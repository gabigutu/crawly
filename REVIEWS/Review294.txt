		<shortDescription>A Fan's Dream Come True</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to the midnight show last night and was completely blown away !! I am 30 years old and had begun reading the Amazing Spider-Man back when I was 11 and leaving the theater last night, I felt like I was a kid again- I was amazed, I was in awe, I really felt... satisfied.Every scene crackled. There was an energy, there was an effort put into every moment of the movie. No scene went on too long, no plot holes fell through. It was the comic, come alive.Sam Raimi and Tobey Maguire did a great job of making Peter Parker sympathetic, you feel for him, you wince with him, he is the boy, becoming a man, and you watch it, and you keep watching it.Even as a long-time fan who knew where some of the story lines were going- with MJ, with Harry Osborne- to see HOW the movie chose to play out these stories, provided great surprises for me, I almost wished I didn't know... I can't wait to see the reactions of my friends who haven't followed the Spider-man comics, the twist of the story and the hints at what is to come...A great movie. Great fun. Great story. Great action. A blockbuster movie. You leave the theater, definitely feeling like you got your money's worth !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Flawless Super Hero Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is what a good summer movie should be.Spider-Man 2 transcends the boundaries of being just another comic book movie to being a richly character driven movie with a very conflicted hero. Here, for the first time, we see the actual emotion behind the facade of the hero behind the mask. Gone is the richly colorful look of the first part, here in Spider-Man 2, we are plunged into a world of shadows and off colors.Picking up two years after the first Spider-Man left off, Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) has his hands full with three full-time jobs. He is going to school full time, he is working full time to pay off his rent, and he is a hero always on call whenever he hears a siren. Not to mention, we see the emotional toll that has been taken on him, his only surviving family member, his Aunt May (Rosemary Harris), has become consumed with grief and loss over the death of her husband (incidentally, creating Spider-Man in the first part), Peter's friend Norman Osborne (James Franco) is now at odds with him since he has become consumed with revenge over Spider-Man killing his father (the Green Goblin), and his love affair with Mary Jane-Watson (Kirsten Dunst) is slowly being extinguished because he is never there for her to return the feelings she has for him. And this is all in the first fifteen minutes of the film.As Spider-Man, Parker is even in danger of losing his powers as his exhaustion slowly begins to take over. Is it medical or is it because he has stretched himself too thin? Eventually, Peter decides to give up being Spider-Man to finally bring peace into his life. There is a brilliant sequence in this film when we see Parker returning to his alter-ego from the first part before the mutated spider bite as he puts on his glasses again, clouding his vision to the world around him. When he sees someone being beaten up in an alley, he turns around to walk away. When the familiar sirens fly past him again, he just eats a hot dog. In short, Parker has finally succumbed to being a New Yorker.In the midst of all of this, we see the creation of a new villain, this time in the form of a deranged scientist named Doctor Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina), who has four frighteningly powerful arms welded to his spine after a disaster with his life's work. This disaster not only turns the Doctor into Dr. Octopus (Doc Ock as the papers call him), but the artificially intelligent arms seemed fuse to his id, placating his desires to not want his life's work to be a failure. Doc Ock will try again at the expense of anyone around him.The standout here is Tobey Maguire, who can convey the film's entire heart with a look or a gesture, but is most heart-wrenchingly done in his hesitations. For a man so used to having quick reflexes, when he has to slow down and realize what is going on around him, we are instantly in his head. Maguire also has to command the screen as Spider-Man and convince the audience that he can stand up to someone like Octavius and not seem fantastic.Sam Raimi also does a knock-out job as well, knowing when to hold on a character's face long enough or swinging the camera along with Spider-Man to give the audience the exhilaration of flight. Raimi is more than competent enough to give this movie the look and feel of a moving comic book and by utilizing his most signature camera shot (zooming into and out of the character's eyes), the audience is invited to live for a moment in the tights of a superhero.Spider-Man 2 has so many great messages to be heard in this film, the best of which seems to draw both Peter and Octavius together in the end: In order for the right thing to be done, does it mean that we have to put away what we want the most? In both cases, there are some strong arguments and that is what makes this movie such a surprise is the depth that it possesses. Seemingly, we have entered the bizarro world of sequels, where they seem to surpass the original (Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, Toy Story 2, etc) and Spider-Man 2 definitely joins these ranks. Perhaps in allowing a series to expand rather than compliment the original, we can expect more depth out of movies, which has been as equally absent in this day and age as heroes as Spider-Man 2 also suggests.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Normally sequels are hugely disappointing in comparison to the original film. So it's hard to believe that they could even come close to topping this movies original, alas they do! Picking up where the first movie starts off and introducing several new comic book regulars, we bypass the history establishing story of the original and head straight into what life is like for Peter Parker being a college student, Spiderman, and trying to hold down a job.This time Spidey must face the likes of Doc Ock, portrayed by Alfred Molina (he's come a long way since Indiana Jones cameos) excellently. Once again they couldn't have picked a better actor to portray the villain Spiderman has to face.Spiderman must take out Doc, save the city, save the girl, and still get good grades.The action sequences once again are entrancing and the story is well written. Kudos once again to the actors involved and Sam Raimi on creating another hit. Looking very much forward to Spiderman 3. Another hit I'm sure if 1 &amp; 2 are any indications.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Takes every element from the first film and improves on it!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It only happens very rarely that a sequel surpasses the original (Terminator 2, Star Wars Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back) and after the relative disappointment that was the original my expectations for the second film in the series had decreased. When I finally did sit down in the cinema to see this film I was a bit anxious. But my anxiety was quickly put to rest because Spider-Man 2 took the premises from the first film and improved upon them all. The first Spider-Man film a well meaning picture but quite as good as it could have been the second film is a good film for both hardcore fans like myself and the broader audience.First off, the acting in the second film has improved tremendously. Tobey Maguire feels more right in the second film. I found him quite shallow in the first film but in the second one he seems to have developed more depth. More nuances have found their way into his acting in the second film making the character more believable and less of a square. Kirsten Dunst is never a good actress but I found her a little less annoying in this film than in the first and therefore I felt I could tolerate her presence. James Franco is decent but still has a problem with portraying nuances which basically means that in order for his performance to work he has exaggerate every emotion his character feels. As it is with most superhero movies the villain is the most interesting character and Sam Raimi couldn't have picked a better actor than Alfred Molina to play Otto Octavius aka Doc Ock. I'm a big fan of Willem Dafoe but I didn't like his performance in the first Spider-Man film very much and therefore I was delighted when Alfred Molina turned out to be a far better villain than Willem was. His performance was both menacing and nuanced and even though the character isn't always directly in control of his actions (making him somewhat misinterpreted) Molina's performance makes the character highly credible and undoubtedly the most interesting character in the film.The effects have improved which is logical considering that it has been 2 years since the first film hit the cinemas. Also I found that Doc Ock was much better suited for flashy moves and cool fights than Green Goblin ever was so in that aspect the film is far superior to the first film as well. Especially the train fight will, I think, go into history as one of the best hero/villain showdowns in history if not the best. The computer effects have become slightly more subtle making the film seem more polished. There were still a few unfortunate scenes were the CGI was pretty obvious but overall the effects have improved dramatically and received a well earned Oscar.The musical score continues in the same epic fashion from the first and Danny Elfman does an exceptional job as usual. The score is both thrilling and epic but it is also subtle when it has to be and that aspect of the score works wonderfully as well. Elfman has some experience in super hero scoring (having done both Batman and Hulk aside from Spider-Man) and it shows as the score is very appropriate and fitting. Two thumbs up on the music.In terms of story telling the second film is also far better than the first. I found the first film to be very unoriginal in terms of its story. Anyone who has just an ounce of knowledge into the myth of Spider-Man knows the story beforehand and thus the film becomes very predictable and boring quite frankly. The second film did not have this problem. It was a breath of fresh air. The story seems to flow more from the heart this time around. Raimi proved in the first film that he could take a situation from the comics and translate it reasonably to the screen. In the second film he proves that he can make a highly original story as well and make it entertaining. It should also be added that Spider-Man 2 has a lot more of the humor like the kind that appears in the comics. J.K. Simmons who was one of the elements in the first film returns in his role and he is absolutely hilarious. He truly embodies the spirit of J. Jonah Jameson. There is also a very funny elevator scene which should be mentioned.Some people complained that Raimi has turned mainstream with the Spider-Man films. That is a load of rubbish and Raimi proves it by adding some elements from his cult films, the Evil Dead series. He even lets Bruce Campbell tell Spider-Man off as if to symbolize that he hasn't forgotten where he came from.All in all Spider-Man 2 surpasses the first film in the franchise in almost every way imaginable Spider-Man 2 is twice as engaging, entertaining and heartfelt than the first film in the series.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well I saw the first and Thought .. OK, nice movie, but nothing special. So I wasn't looking much forward to the second one. Boy was I wrong.. The second one has it all... And I mean all. Suspense, romance, action and some quite nice Effects. Tobey Maguire is performing well, and Kirsten Dunst... wauw.... she is breathtaking...And only 22, so we can only hope to see more of her the coming years. Last but not least, Alfred Molina, who is the bad guy. He is very convincing and very very nasty. The computer-effects used are better than I have ever seen. Now you get the feeling of flying. I recommend all to see this movie, yes girls too. Remember.. movies are best in the cinema!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well worth the wait, what a movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spider-Man 2 picks up where the original film left off, this time showing the more difficult hardships of being a superhero. Standing in the way is Dr. Otto Octavius(Doc Ock) a brilliant scientist whose fusion experiment goes awry at a demonstration Peter attends.The story, and characters are fleshed out more this time out, as well as the effects. Kirsten Dunst is more convincing as MJ, she seemed a little flat in the role last time. Here she, like the rest of the cast, do a convincing job. The top performance has to go to Alfred Molina. In the short screen time Otto has before he becomes a diabolical powerhouse supervillain, he is an endearing, likable person. Spider-Man 2 also offers more confidence in it's story telling. The "raindrops" sequence is an evident example. Not afraid to go full nine, this movie is the definitive comic book movie, possessing action, drama, comedy, and message(without being too preachy). Director Sam Raimi and crew really nailed it this time around. Be sure to check out comic artist Alex Ross' paintings spliced in the opening credits, entailing the events of the first film. A great opening to a great film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WOW.I had low expectations after Spiderman 1. Spider Guy 2 is a blowout, take no prisoners, roller coaster ride of a film. It's got it all: great story line, edge of your seat action, romance, humor, fine acting, break neck pace,?.well, you get the idea.This film is for the whole family. Great chase scenes, crashes, and special effects for the guys. Romance, and a tender love story for the gals. Comic book touches for the kids. It just works so well on every level.McGuire and Dunst have a chemistry that reminded me of Niles and Daphne in "Frasier." They loved each other from afar, and could not communicate their feelings to each other. The romantic tension was exquisite. So it is here with McGuire and Dunst. You know they have to get together at some point, but the long and difficult road is a journey we enjoy.The villain is definitely top shelf. Without revealing too much, suffice it to say that he's bad enough, scary enough, and convincing enough to make the film work on the plot level.The special effects are well done, especially where Spiderman has to save passengers on a speeding train.Spiderman has self doubts, begins to lose his powers, and longs to be Peter Parker instead of a superhero. He struggles with his choices in life, as we all do. He makes difficult choices, and learns that truth and integrity are rewarded, even when the results are very painful for the aunt who has replaced his mother.You might see films with a deeper message, but you won't see many films that combine action, romance, and meaning in one slick package. See this one. In fact, you may want to buy this one for your DVD library.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Maintains the energy of the first one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A cut above the typical comic book movie, S-M 1 did what this type of movie is supposed to do: introduce the main characters, have 'em fight a Super Bad Guy, and then have it all end happily ever after, for the most part. In other words, for the first movie in a supposed franchise, you have to allow time for exposition of the protagonist's background, even if millions already know him from another medium.With S-M 2, though, such an obligation isn't necessary. We've met Spidey, MJ, Aunt May, et al., and we're ready to jump into a new story. So while the first one explains why Spidey is, the second movie devotes more time to fighting the Bad Guy du Jour, Doctor Octopus.Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) still pines for MJ (Kirsten Dunst), from whom he steers clear despite his undying affection for her. It's for her own good, he tells himself. If we're together, my enemies will top at nothing to get at me through her, and I can't put her in that position. And so, in typical superhero fashion, he broods and broods and broods. The relentless push-and-pull between his love for MJ and his devotion to using his powers for good is a constant theme in the Spider-Man universe, and in the movies it either smolders in the background or charges with a raging fury to the forefront. Peter is given the impossible choice - true love or good deeds - and it's a choice to which, at its core, everyday people can relate; we all have exceedingly difficult choices to make throughout our lives.And in this especially, the movies succeed. Peter Parker is supposed to be an average teen - well, except for those powers he has. He's not morally superior. He's not smarter. He's just a poor schlub who accidentally has these super powers, and he doesn't quite know how to deal with them. On a smaller scale, a comparison can be made to a supremely talented collegiate football player who's just made it to the pros. He has otherworldly talents. He has money, fame, fortune. And can he handle it? About as well as Peter can.Anyway, the big villain here is the aforementioned Doc Ock (Alfred Molina), yet another in a long line of Good Scientists Gone Wrong. You may recall that the Green Goblin from the first S-M movie was also of this line. This Doc has found a way to manipulate metallic tentacles with his mind. (It helps that the tentacles are physically attached to him.) Something goes wrong, he goes mad, and next thing you know it, he's gonna take over the world. Give these boys a Happy Meal, and they'd still want two prizes.Along with the inevitable Spidey-Doc Ock battles, Peter Parker's best friend Harry (James Franco) is still quite resentful as Spidey's killing of his father in the first movie. He doesn't know Peter is Spider-Man, but he knows only Peter is able to take photographs of him. So the second thematic struggle is within Harry - does he resent his friend for knowing the murderer (in his eyes) of his father? All of the cast returns from the first movie (well, all that survived the first movie), and they all do a collective good job. Maguire is a perfect choice for the lead; he's unassuming, can't really emote, is stoic, and even a little bit wimpy. All are qualities that plague the characters of both Spider-Man and Peter Parker.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A damn near perfect summer blockbuster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two years on from defeating the Green Goblin, Peter Parker is having a harder time meeting the ongoing expectations of the public. On top of this the double life is taking its strain on his job, his personal life and his ability to even cast webs. Parker decides enough is enough and throws it all in ? after all, he is only one man. Meanwhile, A brilliant scientist, Dr Octavius sees his life's work on a fusion reactor explode ? killing his wife. Wife the protective device on his computerised arms broken, Dr Octavius loses his grip on sanity and starts to rebuild his reactor using money and materials from crime. With him seemingly intent on destruction, Parker must decide if the needs of others outweigh his own.With many blockbusters falling at the opening weekend this summer, the title of 'summer's best' was still up for grabs when I arrived at the cinema to watch Spiderman 2 (having only the week earlier given it the miss in favour of lighter fare). Two hours later I emerged having enjoyed one of the most entertaining popcorn films I'll probably see all year. The plot is more than able to fill the running time and, although the action scenes often have large gaps between them, there are no moments where I was bored ? even if there are a few moments where the film slightly slows. The complexity of the hero is the main thing ? he is an unwilling hero and the strain shows well on him. Even the potentially ponderous thread with Mary-Jane plays pretty well for the most part.The villain of the piece is similar to the Green Goblin of the first film in that he is a scientist driven to madness by 'voices' who we want to lose as well as feeling for ? more tragic than evil. Where Dafoe was great as the Goblin, the silly costume hindered the actor, here Molina has no such obstacle and does very well ? carrying off the 'voices' scene without it looking silly ? it is only a shame that he has so little screen time as a person (he has little time anyway ? but the vast majority of it is throwing cars around). With these complex people as the fronts it is any wonder that the script has no problem being surprisingly strong for a summer action movie. You could read meaning into most of it but it is hard to not see the New York people on the train carrying the prone body of Spiderman backwards as having a bigger significance ? a surprisingly poignant movie after a big effects-driven scene. The script also throws in a real mix of emotions ? perfect for a film that is more about being an exciting ride than a piece of art. Plenty of it is very funny, some of it is touching, some of it is about character and some of it, well, some of it is about cars being thrown through windows! And of course the latter is what we have come for.In terms of action, the several big action sequences are very enjoyable and put the skirmishes from the first movie very much in the shade. Part of this is down to the increased intensity of the fights due to the close combat nature of the character but it is hard not to be impressed by the impact of the vastly improved effects. In the first movie I struggled occasionally to get past the fact that some of it (not all but some) looked very much like an average playstation game. Here the effects are great; sure, you can still tell when a mid-shot of a character is real or CGI but they are much more convincing and they are used a lot better ? making it easier to accept them as real for the purposes of the film. Of course what really makes the action sequences is Raimi's great direction. He is very able in the smaller moments but he is fantastic in the massive action scenes that he pulls together. At times his direction is very clever and my favourite 'reference' scene is also the one that surprised me that it was rated PG. In a very clear reference to Evil Dead, doctors are hammered by Dr Octopus' arms for the first time ? dragged screaming (ED's trees) and tackling it with bone saws (Ash's chain saw). It was a very intense scene and, with it being in a PG, it acts as proof that the BBFC are not as strict as the moaners would have us believe.Working with this direction, the cast all do really well. Maguire takes the pratfalls, the moral questions, the romance and the action equally as well. He is very much the likable everyman that the film needs Spiderman to be and he is good throughout. Dunst has talked about her desire to do more than just this type of film and, from this, I can see why. Although she has some good scenes, generally she is sidelined and it is to her credit that she does as well as she does with comparatively little to work with. Molina is given too little time and lacks a really strong scene of emotion in the same way that Dafoe did in front of the mirror but he still does well. I didn't feel his pain as much as I really should have done but that was more down to his low screen time rather than his performance. Franco is good but a bit too one-dimensional; given that the third film will be very dependent on him I'm hoping he can step up to the plate more than he did here. Of the support cast, once again it is a wonderfully OTT Simmons who steals every scene he is in ? he is so good that I never once saw him as his Oz character ? an association I never thought he'd be able to break but he did ? and he did it hilariously. Cameos from Campbell, Raimi and Dafoe are all enjoyable and add to their scenes.Overall this is not a perfect film and I am bemused by its appearance in the top 250 list here but it does basically everything it sets out to do and does it in a manner that puts this years' other blockbusters in the shade. The script is clever, interesting and involving; the characters are complex and pretty well drawn while the film delivers laughs as frequently as it does action. With improved effects and some very impressive action scenes this is definitely the movie to sue in a summer full of misses and average thrills.</fullReview>

Every member of the cast is superb in their big or small roles, Sam Raimi the director seems very sure of the script and his directing and makes every scene worth watching. Add to that a good story, fabulous, marvelous special effects and visual sequences, an outstanding, fully suitable score, sound effects beyond your wildest dreams, a red-blue spidey Spandex outfit, a chubby guy in a brown coat with four mecha-arms...well how can you not like it???

		<fullReview>He's back but with a bigger problem now. His powers are temporarily lost for a while but when his girl-friend is kidnapped right before his very eyes he knew that he was in for a big battle with the man he had favored before he turned evil inside and out. The film was great it was just like the first film except that right at the ending Mary Jane finally saw Peter as Spider-man right before her very eyes. Now that Peter had "lost" his spider powers he thought things would run smoothly for him and his life style. But all of that changed when his girl-friend was kidnapped by the guy he used to look up to Doctor Octavius better known as Doc Ock by the newspaper Peter worked at. I was a bit scared of the new villain in town who was after Spider-man and his machine that fused together the tentacles on his back spine and messed with his mind to the point that he nearly killed Peter who revealed himself to Doc Ock when he sacrificed himself to save everyone in the city including Peter and Mary Jane but had unfortunately died of drowning to death. But overall great film and a good influence to many young children and adults of all ages.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spider-Man 2 is an adrenaline-packed cinematic delight. A purely functioning superhero film, serving as a sequel to a film that was surprisingly capable after spending a fourth of a century in development hell. Not only is this one of the best sequels I have yet to see, but one of the strongest superhero epics of the decade.What little Raimi and the writers neglected in the original Spider-Man film is injected into this sequel with full-force intelligence, depth, and attitude. Certain action scenes are so artfully designed and professionally crafted, it appears they could serve as the long-awaited climax in any film of the genre. Scenes themselves play like epics within an epic and some, like the infamous train sequence, are so breakneck and excessive they could use an intermission.But Spider-Man 2 doesn't have time for preposterous breaks or intermissions. They would disrupt the flow of poetry the film so effortlessly excels at, and for that matter, it is too busy furthering Peter Parker's entertaining story and fueling its action scenes with the coherency and structure they need. The film takes place two years after the events of the first film. We see Parker is still doing vigilante justice around the city of New York, yet we see he is breathlessly struggling to juggle his alter-ego's duties, his schoolwork, his freelance photography job, and his own free time. Because of this, he has long been distant from the love of his life, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) and his best friend Harry Osborn (James Franco).Now that Harry is the leader of Oscorp, he has been funding research for the nuclear scientist, Dr. Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina). Octavius's goal is to perfect fusion power, and he creates and operates a harness equipped with several long, windy robotic arms that seem to take on a mind of their own. Unfortunately, due to a series of disasters, the arms are now sewn to his spinal-cord and have corrupted his mind and are now influencing his decisions and actions. Dr. Octavius, who will later be known as "Doc Ock," serves as the main villain in the story, as one can expect.Parker not only must try and defeat Doc Ock, but must figure out how to get his spidey-legs working again after numerous web malfunctions, and has just learned that Mary Jane is engaged to an acclaimed astronaut. And don't even get him started about how he must continue to comfort his Aunt May, who is still grieving over the loss of her husband and Peter's uncle, as well as telling her the real truth about his death.Speaking as a sizable fan of the original Spider-Man, the one part I mentioned in my review was that Raimi showed Parker's newly-discovered powers to be all fun and games with no consequences or brewing agony. It was a chockablock of excitement for him, and never once did the story showcase how these powers would've inevitably burdened Parker with a barrage of responsibility and tribulations. It almost seems Raimi and the writers left that part out on purpose, so they could center the sequel primarily around the agony of being a superhero. If that was their plan, their have succeeded, because not only is this one of the most riveting and entertaining superhero films, it is also one of the deepest.Tobey Maguire, returning as Parker, bleeds charm and confidence in the role of a character that just has the charm part down. With the new Amazing Spider-Man film just released about two weeks ago, boasting the relatively new star Andrew Garfield in the central role, I can't help but remind readers who I believe is the real Peter Parker. Maguire's Parker has mastered the role of a shy nerd who lacks any and all confidence. Garfield's character was still in that nerd-position, but he was far more secure in his witticisms and his confidence. To me, Peter Parker is and always will be a nerd. Regardless of how tight and brazen his costume is.When it came down to the villain of the original Spider-Man, unlike many people, I was satisfied that it was the Green Goblin. If anything, Willem Dafoe portrayed the character in a lot more of an eerie light than I assume many others actors would've. Doc Ock is a more impressive villain in every sense. Quite possibly one of the most enticing to watch on screen. The Goblin, no matter which way you examine him, is a rather stock villain. Ock's robotic arms make for a never-ending line of possibilities and events, and the action sequences involving him are stylish and crafty, perfectly complimenting the film itself as a whole.Spider-Man 2 is a shivering example at what makes a great superhero film. It shows us what most of us want, which is explicitly entertaining action scenes, and the something extra I hope most of us crave, which is the humanity and exploration of the character. To show Parker's powers as a burden to him was a brilliant move on screenwriter Alvin Sargent's part (who would later go on to write the third part of this franchise and be one of the three to construct the new one) and Sam Raimi's. With a brain in its head and style on its side, this is one hell of a ride.Starring: Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, James Franco, Alfred Molina, Rosemary Harris, and Donna Murphy.

		<fullReview>Well I just need to know one thing - who thought it would be a good idea to have a seventy seven year old grandmother hanging from Doc Ock's tentacle as he clambered up a city skyscraper? Seriously, didn't anyone consider that she might have had a HEART ATTACK?!?! Come on, and then she hung from a ledge using a wooden cane? I'd like to know where in the realm of remote possibility this could happen. As the Marvel geek opined, 'Nuff said'.Don't get me too wrong. I enjoyed the flick well enough, but these implausible things cross my mind when I watch a film, even if it's a comic book story. Say now, was Doc Ock (Alfred Molina) incredibly cool as a villain, or just incredibly lame? It could go both ways you know. I guess the Octopus connection works because he had his own four limbs and then the mechanical jobbers. On the plus side, the CGI necessary to pull off his character with all that wall climbing and demolition was pretty extraordinary. But cheesy too, I think he was kind of goofy as a Spidey villain.Some other things bothered me too. Like the garbage man turning in the Spider-Man uniform he found in an alley and J.Jonah Jameson (J.K. Simmons, hey, they both have the same first name) going front page with it. Couldn't that have been a replica uniform or a kid's Halloween costume? Why get all excited about that? But it did serve it's purpose for that great tongue in cheek 'He's Back' headline in the Daily Bugle with Spidey bursting through it for his comeback. That was pretty cool.Not cool was using 'Raindrops Keep Fallin' On My Head' when Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) has one of his many moments of angst in the picture. That belongs solely in "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid". The comic books got by for a long time with the characterization of Peter/Spider-Man as a conflicted young teenager trying to find himself, but those days are pretty much over. Then again, I was just becoming a teenager when Stan Lee created Spidey, so maybe I'm too old to appreciate teenage angst anymore. If I'm wrong I apologize.Hey, I did get a kick out of Peter asking Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) about his comic book collection. Mine is part of that same old story - Grandma threw all of mine away when I went away to college. There was a Justice League #1 and a Green Lantern #5 in there, maybe a little beat up but it came as a blow to the system. But after almost forty years I'm just about over it.Anyway, I don't mean to be too harsh on the picture, just trying to have a little fun with my review. Glad to see Stan Lee show up again, this time saving someone from falling concrete when Doc Ock and Spidey have at it twenty stories above. When Spider-Man finally defeats his foe, I thought it somewhat humorous that he used a bit of that Sixties Star Trek logic to drive some sense into Octavius. You'd need to see Captain Kirk in action to understand that one.So I guess the wedding's off, right?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being Spider-Man is wrecking poor Peter Parker's life. He's had to give up his chance at love with Mary Jane, he can't hold a job because he's always late, his grades are suffering at college, his Aunt May is struggling with the loss of beloved Uncle Ben, and his best friend Harry blames Spider-Man for the death of his father. All of this leads to Peter deciding to give up being a superhero. But a new threat rises in the form of mad physicist Otto Octavius, dubbed Dr. Octopus by the press, that may force Peter out of retirement.Sam Raimi's direction is much improved from the first film. This one he seems completely at home with the big budget blockbuster and creates many memorable scenes and images, as he often does in his lower budget work. Comic fans should appreciate the homages to the works of Lee, Ditko, and Romita, The CGI improves from the first film. There's still a little bit of the rubbery animated look of the CGI humans but not as distracting as before. The action is also more impressive. The fight scenes between Spider-Man and Dr. Octopus are well-done. The scene where Spidey saves an elevated train is arguably the movie's highlight. Danny Elfman's music is good but, as with the first film, not in the same league as his iconic Batman work.The cast knocks it out of the park. Tobey Maguire perfectly captures the essence of Peter Parker, even more so than the first movie. His inherent nerdiness, awkwardness, and struggle to do what's right even at the cost of his own happiness. Kirsten Dunst and James Franco build upon their performances from the last movie. Dunst rises above the damsel-in-distress role she's saddled with quite nicely and by the end finally feels like the iconic Mary Jane ("Go get 'em, Tiger."). Rosemary Harris gets far more to do as Aunt May this time around and she's amazing. She steals every scene she's in. The supporting cast (J.K. Simmons and the rest) are all great. Alfred Molina brings Dr. Octopus to life and treats the character seriously, which is miles above the hammy performance given by Willem Dafoe's Green Goblin in the first film.When this came out, it was the best superhero movie since Superman '78. I walked out of the theater beaming from ear to ear and feeling like a kid again. It was one of the rare summer blockbusters I went to see more than once. It still holds up and is a high water-mark for Marvel movies, in my opinion. It's followed by a terrible third film and then a reboot series that, while good, misses a lot of what makes this film work so well. This is the definitive Spider-Man movie. Lots of humor, heart, romance, and action all told in a bright, colorful fashion. Everything a Spider-Man film should be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nearly Flawless Super-Hero Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite #1 being a very good movie, 'Spider-Man 2' falls under the "Surprisingly Better" sequels. Now, that's not to say, #2 didn't have its problems. It did, including one lingering from #1 (pacing,) but overall, they moved forward with the series. And in high-speed.Already established web-slinger, do-gooder, Spider-Man continues his plight in saving kids and punishing criminals all the while getting beaten up (emotionally) as Peter Parker. In fact, they show more than enough of his beat-downs. We get it already ? he's a nerd that everyone takes advantage of.At any rate, he's still pursuing both MJ (Dunst,) who's now engaged to a more "stable" astronaut and Dr. Otto Octavius all the while, he's avoiding best friend (of Pete)/mortal enemy (of Spidey) Harry (Franco.) To make matters worse, his mother's losing her home, Pete's losing his apartment, Doc Ock's becoming an eight-limbed crazed scientist and he's getting Spidey-blocked, or unable to use his powers as his mind's overloaded.There's actually a lot more, but that's for the viewer to see. Don't want to give away everything. Suffice to say, Pete's got a lot on his mind. Thankfully, they've up'd the villain-scale with Dr. Octopus played brilliantly by (unknown to me at the time) Alfred Molina. He ranks as one of the best on-screen villains of all time. His quiet tone, brilliant mind and attitude and mannerisms, especially being attached to 4 additional limbs, made him quite believable despite his appearance. Side Note: Doc Ock was always my favorite Spider-Man villain, and since they did a great job, this is my favorite Spider-Man movie, by a long shot.Hopefully most people picked up on the operation scene, when they tried to rid Dr. Octavius of his metal contraptions and how it was an absolute perfect homage to Raimi's previous work. That was so 'Evil Dead' that, though it was hard to watch, especially the nail scrape, I was so impressed that he came back to his roots vs. the main-stream 'Spider-Man' had become. If you don't believe me, split screen the chainsaw with 'Evil Dead 2' and 'Army of Darkness.' There are a lot of excellent action sequences, tension and fun to be had in 'Spider-Man 2.' (The train scene, itself, is worth admission.) Nevertheless, the movie should've been cut back some ? pacing is such a problem for Raimi and enough already with on again/off again relationship with MJ &amp; Parker.In addition, we get the multiple "Should I be a 'superhero' or not" long scenes. Superman did that, but only briefly in another superhero part 2: 'Superman II.' That's old and wears heavily. Thankfully, they move past it and you can enjoy the movie. Of course, if you can get past now multiple people knowing Spidey's true identity, that is.I cringe that the movie critic I respect the most (Roger Ebert,) called this the best superhero movie he's ever seen. I wouldn't go that far (I'll always be partial to 'Superman: The Movie.' Heck, a few years later 'The Dark Knight' blew this one away) but I would say it's absolutely recommended. Especially since we didn't have to wait too long to see Spider-Man swing, unlike part one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My presumptions of a sequel to a successful original are that they are worn out and are a desperate attempt to cash in on it's predecessor. Look no further for conclusive evidence with the terrible Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen to know what I'm talking about.But every now and again a sequel comes along that just simply changes your perceptions and gives you faith in a continuing franchise where the sequel is just as or in the case of Spiderman 2 better than it's predecessor.Toby Maquire, Kirsten Dunst and James Franco return with director Sam Raimi who has done a terrific job in making this for me one of the best sequels of all time.One of the successes Spiderman 2 has is the depth of the characters and stories as there is more than one strand. Toby Maquire has the same natural ability which he possessed in the first film to accurately convey the character of Peter Parker who struggles with his feelings for Mary Jane who becomes frustrated that he can't return her feelings for him, to his fractured friendship with Harry Osborne who harbours a deep grudge against Spiderman to trying to balance his life as superhero, student and employee and struggling with his Aunt May over Uncle Ben's death to finally battling the new villain Oto Octavious played memorably by Alfred Molina and all these story strands thread there way through two hours of pure entertainment.With the main story and these sub-stories the film could have become confusing and meaningless but thanks to the sublime artistry from Sam Raimi, it flows beautifully and never loses sight of itself.Which goes to say the acting is as brilliant from the main cast which helps the film has more exploration and depth and the special effects this time round are flawless and much improved on the first.This has everything for the comic fans and those who just want to be entertained of action (which there is plenty of particularly towards the end) drama, romance and humour mostly from JK Simmons who when he was on screen I was laughing out loud.Credit goes to all involved and I very much look forward to Spiderman 3.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly Outdoes the First</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow. That's all I can manage to say after watching this film, wow. This movie really blew me away in all its aspects. The performances were top rate, especially Alfred Molina's portrayal of Dr. Otto Octavius. He really knows how to play that comic book villain with a sense of understanding so to speak. Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst romance is a truly interesting and different outlook on being a super hero. We often dream of being super heroes, and yet here we see just the opposite. The audience feels Peter's conflict between protecting the innocent and letting his own life suffer or letting it go and living the life he's always wanted. To get everything he ever desired, he must give up his double-life. Despite whether he gives up being Spider-man or not, he will still forever have to deal with the complication of his dying friendship with Harry Osborn( James Franco). Franco is my favorite actor in this film, a young millionaire dealing with the death of his father, his friend being the only one who can help him bring the murder to justice. And yet, unbeknownst to him, his friend is actually the wall crawler himself. A extremely well done screenplay. Sam Raimi adds touches of humor to the story and it blends in quite well.The characters are just so well done and intertwined with one another. Sam Raimi makes more than just a comic blockbuster but a well-defined drama of sorts. Even the villain has his moments.The action is unbelievable and truly out does the first. Future superhero films will have to work hard to surpass what is seen here. The train chase is by far my favorite scene in the film, truly adrenaline pumping!! Audiences do have to wait a bit, but once a fight starts prepare to be simply amazed. Not only this, but the score is magnificent!! I love Danny Elfman!! It captures each moment exactly the way audiences envision it. Another sequel is surely on the way. This is definitely one of my favorite films of 2004, putting other comic book films of the same year to shame, such as "Blade: Trinity".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first and third 'Spider-Man' movies were simply fantastic.But it gets even better with 'Spider-Man 2'. It's full of action, has plenty of adventure, and is full of award winning special effects.Like any other super hero sequel, there's always a new villain.The villains name in 'Spider-Man 2' is Dr. Octopus.AKA Doc Ock.He has 4 mechanical tentacles that can flip cars and throw people at great distances.Does he remind you of anything? Of course he does.What does he remind you of? An Octopus... Duh.It may sound kind of stupid, but Doc Ock's character actually helps the movie become a 2 hour roller-coaster ride of a movie.Just remember that Spider-Man can do whatever a spider can.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have just watched Spiderman 2 again to bring in me an impression about the movie. What a movie ! Great villain , great hero ,great action sequence and a very emotional and heart touching story . It is a huge improvement over the first movie . Alfred Molina has done a great job as Doc Ock . We actually feel the grip of his four tentacles .The action scenes are great. The best ,of course , is the train scene . The action sequences have great special effects which makes it so great. And the best swinging scene is the final swing ,where after Peter gets back MJ , he swings to save the city.This is actually a real comic book movie with action , emotion , romance and a really appealing story. Hats off !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best one out of the trilogy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sequels are very tricky. They're very hard to crack open, but every so often we do get a sequel that is better than the original like Empire Strikes Back, The Godfather Part II, Terminator 2: Judgment Day, Aliens, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, The Dark Knight, and others. Spider-Man 2 is one of them. The common thing among mostly all sequels is that bigger is better, that's not always the case, and that's where director Sam Raimi comes in, he does the opposite. He makes it smaller, more personal, but with big impactful moments. Here we see a damaged Peter Parker, still full of guilt with the death of Uncle Ben, he's getting fired all the time and late to school because he's busy protecting New York as Spider-Man. His relationship between Harry and Mary Jane are deteriorating as he keeps disappointing them. In the end, he gives up his duties as Spider-Man, only to return to action when Doctor Octopus is threatening the city. This movie in many ways is a coming of age story for Peter Parker. With a moving romantic subplot, Peter learns to accept his responsibilities as Spider-Man in the long run, and puts that first above all his desires including Mary Jane, and he also finds closure by telling Aunt May the truth about what happened on the night of Uncle Ben's murder. Tobey Maguire brings much depth and complexity to Peter Parker. A very fine performance by him showcasing the right amount of emotion in every single scene. Alfred Molina is excellent here as Dr. Otto Octavius, also known as Doctor Octopus, whom Peter deems as his idol in the beginning of the film. What makes him such as awesome and likable villain, is that film allows you to like him from the beginning, and to see his downfall to villainy, then to a redeemable hero at the end makes an engaging story. Give credit to Raimi and his writing team, as they provide Doc Ock much needed flare. Kirsten Dunst here is pretty good as Mary Jane. Peter and Mary Jane also get a lot time bickering at each other here. It's a very complicated and complex romance as she wants Peter and Peter wants her, but he can't cause of his duties as a crime-fighter. James Franco is great playing the a-hole friend. As an audience member it's very sad to see their friendship deteriorate as Harry questions Peter's loyalty to him or to Spider-Man. The action serves the story here, it seamlessly transitions to action set pieces while still serving the narrative. Not to mention they are awesome. All the fights between Spidey and Doc Ock are an adrenaline rush, particularly the subway train fight. But with that being said, if you took out all the action sequences in this movie, you still have a very intriguing and moving story to watch. That's how good this film is. Raimi and his crew of filmmakers did a tremendous job with Spider-Man 2. There are real human moments in this film, one of them involves Spidey and a group of civilians in the train. A real nice, tender, and human scene. Rosemary Harris as Aunt May even has a substantial role in the film as Peter's moral compass and she also has an action sequence in the middle of the film. J.K. Simmons is even better as J. Jonah Jameson this time around and has the film's funniest moments. Everything in this film clicks on all cylinders. The music by Danny Elfman is better than ever, and also provides the film with lots of tender scores. The visual effects are better, Spidey's web-swinging abilities are better, the romance is better, the action is better, the sound mixing and editing is better, the story, the acting, just everything. It's pretty much a perfect film. I for one thought it deserved just a little bit more from the Academy Awards other than winning the well deserved special effects award. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reached a level todays comic book movies can only dream of reaching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have just sat down and re-watched part of my childhood nostalgia, Spider Man 2... I have to be honest here, I loved this movie. It showed Peter Parker all throughout this movie struggling to maintain the responsibilities of being a superhero with trying to lead a normal life while still keeping it entertaining throughout this entire movie.The plot is that Peter Parker can't maintain jobs, promises and the basic struggles of everyday life because of his identity as a superhero. His University lecturer Dr Curt Connors wants him to finish a report on Dr Otto Octavius - a brilliant scientist. He is doing an experiment for Oscorp and Harry Osbourne can get Peter to meet Octavius. He tells Peter about the experiment that he is doing and finally does it. That night his wife dies, Oscorp is driven into the ground and we have a mad scientist on the loose with 4 mechanical arms. While this is happening Peter loses his power as Spider Man and has a normal life... but there is still a part of him that misses being Spider Man.Now I liked this sequel as you may imagine and some call it one of the best sequels to a superhero movie ever made and to be honest... It is clear where they're coming from. Peter trying to balance his life out happens in every scene and it is done extremely well. I just love how the scenes with him wanting to b Spider Man again are played because this could have been done horribly rushed but it is evenly paced out.The acting is pretty good, I thought Tobey Maguire is a good Spider Man, Alfred Molina does a good Dock Ock and James Franco does a good Harry Osbourne. The highlight however is JK Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson, I love his performance. Most of the lines he says and the delivery alone is worth this entire movie's run time he is just that good.So the story is handled brilliantly, the acting is good, the action holds up even to this day, the humour is funny (despite it being a little goofy in places) and it is definitely a superhero movie worth watching. It is much more worth the watch than any of the superhero movies made within the past 5 years and definitely one of the best superhero sequels of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my Favorite Movies!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am gonna get this out of the way. I fricking love this movie! To me, this is the definitive light-hearted superhero movie. It works both as a summer blockbuster and as a sincere, human drama. But why is it so good? Let's take a look and find out!Firstly, the story. While the first Spider-Man was a simple story about a young man who gets super powers and learning to be responsible with them, this film is a lot more complex than that. In this film, Peter is dealing with the struggles of being Spider-Man and having a normal life. Ultimately, his life becomes miserable for him. He can't get a steady job, he's failing his class, he can't pay his rent, and most importantly, he can't get into a relationship with Mary Jane. So he quits being Spider-Man and things start going better for him. He's getting good grades in his class and he can pursue a relationship with Mary Jane. But whenever he sees a crime in progress, he feels really guilty that he can't do anything about it and has to turn the other cheek. Eventually, he becomes Spider-Man again and saves the day and as reward, he gets a chance to be with Mary Jane.What's great about this is that it all feels very human and relatable. We've all been in positions where we want to do something good but isn't getting much out of it. Peter in this film ultimately learns to become Spider-Man again but not because of guilt like in the first film, but because of the responsibility Uncle Ben taught him. It's all very real and human.The villain here is Doc Ock. When this movie first came out, critics raved about how human and sympathetic his character was and I agree completely. He isn't some kind of generic super villain who wants revenge on Spidey or some stupid sh!t like that. He's just a man who lost his wife so the only thing he has to live for is his science experiment. Of course, along the way he does some pretty horrible stuff for this experiment but at the end of the film when Peter tells him what he said to him about intelligence and how it's a gift to be used for the good of mankind. He also tells him how sometimes we have to be steady and give up the thing we want the most. So Doc Ock decides to sacrifice himself at the end to save the city from his experiment. The key theme of this movie is sacrifice and it's expressed beautifully with both the hero and the villain.So there's some really excellent character stuff in this movie but what else is great about it? I think the tone of this movie is perfect. This movie deals with a lot of heavy themes like responsibility, sacrifice, heroism, etc but the tone of this movie never feels too depressing or brooding. It was a huge problem I had with Man of Steel but here, the tone is rather light-hearted and humorous. There's a lot of clever humor in this film that makes the film a really good summer movie experience. I also love the way they made Peter in the beginning of the film. They make him so ridiculously miserable, it's hilarious! It makes the audience sympathize with him well because of how funny it gets. If it was done in a really sappy, tragic way then it would look melodramatic but thankfully, Raimi chose to play it as much for laughs as it is for drama. So you can laugh but still sympathize with Peter in this film.The action scenes in this movie are pretty great too. The one that everyone raves over is the train fight and I agree. The fight choreography here is really quite creative and they take advantage well of all the things Spidey and Ock could do. Overall, Spider-Man 2 is simply one of the best superhero movies out there. It's sincere, it's human, it's funny, it's exciting, and it's surprisingly complex so I am gonna give it a 10/10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Avenge me......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Peter Parker cannot seem to catch any kind of break. Being Spider-Man has brought him nothing but problems as far as his personal life is concerned.Mary Jane Watson is engaged to astronaut John Jameson, and Peter may lose her forever. Things are so bad for him that he is pushed past his breaking point, so he decides that he doesn't want to be Spider-Man anymore, until a freak accident transforms Dr. Otto Octavius into Dr. Octopus, a super-villain with four metal tentacles protruding from his torso.Peter realises that only Spider-Man can stop him but, of course, problems arise.Mary Jane gets caught in the middle, and Harry Osborn, who still blames the web-slinger for the death of his father Norman Osborn, also the Green Goblin, wants him dead.Spider-Man will have to push himself past his limits if he's going to survive....Easily the best of the franchise, Spider-Man 2 also raises the benchmark in Marvel movies, this being the character driven and empathetic. What make it work is the way Raimi harnesses all of the characters stories, and how he doesn't let them spiral out of control, is amazing.There is so much going on in this film, that it demands to be seen at least two times. Once as the blockbuster action-fest you want, and the other as a character study.It's a lot of fun too. From Raimis trademark POV use of camera-work when Octaviuse first kills, to the obligatory Campbell Cameo, the film works on many levels.Maguire is much better this time around, having less of the rabbit in the headlight face, and just getting on with it.But Franco is really the main draw out of the regular cast. His dark side emanates evil whenever something goes wrong, and you can see that he will be a foe who causes great difficulty to Parker.It's one of the best sequels to a summer movie, and it's a great film to boot also.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Peter Parker is no longer a high school student. He's in University having to deal with tests, work, personal life, rent, romance life, aunt, best friend...Oh...And saving the day as your friendly neighbourhood Spiderman. This is exciting and more engrossing than the first or the third, here you see the trouble Peter goes through trying to deal with the pains that come with being a superhero. Tobey Maguire does a fantastic job as Peter Parker, while Kirsten is equally great as the woman who yearns to be loved by him; the supporting cast provide equally stunning performance, but I felt Alfred Molina could have been more vicious..But, you see that Dr.Octopus as the human-being and it works, rather than seeing only the monster...I felt the fight scene on the train was beautifully directed, and definitely silenced me when I thought about the fight scenes in number one. The cinematography returns bringing with it, Spiderman's colourful world.Definitely the best of the trilogy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not a spider man fan, but I started to become one after the first movie appear. The second has some things that were missing in the first, like the appreciation for spider man's work. If I was a super hero I would like to have some consideration for putting wrong things right, so I think the worst spider man enemy is the press. This is just a movie, but in real life the press has also the power to turn a good man in "the bad guy". The other thing that I loved in the movie was the combination of the psychological with the physical aspects, where the first ones overcome the second, like regular people. The mind will always defeat the body and super heroes are no exception. The end couldn't be better, super hero or not, he has also his needs that can't be ignored. People say that behind a good man there's always a great woman, spider man has Kirsten Dunst, sorry, Mary Jane. That's all folks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spider-man some more... please!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After being very impressed with the first one after some skepticism, Spider-man 2 is tackling a sequel with great anticipation and even greater expectations. The way Sam Raimi was able to produce the story of Spider-man with such style, realism and above all, faithfulness to the Marvel original comic is tremendous to say the least. The reason why it took this long to make a live action movie for Spider-man is due to the difficulties in making the action sequences look real and being able to connect all the side stories and characters in a single effort. Although it doesn't look flawless, it is still able to fool the eyes. The characters are also faithfully represented.Spider-man 2 is a great sequel for many reasons. First it ties right into the original without skipping a beat. Set a few years after the original with all the same actors and characters. Though it differentiates itself enough from the original so you're not watching a clone of the first. It dives deeper into the psyche and the experiences of its main character in order for you to gain a greater understanding of his situation. At the same time it still provide great visuals, pulse pounding action sequences, humorous side sequences and breath taking special effects and camera work. This movies stands head and shoulders above all super hero comic movies. It delivers what a movie goer seeks and leaves them gasping for more. Immediately after viewing, I was pondering what they will do with the next installment and i am sure that the majority of the viewers were thinking the same thing. The movie is strung together in a great sequence that never ever bores the viewer. The new villain gets a good intro which explains his situation in a neat and tidy manor. Doctor Otto Octavius is a perfect villain which is played and visually represented to perfection. The movements of Doc Ock are fantastic. It's just as i would have pictured it in my mind, if i could... while watching the cartoons or reading the comics. Only Raimi presents it in a way that connects the loose visuals in our minds with the visual reality (of course with the aid of computers). Some may complain about there being too much story, too much Peter Parker and not enough action. One must realize that if it were the other way around, that you'd be complaining that there wasn't enough storyline. People are so hard to please. Even with this seemingly flawless movie people still find something to complain about. The only thing i didn't understand was the presence of Ursala, the daughter of Peter's landlord. What was her role in all of this? Anyways, i just bought the DVD for this and realized that i should voice my opinion especially seeing how low of a score this movie got in contrast with what i would score it.Action:10 Directing:10 Acting:10 Re-watchability(if thats even a word):10Overall rating: 10 out of 10... bravo!Bring on part 3 whoever the villain might be. Venom, Lizard, Gobblin, Scorpion, whatever. Heck bring on the sinister 6!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best of the original trilogy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't care what anybody says, but this movie is one of the best superhero movies of all time as far as I'm concerned. Since the new reboot of Spider-Man came out, a lot of fans of that new film are boasting about how it's way better than this movie and the other two, how Andrew Garfield was way better and that we should all forget about Sam Raimi's Spider-Man films. They even go so far as saying all three are as bad as "Batman and Robin". I find that completely ridiculous. Me personally, I don't have anything against "The Amazing Spider-Man". I really liked it since it was nice to see a new version of Spider-Man come onto the big screen. However, it's difficult for me to erase the memories I have of going to see Sami Raimi's Spider-Man movies. I loved the first film, and was excited for the 2nd film. I still remember getting pumped every time I saw the ads for the movie on TV, and I marked everyday off my calendar up to the day it came out. I was so excited to see Doc Ock, and it didn't let me down. It was amazing! Plot: 2 years after the events of the first film, Peter Parker's life is a mess due to his commitment to being Spider-Man; he's failing his classes in school, he's messing up in his job and he barely talks to Mary Jane and Harry these days since Spider-Man takes up most of his time. Peter and Harry haven't talked much since Harry believes Spider-Man killed his father, Norman Osborn, and Mary Jane begins dating another man. Plus his Aunt May is facing foreclosure since Uncle Ben died, and Peter is emotionally shattered over not telling her the truth of how Uncle Ben really died. Peter becomes so overwhelmed with the unrelenting stress of living two lives that he gives up being Spider-Man. Things seem to go better for him, until Doc Ock comes onto the scene. Dr. Otto Octavius is injured during a lab demonstration on fusion energy, fusing four mechanical arms into his spine, and becomes Doctor Octopus (Doc Ock). Peter is then forced to become Spider-Man again to stop Octavius' rampage. I really think the story is excellent because it shows Peter struggling with everyday problems, and how he feels that being Spider-Man has brought him nothing but one problem after another. That feeling we have at some point in our lives where we just give up on life after having so many problems is very human, and I love how Sam Raimi was able to show that Spider-Man is also a human being with common everyday problems. As far as accuracy to the original comics, which fans of the reboot claim that this movie is not faithful to the comics at all, the plot in this story was mostly influenced by "Amazing Spider-Man #50", also known as "Spider-Man No More", where Peter gives up being Spider-Man, but finds himself unable to let it go. Sure there are some differences to this version: Mary Jane is the main love interest, Doc Ock is the main villain in the movie whereas the Kingpin was the main enemy in "Spider- Man No More!" But honestly, I don't care how accurate the movies are to the comics, because at least in my eyes, this movie captured the core of Spider-Man and that's what a superhero movie should be about.People can say what they want about Tobey Maguire, but I think he was great in this film. He makes the character sympathetic and relatable, and I really care about what happens to him. I would argue that out of all three movies, Tobey gives his best performance as Peter Parker in this one. He was good in the third one, really good in the first film, but I think this was his best performance as Spider-Man in this film. Kirsten Dunst as always is beautiful and amazing as Mary Jane (yes she is a bit harsh to Peter in this movie, but I think she is still good in this one regardless), James Franco is fantastic in this movie as he shows the rage and anger Harry feels towards Spider-Man, Rosemary Harris is terrific as Aunt May, but I have to give two thumbs up to Alfred Molina who played Doc Ock. He was incredible as Doc Ock, and very scary with those mechanical arms (in a good way). And yes it wash a bit harsh of her to leave John Jameson at the altar the way she did, but the last scene where Mary Jane (who at this point knows that Peter is Spider-Man) chooses Peter almost brought tears to my eyes, and then it shows Spider- Man swinging through New York after hearing sirens going off in the distance. One of my favorite scenes in this movie was the battle between Spider-Man and Doc Ock on top of the subway. I still get a thrill out of watching that scene, and I remember being in awe of the scene where the passengers see Spider-Man without his mask and they promise not to tell anyone they saw his face. As far as directing, Sam Raimi did an excellent job with this film, especially since he was a big fan of the comics.I don't really know anybody who hates this movie, even though I've heard the fans of "The Amazing Spider-Man" badmouth this movie relentlessly saying it's just as bad as "Batman and Robin" by Joel Schumacher (give me a break!). Like I said, I don't care what anyone says, but this movie is one of the best superhero movies ever made besides the first Spider-Man, Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Chris Nolan's Batman trilogy and The Avengers. 8 years later, this movie is still a great film to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Comic Book Movie. Ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is by far one of the best movies of all time! The movie had pretty much everything you need for a prefect film: Script: 10/10! OUTSTANDING! Director Sam Raimi did an excellent job giving full attention to the Dilemma of Peter Parker. He balances all the action, comedy, and drama perfectly.Acting: 10/10. Tobey Maguire was very good being a character that doubts himself and has to choose between wanting a normal life and wanting to live as a superhero. Kirsten Dunst is very good in her roll as Mary Jane Watson. James Franco is amazing as the bitter Harry Osborn who is seeking revenge on Spider-Man. And Alfred Molina as Doc Ock is fantastic. He was an excellent choice as one of my favorite characters from the comic.Action Sequences: 10/10. This movie has some amazing action scenes with Doc Ock on the building. But the best effect in the film is the fight between Spidey and Doc Ock on the side of the train.Comedy: 8/10. J.K. Simmons is amazing as J. Jonah Jameson and adds a lot to the film. Ted Raimi is also very funny. The Raindrops sequence in the movie had a lot of laughs when you see Peter Parker as the nerdiest kid in the world.This movie has everything you could ever want out of a summer blockbuster. And as far as staying faithful to the comic book 10/10.PERFECT!!! 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i watched SPIDERMAN and SPIDERMAN 2 when they were released, and i didn't write a review about either of them. Better late than never. This wont be much of an overview of the films; just a great big thank you Mr Sam Raimi for your great comic book hero come to life. I saw what you could do with no money, a great friend/eternal hero, camera angles, and sound, with your EVIL DEAD series, and look at what you can do with a budget. This is one of those rare times when the sequel was as good if not better than the first, and i am looking forward to SPIDERMAN 3 with anticipation. I wouldn't mind seeing another A SIMPLE PLAN type of film from you either. These are some of the best action-hero comic book character(s) i've ever seen brought to life. The ensemble casts with the likes of Alfred Molina, Thomas Hayden Church, Willam Dafoe, Cliff Robertson, Kirsten Dunst, and James Franco, Bryce Dallas Howard, Theresa Russell, Topher Grace, and of course, the spiderman himself, Tobey Maguire, is a treat in itself. Nice touch with Ted, Lucy, Bruce, and Briget too. gotta say, i'm a big Raimi fan....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spider-Man returns...Wonderful news!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 2002, Sam Raimi proved he was the right man to give cinematic life to Marvel Comics'most popular character.With this sequel, he proves he can do the same thing again, only a lot better...Two years after the events of the first movie, Peter Parker's life hasn't got any better: the woman he loves is engaged to his boss's son, his best friend accuses Spider-Man of said friend's father's murder, and his powers are beginning to fail him(comparisons with Smallville aren't a problem, since the show's creators contributed to the Spider-man 2 script).Plus, there's a new weird guy in town: Dr.Otto Octavius(Alfred Molina), aka Doc Ock.Trouble's on its way...This film is far more exciting and gripping than its predecessor, and it also contains some humor(check out Raimi-regular Bruce Campbell's cameo).The original actors are excellent, while Molina's Ock is more conflicted and charming than Willem Dafoe's superb Green Goblin.The movie also contains the most breathtaking action sequence ever,featuring Spidey, his nemesis and a speeding train.A real triumph within the genre, it makes the expectations for the third movie very high, as people wonder what Raimi can do to overshadow the greatest superhero movie after Batman Begins.The standout of summer 2004</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spider-Man 2 put my faith back into the movies. The action in this film is unbelievable. Just to be able to visibly see the very stories we have read in comic books come to life on the big screen was wonderful. I found myself not wanting the story to end. Many of the movies based on superheroes in a comic book tend not to stick close to the actual story. I personally have been a Spider-Man fan since I was seven. The movie has surpassed my expectation and I certainly look forward Spider-Man 3! The next film sets itself up for a kick butt start. Raimi should take a page from X2 or the Lethal Weapon series and just open the next film with a wild battle. Keep the Tobey thought intro but have him talk over a Spider-Man vs Sandman battle. You can grab the viewer right away and still tell your full story right after. A villain made of sand really doesn't need an intro and these kids clamoring for more action will be satiated enough to let Sam continue to spin his remarkable story and his take on Spider-Man.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Spider-Man Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tobey Maguire,(Spider-Man/Peter Parker), gave an outstanding performance as a very weak and helpless type of guy who tried to fly like a bird and fell on his face all the time, so to speak. As the picture progresses you wonder just how Spider Man will eventually put an end to his octopus friend and his evil deeds. There are many exciting scenes and especially when Spider Man is trying to save a run-away elevated train from going off its track and winding up in a river. Kirsten Dunst, (Mary Jane Watson) is about to get married to someone other than Peter Parker and something takes hold of her and sends her in another direction. This was a great entertaining film and very well viewing over and over again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>2 years after the first movie, Peter Parker (Tobey Mcguire) has never had time with Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) whom has became a model/actress or for class because he's always late because there's always a crime happening at the wrong time. Suddenly his powers fade away which makes him realize that he must give up being Spider-Man, however as Dr. Otto Octavius (Alfred Molan) has made a robotic suit with monstrous tentacles as suddenly a lab accident occurs making the suit fused to his body as he controls it telepathically to become Dr. Octopus with a plan on eliminating the city. Sure Peter is happy with being normal again, but with the crime rate high and Doc Ock on the rampage can he return back to Spider-Man or will the city be doomed.This is a rare sequel that can surpass the original much like "Terminator 2", "Aliens", "Godfather 2", "Dawn of the Dead (1978)" or "Empire Strikes Back"! Sam Raimi and company knew what they were accomplishing when they made this fantastic sequel to their instant crowd-pleaser "Spider-Man". Packed with more emotion, more characterization, better action then the last one, better special effects and more comical moments that make this movie superior to the original. J.K. Simmons along with Rosemary Harris, Bruce Campbell and James Franco return for as the acting is really great here and more true to the comic then the original movie ever was.A Must see! Can't wait to see "Spider-Man 3" with Spidy's Black costume, Venom and Sandman.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Expanding the World of Spider-Man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What makes a truly great superhero movie? Is it the large spectacle of incredibly mind-blowing special effects? Is it about the character and their amazing gifts and abilities to overcome overwhelming odds? How about the implementation of a tangible love story, the introduction of a particularly nasty villain or the mythology formed from generations of stories told through a multitude of media.If "all the above" is what you had in mind then you must conclude that Spider-Man 2 (2004) is the golden standard for superhero movie sequels and the modern gold standard for superhero movies in general. The movie has everything one would need to enjoy from a film genre that embraces popcorny-ness. It's sleek, stylish and has a tremendous villain in the form of Doctor Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina). Furthermore, the fact that Spider-Man 2 is a sequel, the story has the ability to open and expand the world of Peter Parker/Spider-Man (Tobey Maguire), our forlorn hero.The film opens with Peter Parker trying to balance his personal and professional life with that of his secret life as the web-slinging wall-crawler. Late on his rent, fired from his job delivering pizzas, discovering the woman he loves (Kirsten Dunst) is about to be married to someone else, and slipping in his academics, the downtrodden Peter can't even catch a break on his Birthday. To top it all off his best friend Harry (James Franco) wants Peter's alter ego Spider-Man dead for killing his father and dear Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) is foreclosing on the house. How can things get any worse you ask? In comes Otto Octavius, a brilliant scientist who after a scientific breakthrough goes wrong gets four large mechanical arms with a mind of their own. Add to that Peter's web-slinging just isn't what it used to be.The film asks many questions about Peter's fidelity to his masked persona. Life is hard enough without having to deal with every whack job, natural disaster and heavily armed bank robber in New York. Half way through the movie Peter eventually just says to hell with it and walks away from his supposed great responsibility for as we all know he has great power for.Spider-Man 2 differs from its prequel and from most superhero films in that it has a very strong and apparent emotional core. The majority of the movie is spent with Peter Parker out of his Spidey-outfit just trying to keep his head above water. We have an emotional connection to his character to the point where we actually care and want to see him and Mary Jane get together and be happy.My only major gripe about Spider-Man 2 is its setup of Spider-Man 3 (2007). While there is a lot of controversy about whether the Sam Raimi directed trilogy (2002-2007) is better than the new Amazing Spider Man (2012), we can all agree Raimi's third installment wasn't very good. Still by the end of Spider-Man 2 both Mary Jane, Harry and even Aunt May knew Spider-Man and Peter were one and the same. Add to that the fan boy crowd screamed at the top of their lungs for Venom so Sam Raimi kind of painted himself into a corner.Ages ago Christopher Reeve dawned the cape of the Man of Steel which first planted the seed for a viewing public ready for breathtaking action and noble sacrifice. Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy gave way to the darker more brooding superhero films which expounded on larger themes about a hero's relationship with society and the greater good. In between those two moments, Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy laid the groundwork for superhero films loaded with modern special effects and old-school story-telling. Without the bankability of Spider-Man 2, there would be no Avengers (2012), Fantastic Four (2005) or Kick-Ass (2010). Additionally there'd be no standard to reach for or exceed.http://theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Solid Sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spiderman 2 is a superhero film directed by Sam Raimi and written by Alvin Sargent from a story by Alfred Gough, Miles Millar, and Michael Chabon. The sequel to Spider-Man, it is the second film in Raimi's Spider-Man film trilogy based on the fictional Marvel Comics character of the same name. Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, and James Franco reprise their roles as Peter Parker, Mary Jane Watson, Harry Osborn, respectively.Alfred Molina,Rosemary Harris and Donna Murphy co-star to play key supporting roles.Set two years after the events of Spiderman, the film focuses on Peter Parker struggling to manage both his personal life and his duties as Spider-Man. Dr. Otto Octavius, who takes a turn for the diabolical following a failed experiment and the death of his wife. Using his mechanical tentacles, Octavius is dubbed "Doctor Octopus" and threatens to endanger the lives of the people of New York City. Spiderman must stop him from annihilating the city.Boasting an entertaining villain and deeper emotional focus, this is a nimble sequel that improves upon the original.Due to this reason,it has become one of the best sequel ever made particularly of that of a superhero film.A lot of talent to lavish on a single movie, but the result is uncommonly smart for the genre, and not just smart but tremendously enjoyable.There are plenty of surprises in this compelling Hollywood cartoon-inspired movie that tops everything else in the genre especially as it improves on the first one in terms of action and comedy.Overall,it's a solid movie with some memorable moments.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spider luck, better than before</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember seeing this film back when it came out, but I only managed to watch it until the scene where Doc Ocks tentacles came alive and attack the doctors. After my super hero fandom started to rise with batman, and then with Watchmen. I finally came back to this film, (well actually I decided to watch this after the disappointment of spider-man 3)and I was surely impressed with what they decided to do in this film.At a young age at seeing this film I wasn't into Spider-man, I was more into seeing animations or cartoons,so even now I wasn't surprised in being scared at first. But now, I find myself a big fan of spider-man.The film itself is an improvement from the last one, there may have been a few tiny things that bothered me (like the goblin's mask), but they fix that with a better villain, they make an even more interesting story after the origin story, and they make some pretty damn good action. The first thing that caught my attention now was the villain, instead of making the villain seem like a bad guy even before the transformation, they decide to add more humanity to him. That's a great way to get people to like the villain even as much as the hero. Of course this story is famous in the comic book world (the hero stops being hero because of their other life), is even better portrayed into live-action. In that way you can truly see all the negatives in his life as a super hero.My personal favorite part of this film is the villain: Doc Ock. There are lots of villains I like out there in the film world (Jason Voorhees, Joker, Hanibal Lecter, Freddy Krueger, Tetsuo Shima, and more), Doc Ock stands out as the more human villain, and by that I mean a person could relate to this guy because he has an actual social life and a career of science. It's better than relating to someone like Jason, and without someone questioning your mental state.My final thoughts: A vast improvement from before, simply brilliant! I think anyone can enjoy this movie, even if they're not a fan of spider-man or superheroes. If you watch this film your really have a great time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spider-man 2 A Much Better Than Expected Sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spider-man 2 was a much better than expected sequel. It's better than the original with more improved special effects, humor, a nasty villain, and more intense action. Director Sam Raimi did a great job of making this sequel which is the best of the three films. Spider-man 3 unfortunately was the worst of the trilogy. This one however is definitely worth seeing because it's that good. Tobey Maguire reprises his role as Peter Parker/Spider-man and he continues to be a good choice for the character. Peter's now in college and what he wants more than anything is a normal life but his character feels a duty to protect people with his amazing arachnid abilities. Kristen Dunst returns as Mary Jane and she's okay in the part but like the previous one she isn't good much to do except eventually being the lady in distress again later on in the film. James Franco is back again as Harry Osbourn who blames Spider-man for his father's death. Franco does a decent job as Harry but like Dunst he isn't given much to do and his character lacks screen time. Alred Molina joins the cast as brilliant scientist Otto Octavious who after a freak accident becomes Doc Ock because of four mechanic arms melded to his back. Molina like Dafoe makes for a menacing villain and is well developed. Also his character fortunately doesn't have a corny costume like the Green Golbin did in the original. No offense. Rosemary Harris also reprises her supporting role as Peter's Aunt May. She isn't really given much to do either but Rosemary Harris makes the best of her limited screen time and Bruce Campbell shows up once again in a cameo appearance as a theater usher. The special effects are an improvement over the first one and so are the action/ fight sequences most of them between Spider-man and his nemesis Doc Ock. The one standing out is of course their fight that starts off on a skyscraper near a giant clock and then on top of a speeding train thats grows more intense as their confrontation escalates toward it's conclusion. The final showdown between Spider-man and Doc Ock near the end was a bit of a letdown compared to train one but everything else that happened before in the movie made up for the somewhat rushed conclusion. The pacing in between the action was a little slow at times and the dialogue wasn't the best occasionally problems that the original had too but this sequel is still a very good movie. It was much better than expected and I was fairly impressed with the film overall. Spider-man 2 is one of the best sequels (besides The Dark Knight, and T2 Judgement Day) out there with just the right amount of well balanced intense action, character development, humor, drama, some suspense, and impressive performances by the cast especially Molina that's sure to please almost any comic book fan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Balanced almost as perfectly as an egg on the back of a spoon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having enjoyed the first Spider-Man movie, I was looking forward eagerly to this movie, and to bluntly ruin the surprise, I was impressed beyond expectations. In a superhero movie, good action is usually a given, but a good story is hard to manage, and Spider-Man 2 honorably handles both these elements with a grace that equals Spidey's when he's web-swinging across the skyscrapers of New York City.Spider-Man 2's story, which is themed on internal strife, is one of the mature and realistic I've ever seen in a superhero movie, and it portrays the duality of the protagonist and antagonist's lives very effectively. Spider-Man 2 is also one of the few superhero movies that manage to be serious without getting dragged or seeming self-obsessed.But even with its seriousness, Spider-Man 2 proudly embraces the lightness of its origins with J.K. Simmons' hilarious stints as the brash Daily Bugle editor J. Jonah Jameson, Doc Ock's dark sarcasm, a side-splitting scene with Spidey taking an elevator and a cameo by Bruce Campbell as an annoying doorkeeper at a theater, along with more subtle humorous moments with Peter Parker. Amazingly, none of the humor feels out of place, cheesy or overdone.However, Spider-Man 2's story is not without its flaws, almost all of which had to do with prematurely revealing Spidey's secret identity, something that should have been delayed as late as possible in the series. The first time Harry does the unmasking (thanks to some good help from Doc Ock), which should've been avoided but wasn't as paining as the second time, when Spidey deliberately takes off his half-damaged mask during the climax, revealing his identity to a train full of passengers.Perhaps sensibly, the movie makes no effort at explaining the knock-on effects of the revelation of a superhero's identity in a place like NYC (especially with people like J. Jonah Jameson around), but then why unmask Spidey in front of an entire crowd in the first place? But since this is just one inconsistency in an otherwise superb plot, it's somewhat forgivable.The action sequences are much, much better than the first movie, and probably the best I've ever seen in a superhero movie. While the first Spider-Man featured a good deal of almost kung fu like action, this time around Spidey grapples and smashes objects on a far bigger scale ? the best of which occur on the faade of a skyscraper and on top of an elevated train (the climax). But what makes it all so exciting is that Spidey does all this against four mechanical tentacles that are essentially the arms of his nemesis, Doc Ock.Talking of Doc Ock, I feel that it's necessary to mention that his tentacles feel so organic and natural in their movements that it feels like they're actually his arms, controlled by his own muscles; in fact, they're even capable of emoting when needed, such as during the more dramatic scenes when Doc Ock questions his conscience, which is a big feat in itself. Spidey's costume has also undergone some subtle changes this time; the colors are richer, the lenses are whiter and maybe a little more opaque, and the costume generally looks more imposing on-screen.The acting is miles better than the first movie from the ENTIRE cast, with Tobey Maguire and Alfred Molina taking the top spots in the major roles. However, Kirsten Dunst still had more room for expression. There is also something unique about the way the web-swinging scenes are filmed that I didn't feel in the first movie; it feels like you're swinging with Spidey. I later found out that this was the result of a new camera-work technique called the Spyder-Cam; anyways, great stuff. The cinematography is also top-notch throughout the movie, and especially so during the action sequences.Overall, Spider-Man 2 is a tremendous leap forward in every aspect from its already-impressive predecessor, and in my honest opinion, quite simply the best superhero movie made so far (since this review is pretty late, I include the extremely overrated Dark Knight in that too). RATING: 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Basically the perfect superhero movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Comic book movies don't get much better than this. Sam Raimi once again proves what a great director he is with this sequel to the fantastic Spider-Man movie of 2002. And as good as the first movie was, this one improves on it in many ways. It's a fantastic continuation from the first one, fitting right into the storyline. I honestly don't think anyone could hope for a sequel better than this. Set two years after the first movie, Peter is struggling to find balance between his two identities. His life is falling apart. His loved ones are still suffering from various events from the first movie. And now a new enemy has appeared. What can become of all this?The storyline of the movie is really great. It sort of makes you ask yourself questions. Like how long can a person really put other people before themselves before it all just becomes too much? Can a person really handle that much responsibility? The movie definitely gets the human side of the story right, and has a strong sense of emotion about it. It doesn't just go through the motions and have Peter as a hero who never gives a second thought. He is portrayed as a normal person who got these powers that he never asked for. After watching the movie you might re-think "How awesome it would be to have superpowers." And the villainous Doctor Octopus has been given a drastically different origin in the movie to the one he had in the comics, which was a risky move to make, but it really worked.The acting is great, once again. Tobey Macguire still does a great job as Peter Parker and Spider-Man, Kirsten Dunst is a good Mary Jane Wattson and James Franco plays Harry Osborne well. As with the first movie all the supporting actors in the movie are great, like JK Simmons and Rosemary Harris. A lot of the chemistry the characters had with each other in the first movie is back, although considerably different in contrast to the differences that the events of the first movie have caused in their relationships with each other. The actors pull off the changes well. Alfred Molina was the perfect casting choice as the villainous Doc Ock, and played the part fantastically. Couldn't have asked for a better actor for the job.The visual effects in the movie are amazing. The effects in the first movie were decent, but these are a vast improvement. The action scenes were just amazing and really got my blood pumping. All of it just came together better than someone could hope for. Once again the costume designs were fantastic, with huge props for the way Dock Ock is done. His artificial arms are awesome and the character could not look more perfect. So all in all, the whole movie was fantastic, and It makes me sad that I missed the chance to see it at the cinema. I've watched it several times, and it really holds up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all let me just say that Spiderman 1 was good but not perfect. The only other sequel I preferred to the original was Superman 2. All the regulars return but this time the villain is Dr Octavious played by Alfred Molina. In my opinion however I thought Williem Dafoe was better as the villain. Everything was perfect, the scripting, the acting and the action sequences. For an superhero movie it is also quite emotional but that just adds to the appeal. There was also the hint of a revenge subplot between Harry Osborn and Spiderman. Spiderman 2 is the best in the franchise so far.I also went to see Spiderman 3 but to be honest I was slightly disappointed. That isn't enough to deter me from watching future sequels though. No.4 bring it on!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun action adventure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spider-Man 2 continues from where the first one ended. Peter (Tobey Maguire) is trying to divide his life between real life and his career as a Spider-Man, while Harry Osborn (James Franco) is franticly trying to find out who spider is, so he could wreak his vengeance upon him because of his father Norman, who was the Green Goblin. Meanwhile Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) is trying to figure out if Peter is worth the effort and if she should just go on with her own life. And then we have Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina) who will turn into Doc Ock after a small mishap.In all Spider 2 is more complete and better rounded up movie than the first one was, because the main players are already introduced and this time they can grow better as characters. Only new character to be introduced really is Dock Ock, which is a part that Molina deliverers very nicely. The script holds together, the acting is good and direction very fitting to the story. Even though Spider-Man has never been my favourite comic hero, this movie does deliver good entertainment and I found it to be good presentation of the hero. It certainly is worth the watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How can Spider-Man possibly be Improved?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spider-Man 2 (2004, Dir. Sam Raimi) It's been two years since Peter Parker had his transformation into Spider-Man, and he is still trying to balance life perfectly. His love for Mary Jane is becoming much stronger, as he finds it hard to not let her down. His friendship with Harry Osborn is at risk, as the young Harry is frustrated with Spider-Man getting away with his fathers death. And if this wasn't enough for the superhero, a new enemy is in town. Dr. Otto Octavius is involved in a freak scientific accident, and emerges as the dangerous, 'Doc Ock'.The first 'Spider-Man' movie was amazing, and you would have to wonder how it could possibly be improved. Well, you just simply make a sequel. Good sequels which was better than the original are hard to come by, but 'Spider-Man 2' does the job perfectly. All the cast and crew return bringing a very familiar feeling to the original movie. Everyone is older and feel more mature. Alfred Molina is an actor who is not normally associated with comic book villains, but he performs an awesome version of Doc Ock, who is definitely more menacing than the previous Green Goblin. The special effects have improved this time, with some great action scenes between Spidey and Doc Ock. If you've never seen the 'Spider-Man' movies, what are you waiting for? "Do you love me?" - Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) "...No." - Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superior to the original, with some problems worked out!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before going to see this sequel to 2002's "Spider-Man", I read a very positive review of it, and after doing so, I had high expectations! Surprisingly, I left the theatre disappointed that night, and failed to see how it was superior to the first (many clearly to believe it is). However, after watching "Spider-Man" again on the small screen more than 2 1/2 years later, all the praise the movie has received suddenly made sense to me! It has been two years since the events we saw in the first movie took place. Peter Parker is still Spider-Man, but unfortunately, he hasn't been having the best of luck lately. His life as Spider-Man is causing nothing but trouble in his life as Peter Parker. He can't seem to ever be punctual, which makes it very hard for him to keep a job and make it to his university classes. Also, due to misunderstandings, Mary Jane Watson and Harry Osborn no longer consider him their friend! His life as Spider-Man isn't going so well, either, as lately, his powers have often been malfunctioning, and the Daily Bugle is constantly trying to make him look bad to the city. So, Peter decides to give up his life as Spider-Man and move on. However, with a new villain threatening the town, Dr. Octopus (Dr. Otto Octavius, a scientist whose invention has gone wrong and taken control of him), it appears that Spider-Man is needed! I guess I was disappointed when I saw "Spider-Man 2" in the theatre because it was a bit darker and more dramatic than I expected. However, when I watched the movie again, I was obviously prepared for that, and managed to see a lot more in the film. It definitely has more funny moments than its predecessor (there certainly aren't any moments in the first "Spider-Man" movie that can match the part where Peter is on an elevator in his Spider-Man suit). Also, despite some dragging around the beginning, the excitement is probably more consistent, with more action in the movie, and the dialogue, while not always perfect, doesn't get quite as cheesy as it sometimes gets in the first movie. This second installment involves more romance between Peter and Mary Jane, but it never gets quite as embarrassing as it does at least once in the first.Sequels may not usually turn out to be as good or superior to their predecessors, but "Spider-Man 2" turned out to be one of those rare cases! Overall, this is certainly not an absolutely perfect superhero flick, but it comes closer to being one than the original "Spider-Man" movie adaptation. So, I wouldn't expect this movie to be quite the same as the 2002 blockbuster. I also wouldn't expect it to be quite the same as the comics, if you're at all familiar with those. However, if you want good action, a bit of humour, and some drama, you will likely find it all in this 2004 smash hit!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One word: brilliant. The first one was good. But after seeing this one, I didn't want to leave the theater. The entire cast from the original has outdone themselves in this one. However, the best performance is probably Alfred Molina as Doctor Octopus. And the special effects are realistic. Especially the tentacles scene in the emergency room. This one has improved upon everything from the original. There's more action and emotion in this one. And the ending with Harry discovering the Goblin's lair is excellent, foreshadowing, and even scary. As soon as I left the theater, I went home and began waiting for the DVD release. And when that happened, I began waiting for the release of Spider-Man 3.</fullReview>

From inner conflict, love and the fight against Doc Ock, Raimi and the scriptwriters amazed me till the end.Maguire was great.

		<shortDescription>A teenager character study.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spiderman 2 has become a fond memory of my movie experiences, mainly due to the fact that this was the first film that provided me with an emotional investment in the characters and also illuminated me to the power that films can present. Previous to this surreal experience i liked films as a form of entertainment, however the second viewing of this film, i believe, developed my love for cinema. Spiderman 2 is a superhero movie in the minimal sense, the film provides the dangers that a superhero faces but rather is concerned in developing a character study on the concepts of being a teenager and facing simple life problems. This is where the brilliance lies in spiderman 2, it's focus is on peter parker rather than spiderman.The audience sees immediately, as we are introduced to peter parker, the challenges he's faces from the creation of parker/spiderman. As to the previous film, we are introduced to peter parker narrating his daily life problems such as trouble at work, failing at school, struggling with rent and his social inability for Mary Jane. Raimi takes the first 10 minutes to establish these problems, which is great because it provides a brilliant focus for the movie and creates amazing pathos for the audience to establish an emotional investment. These opening sequences also create raimi exploration into the superhero paradox, spiderman offers the opportunity to save people from danger and the chance to be classified as a hero, however why does peter risk his life and sacrifice his social life when he is unappreciated for his efforts. Peter realized that the personification of spiderman was a self sacrifical curse, however peter is beginning to question his obligations.Furthermore there is a new villain in town 'doc ock' who is a scientist that has 4 mechanical arms welded to his body, sounds ridiculous doesn't it?, however raimi provides Octavius with a great sense of depth, a scientist tragical embedded into his own creation. Furthermore the birth of 'doc ock' brilliantly shows off raimi love for horror, as the scene encapsulates the villain while paying homage to horror classics.Once again Maguire is great, his ability to convey a sense of innocence effortlessly compliments the pathos that are used. Consider the scene when peter confesses the truth about uncle Ben death to aunt may or when he tells uncle ben that he has to give up their promise, it's quite impossible for the audience to not share some kind of emotional investment into peter's character.The previous spiderman was noted for the first use of CGI, which brought high and lows, however it seems raimi has improved dramatically at incorporating the use of this technology as the action sequences flow quite effortlessly. Particuly the train sequence, as the CGI allows the action to obtain an exhilarating level.As i previously noted, where spiderman 2 brilliance lies, is in it's ability to create a superhero movie that draws it's attention to not the superhero but rather the individual, who makes the choice to protect humanity and the predicaments that are cursed with this choice. Spiderman 2 is a teenager character study, most notable a drama then an action film, IMO the first superhero film to break the concepts of what these 'genre' films can represent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Improves on the Original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spider-Man 2 is considered by many to be an improvement on the original, and I think that's a very accurate suggestion. By eliminating some of the flaws of the first, and improving some of the strengths of the first, Spider-Man 2 surpassed the original, and is one of the best super hero films ever created.Between college, his job as a photographer for The Daily Bugle, and being Spider-Man, Peter Parker has a lot on his plate, and he's not doing that great of a job at any of these pursuits. Yet, as he loses his spidey abilities, Parker considers throwing in the towel, even though a new villain, the 6 armed Dr. Octavian is emerging.Many of the flaws that were present in the first film have been fixed in Spider-Man 2. One such example is the CGI work, which looks fantastic in this sequel. It's certainly not the best visual effects to appear on screen, but it's a great improvement over the original.One of the best parts of the original Spider-Man was the publisher of The Daily Bugle, J. Jonah Jameson. The quick talking, cigarette chomping publisher was consistently hilarious, but his screen time was sadly minimal. In the sequel, his role is greatly expanded, so he appears in more scenes. He remains one the film's highlights.The nefarious villain, Dr. Octavian, isn't as creepy as Green Goblin, but nor is he as campy. Personally, I wouldn't be able to choose one over the other, but Octavian is a wonderfully sinister villain, though he may be too similar to Green Goblin- in some respects- for some.Emotionally, the film expands as well, though this improvement isn't quite as dramatic as some of the others. We connect more with the characters (which is also assisted by solid acting by the entire cast), and this makes the film that much more enjoyable.The romance, on the other hand, is considerably worse than in the original. It feels more cheesy, even a bit more forced. And Mary-Jane is beginning to feel more and more irritating and helpless. It's a shame that there's so much more focus on this aspect of the film than in the original.The title sequence has been shortened slightly, but it's actually less entertaining than the original's making it seem longer. The title sequence should really be shortened, or perhaps it should be omitted entirely, or withheld until the end.Danny Elfman's score has improved. The techno effects has been significantly toned down, and there are few (if any) rock oriented pieces. It's still not a great score, but it's a good one, and it serves it's purpose.Spider-Man 2 both improves on it's predecessor, and provides solid entertainment. Even if cheesy romance create a few slow moments, improved CGI work, intense action, and superb acting make up for the flaws, and more. There aren't many super hero films out there that I've enjoyed, but this is certainly one of them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>it would be better if i come straight to the point and discuss why i think this movie is better than tdk. when i watched spiderman2 first time i was blown away by it i felt like i never felt before watching a superhero movie, its generally very hard to relate to a superhero for us average movie goers.. after all how many of us pull their briefs on top of their trousers and go after bad guys... before spiderman2 superhero movies had the very usual worn out formula, there is a superhero there is a super villain and there is a girl, super villain come up with an ingenious plan to kill the superhero and conquer the world... spiderman2 has all this too but it has little more and thats what makes it the best superhero movie till this very day... and that thing is the failures of superhero the weakness of the superhero, his suffering and for a change him being a victim of others cruelty. and that makes us love, sympathize and pity this superhero. the movie is not just some high on adrenaline cgi cheap thrill collection of sequences (though it does have some great action sequence which you'll love), its much more... tdk is a great flick but in my opinion its overrated and spiderman2 is a superior flick and first of its kind... god how i wish they didn't screw up spiderman3 so bad..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best Spiderman movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a big fan of comic books and comic book conversation when done right. Spiderman is on of the best comic best to be made and is an important cultural figure and important to Marvel Comics. The first and the third films were both good, the first was an introduction and the third really underused Venom. Spiderman 2, like X-Men 2 is best in the film franchise.Spiderman is meant to be more family friendly and a little serious then say the X-Men films and Batman Begins, but is still very fun and avoids going down the camp or comic root which is easy to do.Spiderman 2 takes place after the first film and the credits give you a brief run down of what happened. Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is struggling in his life, he had rejected the love of his life, Mary-Jane Watson (Kirsten Durst), his friendship with Harry Osborn (James Franco) is strained because he believed Spiderman killed his father and Peter wouldn't tell him anything. Peter is also struggling at university, unable to keep a hold of a double-life, suffering money troubles and had just been sacked as a pizza boy. Harry offered him the chance to meet with Dr. Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina) which Peter takes up. However during a demonstration of his invention his gets killed and the metal arms that he used to control the invention before fused with his body. From then on he became Dr. Octopus and sets out to make money so he could re-build the machine. At the same time Peter's relationship with Mary-Jane is getting worse, he missed the play she was starting in and then he finds out she became engaged with John Jameson, J. Jonah Jameson's son. However, as the film continues Mary-Jane doubts Peter's earlier claims that he wasn't in love with her and starts to develop feelings herself. Peter also starts loosing his powers and he starts to doubt whether to be Spiderman anymore. This was confirmed when he spoke with a doctor and then with his Uncle Ben in a dream. However, without Spiderman crime starts to raise in New York and Peter relies that he can't hide from his destiny.The reason why this film is so good was because of Sam Raimi's director. He focus' on the psychology of Peter/Spiderman and looks at relationships with many characters. He shows how a double life could take its toll on a person. There are also issues of sacrifice that Peter had to face and the guilt he suffered from his Uncle Ben being murdered. The CGI and the special effect had improvement from the film and they are stunning. There are great sequence in the movie such as Spiderman vs. Doc Ock on the church and the fight on the subway train. Raimi also has good casting instincts. Maguire is good at playing Peter as a bit of a geek and the films have made him an A-Lister. The other opinion was Jack Gyllenhaal and he possibly would have played Peter as a man who was a little more cooler and less of a social outcast. Durst and Franco had also improved as actors from the first film and you care for them more, especially Durst and I personally think she looks betters as a red-head then blonde. Molina is good as Doc Ock and shows that Raimi is able to get a stage actor like him to be in an action film like this. There are also regular like Rosemary Harris as Aunt May who is a good casting choice and the best of all was J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson, playing the character just right and looks like him as well and if you ever seen Simmons in the programme Oz then you will see how good an actor he is because it will special you when you find out what character he plays. Raimi also got the mix of fantasy and reality just right and doesn't go silly with it like some versions of Spiderman have done.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I always loved the first half of Spider-Man. I thought it was perfect. Right up there with Superman's origin in Donner's original. Tobey was perfect as Peter. Even Kirsten Dunst who is not one of my favorites radiated with a genuine girl next door quality. It had just the right sense of humor and it was wonderful to look at.Then the Green Goblin showed up.The movie nose dived pretty hard for me after that. It still had some good moments but it never stood as firm as it did in the first act.The sequel doesn't have that problem. This is a solid piece of work from start to glorious finish. This is not just a definitive Spider-Man movie. This is one of the best comic book films PERIOD. Maybe only second to the original Superman. It sure as hell beats all the Batman films (Bats is my fav and I can still admit that) and I think it's even better than X2.Everything works. Every character. Every action sequence. Every subplot. They packed so much into this that it's ready to burst at the seams. What other action films should pay attention to is what Sam Raimi has mastered with this series: it's character driven, not plot driven. Each major character has a strong and identifiable arc. John McLane is the same at the end of every Die Hard movie as he is at the beginning. Blade has had three movies and we don't anything more about him now than we did when the first one began.It's one of the first lessons of screen writing: create characters that the audience cares about and invests in. Because then when they're in those life or death situations it literally becomes an edge of your seat experience. For my money, there might not be a better scene in any superhero film than the train sequence in this one. It left me breathless.The biggest thing this has going for it is heart. Peter Parker has to be one of the most sympathetic heroes ever committed to film. You feel for this kid. You want him to get the girl. You want him to reconcile with his best friend. You feel his anguish when he has to admit to his role in his uncle's death.This is everything the first film got right with everything that didn't trimmed off.I cannot give any higher recommendation. I loved this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is absolutely fantastic. This isn't just a sequel that was just as good as the first, it whooped the first movie so hard and it set the bar extremely high for future superhero movies and movies in general to come. Toby Maguire, Alfred Molina, James Franco, Rosemary Harris and extras play their roles wonderfully. Kirsten Dunst not so much.The characters have matured and you'll care for these characters. The story is much deeper and the stakes are higher than they wee in the first film.2 years after the first movie, Peter is suffering to balance his normal life and his crime fighting life. He's low on pay, he doesn't make time for Harry or Mary Jane, Peter is doing poorly in school, he doesn't want to feel this pain anymore. He meets Doc Ock, a scientist invested in his work, but when his experiment goes bad and kills his wife, he avenges her and swears to take down Spider-Man and all of New York by rebuilding his work, but bigger and stronger than ever. Now, Peter has to stand up and do what's right.The action in this movie is just perfect. Not too boring and not too intense. The CGI looks really amazing for 2004 and it hasn't aged yet. I love the fight on the clock tower and on top of the train. Although I did enjoy Danny Elfman's work in the first Spider-Man, he brings his A game to the sequel and it's fantastic. The music is calm, ambient, sad, and frantic when it appropriately needs to be. This is personally my favorite film score. It's just a shame that Elfman had an uncomfortable time composing for the movie.Quoting from the film critic Roger Ebert who didn't enjoy the first Sam Raimi Spider-Man that much, he said that Spider-Man 2 "May be the best superhero movie I have ever seen." If you have not seen Spider-Man 2, go and watch this. You are doing a massive disservice to yourself by missing out on a compelling story and spectacular fight sequences. 10 years later and I still love this movie so much. This is a special movie, one of my top 10 favorite movies ever. This will go down in the film history books.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitively, one of the best in its genre.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The sequel to the Spider-Man movie is everything a fan of the first could ask for. Imagine the surprise to see such care, effort and appreciation put into every character within the movie, with excellent acting, direction, sound, computer animation... all of it seamlessly integrated into a film that is very aware of the history, the fandom, and the expectations associated with the Spider-Man franchise. Spider-Man 2 is the perfect film for the comic book genre, and the perfect sequel for Spider-Man fans. Aside from the flawless animation and choreography staged between the Spider-Man/Doctor Octopus fights, we get to the real core of Peter Parker, when he makes a real attempt back at normal life, after events allow him so. Seeing Peter Parker deal with day-to-day life honestly, in an environment unintentionally nudging against him in all areas, makes this film a real gem, and Tobey Maguire should give himself a pat on the back for what a good film he's put together.While Peter Parker deals with him losing a job, failing school, missing rent and straining to meet Mary Jane at the cost of being Spider-Man, an idol of his, Dr. Otto Octavius, whom his very project is on, receives sponsorship from his friend, Harry, to work his experiment on fusion. After the experiment goes horribly wrong, Octavius loses control of his senses and plots to finish his job no matter the cost.One of the best scenes has to be when Peter comes clean to Aunt May about what really happened to Uncle Ben. Here, the script and director could have done anything to make the scene anything else but what it was but they didn't. Those types of scenes, included along with relating to Mary Jane and saving whatever he kept holding onto with her, worked because of the exceptional acting and direction involved in knowing that they were creating a great film. Spider-Man 2 is one of the best sequels of all time, and if you loved the first movie, the second will not disappoint. Everyone involved in this film, should give themselves a hand because Spider-Man 2 lived up to its namesake as a film that you could enjoy over and over and never tire of. Every scene is never wasted, and I give the film two thumbs way up for ingenuity and imagination, for bringing the web-crawling hero a greater movie than one could think possible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spider-Man 3 should be like this</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In comparison, Spider-Man 2 is better than Spidey 3. Why? because my dear Spidey fans and casual movie lovers, Spider-Man 2 has a better script, better character development, suspense, humor and great action sequences; something that Spidey 3 DOESN'T HAVE!!! Spider-Man 3 was so bogged down that it sputtered like a car that ran out of gasoline at the last (and worst) time of the day. If the producers and the director would've sticked to the same formula that made the first two films so great in the third installment, it would've been SO much better. Sadly that wasn't the case.Spider-Man 2.1 with all the extra bells and whistles easily trumps Spidey 3. Get this instead of waiting for part 3. You won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Superhero Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spider-Man 2 is the way how they should make a superhero movie.We start out with Peter Parker having a crappy job, and keeps getting fired all the time, and live in a bad apartment, and is always late for work, and for class at the university. His relationship with his best friend is not going well, Harry blames Spider-Man for the death of his father(Green Goblin). Things aren't going well with Aunt May she has no money, and Mary Jane the love of his life is getting married. Not getting what he wants, Peter loses his powers as Spider-Man, and give up for good, having a normal life just as Peter Parker. Things go well, not until Peter's hero Dr. Otto Octavius a good-hearted nuclear scientist, who wants to create a first-ever successful self-sustaining fusion reaction for the welfare of mankind. He is a hero of Peter's, being the subject of his paper on fusion power, and the two become good friends. However, when the fusion experiment fails, Octavius is bonded with his handling equipment, four artificially intelligent mechanical tentacles. These convince him to carry on his dangerous experiments no matter the cost, in memory of his wife who was killed in the accident, and is dubbed Doctor Octopus by the Daily Bugle. Harry and Doc Ock make a deal, for Spider-Man in trade for the tritium. Spidey and Doc Ock have one awesome, spectacular, amazing fight in the subway trains, after Ock holds MJ hostage. Then Spidey is beaten and Harry unmasks Spider-Man and is stunned to discover that his sworn enemy is also his best friend. Peter awakens and convinces Harry to reveal Octavius' whereabouts so he can rescue Mary Jane. Spider-Man finds Doctor Octopus in an abandoned warehouse on a waterfront pier, where he's restarted his fusion experiment. After defeating Ock, Peter reveals his true identity to Octavius, who is dazed and whose tentacles are temporarily incapacitated, and pleads with him to stop the machine. Determined to end his doomsday experiment before it causes more harm, Octavius uses his mechanical arms to collapse the floor of the building, plunging the fusion device into the water below and him along with it. Mary Jane sees Peter without his mask and realizes that he is Spider-Man, but Peter tells her they can never be together, as he will always have enemies. Back at the Osborn Mansion, Harry hallucinates his own father, tells him to avenge his death, he finds all the goblin gear, learning his father was the Green Goblin. At the end of the film, Mary Jane leaves her wedding and finds Peter in his apartment, telling him that she has decided to be with him, despite the risks. She persuades Peter to finally let her in while accepting the need of his vows by letting him respond to a sudden call for help.The acting is great Toby MaGuire does an excellent job as the tormented superhero who can't have his own life, and what he wants. Alfred Molina as Doc Ock was well acted. I really think he should have gotten a nomination for best supporting actor, a really great villain an the best one. Kirsten Dunst as MJ, breath taking, she was much better in this film, as the love life of Peter Parker. James Franco as his best friend, who blames spidey for his father's death, and angry at Peter for taking pictures of spidey, a great set up there. The cast was excellent!Spider-Man 2 is the true way to make a comic book film. The sub plots worked very well, and this film shows true emotions, it's sweet, has very good romance between Peter, and MJ, and real feelings to one another, yes the actions scenes are jaw dropping and amazing, along with the incredible special effects. Spider-Man 2 has a human story, keeping its parallel plots alive and moving.The movie demonstrates what's wrong with a lot of other superhero epics: They focus on the superpowers, and short-change the humans behind them. It gives a good message, and doesn't be preachy about it. This the best comic book adaption next to Batman Begins, X2, and the original Superman. I liked many other superhero films such as Hulk, Daredevil, Fantastic 4, Blade, and more, but not enough to recommend, but Spider-Man 2 is in another category: It's a real movie, full-blooded and smart, with qualities even for those who have no idea who Stan Lee is. Spider-Man 2 is the superhero movie that would blow away, and fill amazement with comic book fans, and it's also a comic book film for people who don't like comic book films. For those of you who don't like Spider-Man, or just not into comics, watch it, you just might be surprised. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than the first!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I for one was not totally blown away by the first Spider-Man film. Yes, it is a good comic to film, but somehow I just didn't get caught up in all the hoopla. That was changed with Spider-Man 2. This film took the successful elements from the first (character and acting) and pushed it up another notch.We were given again only 1 new villain, this saved much needed time to flesh out Peter Parker/Spider-Man as well as further the other story lines going on with those surrounding Peter. The struggle that Peter goes through; should he or shouldn't he sacrifice his life for others, is handled beautifully here. You feel that struggle. He may be a "superhero", but he is still just a kid trying to sort out his life. A life that seems to sucker punch him every single day. I thought this was the most logical step to take the franchise after the introduction in the first. The special effects this time were much improved over the first. Many times I was taken out of the moment in the first film because the effects looked to much like effects and were not natural. That is still a problem from time to time here again, but by in large a much better outing.Story, performances, effects, all were improved in the 2nd installment, something we just don't see happen a lot. One of the best comic to film productions ever in my opinion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like Everyone, I Think That This Is The Best Superhero Movie EVER! (SPOILERS)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS What can I say about this movie that has not already been said? There is one thing that I know a lot of people will agree with me one.1. This is the best superhero movie ever made.Why? This combines humor with breathtaking action with an all around dark and rich plot. The only problem with the plot is that it is complicated. Also, I know a lot of people will say that this is the best superhero movie ever, and I agree, but this is one of the best sequels of all time too. Sure, Spiderman 1 had everything, but this has everything but also it does everything 10% better. Besides, Doctor Octopus is the best Spiderman villain of all time. He may be evil but you feel sorry for him at the same time, and Alfred Molina did a fantastic job of showing that. I mean, it is the tentacles. They are controlling him and persuade him to turn evil. It is so heartbreaking and disturbing at the same time. Also, there is one scene I have to mention. The Hospital Scene.The hospital scene was just back to the old Evil Dead says, where Sam Raimi was at his peek of showing super terrifying and kind of funny things at the same time. The hospital scene was terrifying and truly showed what the tentacles could do. That was the turning point of the movie. By far one of the most important scenes in the movie.Okay, now that I got all of that off my chest it is time to give the plot. Like I said, this is a bit complicated and hard to fit into words but here it is, the plot.Peter Parker (Spiderman) is finding life as the web-slinger difficult. He tries hard to keep up his education and tries to keep his friends Mary Jane Watson and Harry Osbourne, who thinks Spiderman killed his father. He also invested in Otto Octavius's experiments, which he uses extra arms for a fusion experiment. It goes terribly wrong. The arms, which are super-smart, are fused to his back. His wife, Rosie, is killed also. The arms tell Otto to turn evil and still make the experiment again. Meanwhile, Peter finds out that he can not use his powers as well anymore. He also learns that Mary Jane is getting married. With all the pressure, he gives up Spiderman. He starts to enjoy life without being the web slinger. Doctor Octopus is the meantime has found a warehouse to rebuild his experiment. All he needs left is tritium. He goes to Harry for it. Harry tells him he'll give him tritium if he gets Spiderman, and get Peter to find him. Doc Ock captures Mary Jane to lure Peter into getting Spiderman, or himself. Peter, as Spiderman is captured and given to Harry. Harry is shocked to learn the truth. Peter escapes and gets to the warehouse. After a battle with Doc Ock he becomes good again and Peter persuades him to turn off the machine. He does, but he sacrifices himself doing it. Mary Jane then learns that Peter is Spiderman.Then, at her wedding, Mary Jane leaves it to be with Peter, or, as we all know him, Spiderman.Overall, this is definitely the greatest and the richest superhero movie ever made. I know I mentioned that three times but that is all I can say about this movie. Everyone has already said it and it is so true. Trust me, if you are a fan of Spiderman or a fan of comic books or a fan of having a good time, watch this movie, you will not regret it. Take out the popcorn and just watch. You are definitely in for a ride.9/10Recommended Films: Spiderman.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spider-Man 2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No one can deny that 2002's Spider-Man was excellent. It had everything that was required for a top superhero film ? great characters, great script, great action and great effects. The story of the all-too-human Peter Parker who, because of a freak accident (aren't they all?!) became Spider-Man, and after the death of his uncle decides to heed his advice and fulfil his responsibility to protect people with his new-found powers. Of course, the Green Goblin showed up to mess things up, but it all worked out (reasonably) well in the end.To write a synopsis for the sequel, I could just settle for "see above". The story behind this film is pretty much the same as the original, but then again when the result is this good, a 'more of the same' attitude is not necessarily a bad thing. There are obviously going to be some changes, and this time Peter begins to lose his powers instead of gaining them. This gives a nice little twist to the story, and also provides most of the films lighter moments (Spider-Man taking the lift to get down from a building), and throughout this shows how comfortable director Sam Raimi is with his source material. Also fully present and correct is the good-hearted scientist who, because of an experiment gone wrong, becomes a mad bad-guy. However Alfred Molina must be given credit, as he is a much better villain than the Green Goblin was (and not a stupid mask in sight!), giving the right amount of menace to the film; he almost steals the show from right under Tobey Maguire's web. The rest of the cast are also excellent, their characters evolving just as you would expect them to after the first film.However, unfortunately it cannot be said that the sequel is actually better than the original; it is clearly its equal, even though has better acting, better effects and a better villain. The problem comes slap-bang in the middle of the film, just after Peter has decided to give up being Spider-Man and start his life afresh. The set up becomes repetitive ? his powers fail him in exactly the same way (in mid-air) a total of four times. He even goes into a burning building just like last time to save a kid; though this time he is without his powers. Once he gives up his responsibilities, the film seems to dip into some kind of soap, with Peter trying to win Mary-Jane back. This results in some quite trite dialogue, and the whole act is far too long, prompting the audience to have doubts as to where this is all going.But it is all saved by a relentless final act, where Spider-Man realises he has to do what he does, and goes to kick some ass. And does he! The action scenes beat the originals' hands-down, and special mention must go to the showdown on the train, which is accelerating out of control. They are expertly shot and edited, giving any other film of 2004 a run for its money in the excitement stakes. It's non-stop pace is just what the film needs after the slow middle section, and it clearly shows that this franchise is definitely going somewhere great. If only that middle had a little more attention paid to it, then this could have quite possibly been a 10. However because of this, and it's 'more of the same' feel, no matter how good it might be, just puts the top score out of reach.Rated: 9/10More reviews at: http://www.thelazylounge.net</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>best comic movie ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spider-Man 2" is the best comic book superhero movie made to date, and not simply by default. The story and screenplay come from Alfred Gough and Miles Millar (co-creators of "Smallville"), Michael Chabon (author of "Wonder Boys"), and Alvin Sargent (Oscar winner for "Julia" and "Ordinary People"), and more than any other film in this genre it is true to the character and what made him Marvel Comics' most popular superhero in the 1960s. I teach a unit on Spider-Man in my Pop Culture class where we compare the original Stan Lee &amp; Steve Ditko stories to what is being published today and my students have to deal with the key elements of the comic book. This time around Sam Raimi has those elements nailed big time.The story picks up two years after the first film, which is reprised through artwork by Alex Ross during the title sequences. Peter (Tobey Maguire) is now in college, working a part time job, fighting crime, and generally making a mess of everything. Being Spider-Man is a burden and it is beating Peter Parker down. He loses his job, his grades are slipping, and even his powers seem to be leaving him. He still loves Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), but all he can envision is a life where his enemies would threaten her life and he has to endure seeing her picture on billboards and posters all over New York City. It becomes clear that our hero is coming to a cross-roads in his life, but we have no idea what will be the final straw, as it could be anything from the bank foreclosing on the house of Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) or Dr. Curt Connors (Dylan Baker) flunking him to J. Jonah Jameson (J.K. Simmons) really firing him from the "Daily Bugle" to Mary Jane ending up with some other guy (Daniel Gillies).What made Spider-Man endearing was that he was the victim of such bad luck. With power comes great responsibility but you would think a guy could catch a break now and then. There is a point where a bruised Peter tries to make his way home and as he reaches out to steady himself against a parked car you KNOW that as soon as he touches it a car alarm goes off. Spider-Man endures a lot of slings and arrows in this film (e.g., Aunt May never told him how to do laundry) and all the while the gods just look down and laugh.The Green Goblin was something of the ultimate villain for Spider-Man because he was the one who learned the web-slinger's secret identity. But the consensus of my students each semester is that Doctor Octopus is the best Spider-Man villain. Dr. Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina) intends to make nuclear fusion work and is employed by Harry Osborn (James Franco), who dreams of making a fortune during the day and of killing Spider-Man to avenge his father at night. Of course things go horribly wrong, and the four metal tentacles that Octavius has created are now fused to his body and have driven him insane.We have all seen the trailer for "Spider-Man 2" and the scene where Doc Ock interupts a potentially tender moment between Peter and Mary Jane by throwing a car through a window at them. This must happen over an hour into the film but it starts off a series of fantastic computer generated fights between the hero and the villain. The reason for this and why the pairing is so perfect is that Spider-Man and Doctor Octopus can both fight on the vertical axis as well as the horizontal. These two go at each other on the side of buildings and falling through the air as well as on top, on the sides, and through the middle of a subway train. Then you throw into the mix that Doc Ock can be carrying off someone Peter loves and still have three mechanical arms pounding away at Spider-Man. More importantly, when Spider-Man travels around by his webbing in this film it no longer looks like something we would expect from a Saturday morning cartoon.But the conflict between Spider-Man and Doctor Octopus is only one of a half dozen that provide the interpersonal web of problems closing in on Peter and the way they all fit together gives "Spider-Man 2" a weight hitherto unsuspected in superhero movies. This point is best evidence by the fact that Aunt May is major supporting character in the film just as she is in the comic book. There were always two women in Peter Parker's life and the one constant was always Aunt May.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow. Just wow.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a comic book fan and film buff. Have been for years. But I NEVER rushed out to see this movie in the theatre. In fact, I waited until I could watch it on DVD. Why? Mostly because the first movie, while good, didn't really strike me as 'great'. But there I was on my day off; no wife, no talk-during-the-movie friends, and most importantly, no audience to prompt me to laugh or groan or when to say 'whoa'... and I was whoaing. A lot.Picking up where the first movie left off, this is undoubtedly one of the greatest superhero movies ever, even surpassing the first. But despite being a great comic book movie, it is SO much more... it is a great 'FILM', comic book or otherwise. Good character development and interaction, perfect integration between live action and CG, a beautifully developed bad guy, strong performances, great cinematography and visuals, pathos and even an ending, that while leaving it open to sequels, DOESN'T make you feel cheated in the end! I truly believe that ANYONE could watch this movie and enjoy it. Incredibly-choreographed fight scenes, an involving, realistic story, romance and a sprinkling of comedy are all balanced together nicely in an unbelievable movie. And now that you've read all this you're gonna be disappointed, right? Let me leave you with the same thought process that I had when I sat down to watch it: just remind yourself of everything that happened in the first movie and think, "Sure, anybody with superpowers has it easy, right?" 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superior sequel that lacks vitality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I start, let me say that I thought Spider-Man 2 was superior in every way to Spider-Man 1, but one.Honestly, I don't know what it was about Spider-Man 2 that I found lacking. While it was a better movie with excellent effects, great performances, well-conceived plot elements, and beautiful film shots, it still felt "flat" in comparison to Spider-Man 1. Perhaps it was the fact that Peter had to surrender the mask this time. Or maybe it's that he wants to be with MJ so badly, but can't find the intestinal fortitude to be happy AND a super hero. Or it could be that I expected much more with a $61M budget increase. Whatever the dilemma, apparently it was felt by other movie-goers, since the return for that increased budget was down $23M from the first installment.This was like Superman 2 in that our hero chooses to be an earth-bound human to be with the gal he loves, discovers there's a new menace and immediately regrets his decision. Perhaps that was why it felt "flat." It's been done. But then again, what hasn't? This was a superior story with superior effects and action sequences that looked realistically played out rather than the CGI mess that was the first installment.Peter coming clean with Aune Mae was a difficult scene to watch. It was a courageous step on the character's part, and Aunt Mae reacted much the way I expected she would which lent a believable tone to the scene. The villain this time around is done extremely well. Gone is the camp of the first installment's treatment of the nemesis, and enters an age of superior CGI. After Spider-Man 1's Green Goblin, I was frankly reluctant in seeing this chapter. I'm glad, now, that I have. Doc Ock is malevolently beautiful in both design and execution. I thoroughly enjoyed his character.While the first Spider-Man rates a 7.4 (at IMDb) and received two Oscar nominations and Spider-Man 2 received none (but strangely, receives a 7.9 rating here at IMDb) the second installment was definitely above the original in every noticeable way. Yet it grossed less with a bigger budget and received no special effects Oscar nominations like the inferior Spider-Man 1 did, which leads me to believe that the lacking element, whatever that may be, affected more than just this movie Fiend.It rates an 8.2/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spider-Man 2 Is a Great Sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spider-Man was one of those films that was just a lot of fun, that never took itself too seriously, and had a tone that followed suit. The film's main protagonist had troubles, but never became so dark, that the viewer felt the tone out of place. This film takes the same approach, and delves deeper into the life of Peter Parker, with his past struggles, along with some new ones.The movie starts out with our hero as earnest as ever, but the struggles of life, topped with being a superhero, eventually brings him down, to the point that he questions his very purpose. This is something that I found very interesting, the idea of how much can one endure, before he starts to crack. Peter is struggling in his life for multiple reasons, he can't hold a job, the love of his life is slipping away, his friendship with Harry is strained, he's failing college, and he still feel's guilt for the death of Uncle Ben. Top this off with the threat of a new villain Doc Oc.Doc Oc, is a good villain for Spider-Man 2, not only is he a popular comic book villain, but on film he's incredible to see. The character isn't overly complex, but is deep enough (thanks to Alfred Molina) that his screen presence, isn't outmatched by his spectacle, during the more action packed moments. What really makes this film strong are the performances, namely Tobey Maguire, who carries the film on his shoulders. Now I've heard the criticisms of Tobey's take on Peter/Spider-Man, but he make's the general audience root for him, because of his underdog/mopey portrayal. True to the comics, or not, I root for this Peter/Spider-Man to succeed, and genuinely feel bad for him when things don't. The supporting cast is also pretty good, and each character gets their moment to shine. Mary Jane, though presented at times as a bit selfish, really does show her love for Peter, and feels confused as to why a guy who supposedly loves her is never there. Aunt May helps make Peter realize the importance of Spider-Man, and Harry learns the truth about Peter, and at least in this film, appears conflicted on how to deal with his revelation. Jonah Jameson, is still the scene stealer, and has even better lines this time around.As good as this film is, "it" like most films, has some narrative problems that do cross the viewers mind at times, but not to the point that the overall film suffers. Spider-Man 2, like it's predecessor, keeps the narrative relatively simple, but delivers it in a way that resonates with the audience, and never becomes too over the top, or convoluted. Spider-Man 2 is one the best comic book films ever, and it's certainly a sincere one, that keeps a crucial component, and thats heart.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Sequel Done Right!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spider-Man 2 (2004): A sequel done right, that's what this movie is. Without the lengthy origin, this film jumps right into the character's life. The film starts out with Peter as a Pizza delivery guy that's having issues getting his deliveries on time. He has 8 minutes to deliver a Pizza across a great number of blocks. Who better to help out, then his wise- cracking,Webslinging friend Spidey. Only spidey is having issues as well, his spidey life is getting in the way of his love life, his career, his education, and his social life. Long story short Pete is late, and it ends up costing him his job. He starts to write a paper on genius Otto Octavious (later to become the antagonist) I like that we get some time to get to know the character before he goes rogue. Otto invites a bunch of reporters and Others (I dunno maybe just discount "Important people") to a presentation of Tridium ( thought to be a self sustainable source of energy) He can't do this of course , without his four mechanical arms, and his sponsor Harry Osborn. Peter Parker ends up at the presentation, and of course the presentation goes wrong, the chip keeping the arms from his consiance gets fried, and Spidey shows up to save the day. Remember Harry has a grudge against Spidey, Spidey ends up saving Harry, and Otto Is sent to the hospital. The surgeons attempt to remove the arms from Otto, and the arms don't like that one bit. The arms kill the doctors one by one (or four by four?) I think this scene is fantastic, and directed excellently. All credit goes to Sam Raimi because of his experience with The Evil Dead Trilogy. My only gripe with this scene is it seems darker then the surrounding movie. After this we get a couple great fight scenes filled to the brim with beauiful color, and then Spidey starts to lose his powers. He see's a doctor very obviously which I found hilarious. He gives up the web slinging persona, and things start to go great for Pete. This is when the story really get's good, and you start to grow, and sympathize with Pete's character. You are happy when he is happy, and troubled whenever a cop car rolls by and tries to not notice. All credit goes to Tobey, and the writers, it wouldn't have been possible with out Tobey giving such a convincing performance. Later on Pete attends a dinner for Jamerson's astronaut son who just got back from the moon, Jamerson's son ends up taking Mary Jane to the dinner. He asks Mary Jane for her hand in marriage, and MJ says yes. Pete is barely upset about this. Later On Harry and Otto meet up. They make a deal, More Tridium for Spider-Man. Otto asks Harry how to find Spider-man and Harry says "His photographer Peter." Otto leaves but not before Harry shouts "Don't hurt Pete!" MJ and Pete go out for coffee , and MJ asks Pete "Do you love me?" and Pete says no. Otto throws a car through the window. WAIT, WAIT,WAIT! How did he know Peter would dodge that? If he was a normal guy (like otto thinks he is) he would have not have noticed and been killed. Anyway Otto takes MJ forcing Pete to become Spider-Man. Spidey get's into a fight with Otto on a train, which is one of the best fight scenes in the film. It's wonderfully choreographed and actually logical and realistic. The Subway goes out of control and barrels toward a dead end track. Pete stops the train and passes out. He wakes up on Harry Osborn's couch. Harry takes out a dagger, and rips off Spideys mask. The expression on Harry's face is deep and he stumbles back and drops the knife. Just another brilliant move in the Harry Story Arc. Spidey breaks free and goes to save MJ, and he does. MJ and Doc Ock both find out about his secret identity. Instead of trying to fight, Peter takes off his mask and talks Otto out of it. Otto drowns the tridium ball in the lake, as well as himself. Peter takes Mary Jane to a web and tells her why he can't be with Her. I think all of this gives Pete a great opportunity to grow as a character. Overall I really love this film. It's my favorite in the trilogy. It's well acted, and written. The action is fantastic,and logical. The film isn't afraid to give it's characters room to grow, and leads up to the most disappointing but still decent film in the trilogy. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerfully continues the emotional journey of Peter Parker</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Blockbuster sequels were notoriously tough to pull off before the superhero movie renaissance of the 2000s, and "Spider-Man 2" in 2004 was the very best follow-up we'd probably ever seen, with a number of the critics praising it more than Sam Raimi's original. Personally, I prefer the first "Spider-Man," but there's no denying the sequel's many strengths.Ultimately, Peter Parker's (Tobey Maguire) personal journey elevates "Spider-Man 2" above everything that preceded it, unless of course you happen to have my personal attachment to the first film. Peter's struggle to reconcile himself and Spider-Man drives the core of the movie and it goes on quite the wild ride.Having come to the powerful realization that being Spider-Man comes with the cost of keeping distance between himself and the ones he loves, Peter finds his personal life in a downward spiral at the beginning of the film. He has been fired from his pizza delivery job and can't pay the rent, fallen behind on his schoolwork and his secret identity has caused a strain with his best friend, Harry (James Franco) who wants Spider-Man dead, as well as kept him from coming clean to his Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) about his uncle's death.Then there's Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), the love of his life, who has moved on thanks to his peculiar way of being around her. When he fails to arrive on time to see MJ's play thanks to a crime-fighting pit stop, he realizes he has no part of his act together. Even his superpowers have been slipping up.Peter has advice coming at him from every which way, even his physician. The most profound advice, however, comes from Dr. Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina), whom Peter is writing a paper on. With Harry and Oscorp funding Octavius' fusion energy research, Peter gets to meet one of his idols. Octavius tells Peter that intelligence is a gift and not a privilege, and also drops some hints as to how important love and companionship are.But it's pride that causes things to go wrong with the doctor's experiment. When the energy becomes unstable, he refuses to shut it down and it results in his wife's death and the injury of others. He himself has four giant mechanical arms fused to his spine with no way to inhibit them from controlling his neural pathways. Dubbed Doctor Octopus, he becomes preoccupied with rebuilding his technology and fixing his ego, no matter the cost.Doc Ock presents a formidable challenge to Spider-Man and Molina does him justice, but the choice for Doctor Octopus seems arbitrary. His story never fully intertwines with Peter's, and his character development reduced to talking to himself. He simply could have been more of an example for Peter to learn from, but with the movie so focused on Peter's personal journey, not much else gets a fair shake, even if that character development is in fact what makes it so good.When Peter decides to stop being Spider-Man, it comes in the form of a second act when something that serious could've been a whole film. The script handles it well and Raimi truly brings us along with Peter's thought process, but it happens as an epiphany in the story and feels rushed. Consequently, Peter and MJ have so many changes in their feelings about each other throughout this movie that it could've been comical if not for the continued strength of Maguire and Dunst's performances.The romance wrenches as it did in the first film. The fact that these two can't find a way to be together absolutely kills and it drives up the emotional catharsis of the movie, playing a huge factor in why so many people love "Spider-Man 2."On the opposite side of things, the action is visually stunning, with props to the team behind Doc Ock's appendages. Even if the sequences don't have much of a role in driving the plot, they're fun to watch. Doctor Octopus' need to rebuild his machine drives all of them, which make his motives seem a little weak. The elevated subway train fight toward the end is the unquestioned highlight, but nothing necessitated a fight on a train. Still, it's an exhilarating sequence and the nice touch at its end involving Spider-Man's mask adds an extra something to the character development as well."Spider-Man 2" does an excellent job building off the first film's foundation, shooting the Peter Parker/Spider-Man character out of a canon now that we are familiar with him. The genius of the franchise to this point is that we're always on the same page with Peter's emotions and it doesn't change despite all the ups, downs and changes of heart that he endures in this installment.~Steven CThanks for reading!

		<shortDescription>More spidey</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spider man 2 continues the adventures of Peter Parker and his alter ego spider man, the crime fighting super hero. Tobey Maguire is back again as is his love interest, Mary Jane(Kirsten Dunst). The high octane action is as thrilling as the first film and the main villain is Dr. Octavius(Alfred Molina) who has created a mechanical device with giant metal tentacles with which he terrorizes the city.Dr. Octavius works on a fusion machine which will enable him to take over the world and spidey must stop him before he achieves his goal. Meanwhile, due to his hectic schedule battling bad guys, Mary Jane has become engaged to someone else, breaking the web man's heart. Predictably, our hero will fight for his woman, and he does. The couple seem to be destined for a long and complicated relationship. Spider man 2 works as well as the first one with good acting and breathtaking action sequences.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exciting Sequel!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spider Man 2 is one of the best sequels of all time rivaling the Lord of the Rings movies. I was blown away by the movie with the special effects and Spider Man himself. This movie may even be better than the first. I think the villain is better than the first film.Peter Parker has a busy life. He has several full time jobs and he attends school full time. On top of that he turns into Spidey when the time calls for it. And here, the time does call for it with the evil Doc and his mechanical arms.The acting is decent. I felt more towards Tobey than I did with the first film. Kirsten Dunst is still great to look at. Alfred Molina plays a great villain.The special effects are amazing. They should have with the budget this movie had. The music by Danny Elfman is another beauty.Overall, this is a great sequel to a great superhero movie. I rate this film 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent sequel to the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've recently read many reviews from posters and critics. And it seemed that there are far too many negative comments on this board about Spider-man 2. Much of the criticism is because of the fact that there is more romance and seemed more like a love story. This can be true but I disagree, the romance and action/adventure with suspense is great in this film. I enjoyed the first one but I gotta say that this was one better. The story was more developed along with the characters and it felt better. The CGI was better and so were the action scenes. Also the characters felt more ral as they showed more emotino and depth. There was far more suspense. Especially the scenes where Harry find out that Peter Parker is Spiderman, same with Mary-Jane. Also the scene in the train was great, and the ending was nice. The villain in this one (Doc.Oc) was more developed and it had a better story. In Spider-Man (2002) the villain- Green Goblin looked like some sort of a power ranger bad villain and his face didn't move when he moved, and the costume looked rather cheap, where as in this one the villain looks very sophisticated &amp; realistic. Spider-man 2 was going at a pretty good pace all the way to the end. The acting is improved and really great especially by Tobey Maguire. Overall a brilliant comic book movie &amp; equally as good as X-men 2. A perfect 10/10 for this amazing movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Again, Sam Raimi does it again with this new sequel to the famous first film. Parkers (Mcguire) now has to contend with a new villain who happens to be a very good friend by the name of Doctor Octavious. Or his evil name (Doctor Octopus). The friendly doctor gives a demonstration to a group of investors who needs to create an unlimited supply of energy harnessing the suns power but in a smaller version. When things go wrong, the doctors built in appendages which helps him in his experiments somehow give him the ability to create more havoc as his revenge runs rampant after the death of his beloved wife. Wanting to still create his experiments, doctor octopus begins his reign of terror across the city as Spiderman tries to quell his vindictive nature. A fantastic story that blends well with the familiar graphics everybody has come to love. A great summer movie for the kids who have nothing better to do, especially when they wear the uniforms.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Favorite Comic Book Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spider-Man was an okay film, but it is not as good as Spider-Man 2. This film is obviously the best of the franchise, and gives us a lot of the high-quality action we have wanted from the very gecko. There are lots of fight scenes, lots of great acting, and great character development that drives the story further.In this film, Spider-Man is facing off the evil Doctor Octopus, and trying to balance out his time, so he can do things like his job at the Bugle and tend to Mary Jane. it's not easy, but it is funny and entertaining to watch. This film is awesome because it gives us a lot of the things that we have been asking for, such as great action scenes, great story, and in the end, this is a great comic book film, and is my favorite comic book of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spectacular comic book fun!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is well known that Peter Parker is probably most well liked because of his human weaknesses than for his superpowers. He's a comic book superhero who is presented as just a normal guy who suddenly finds himself in possession of amazing powers that he doesn't quite understand or know how best to use, just like any of us would probably react. A lot of people were dissatisfied with the original film for a whole list of superficial reasons, but even those minor shortcomings seem to have been fixed for this sequel, which is one of the best comic book movies I've ever seen. Peter Parker is in college now and remains hopelessly in love with Mary Jane, but also remains a hopeless romantic, to say nothing of his unwillingness to get close to her for fear of endangering her. Superheroes, you see, tend to make enemies easily. And speaking of enemies, the villains in Spiderman 2 are a much welcome step up from Willem Dafoe's too- clownish Green Goblin with the plastic mask. There is a complicated history between Parker and Harry Osborn (James Franco), who is both in love with Mary Jane and the son of Norman Osborn, the alter-ego of the Green Goblin in the first film. As revelations are made about who Parker really is, their best friend relationship of course becomes increasingly prickly. Alfred Molina is also brilliant as the perfectly named Dr. Otto Octavius, the main villain, a benevolent scientist whose desire to create a means for harnessing cold fusion turns him into a madman, which is complicated by the fact that he has developed a way to connect some massive and enormously destructive metal tentacles to his body, enabling him to climb buildings like a spider and crush and toss humans around with equal ease. There is a scene involving a group of doctors that really reminds you who the director is. "Doc Ock" has a laboratory on the bank of the East River in which he has created a device which will either prove that he can use cold fusion or, if he fails, will destroy all of Manhattan. Parker doesn't think it's worth the risk, and the grand climax of the movie culminates in the final fulfillment of Octavius' experiment while Spiderman tries to stop it and save Mary Jane at the same time. It seems that Spiderman 2 is the result of a production team that openly discussed what might be weaknesses in the still fun and exciting original film, and how to fix them and make them better in the sequel. Superhero movies are often hit or miss, and usually it's pretty obvious what the misses are (hear that, Punisher?). The original Spiderman was a hit, and the first sequel is a bigger hit. People who don't know the comic books can still have a great time, and genre fans are sure to love it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is probably the best "Spider-Man" movie I've ever seen! Sam Raimi, once again, does a great job with this one. Alfred Molina was great as the sinister Doc Ock. I especially like the dramatic side of the film, such as Aunt May being in debt, Peter Parker thinking about giving up the life of a super-hero, and his friendship with Mary Jane (despite the fact that he really loves her) beginning to degenerate. I also like how Harry is beginning to become more arrogant and more bent on killing Spider-Man for "killing" his father. I didn't quite know what to expect of this one when I first saw it in theaters (and I had just started recovering from a mild case of the chicken pox when I did), but I was completely taken-aback from this. What a great sequel!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A powerful and memorable sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have never been much of a Spiderman fan, as a matter of fact I am not really a comic book fan overall. However I enjoyed Raimi's first Spiderman film very much and was more than happy to check out the second instalment when it was first released in cinema.My hopes before entering the cinema were not too high to be honest, I expected it to be one of those sequels which were simply out just to make money. However by the time I was leaving the cinema my thoughts were completely different to my expectations.Everything about this film in my personal opinion is an improvement from the first. The acting is a lot better and you can tell that the actors really do understand and care for the characters that they are playing. Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst have some outstanding chemistry in this film and of course not to forget the fantastic performance from Alfred Morlina who plays the menacing Dr Otto Octavius.Also the action in this film is a large improvement along with the special effects, each action sequence is directed well and is executed in a fast and exciting pace, making the film a real roller-coaster ride.Finally one thing that made this film so memorable for me is how much deeper and personal it is compared to the first film. As the original shows Peter Parker becoming Spiderman, this instalment shows the problems that Peter faces actually being Spiderman and what he must sacrifice.I do not usually like to compare sequels to original films as in my opinion every film whether it is sequel or remake should be given a chance on its own. However Spiderman 2 is one of those sequels which shines well above the first instalment and in my opinion has so far been the best in the series.8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spider-Man 2 is one of the best super hero movies ever. Peter Parker is still dealing with the dichotomy with being a super-hero. He loves and hates it at the same time. On the one hand, he realizes "with great power comes great responsibility," but he still wants his own life. It seems that every promise made to others he cares about is broken because of his self-imposed "responsibility." He cannot hold a job because he felt compelled to stop a robbery. He misses Mary Jane's play for a similar occasion. Adding insult to injury, is the fact that his powers are misfiring. He keeps losing his mastery of equilibrium, he cannot stick to walls, and he cannot sling his web. Frustrated, he packs up being Spider-Man. But is it for the best? At the same time, Doctor Octavius is trying to show Peter Parker the mastery of fusion power. It could solve the world's energy problem, mostly by copying the power of the sun. His robotic arms used to control the experiment fuse with his spinal cord and brain functions, giving the scientist a split personality. Now, he is controlled by the artificial intelligence of his robotic arms. Doc Ock needs a special element to continued his experiments. Only a vindictive Harry Osborne has. Since he wants Spider-Man dead, Doc Ock has to kill Spidey to get his precious metal. At the outset, this movie does so well in giving us super-heroes who we care about. The characters and story do not take precedence over the special effects. Director Sam Raimi does well in making Mary Jane, Harry Osborne, Peter Parker, and even Aunt May believable as real people. This is probably the best strength. We identify with them because they have the same problems we do. Aunt May cannot meet mortgage requirements, Peter can't pay rent, Harry turns to alcohol after an abysmal failure, and Mary Jane is frustrated with Peter's lack of commitment. Probably the best scene that shows this believability is when Peter confides in Aunt May. In fact, I think Rosemary Harris does a fantastic job, giving this background character real strength. I also liked the way Doc Ock was given some depth and intrigue. As a villain, he is smart, powerful, and strong. Even more intriguing is how he meets his demise, which will surprise the audience. However, the action and special effects are the topping on the cake. The fight scenes between Spidey and Doc Ock are incredibly fantastic, giving such intricate detail that will even wow a CGI specialist. One of those involves Spidey trying to save Aunt May from Doc Ock atop a high building. A better scene involves the two opponents fighting atop a moving elevated train. In any case, Spider-Man 2 is the best of the series, and probably the best super-hero movie ever ... so far.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An entertaining blockbuster with brains</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sam Raimi's 2002 adaptation of the "Spider-Man" comic books was a phenomenal success and whether or not to green-light a sequel was a "no-brainer" for the studio. However, sequels always bring higher expectations and often, as the sequel to this film shows, disappointment. With "Spider-Man 2", Raimi pulls off that rarest of cinematic successes. It is a sequel that is better than the original.The strength of the "Spider-Man" films lies in the central character. How Peter Parker deals with this stroke of fate and the stress on him being an ordinary man, and a young one at that, in an extraordinary position of responsibility creates a great deal of sympathy and depth. It is a role that Maguire is ideally suited for and his performance makes this more than just a simple blockbuster. It is a light-hearted drama. It has been described as "subversive" by some and that is an apt description. It sits right at the top of the great summer blockbusters of this decade, a list that includes "Batman Begins" and the "Bourne" series.But, it certainly doesn't shirk on its duty to entertain. Sam Raimi is a born entertainer and he doesn't pull any punches here, quite literally. The action comes thick and fast. All of the set-pieces are eye-popping and inventive. The first hour, in fact, is spectacular. There is stunning action, breathtaking visuals, interesting character development and lots of brilliant humour.It opens as a pretty light-hearted affair and this is not really an example of a sequel going "darker". The birth of this film's villain, as it was in the prequel, is the result of a tragic accident and there is no suggestion that he is truly evil. The second hour is grittier, but not darker. It is a completely satisfying film that never bores, but Raimi can't quite hold himself back at points. The final scene should be awfully melodramatic, because it is, but it is forgiven on the basis of the rest of the film.The other failing is that the villain, Doctor Octopus, brilliantly played by Alfred Molina, doesn't get nearly enough screen time. The main focus of the film is Parker's struggle with himself and his desires, but it comes across as pretty much the only focus. There is an interesting "Jekyll and Hyde" duality in the "Doc Ock" character, but this isn't really explored. There aren't enough internal struggles to make the character believable at points.Though, this should not take away from the many positives of the film. Mention must be made of J.K. Simmons, who is brilliant as J. Jonah Jameson. If this performance were in an offbeat comedy, he would have got an Oscar nomination. And don't forget Bruce Campbell's cameo as the "Snooty Usher".All in all, that makes for a completely entertaining two hours. In every way, this film justifies a sequel. In fact, it's a "no-brainer". What a shame that the sequel turned out to be exactly that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Rare Sequel the Passes the Original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sam Raimi gives us the second part of his Spider-Man series.Our story follows Peter as a struggling college student, juggling his job, class, friends, and being Spider-Man. Peter finally meets his idol Doctor Octavius who invites him to a new fusion reactor experiment they are going to do the next day. At that experiment he puts eight tentacles on him and the fusion reactor erupts and pulls a lot of stuff off the wall, killing his wife Rosie and fusing the tentacles to him and they take over his mind and becomes evil.Tobey McGuire returns to the role that made him a star, Peter Parker. He plays a very good geek and an unconventional hero. Although he lays a bit on the cheese factors on time.Kirsten Dunst plays Mary Jane Watson, the girl Peter's been crushing on. She plays her role very nicely, I do have one problem, she gets mad at him and breaks up her friendship with Pete for the weirdest reason.Alfred Molina is one of my favorite actors from Raiders of the Lost Ark to The Hoax, no slip ups on his performance, he almost made me sympathize with him.James Franco is easily the worst in this movie, a major on the cheese factor. The one good thing about his character is that he has an awesome ending.I liked this movie, the special effects were awesome (well-deserved Oscar,) the only problem I had was the acting and them putting on the cheese.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>... you just hit the jackpot", Mary Jane Watson ~ Dialogue straight out of the comic book ensuring that this sequel is going to be well worth the wait! OK, not quite as good as the first - sequels seldom are - but a valiant effort on the part of Sam Raimi.Here we have the next big Super Villain, Dr Otto Octavius/Doctor Octopus (Alfred Molina), who is about to further complicate Spider-Man's (Tobey Maguire) already failing personal life: Parker is experiencing financial difficulties and his studies are slipping. To top it all off, Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) is now engaged to astronaut John Jameson, son of Parker's overbearing newspaper editor, Jonah. Things just go from bad to worse for the web-slinger.Meanwhile, following the death of his father (the Green Goblin), Harry Osborn has now now taken over Oscorp Industries and is in business talks with Dr Otto Octavius. The Doctor, Parker's idol, has created a set of mechanical arms that are impervious to heat and magnetism; the experiment goes wrong and the arms become fused to the spine of Octavius, taking complete control of the doctor both mentally and physically.Aunt May is later captured and taken hostage by Dr Octopus. Spider-Man too falls prey to capture and is delivered to Harry, where his true identity is under threat. How much can one guy take? 'Spider-Man 2' is all about choices for Peter Parker: lose his alter-ego and concentrate on number one or continue with the responsibility he chose after the death of Uncle Ben ~ Raimi has skillfully recreated the classic scene - panel-for-panel - from Amazing Spider-Mam #50, Spider-Man No More, written by Stan Lee, pencilled by John Romita, and inked by Mickey Dimeo. Here Parker is seen leaving a rainy alleyway where his discarded costume hangs from the throat of a garbage can. Raimi has concentrated on the Parker who is forced to deal with actual everyday problems in Spider-Man 2, one we can all sympathize with. Parker's character outweighs that of other superheroes, for the simple fact that - at heart - he is just an ordinary guy trying to exist in a complicated world.Also stars: Bill Nunn, J K Simmons, Ted Raimi, Bruce Campbell with Cliff Robertson and Willem Dafoe.Matthew J Lee-Williams, Review.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Review 1: Spider-Man 2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spider-Man was almost the perfect comic book movie and perhaps released at the best time. When audiences get bored with what genres normally cook up (mostly horror) we the viewers always look for the next best thing. For a while, horror movies were all the fad, but these movies can become boring extremely fast and Hollywood must find something completely opposite from horror to try and keep our attention. So, what might be completely opposite from horror? Well first, lets make a list of what is opposite from horror. Happy is one, action is another; good guys always winning might be another. So, what might be a good opposite for horror is a comic book movie. Now, a lot of money comes from what Hollywood had to offer for comic book movies. Some are failures (Electra) and others are hits. For the most part, most of them are hits. Spider-Man 2 is one of them. We begin with Peter Parker continuing his job as Spider-Man, but all is not well. Peter's friend, Harry Osborn, hates Spider-Man and wants him dead. Because of Peter's relation with taking photographs of Spider-Man, Harry has problems with Peter that only continue to grow worse as the movie goes on. The main villain of this movie is Dr. Otto Octavius who later becomes Dr. Ock. In a freak accident, he is connected to his invention of arms that are suppose to help him with an even bigger invention. His wife is killed in the process and the arms attached to him seem to have complete control of what he does. Deeply grieved, Dr. Ock runs away and hides, but not for long. He comes to terms with what he has become and starts his life as super villain. As usual, it is up to Spider-Man to save the day, but something is not right. Spider-Man seems to be losing his powers and has no control of what is happening to him. It is true that this film is better than the first entry, but only by a little bit. It seems though, that scene were Peter saves the people a train was little over it when everyone on the train discovers he is Spider-Man. Overall: A- -Ben Russell</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Spider-man Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spider-man 2 is a perfect example of a film with a good story with lots of action, drama, entertainment, and has a good love story. This film surpasses the first one and despite the fact I had high expectations for this film, those expectations were sufficiently met. This is the best spider-man film.Sam Raimi returns as the director in this popular movie series. This film covers the emotional battle of Peter Parker and it is handled perfectly. Peter is torn between his duties as Spider-man, his responsibilities as a student, and most of all, his emotions. The result is Peter is uncertain what he wants and what he should do. The ultimate theme, the true test of a hero! What are the choices that Spider-man makes and the actions of those choices. They will define and determine the fate of his character, Spider-man. This story of Spidey's problems is handled perfectly alongside the story behind Doctor Octopus. The special effects in the movie are very good! Although some of the effects at times seemed obviously fake and way overdone! One of which I disliked was the Spider-man/Doc Ock battle on the skyscraper! Other than that, the special effects of the film were very satisfying.Tobey Maguire returns in perhaps his best performance of the movie series. Kirsten Dunst and James Franco are back as Mary Jane and Harry Osborne. I think Franco has a better performance as Harry in this film over the first film. But yet again, just as in the first film, the villain steals the show. Alfred Molina portrays Dr. Octopus. My personal favorite spider-man villain aside from Venom. He handles the character terrificly and the character is used perfectly as well. A good hearted man trapped in a mechanical and "superior" intelligence. Molina has the appearance and attitude of Doc Ock. He takes a very serious approach to Doc Ock which is very satisfying. He is a dangerous threat instead of a sometimes viewed old, crazy, and laughable villain. One of the best performances by an actor on a super-villain. He did not disappoint. J.K. Simmons returns in his humorous role as J. Jonah Jameson and Bruce Campbell makes a hysterical cameo appearance. Rosemary Harris portrays Aunt May and in this film, her character is more influential than ever! Her character has always been important to Peter but in this film her role is most significant. She has always been there for Peter but in this film she is able to provide Peter with the most wisdom and guidance he has ever needed. Her character is perfectly portrayed in this film. She is used as a pivotal necessity which is exploited wonderfully.Just an outstanding movie with an outstanding story and an outstanding usage of secondary characters! One of the best comic book films ever made and a true compliment to the Spider-man character. A fantastic film! The only reason I give it a 9 instead of a 10 is that it does not seem as captivating as other movies. It is a good film but I do not really get sucked into it near as much as I do with movies I give higher ratings. An outstanding movie, a must see by spidey lovers and spidey haters alike.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Spider-man 2" dwells on an identity crisis that young Peter Parker must contend with</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The best parts of the latest "Spider-man" movie "Spider-man 2" (*** out of ****) have nothing to do with either state-of-the-art computer generated special effects or dazzling high-octane action sequences. Instead, "Spider-man 2" director Sam Raimi allows his comic book characters to sit down and discuss their human foibles and frailties with friends. Sometimes, these characters hear things that don't make them happy. In fact, "Spider-man 2" dwells on an identity crisis that young Peter Parker must contend with if he is to maintain his future as an anonymous crime fighter. Imagine Hamlet in a web. The lesser parts of "Spider-man 2" focus on Spidey's latest adversary: Dr. Otto Octavius, an exceptionally gifted scientist who accidentally transforms himself into a multi-tentacled terror. Unfortunately, the super heroic sequences appear less than super heroic, and you almost want the Green Goblin from the clearly superior "Spider-man" (2002) to return for an encore. Actually, Willem Dafoe does have a cameo in "Spider-man 2," but he spends no more than a few minutes on screen as Norman Osborn rather than the villainous Green Goblin. Aside from Dr. Otto Octavius, everybody who showed up for the first "Spider-man" epic came back for the sequel, including Tobey Maguire as the web-slinging protagonist, Kirsten Durst as Spiderman's romantic interest, James Franco as Peter Parker's best friend, Rosemary Harris as Peter's Aunt May, and J.K. Simmons as irascible newspaper publisher J. Jonah Jameson."Spider-man 2" picks up the plot no more than a couple of years after its blockbuster predecessor with Peter Parker struggling to make ends meet in both his personal and professional life. Never has an alter-ego super heroic character suffered the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune as Spider-man. Peter loses a pizza delivery job, because he kept taking time off to play masked crusader. On the way to deliver pizzas, Peter spots two kids on a collision course with a truck and saves them. Nevertheless, he misses his delivery deadline, and his heartless boss cuts him loose. When Peter comes home from the university he attends in New York City, he tries to elude his rent-harassing landlord. Russian actor Elya Baskin of "Air Force One" has a field day as Peter's obnoxious landlord. Director Sam Raimi and writer Alvin Sargent overplay Peter Parker's nerdy image, taking it to seeming Woody Allen lengths. Furthermore, Peter desperately wants to hook up with Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst of "Mona Lisa Smiles"), but every time he tries to see her, he finds himself diverted to thwart criminal acts. Inevitably, Peter struggles with serious doubts about whether he should be "Spider-man." When he encounters trouble slinging webs, he worries about his ability to battle crime. Eventually, Peter trashes his "Spider-man" suit and behaves like an average ordinary college kid, ignoring the sight of thugs mugging a helpless victim in a back ally. Of course, Peter shrugs off these doubts when it becomes obvious he must foil Dr. Octavius' homicidal plans.Essentially, scripter Alvin Sargent of "Ordinary People" &amp; "Unfaithful" juggles three story lines in a 127 minute melodrama that runs about twenty minutes too long. Not surprisingly, since there are three plots in motion: the Peter Parker/Spider-man identity crisis; Peter's romantic pursuit of Mary Jane Watson; and Spider-man's battle against Dr. Octavius, you can expect just as many endings. Suffice to say that Spidey's face-off with Dr. Ock is hopelessly predictable. First, Spider-man cannot die. Second, their confrontation lacks magnitude. While Alfred Molina is a good actor, he looks miscast as web-crawler's arch-foe. Molina's Dr. Ock seems more flabby than frightening, and his character drags "Spider-man 2" down to the level of a formulaic "Superman"/"Batman" cliff-hanger. The quiet, simple moments when Peter Parker reveals the truth about events from the first "Spider-man" or about his feelings for Mary Jane emerge as the most dramatically satisfying in this curiously introspective, morality-driven, summer action thriller. Sargent's dialogue is probably the best thing about "Spider-man 2," because it sounds believable. What director Sam Raimi did with the original "Spider-man," he does with less success in the sequel. "Spider-Man" qualified as a breath of fresh air in the largely stale super hero genre, because Raimi and company reinvented their hero and brought him down to the level of an ordinary human with extraordinary powers. Tobey Maguire hasn't forgotten that quality, because he plays Peter Parker not so much as a super hero but as a guy with other problems when he isn't climbing walls after criminals.Long-time "Spider-man" fans will appreciate "Spider-man 2" and judge it less critically for its flat spots and its loyalty to Marvel comics. If you haven't seen the first "Spider-man," you may find yourself in the dark about parts of the plot. Virtually all the characters from the first "Spider-man" appear on screen, bringing plot threads from the original with them. Raimi manages to counterbalance the comedy and drama, but he over-emphasizes Peter Parker's nerdy nature. Altogether, while it doesn't surpass the original, "Spider-man 2" is still worth watching once.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would recommend this to any Spiderman or comic book fan. This film has a lot of action and can also make you laugh in some parts.It improved everything that was used in the first movie. Great to put Doctor Octopus (Doc Ock for fans) in the film. Excellent for Alfred Molina to play him.The end is most exciting, when Harry Osborn finds out his father is the Green Goblin and becomes GG Jr. Lots of twists, turns, and excitement. Visual effects are excellent. (Well that's why it won an Oscar for it) Better then the first and third.9/10That means see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spiderman 2 directed by cult director Sam Raimi(Evil Dead Trilogy) has to be the one of the best comic book adaptations. this movie has it all romance, action and a great story.Spiderman 2 is without a doubt the best in the trilogy.In this movie Peter Parker is losing his powers because of an unknown reason. Peter goes into a clinic and explains to the doctor that he has a dream were he is Spiderman and he is losing his powers. The doctor response is "maybe your not suppose to be doing those things." Peter focuses on that and has a flashback were he is talking to uncle Ben. Peter decides to be "Spiderman, no more." That story is what made this movie great, and of course the fighting scene in the train with Doc Ock.4/4</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Peter Parker is finding his life real tough, conflicted with his feelings for Mary Jane, he's also struggling at school. Add to that that his best friend is thirsting for revenge against his alter ego, and that a new breed of bad guy has been birthed, well it's a mightily challenging time.Spider-Man 2002 was a roaring success, director Sam Raimi excellently bringing the iconic web slinger to the big screen. That Spider-Man 2 met expectations is something of a stunning achievement, following on two years later from the first film, Raimi has wisely kept the same formula that made his first film so joyous. The same cast all return to cement this as a character driven franchise, so just add a new quality villain into the mix and it's all good really. Here the story is very strong, driving the picture on is Peter's struggle with his dual identity, Raimi merrily leads us along the path of his struggle whilst often hinting at what is to come, and sure enough once Doctor Octopus is born, all hell breaks loose, but because of our familiarity with all the characters, the film has gained our trust and thus the impetus hits splendidly.Raimi benefits here from having more money available and so we as the viewers get to see him weave his FX tricks, whilst great fight sequences and a more grounded bad guy both are great improvements over the first films offerings. There are also nudges aplenty to some of Raimi's other films, and fans of the Spider-Man legacy will enjoy all manner of nods in their direction. Alfred Molina is the big new addition as Dr. Otto Octavius/Doctor Octopus, he brings a sharp bit of intensity to the villain side of the persona, and although the character is never fully formed, Molina puts credible gusto into the role as we enter the final third.Fine story that is dazzlingly surrounded by quality, hell yes this is a truly great sequel. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Sam Rami Spiderman movies just seem to get better and better and I am surprised myself that I missed them when they first came out, but I guess it is because I was not really all that interested in Spiderman at the time. It was not until the third movie hit the cinemas that I decided that I would watch the other two, just so that I could at least catch up to the third one. Then again, I didn't realise that the director of Army of Darkness had actually been allowed to make these movies.This film begins with Peter Parker (Toby Maguire) struggling through life. He is trying to hold down a job, go to college, make money as a photographer, and also play Spiderman at night. Needless to say that this is a huge responsibility, even for a superhero. Not only does he have to manage his day to day activities, but at night he is out keeping the city safe from bad people. His best friend, Harry Osborne, is also trying to bring his father's company out of the pits after his father's death, and he believes that he can do this by helping fund a fusion reactor.Things don't get better though, because poor Peter has no money and no way of getting any more money, and his Aunt is looking at having her house foreclosed on, but Peter simply cannot through away his morals to get himself out of this mess. Further, the girl that he loves, Mary Jane Watson (Kurstin Dunst) looks like she is going to marry an astronaut (as well has making her move into Broadway, though Peter is finding it even more difficult to even maintain a promise to her, as she said, all Peter has become is an empty seat). If all that is bad, it gets even worse when Peter suddenly discovers that he is losing his Spider Powers, but because nobody knows that he is Spiderman (namely so that his enemies cannot use those he loves as leverage) he finds it even more difficult to get to the floor of this problem.What I really like about these films are twofold, first of all this is purely a fantasy movie. Okay, it could be considered a superhero movie, but the way that it is set out, namely that everybody that he interacts with (including the supervillians) are all connected to Peter's personal life. The Green Goblin was the father of his best friend, and Doctor Octopus is the mad scientist that Harry Osborne (Peter's best friend) is funding. Further, Peter is present when the experiment goes wrong, and Doctor Octavian becomes Doctor Octopus.The next thing I like are that the characters are well developed. They have the strengths and the weaknesses, in fact they appear to be very well rounded characters that the actors bring out really well. I guess the reason for this is that since Spiderman is evolved from a number of comic book series, it is easy to tease out the character from them (though once again it is cheaper to produce a comic book than a movie). Peter is not the rich millionaire that a lot of superheros appear to be, and though he has some very rich friends, he does not seem to rely upon them for his survival. In fact he seems to want to try and make things on his own.Then there is the fact that he is torn between the love of his friends, and his knowledge that Harry is determined to get revenge against Spiderman for the death of his father. Peter knows this, but he will not desert Harry, and also knows that he didn't actually kill Harry's father, but rather Harry's father was responsible for his own death. However I will leave the discussion of death in Spiderman for the next movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>8 limbs of awesome superhero fun!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spider-Man 2. Considered by many to be the best of the web-slinging trilogy, this movie nailed it as one of the greatest moments in the Spider-man history. Appropriately, there are about eight reasons why I love this masterpiece.Story: Peter Parker reaching a difficult time in his life (love for MJ, Aunt May's financial problems, failing Dr. Connors' class, etc.) and having to face another villain causing him to consider what life to choose is a great idea for a story. It's such an important part of his life in the comic books that it's hard not to put it in a movie.Peter/MJ Romance: Sure Spidey had other love interests in the comics, but Mary Jane stands out on top. Their love is taken to another level as both struggle to choose between love and the lives they choose, making each of them more 3-dimensional characters. This is all very subtle.Villain: Doctor-freaking-Octopus! Considered by Stan Lee himself to be one of the greatest villains of all time, Doc Ock is finally brought to life as the tentacled terror he is. Like in the comics, he starts out as a good person and someone Peter can relate to, but fate deals a tragic hand as the nuclear physicist is fused to his artificially-intelligent mechanical arms and he sets out to finish what he started by any means necessary. Spectacularly executed and the design of his arms is excellent.Action: These are some of the best action scenes I have seen in a superhero movie. Superior to the ones from the first film, the battles between these 8-legged critters literally takes you to new heights as they practically beat the living crap out of each other. AWESOME!Effects: While the effects like the CGI of the first movie were kinda obvious, this films effects are a major improvement. It almost makes me have a tricky time telling whether something is real or a computer effect and that is impressive. It all makes the action more amazing to watch.Cast: Most of the classic characters are played by a fine cast with Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, James Franco, and Alfred Molina doing excellent jobs playing their parts, even if Tobey is a little too goofy and dorky. Rosemary Harris does an even greater job here as Aunt May as she goes through a significant change in her life throughout the movie. Lastly, I absolutely enjoy J.K. Simmons as Jameson, who's just wonderfully hilarious and portrays the character perfectly.Themes: The themes are substantial. Spider-Man 2 brings another aspect of the whole great power/great responsibility, that is it is ultimately determined by how we choose to lead our lives, and this is enhanced when you're a hero or villain. This coupled with a few other themes discussed in the film brings a sense of reality to the story.Dr. Connors: Also known as the Lizard, he is my favorite Spider-man character of all time and I am so happy to see him here. LONG LIVE THE LIZARD!!! Without a doubt, this is a spectacular sequel, better than Spider-Man 1 and 3. Wanna see 8 limbs of awesome superhero fun, then this is the perfect movie for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie takes everything from the first movie: all the love, action, and super-hero from the first movie and just makes it so much better! This one was much more serious than the first one. Peter/Spider-Man has everything going wrong for him. He's losing his powers. his job, his dream girl, he's ruining his grades and the entire time you just want it all to work out for him.Without a doubt the CGI in this one is much better than the CGI in the first, but that's obviously because technology had two years to advance itself. I still don't understand how they did all the scenes with Doc Oc. Hmmm. Magical Hollywood, I guess.If you saw the first Spider-Man I would without a doubt say see this one.I already have the third one sitting next to me waiting to be watched. This one's kinda like Iron Man 2- you don't necessarily need to see the first one to get the second one, but it's still a good idea to see the first one.In other words: SEE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now this is a super-hero movie, filled with crazy action scenes, great effects, funny moments and a little cheesiness. I can't explain why I like Spider-man movies so much, I even liked the 3rd movie which I admit it wasn't very good, but it was entertaining and it even managed to be very emotional for me.Spider-man has always been my favorite super-hero. There's just something about a super-hero fighting crime, struggling to pay the bills and trying to find time to study. It certainly was a hero that revolutionized the basic concept of the rich hero which has a secret base filled with costumes, weapons, gimmicks, wheels, etc. That AND Spider-man's charisma appealed to me, he is a funny character, he wears a funny costume (not too ninja-like that's for sure) and he has awesome powers! He is not an indestructible mutant nor a green beast with infinite strength... or even a guy who bursts into flames or shoots laser-beams outta his ass! He IS a simple hero and has enough to be cool and interesting, spider powers! After all he is your friendly neighbourhood Spider-man! And by the way, the original Spider-man created a hardening, sticky liquid/glue or whatever it is called, making his own web, because in spite of his initial superhuman powers, Peter Parker was also brilliant teenager and used that great intellect to his advantage. That good analysis and perception of his also saved his ass numerous times (I confess I used to be an avid reader of the comics and follower of its never-ending story).And this movie delivers all that, it shows how great of a super-hero spider-man really is, his crazy-ass awesome villains, his cheesy jokes, his athletic and jumpy fighting style, it's all awesome to be seen! And for action fans, be it chaotic scenes, be it car chases, sword fights or fisticuffs action, there are some scenes in this movie that will for sure please all of you. Starting from the Bank robbery all the way to the train stopping, it's candy for my eyes... Spider-man vs. Dr. Octupus, one of my favorite fights in Cinema history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best Superhero Films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the second installment of the Spider-Man saga, Sam Raimi brings us one of the best comic book/superhero movies ever. I still remember how blown away I was after watching this movie in theaters after it's initial release. The action, the story, the special/visual effects...everything was spectacular and came together to create an awesome ride. Two years after the events of the first film, Peter Parker is struggling to balance his real life with his role as Spider-Man. He's unable to keep a job, failing his college courses, and ruining his friendship with longtime love Mary Jane Watson; on top of all that, his best friend obsesses over Spider-Man's role in the death of his father. Meanwhile, an experiment to create fusion by nuclear physicist Otto Octavius leaves him with four metal tentacles welded to his body and an insane desire to recreate the dangerous experiment, risking the lives of half of New York City.Where do I begin? I absolutely loved this movie. The first movie was a great film as well, but it's sequel seemed to take everything a step farther. I felt the story was better in this installment; it manages to fit in so much development but never feels overwhelming and without losing the audience in too much plot. The film concentrates on Peter's personal troubles just as much as it does the Doc Ock storyline. In fact, Doc Ock's transformation doesn't even occur until nearly 40 minutes into the film, but with so much else to absorb, it doesn't hurt the film. And once Doc Ock emerges, the movie only gets better from there with great battles and memorable moments. The hospital scene in which Doc Ock awakens is probably the best scene in the movie (and oozes with Raimi's style) and the battles between hero and villain are some of the best superhero battles created for film.Alfred Molina and the actual character of Doc Ock ranks as one of my top favorite villain performances. Raimi made Octavius and sympathetic character in the film, rather than completely evil, and Molina was a perfect fit for the role. While I was a huge fan of Willem Dafoe and his Green Goblin in the first film, I feel Molina and Doc Ock have topped him. We also get great returning performances from the key players: Maguire, Dunst, Franco, Harris, and Simmons. You can tell they've all become comfortable with the roles at this point and are grasping their characters even better than before. We're also introduced to Mr. Ditkovich (Elya Baskin), Peter's landlord, who injects some humor into the story.As you can see from my rambling, I was a huge fan of this movie and, as much as I've seen it, it never gets old. While it's not the greatest comic book adaptation out there, it definitely ranks with the best. Director Sam Raimi proves that he was meant for this franchise, embracing it and improving with the sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spidey Spins his Web</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spider-Man 2 is a rare thing, a sequel that improves on the original in almost every way. Sequels tend to jump straight into the action; the characters after all, have already been developed in the original movie. Spider-Man 2 smartly eschews this rule, allowing for almost as much character development as in the first film. The result is a truly beautiful motion picture.Spider-Man 2 begins some time after the first movie. Spider-Man's real life persona, Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is a wreck. Fired from his job, falling behind in school, unable to pay his rent and out of touch with his friends Peter struggles with the duality of being Spider-Man.Meanwhile, the brilliant Dr. Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina) is working feverishly to complete his latest project: a fusion reaction meant to provide a perpetual energy source. He conducts his project under the Oscorp Corporation, now led by Peter's best friend Harry Osborne (James Franco), who unbeknownst to Harry himself, is the son of deceased Spider-Man villain The Green Goblin. To complete the fusion, Octavius fits a set of artificially intelligent mechanical tentacles into his spine; these tentacles are prevented from controlling Octavius because of a tiny chip he has implanted into his neck. The fusion of course, goes awry, turning the respectable Octavius into the evil "Doc Ock".This sequence sets up the remainder of the movie, as Spider-Man must stop the villain from terrorizing the city, while he battles his own demons.This is where director Sam Raimi succeeds. The battles are fast-paced and shot from neat angles, with bright colours abound. An over-reliance on CGI for certain scenes can give the movie a 'cartoonish' feel, but more times than not it works well. Those scenes that further Peter's plight and his relationships with others takes up a significant amount of the movie's running time, but they never feel too long or verbose.Tobey Maguire is of course, the perfect Peter Parker. With his forlorn look and oft crackling voice, he evokes a genuine sense of pity for Peter. While I still feel that Kirsten Dunst is miscast as Mary Jane, she performs her role quite creditably. Alfred Molina is certainly quite enjoyable as the villain. Molina's Doc Ock presents a more interesting and dangerous villain than the Goblin. Making real progress since the first film is James Franco. Now freed of a peripheral role he steps nicely into the spotlight for the sequel. Further credit must be given to J.K. Simmons who plays J. Jonah Jameson. Simmons steals every scene he is in, not only because of his accurate portrayal of Jameson, but also because of his loud, unapologetic delivery of dialogue.Spider-Man 2 successfully pulls off what the Hulk tried, but was unable to do: to create a superhero film whose characters are just as exciting as the action.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After the two year wait, he finally back and better than ever. I thought this movie was a real treat for Spider-Man fans, it was excellent, with lots of energy to entertain the audience and has a few twists and turns. Better than the first, it made good progress since then, this movie is more complex and exciting than the first, so you can see a big difference when you put this movie and the first together.Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is facing more stress than ever, after two years of saving the world, life becomes more harder for him. He's been fired from his job, the newspapers says that Spider-Man is a criminal, Peter is not doing so well at school, his true love has been engaged to another man, his friendship with Harry is falling apart as Harry wants revenge on Spider-Man for killing his father and a scientist called Doctor Octavious does a fusion experiment but it leads to failure and he turns into a villain with four tentacles controlling him. This time, Peter must learn to control both of his two lives and he must find time to save the world and also try and live a normal life as a college student. But as the world needs Spider-Man's help as Doctor Octavious starts destroying and killing the city, Peter must make a choice of who he's going to be, Peter or Spider-Man...The performances, script, special effects were all amazingly brilliant. So well done.Overall, a great movie, with special effects were out-of-this-world, the performances that were outstanding, but a little work needs to be done on the plot : it needs cutting down, if it were 5 minutes shorter it would have been a masterpiece. But an enjoyable sequel and if you haven't seen it, you should!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Sequel that almost surpasses the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Peter Parker's life should be on the up. He is in love with a beautiful woman, he is at college studying exactly what he wants under a professor who understands his abilities, oh, and he also has superpowers and masquerades as a superhero. What could possibly be wrong with this perfect life, apart from everything. His best friend Harry is alienating him because he thinks Spider-man killed his father, his professor thinks he's lazy and his potential girlfriend is about to marry someone else. Everything is turning sour until he meets a scientific genius named Otto Octavius who has invented a way to make fusion energy work by creating pocket suns. However, after his experiment goes wrong with tragic consequences, the robotic spine and arms he used to help in his experiments take control of him turning him into Doctor Octopus.In this, Spider-man's second outing the storyline is based on the classic story "Spider-Man No More!" with one of the definitive comic book covers. As such this means that, for me, their is a section in this movie that dragged the first time I watched it, which is when Spidey hangs up his tights and tries to find his place in the world as Peter Parker. However on a more recent perusal of this film I had less of a problem with it, so it may be a case of it growing on you over time. The script is almost equal to the first in it's diligent attempt to get the best Spider-Man has been in the comic books and transfer it to the big screen, the actions sequences in this one and the effects by far outstrip everything in the first one and they reflect everything that was good about the comic book with Doc Oc and Spidey going at it on tall buildings looking even better than one could ever imagine it. The cast do a sterling job and Alfred Molina joins the able cast and gives a show-stealing performance as the nutty Doc Oc.The only downside I feel is that all of this great stuff does take a while to set up and because of that I have had to reduce it by a point. That said this is still one of the best superhero sequels of all time and for me what gives it that little bit extra is the look of concern on Mary Jane's face as he leaves the apartment to tackle more bad guys. It is the look of a woman fearful that she may not see the man she loves again and is played to perfection by Kirsten Dunst and really gives the ending a bittersweet feel that could have been missed by any other director, but not by the man who loves the Spider, Sam Raimi.Excellent work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spidey outdoes Spidey.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Take: Better, faster, wilder and deeper than the original. In summer movies' case, the only attempt to make a sequel better than the original is that it should be bigger and louder. The original SPIDER-MAN was everything a fan boy could want from a comic book adaptation (You tell me! I'm not exactly one of them), and the only way the sequel could be better than its predecessor is that the sequel should have bigger special effects, louder surround sound and leave everything else in between (New story? Who cares!).Same is not the case for SPIDER-MAN 2, for not only does it live up to the expectations had for it, it also outdoes and occasionally out-leaps its predecessor. Bigger special effects and louder sound abound, SPIDER-MAN 2 also holds the same sharp focus on characters and a new and different story that isn't just a blueprint for tons of new special effects director Sam Raimi has in store. The character of Peter Parker (still wonderfully played by Tobey Maguire) is more developed, showing how he balances his careers as both the web-slinging superhero and young college student Parker, who also is in desperate need for a job. Kristen Dunst returns as MJ Watson who now blends in deeper in the role. the action-packed moments come in fast, when the film reveals its new and even better villain, the semi-evil Dr. Octopus (Alfred Molina), originally Dr. Octavius, attached with self-operating mechanical arms on his body.Like the very best of summer entertainments, the special effects moments are thrilling and exciting (if you don't find the scene where Spidey tries to stop a runaway train exciting, you're probably low on sugar). But one thing about SPIDER-MAN 2 is the fact that when the moments of character development and human elements come, it doesn't disappoint. The characters are interesting and fine to sit trough, and unlike most characters in summer movies, they don't look like special effects themselves. I'm not really a fan of Sam Raimi's works, but he'll definitely get his audience when making these would-be series, and SPIDER-MAN 2 should serve as a guide on how to make the future sequels.Rating: **** out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best superhero sequel ever made?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In one of the best superhero sequels ever made, Tobey McGuire reprises his role as Peter Parker who is struggling with life's challenges, money, love and living and what's more he is losing his powers. And with more crime arising, Parker faces difficult choices concerning his personal life.Breaking the opening weekend Box Office record, the Spider-man franchise grew wider and this 2004 sequel has been described as one of the best superhero sequels ever made, and I couldn't agree more.With a much better opening to the first film, we are thrust straight into Parker's life as he tries to balance his job, his money and his university classes. Having many issues gives the film depth and is intriguing to watch each situation develop.This film is similar to the first, with a focus upon dramatic issues such as his love for Mary Jane and the loss of his Uncle Ben. There is a slight feeling of repetition but in context it is understandable and gives the characters more emotion and understanding.There is more action in this sequel, watch out for one of the best fantasy fight scenes in motion picture history, which so happens to be on a train. Excellent direction and nail biting close scenarios. There is always a question of realism but nevertheless that situation was simply outstanding.The effects are great, as you would expect and much better than the first. I'm personally not a big fan of CGI but regardless this was special and was made so by Raimi's direction.There are plenty of twists and turns in store and with the added action and more deep situations it makes the plot even more special.Though the love scenes are questionable they aren't as corny as the previous films and are enjoyable to watch. The green Goblin was a much better villain than Dr Octopus and J.K Simmons is brilliant as the newspaper boss and overall, Spiderman 2 is my favourite superhero film of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best 'Spider-man' movie of the three</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With a great story, great villain, and even more drama and action than the first 'Spider-man,' the second Spidey installment thrilled its viewers across the globe, and deservedly so.Doc Ock was a fantastic villain choice, and really is a nemesis for Spider-man. The action scenes, though heavily relied on CGI, are fantastic, and are OK on being CGI-heavy since they looked so realistic and so cool. On a personal, internal level, Peter Parker accepts who he needs to be as a superhero, rather than shunning the responsibilities that he has been given.Mary Jane is torn between two men, a recently-returned astronaut and Pete. Her fateful decision at film's end directly follows Pete's exciting last encounter with Doc Ock.'Spider-man 2' is definitely one of the three best superhero movies of all time, and arguably the best. 3.5 stars/4</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cool movie ! from l3ad BOy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is why they invented movies. It's a dazzling story of love, loss, adventure, courage, heartbreak, tough choices, and tender feelings with a rescue from a burning building, a runaway train, a world-class villain, and a really great kiss. It is smart and funny and touching and exhilaratingly entertaining. S2 has sensational special effects integrated with a first-rate script and outstanding performances to illuminate the characters and tell the story -- and to show us something about ourselves. But most of all, this is why they invented movies because director Sam Raimi knows how to make things MOVE.Few movies have so mastered motion. Spider-Man (Tobey Maguire) swoops through the skyscrapers. A train hurtles across a track that just abruptly stops. A car flies through the air. Raimi is all but re-inventing cinematic story-telling before our delighted eyes.In the first movie, we saw Peter Parker's joy in the powers he developed after being bitten by a radio-active spider. When his Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson) was killed because he failed to stop a thief, he resolved to devote his life to help people. And that meant no close attachments because anyone he cared about would be vulnerable to attack by bad guys who wanted to pressure him.As this movie opens, things are not going well for Peter. Even his Spidey powers can't get those pizzas delivered by the 30-minute deadline when there are people to save along the way. Aunt May's application for a loan to save her mortgage from being foreclosed has been turned down. He is having trouble in school because he doesn't have time to do the work. His best friend Harry (James Franco) is still angry because Peter won't tell him what really happened the night Spider-Man killed his father. Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst), the girl he loves, is giving up on him because he can't tell her who he really is or how he really feels. He can't even do a load of laundry without making things worse. That Spider-man suit chafes. Spidey can't even sling those webs the way he used to. The last hors d'oeuvre at the party is always snatched away just as he reaches for it. Maybe it's time to quit.Harry introduces Peter to the brilliant scientist, Dr. Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina), whose devotions to his wife and his work are inspiring. Harry is financing the doctor's experiments with fusion energy, so complex and dangerous that they must be conducted with tentacle-like mechanical arms that are controlled by artificial intelligence. But in the grand hubris tradition of myths and comic books, the experiment goes terribly, tragically wrong and the doctor's wife is killed. The four artificial arms are fused to Octavius' spine. Devastated by the loss and overtaken by the arms which move like serpents in the garden of Eden, he becomes a villain known as Doc Ock, stealing what he needs to resume his experiments.But Harry controls one of those ingredients, and he says he will give it to Doc Ock in exchange for Spider-Man. Molina is brilliant in both incarnations. His kind Doctor Octavius has a glimmer of benign madness. And his Doc Ock shows us the tortured soul that cannot help being thrilled by power. The weakest part of the first movie was the villain, with his dopey mask and over-the-top monologue. But Molina's Doc Ock is a villain for the ages, a man who shows us his real face so we can feel the struggle for his soul.The comic book elements are all here, with spectacular fight scenes and teen-friendly existential themes. Peter has to struggle with feelings of isolation and not being understood or appreciated. He is aware of the irony of his working for justice for others when his own life is filled with people who judge him unfairly.One of the screenwriters was Michael Chabon, who wrote a Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about comic book creators called The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier &amp; Clay, and his rich appreciation for the mythic appeal of the comic book tradition brings depth to the story. Spider-Man and Doc Ock have many parallels. Both were granted extraordinary powers through mutations caused by accidents in scientific experiments. Both struggle with their alternate identities, represented in visual terms by frequent use of reflections. Both struggle with devastating losses. In a nice moment that gently underlines and broadens what is going on with the characters, Peter watches Mary Jane perform in a production of The Importance of Being Earnest in a scene where Cecily talks to Algernon about his pretending to be someone he is not. And a street musician sings the Spider-Man song, at first a little tentatively and off-key but then, as Spidey re-discovers who he is, with more assurance, hitting the right notes.This is a sumptuous summer treat that succeeds on many levels. It is that rarest of treats, a popcorn pleasure with heart, soul, and insight.Families who enjoy this movie may also enjoy the original Spider-Man and other comic book movies like Superman and Batman. Adult viewers may enjoy Wonder Boys, another Michael Chabon movie starring Maguire.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Superhero Film Ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two years have passed for Peter Parker, established in his role as college student...and as a crime fighter. He can't keep up at school, pay his rent or make amends with his estranged best friend Harry, who wants Spider-Man dead. Mary Jane is more skeptical than ever of the man in her life. Peter's idol, a renowned scientist named Otto Octavius, resurfaces following a failed fusion experiment. Peter, at times noticing he's losing some of his powers, and is feeling the effects of the stress in his personal life, realizes he must decide between being who he once was or retaining his secret identity to stop "Doc Ock" and save New York City.From a disappointment from the first film of this series, I was quite relieved that this film is not only a lot better, it's the best superhero film ever made! There are much more love for the characters in here and the character development. There is also an emotional core throughout the entire film and it's not your regular superhero film.There's a lot of drama in this film, not only from Peter choosing a life to take, but he also has to beat the bad guy, and tries to tell Mary Jane that he loves her. I mean, it's not all about the action in here. The action sequences are much bigger and better in this film with nice CGI to top some of the most exhilarating action sequences.Tobey Maguire's acting is better, as well as Kirsten Dunst and Rosemary Harris. The villain, played by Alfred Molina, also does a very good job playing a creepy antagonist. There's one scene with him in it that was filled with tension, like a horror movie. Again, the score is also fantastic.This is the best superhero film ever made! It gives you the fantastic characters, great action sequences, it's emotional, suspenseful, and exhilarating as an entertaining film! This is THE MOVIE, if you're a comic book fan so see it, whether or not you're a fan of Spider-Man!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enter Dr. Octopus!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have never been a big fan of the first Spider-Man movie, but I have to agree that its sequels, especially 'Spider-Man 3' have finally won me over. I've been a Spider-Man fan for a rather long time, but the Green Goblin has always been, to me at least, the lamest villains in Spider-Man's villains galore. Dr. Octopus isn't really the coolest one in the bunch either, but growing up I kinda liked him and his movie incarnation presented a nice multi-level character.The second Spider-Man has the convincing CGI effects but is also miles more interesting and comedy-packed than its predecessor, which is why I liked it so much. Though some parts of it are borderline cheesy there's enough to keep the film grounded.Only the middle-part of the film seemed horridly stretched out and a little boring though its nice to present Spider-Man having problems. I also wasn't irked by the revelation of his identity to a number of individuals, but in some places the film just seemed to lose its pace at times.However, the film undoubtedly has all the right ingredients of a great film. It doesn't compare to Spider-Man 3 in terms of plot, but it definitely has a memorable cast and is in most ways superior to the first one. Definitely recommendable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Enjoyed It Even After The Tenth Viewing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is no need to say that the first Spiderman movie exceeded all expectations from the audience worldwide,and I could not rest till I had the DVD of the film in my possession. One would have thought that this was as far as Hollywood could go ,but 'Spiderman 2' left me speechless. First and foremost,who would think that Sam Raimi could outdo his previous effort,given the fact that most of us were already stunned by the 'Evil Dead' director's first venture into the comic-book genre ? This film completely eclipses the first instalment ,and I'll elaborate on why .There is a new villain in the shape of Dr. Otto Octavius,(played very well by Alfred Molina)who turns into 'Doc Oc', a steely-armed monster bent on world domination.There is also a strong possibility of Mary-Jane- played by one of my favorite actresses,the lovely,talented Kirsten Dunst, ultimately getting together with Peter,that is the incredibly expressive Tobey Maguire.I do not imagine any other duo that could have ignited the screen when Spider-man is NOT in action as these two do.If another remake of Romeo and Juliet were to be made now,I'd say these two actors would turn it into a worldwide blockbuster .It is undeniable that the on-screen chemistry between Dunst and Maguire contributes tremendously to the way the film absorbs all your attention.Rosemary Harris is as convincing as she was the last time we saw her as the adorable Aunt May. The screenplay has a lot more humor in it,and the funny situations are guaranteed to leave audiences in splits all over the world. But in the end it is John Dykstra who makes the film into what it is- a breath-taking thrill-ride aided by mind-blowing special effects.The scenes between Spider-man and Doc Oc are unbelievably 'real' in a way that makes the first film look more like a rough draft of this one ! Dykstra uses every possible scenario to make his character achieve the impossible,and the images stay in your mind long after the film is over. I wrote this review after watching it for the tenth time,so you can guess just how much I liked it.I am sure that this is true not only for me,but for the millions who saw it as well.' Spider-man 3' will hit theaters next year,and most probably it will eclipse the second movie. Because Sam Raimi has proved beyond doubt that his days of churning out second-rate trash are completely over,and I thank him for that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I cannot even begin to tell you how much I loved this movie. When I first watched it, I was a little wary of what to expect. The first Spiderman movie had been simply phenomenal, truly a tough act to follow. And yet this movie surpassed all of my expectations. The plot line was amazing and much better than the first. The character's are developed very well and you can actually feel some of the pain Peter Parker feels. His abilities truly are his gift and his curse. Mary Jane's character seems less flaky in this one also; she seemed to have really grown up since where the last one left off. James Franco did a wonderful job in his portrayal of Harry Osbourne. He seems aloof, arrogant and vulnerable at the same time. He too is in pain upon finding out that it was his best friend, the person he loved like a brother, who had killed his father. The ending sets up Spiderman 3 perfectly, with Harry discovering his father's alter ego as the Green Goblin. My only complaint was that Peter and Mary Jane actually decided to be together at the end of this one. And that Mary Jane found out Peter's secret so early on in the series. Where was Gwen Stacy, Felicia hardy, Betty Brant? Sure, Mary Jane is Perter's main love, but she's not his only love. But even this isn't much of a negative, considering it only adds to Peter's image as an outcast and it proves that he truly does love Mary Jane. This is a definite must see for all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have only just watch this movie. And its one of those movies that makes you look at yourself. Its thats good. The Cgi effects aren't over the top, its well integrated within this movie. I like this movie better then the first movie, as the story is even stronger.It gave us the chance to see what being a superhero really must be like. Everything is put on hold for Spiderman.I think Spiderman is the real reason why Marvel Comics enjoyed so much success. But I still like the X-men.The are different plots and lines within the movie that make it worth while watching throughout the film.Mary Jane - and her agonising choice between her choice and Peter Parker.Peter Parker and his relationship with his boss, Mr Jonah Jameson.The flash back conversation between Peter Parker and his Uncle.His relationship between Peter Parker and his best friend.A real good movie, that really shows how Peter Parker came over many of the hurdles mentioned above.The action is first class as well. I think that the best shots are still with him Webslinging his way throughout New York. It looks fantastic.Please let have Spiderman 8. Please don't finish off this wonderful Superhero character....If you read the stories of Spiderman you will realise that he has many, many stories that can be used......If you are reading this Hollywood take note.This is one of the finest Superhero movies ever made. Well Done Hollywood.Carl Brown - Ipswich, England carl@garage-music.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>great film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not sure why this movie has been getting such harsh criticism, as die hard spidey-fans and those who know nothing of the world-of-tights both find this movie great entertainment. Most of the critiques seem to come from individuals who have never read a comic book or watched a cartoon dealing with our friendly neighborhood spider-man, and shouldn't be taken seriously. Some of these "die hard" movie reviewers seemed to be under the impression that spider-man was just a ordinary guy, like Batman. I believe someone was asking how spider-man can lift a 2 ton piece of debris and implying that the movie was too unrealistic. OK......for those that don't know already....this is a movie about a boy bitten by a radioactive spider, who then develops the proportionate speed, strength and agility of said spider. If your looking for realism, go watch Clerks. The film does a pretty remarkable job of keep within the confines of the marvell universe, and if anything, they actually made the spider-man character weaker than his comic counterpart (as he can lift/press over 10 tons). It's a fun movie, and seems to be equally enjoyed by people from all age groups. Definitely worth watching, at least once.</fullReview>

But i loved it with its fantastic special effects ,great action scenes, great super villain, great super hero great acting and a dash of humour. Something for everyone even my grandma sat there enjoying every single minute of it. After the film finished i came out of the cinema thinking WOW what a great film i wanted it on DVD when it first came out i didn't get it then and i still haven't got it but i saw it at the Imax and that was the ultimate experience. 10/10 a must for fans of the first or if you're bored and need something to entertain you.

		<fullReview>This movie starts off right where the first one left off. Peter Parker continues saving people as Spider-Man, however the misunderstood Doctor Otto Octavius, a.k.a. Doc Oc is standing in his way and is backed by Harry Osbourne, who is still extremely mad at Spider-Man for killing his father, Norman.Peter faces all the hardships of a superhero, watching Mary Jane off with Jonah Jameson's son, John and watching his best friend Harry Osbourne drink himself into a frenzy. Eventually he has a tough choice to make; stop being Spider-Man and live a normal life while the city crime rates soar, or continue as Spider-Man and watch his social life go down the toilet. Doc Oc also looms in the wake, attempting an experiment that could destroy th city. More than one secrets are revealed and those secrets and who they are revealed to may surprise you.Definitely a great performance by Toby McGuire and Kirsten Dunst and solid directing job by Sam Raimi. The special effects are very good and they do an excellent job during the fight scenes. Great all-around movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just came back from the theatre after watching this movie and i thought it was great. Despite of the unimpressive acting, this movies grasps the attention of the audience because of its great special effects and stylized action. The script wasn't that good but it wasn't bad aswell. I think this is the greatest comic book that has been made into a movie. Sam Raimi did a great job making the sequel. I think the direction was perfect. This movie is also a bit hilarious. Like the scene in the elevator. Tobey Mcguire acted well being Peter Parker. I think Kirsten Dunst should not be in the third part. She acts pathetically.I gave this movie 10/10 and I think it deserves to be in the top 250 movies of IMDb. I recommend this movie to everyone who loved the first part. Don't wait for its DVD. Go to the theaters and watch it. I think that this movie is worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sequel, Shmequel. This one tops the first in every area.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sequels. Who needs them? Who wants them? I hate them, most of the time. Most of the time, the sequel ruins what made the first one so great. Take the Superman movies. First one, GREAT! After that, it was all down hill. Batman is another perfect example. The change in actors playing Batman/Bruce Wayne, along with the slide into fantasy instead of realism ruined the Dark Realism of the first two. Along comes Spiderman. It had a top notch story, top notch actors, and top notch plot. Although the Green Goblin costume looked too much like a kid's Halloween costume and Willem Dafoe's dialogue was a bit over the top. Okay, that's an understatement, it was way over the top. The visuals of the first were mediocre at best, to the point where you could tell what was real and fake. Still, I wondered, how could they top it? It was still superb for a comic movie. Then I see the teaser for Spiderman 2....Made me feel all tingly inside. Then the trailer. I must say, I was salivating at the mouth. Then it came. I couldn't get any better than the midnight showing of the premiere! On the Edge of my seat before the movie even began. I know, I know. I am such a dork. The intro was great. I loved the Alex Ross drawings portraying some of the important plot points of the first movie, to remind us of how Spiderman came to be. From beginning to end, this movie had me laughing, crying, cheering, and just about any other emotion you could think of. The story was amazing. For those of you who think it was a rehash of the first stories theme, yes it was, and no it wasn't. First of all, yes it was about great responsibility coming with great power, but it is also so much more. It's about being able to balance his responsibility with his life. To borrow a Christian theme, it's about serving two masters. Either God or Money, and the struggle to decide which of the two to serve. Of course, the best part of the movie is in it's heart. The action is great, but it's the vulnerable parts that really shine, like the scene where Peter reveals a secret long kept hidden to Aunt May. The writers were so much more confident in their abilities when it came to the script dialogue, and except for one instance, everything flows perfectly. The only part that feels forced into the movie is Aunt May's speech about Heroes. The acting was so much better this time around too. You really feel the struggle going on inside of Peter Parker/Tobey Maguire, and I still can't think of anybody who could play the part better. He really makes you see the struggle, the pain going on inside, and he's more sure of his ability as an actor. Kristen Dunst plays the beautiful Mary Jane like no other, still making us love her even more, and ends the movie perfectly with one statement. You can't find a better Doc Ock either. Alfred Molina really brought substance to the part, and since their is no mask to hide behind, you can see the struggle between good and evil within his face. Though, a couple of the bits of dialogue were a bit overacted. The visuals are ten times better than those in the first. Doc Ock's arms move so realistically that you'd never believe they were real puppets and not CG. Spiderman looks even more realistic than ever. His motion is so much more fluid than the in the first movie and he doesn't look all rubbery. Sam Raimi, I tip my hat off to you for perfecting Spiderman. I had my worries about you when the first one hit, but you've got my confidence that you can do it, and do it right. I have only one question for you. How can you top this one? This movie is one of those movies that everybody can enjoy and for those who don't agree with me, here's webbing in your face.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is it any wonder he's stilled billed as 'amazing'?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I heard a sequel was being made to the original Spider-Man movie, I admit that I had my doubts as to whether it could be pulled off. Sure, Raimi and co. did a great job with the first movie, creating not only a faithful comic book adaptation, but a great movie in its own right, but the usual 'sequel issue' looms into view: a well done and successful movie is made, but then the sequel is rushed out a year or two later which turns out to be less than successful, and the entire series is remembered on a bad note. I liked the idea of a Spider-Man 2, but I didn't want it to ruin the memory of the original. Turns out I had nothing to worry about at all.Raimi bestows upon us a masterpiece, easily equaling if not surpassing the first in quality and enjoyability. Unlike most sequels, which turn out with a very shabby plot, attempted to be covered up by stuffing in as much action as they possibly can, we actually spend more time with Peter Parker out of costume than behind the mask of Spider-Man. These long sequences spent with Peter Parker's friends and family as he struggles to solve his various personal problems risk losing our attention, but fortunately, Spider-Man will rush out to beat on some criminals at just the right moment to keep us interested.Raimi himself uses the directorial freedom granted by a sequel to allow his quirky sense of humour to permeate the film much more visibly than in the first movie. He uses techniques such as having the scene go entirely black except for the eye of Spider-Man's costume as a scene transition, or having the camera perform a dissolve effect, representing Doc Ock's progressing insanity. Such liberties you can't usually get away with in a movie, but Raimi finds a way to make them work. However, the main problem I had with Spider-Man 2 is that the 'slow scenes' drag on far too long. Far too much time is devoted to nothing but Peter Parker walking along the street, or running with a determined look on his face, without even any dialogue. I think these parts should have been edited down to about a quarter of their length, to decrease the likelihood of them appearing boring, unnecessary and out of place.The visual effects are much improved - Spidey looks and moves better than ever! And the addition of Dr Octopus and his four metal tentacles to the script gives the FX people plenty to play around with. The tentacles were apparently part puppetry and part CGI, but however they did it, the tentacles looked and acted excellent. This also opened up an opportunity for much more intense fight scenes than in the first movie, with Doc Ock and Spidey crawling up and down the walls, bashing at each other all the while.Unlike the Batman series, which threw in new actors every time, destroying any sense of continuity, all the principal actors from the first film return to play their characters once more. As the man behind the mask (for part of the time anyway) Tobey Maguire gives another solid performance. (in spite of what British Tabloids have to say about him out of character) He offers a lot more insight into the character of Peter Parker, and the motives that drive him. Kirsten Dunst gives a decent performance as Mary-Jane Watson, but she seems bored in her role, as if she would rather be just about anywhere else at the time, which doesn't help us realize what it is about her that makes Peter love her so. J.K. Simmons, however, gives another enthusiastic performance as the wonderfully horrible J. Jonah Jameson, number one tormentor in Peter Parker's dual life. Noticeable improvements can be seen in the performances of James Franco and Rosemary Harris. Harris as Peter's kindly Aunt May breathes a lot more life into her character this time round as the sole parental figure in Parker's life, ultimately becoming his inspiration for continuing to be Spider-Man.Franco has a real mess of a character to handle in Harry Osborn. Consumed by a lust for vengeance upon Spider-Man, who he believes murdered his father, and trying to take up his father's mantle at the family company, Oscorp, Harry is, whether he realizes it or not, becoming an exact copy of his father. This becomes more clear by the end of the movie. (you'll have to see it for yourself to figure out how) Franco conveys all these emotions convincingly, contrary to the shallow job he did on the first movie. It's good to see him improving as an actor. However, the show stealing performance has to go to Alfred Molina as multi-armed super villain Dr. Octopus. Molina does a spectacular job, perfectly inhabiting the complex character of Otto Octavius. What could have been a campy performance by someone else is a heartfelt and charismatic one in the hands of Molina. By spending some time with Otto and his wife and sensing the love that resonates between them, we know that he isn't really evil - just driven and determined that his 'dream for mankind' will succeed. It's just a darned shame that it seems like his character was stuffed into the script at the last moment just so Spider-Man has somebody to bash about, but fortunately, Molina's performance helps us forget this. Visually, he fits the part perfectly, looking like he just stepped out of the pages of a comic book, and his evil little smile was truly chilling! Molina put everything he had into the part to great effect: indeed, he lived, breathed and died Doc Ock. All in all, the Spidey folks throw us a well thought out and very successful sequel. All I can say is 'Bring on round three!'-9.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this is an excellent piece of film making. it will do to films what star wars and superman did. It is revolutionary in the way it uses special effects.Spiderman flies faster than ever, and you cannot tell which is computer generated. It is unlike anything ever seen before. The other special effects are amazing. They are so fluid and detailed, that they just blend into the scene. Some of the scenes are brilliantly thought out and grip you to the edge of your seat. aside from the visuals and sound, its an excellent film for the family. Its both humorous, serious and romantic. All wonderfully blended in to create a tru blockbuster.This version is superior to the first in all aspects and sets the landmark for future movies. Hollywood has created a most incredible world and presents in a glorious way. I felt very privileged to experience the genius of the film. Great way to spend two hours, or even better to have on DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It is not the typical sequel, it actually makes you forget that there was a part 1 of Spider-Man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spider-Man 2 is the best movie this year so far. The last time I saw a movie this good was last year when I went to watch Finding Nemo. As a matter of fact, Spider-Man 2 beats ALL superhero movies of this decade and the 90s. To be more specific, the last time a superhero movie was done so well is the instant classic Batman, and SM2 even outperforms that movie at certain times. Spider-Man 2 improved on the original in every way possible, it took the formula that made the first one a hit and tweaked on it much more to create a masterpiece of writing, acting, and special effects. So much happens in this movie, there was never a dull moment, and most of the time, you will be at the edge of your seat. Derived from a clever and very strong plot, a whole lot happens in the movie. The plot includes the fact that Harry Osborn is still hunting after Spider-Man, and also investing money in one of Dr. Otto Octavius's experiments, who turns out to be the main villain in the movie. Meanwhile, Mary Jane is being a successful model and is also an actress that is getting angrier and angrier at the fact that she can barely see Peter Parker. Not only that, but Mary Jane is also planning on getting married to an astronaut. In the meantime, Peter Parker continues struggling mixing his day life with his two friends and his aunt, with his nightlife as Spider-Man. So much happens, you wonder how all this manages to fit into just 125 minutes. This plot is the reason why the movie stays fresh and exciting throughout the entire time. Spider-Man 2 has much more humor the 2nd time around, much more romance and tear-jerking moments, more action, and much more moments that would make you jump out of your seat. The funniest character in the movie is Peter Parker's boss, which is the bossy, mean, not-too-smart, manipulative and just plain awful J. Jonah Jameson. The standout funny scenes in the movie are any scene with Jameson and also a hysterical scene in an elevator involving Spider-Man and a stranger. Mary Jane and Harry, despite still being major roles in Peter Parker's life, are not around as much in the movie, but they are in many major scenes anyway.The acting was excellent; everyone did his or her part wonderfully. Tobey Maguire did a good job as the strong yet tired and vulnerable Peter Parker/Spider-Man. Kirsten Dunst played the beautiful Mary Jane with plenty of emotion and James Franco does the angry and unsure Henry Osborn. J.K. Simmons gives perhaps the best performance of the movie as J. Jonah Jameson. The main villain (Awesome performance by Alfred Molina), even though gets less screen time than The Green Goblin from the original Spider-Man, offers up a lot more scares and a couple of awesome fights against Spider-Man. The Green Goblin had 3 fights against Spider-Man, two minor, and one major. Dr. Otto has three fights against Spider-Man, 2 of them phenomenally awesome fights, and one smaller and shorter fight. One last note, I must applaud in Rosemary Harris's wonderful performance as Aunt May.The fight scenes were much, much, much, much better the second time around. The fights are not only longer, but have much more action, much more awe-inspiring little moments in the fight, and are in a much larger range. What I mean by the range is that the fight takes a lot more room, a lot more space. While the fights in the original Spider-Man are in a building or a burning apartment, the fights in the sequel take place at first in a bank and then goes up to a huge building, and then the best fight of all involves the top of a clock tower, and then heads on to a runaway train [Which is the best fight I have seen in years, I may add]. What separates this superhero movie from the other superhero movies is that it does an awesome job of mixing the romance, comedy, action, and jaw-dropping moments so that it appeals to every single person wanting to watch it. The ending reveals so much; I cannot really discuss much about it. In some parts it will shock you, in some parts it may disappoint, and last of all, it keeps you asking for more, hours after the movie is finished. It was fantastic, in my opinion, and it will appeal to a lot more people than the original. The sequel stays very close to its comic book roots and does an excellent job with the special effects. Bottom Line: Fantastic movie. Despite perhaps the ending at one point, which I should not reveal much of, this movie will not disappoint at all. It was truly worth all the hype, and is the most exciting, most rewarding, and funniest, and best movie of the year. It was more action packed than all action films out now, it is funnier than most comedies out this decade [cough*Shrek 2*cough], and because of the great close-ups and brilliant acting, I find this one of the more emotionally-moving films out there today. I was impressed, and I am waiting for part 3 already. The only thing that part 1 has the advantage of is perhaps the villain, I really did enjoy seeing the Green Goblin, but besides that, the original is nothing compared to this. Go see Spider-Man 2, now, it is a crime to not watch and experience this movie. Final Score: 9.5 /10 [A]</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Review of SPIDER-MAN 2by STEVEN BAILEYThere are some "popcorn movies" that transcend their origins andjust become great movies--"North by Northwest," "Raiders of theLost Ark."Add "Spider-Man 2" to the list.There's no good reason that a film about a guy with the dubioustalent for traveling by web should be one of the most touchingmovies around. But darned if I wasn't near tears by movie's end.For that, kudos to director Sam Raimi, who found the same"realistic" tone in the first "Spider-Man" and extends it here. Thecharacters seem like clichs--the clumsy kid turned super-hero,the erstwhile girlfriend, the doting aunt. But thanks to heartfeltencore performances from Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, andRosemary Harris, they're more believable than those in more"earthbound" movies I've seen this year.Of course, some viewers don't go to "Spider-Man" movies forcharacter depth, and action fans won't be disappointed here either.Alfred Molina, whom I've always found hammy, here has perfectpitch as Dr. Octavius--at first friendly and caring to Peter Parker(Spidey's daily alter-ego), then downright operatic in his revengewhen his planned scientific breakthrough goes wrong and turnshim into a kind of octopus-robot. But the movie spends an unusual amount of time letting us get toknow its characters, so that viewers truly have a stake in thehigh-powered action scenes. (Warning: Those scenes might bevery tough sledding for younger viewers. But if you've seen"Spider-Man 1," you know what you're in for anyway.)Out of a flawless cast, I end by singling out thoroughly winningKirsten Dunst as M.J., Peter/Spidey's love interest. Her dreamy,sunny face grounds the story in happy normalcy. And her finalscene tops even "S1's" much-ballyhooed kiss.This movie has it all. Go.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Spider-Man Will Ever Get On The Big Screen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I'm writing this in 2014, and we've seen a plethora of "Spider-Man" in various media over the last couple of years. it's hard to believe this sequel improved so much of what was arguably a really solid first instalment. "Spider-Man 2" remains me &amp; my fathers personal favourite. Already as soon as the opening credits began, they recap everything so far with illustrations by comic book icon Alex Ross. It all feels like natural progression, showing signs that we were in for something very unique.First off I need to say Alfred Molina as Doctor Octopus was incredible. For as silly the villain may look in print, the mind behind the character is what always made him interesting and they play their cards right by making him a victim of tragedy more than a evil genius. Of course his motivations to prove himself and his life's work will doom us all, but some homespun (Heh.) wisdom will ultimately make him see the right his errors. It's a great performance, and seeing as how comic book movies are becoming more popular every year. I'm sure we'll see the character return someday. Mr. Molina has set the standard considerably.Before I finally get to the Peter Parker portion of the movie, lets go over the supporting cast. James Franco finally has more to work with this time, and generally comes off maleficent. Kirsten Dunst's performance like the first one is likable, but the character still has yet to really do anything rather than be the object of the heroes desire and development for the character throughout the movie pretty much remains just that. Except for the end, which is more or less sweet. Finally what must be mentioned is Rosemary Harris's performance as Aunt May, which is wonderful and explains some of the highlights and themes of the original Sam Raimi trilogy. As much as Peter will have to learn for himself, she is the one who will always rest his mind over the guilt he suffers and teaches him the advice that will guide him throughout life's choices.Tobey Maguire finally gets to show the side of Spider-Man I wanted to see. The famous issue where Spider-Man leaves his costume in the trash is iconic, and works well in the films narrative structure of choices and sacrifice. Just reflecting the movie now as a whole there are only a few problems I see in the picture, that seem to be immediately forgiven amongst some very impressive action sequences. All of which remain unique &amp; fantastic, whilst The quiet moments of self reflection are boosted by Danny Elfman's solemn score.Final Verdict: I think Spider-Man 2 is the best in the series, and best reflects what makes the icon so beloved by many. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fantastic film that rivals the best comic book films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was the second Spider Man film and after the original's huge success this film had to deliver and I believe it really did. This film starts off with Peter Parker enjoying his life as Spider Man but because of problems from the past movies and a new super villain created it tests him to his limits. Now I believe Tobey Maguire is a great Peter Parker/Spider Man and this is the film where he truly gives his best performance as the character as you truly feel sorry for his character at points and also that he is up for the responsibility. In all three films I do not like Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane she just seems annoying and selfish and in real life I would never be interested in her and she just seems like an annoyance to Peter. I do like James Franco as Harry Osborne in this film as his character goes through a lot and changes throughout but the best performances are by Alfred Molina as Doc Ock and JK Simmons as J Jonah Jameson. I do not see Jk as anything other then this role because he is an absolute show stealer in every film in the trilogy. Whereas, Doc Ock is my favourite villain out of the films because Molina truly shows this twisted character that isn't truly evil but still a threat. The Story makes logical sense from the past film and even though this film has a few story arcs they all are good and well executed. The script is good overall but is quite cheesy throughout and the cheesiness of this film and the slow pace is what stops it from being an epic film. The style is fantastic and it looks marvellous as it truly should which adds to the overall quality. Overall this is the best Spider Man film ever and will take some beating.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best of the genre, and of the best movies of all time. For me anyway...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spider-Man 2 by Sam Raimi has been one of my all time favorites ever since I saw it when it came out nearly 10 years ago. At the time, the comic book film genre had regained momentum after Spider-Man (2002), and Bryan Singer's first two X-Men films, and this is one of those comic book films that not only has the great spectacle, it also has a compelling story, interesting/well realized characters that you can care for and a deep emotional core where it shows you the psyche of the protagonist who's journey we're going on. I've been a Spidey fan ever since I saw the 2002 film when it opened and having read some of the comics, I can say that this movie is the one that not only gets Spider-Man right on the mark, but allows us to understand him by (as the late Roger Ebert describes) giving full attention to the dilemma of Peter Parker.Peter Parker, two years into his career as a crime fighter is having trouble balancing his two lives since being the hero takes up a great deal of his personal time, causing everybody to decide he isn't reliable. He's messing up in his job, he's failing his classes in school and he tries to be there for Mary Jane but disappoints her by not showing up at her play, which reinforces the idea that he can't be counted on. And as Spider-Man, he's viewed as a menace to NYC and is always painted as the bad guy by the Bugle. After awhile, his powers start fading away and he realizes that he's gained nothing from all the good he's done and he gives up being Spider-Man in order to live a normal life. While his personal life does improve a great deal, he still feels the need to help other people and is eventually drawn back into the fight when Doc Ock shows up as the city's new nemesis. Since the story was mostly inspired by one of the most famous Spider-Man story lines from the comics, "Spider-Man No More!" Alvin Sargent's adaptation of that story does a great job of showing Peter weighing the good the bad and the ugly of balancing two lives and how he ultimately decides to be the hero in the end. While occasionally, it gets a tad cheesy, the film remembers to take itself seriously and also have fun with the characters.The haters can say what they want about Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker/Spider-Man, but I've always thought his performance in the leading role is pretty damn great considering he's given a deeper fleshed out character and along with Alvin Sargent's screenplay and Sam Raimi's direction he does a great job of making the character someone you can relate to and sympathize with as we see the journey he goes on throughout the film. Alfred Molina is perfect as Doc Ock, and giving us a relatable bad guy unlike his comic book counterpart who was just a plain old evil villain. Dare I say it, but I would put Alfred Molina's Doc Ock up with Heath Ledger's Joker, Tom Hiddleston's Loki and Tom Hardy's Bane as one of the best villains ever put into a comic book movie, or even a movie in general. James Franco gives a commendable performance as Harry Osborn (even though we know how his story turns out in SM3, it's still cool to see him end up in the Goblin lair), and I don't care what anybody says but I thought Kirsten Dunst made a good Mary Jane. I know a lot of people hate her and I don't think she's the best Mary Jane ever but I appreciate her portrayal of the character and I do like her in this film even though she does come off as a bitch at times, for instance when she leaves John Jameson at the altar. But at the same time, I do like how she makes the choice to be with Peter in the end, and that scene gets me every time. Rosemary Harris is terrific as Aunt May (I love the scene where she teaches Peter about being the hero), JK Simmons is PERFECT as Jonah Jameson, and everybody else does commendable work.The action scenes are a blast to watch, even 10 years later. Sam Raimi I believe is a master of directing action, and the bank heist and train fight show that Spider-Man is a character that belongs on the big screen. I don't mean to compare to ASM 2, but whereas that film overused CGI in it's action scenes, the special effects team Raimi hired for this film were able to perfectly blend the practical stunts and CGI effects. And once again the score by Danny Elfman is fantastic. The only thing I didn't really care for was the hospital scene where Octavius kills the doctors with his tentacles. I know that it's Sam Raimi's throwback to his days on "Evil Dead" (which I've never seen), but I find it to be a bit disturbing.It puzzles me as to why so many people call this a terrible movie due to the reboot being released so soon. Granted, everybody's entitled to their opinion but unfortunately we live in a society where people jump on the bandwagon to hate on things that are good. The ASM franchise unfortunately has only reinforced this mindset, but that's another review. But at the end of the day, this is in my opinion not only the best Spider-Man movie, one of the best in the comic book film genre, it's one of my favorite movies of all time. It's got a compelling story, well realized/interesting characters, thrilling action and a film that perfectly captures the core of the character. If you're a comic book fan, a Spider-Man fan, a film buff in general, etc. I promise that you won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hey what can I expect his a cool guy who can kick butt and save the day. So alright what is Spiderman 2 about well its a sequel to the 2002 hit and it tells the tale of Peter who is still in love with Mary Jane Watson(Kirsten Dunst),the problem is whoever she is seeing someone else and forgetting about Peter Parker from the 1st movie as he didn't feel the same way about her.Meanwhile Peter's best friend Harry Osborn(James Franco) is seeking revenge from the death of his father who was killed in Spiderman 1 and since then he wants to get his hands on Peter Parker.But wait you may ask who the villain is? Well the villain in this film is Dr Ocatavius(Alfred Molina)who is coming up with a new project that goes horribly wrong and it tragically kills his wife(Donna Murphy who yes folks is Mother Gothel from Tangled hilarious). So its up to Peter/Spiderman to save the town of NYC against the new nemesis. So what do I think of it?I actually enjoyed this movie as it had some terrific special effects,and the story as great along with the charcthers.The setting was excellent I swear if they re-release this in 3D i'd say it would make the film 10 times better than in Non 3D format. My only complaint however is Mary Jane Watson aka Kirsten Dunst. She is a great actress don't get me wrong but here she's always whining,always moaning and she just WON'T make up her BLOODY mind as to whether or not she loves Peter or not.But she gets worse in Spiderman 3.Overall im giving it an 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A far more superior follow-up to the first!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seeing as how Spider-Man became a huge success, Sam Raimi decided to make a sequel in order to capture the spirit that made the first film a huge critical hit and two years later, in 2004, he succeeded, but not only that. This film takes everything from the first spider-man and transfered and transforms itself into a far more superior follow-up! While the first spider-man wasn't a masterpiece due to it's clunky editing and corny dialog, this film has absolutely no flaws at all.The story is much more compelling than the first, the visuals are fantastically made, the pacing is wonderfully brisk, the special effects are top-notch, and the music score from Danny Elfman is as better as ever with some atmospheric moments throughout this follow-up. The strongest aspects goes to the much stronger acting (Tobey Macguire and Kirsten Dunst gave their solid performances and are as likable as ever. Alfred Molina is a great villain and lives up to the Green Goblin from the first and the other actors did well especially James Franco.) and the groundbreaking action especially the fight scenes with Spiderman and Doctor Octopus.Overall, a far more superior film that is always worth-watching. Thumbs up!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Only The Best In The Series; Also One Of The Best In The Genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me just tell you this: I love Spider-Man 2. Love it, love it, love it. I always have loved it, and undoubtedly always will. Now, let me tell you why I love it.First of all, it starts off with the characters already developed and established. This means no time is wasted in explaining who the people are. The introduction of how Peter Parker became Spider-Man has already been told, which gives the film the ability to begin at an already-quickened pace, which it definitely takes advantage of. From the minute the narrative starts, you as a viewer are automatically hooked. This movie does not fail to get your attention... unless you have really bad ADHD.Also added into this film that are missing in most superhero films: emotions. Tons and tons of emotions. Whether it be the ill-fated love between Peter and Mary Jane, the tense rivalry between Peter and Harry, or the saddened yet insightful words of Aunt May, this film gets right down into the hearts of the people who matter most. The movie doesn't overuse action or stunts; it uses them as a powerful compliment to the even more powerful storyline.Another point that must be observed is the pure awesomeness of the villain. Alfred Molina as Doctor Octopus is, in my mind, the quintessential comic book super-villain now ever since I've seen this film. His performance is spectacular and the character is just wonderful. I mean, once you catch just a glimpse of Doc Oc and his four mechanical legs, that picture will stay in the back of your mind for at least two months, give or take. He's also a superb character because he has such a powerful story and strong personality, which is clearly illustrated before he becomes Doc Oc. The reason why I love him so much as a villain is because he is human, and he's not completely evil at heart. It's a clear example of how good, intelligent people can be driven away and turned into something they're not, but then also deals with the importance of redemption.I won't give away too much more, since the movie really is worth seeing. When viewed, in my mind, I can't find anything that a viewer would find wrong or out of place. It's a fun, light-hearted film with a strong message and deep emotional scenes. There's also great action and comedy throughout. The acting is terrific on everyone's part, from the lead role down to every little extra you find in an elevator or on an elevated train. Also, with a villain whom you can feel compassion for and a hero you can really connect with, this movie can be related to pretty much anyone's own life. The bottom line is... if you've had troubles in your life, you'll be able to connect with it. If you've ever been unsure of who you are or what you're supposed to be doing, you'll be able to connect with it. And if you've ever given up a dream to do what's right, you'll be able to connect with it. And if you haven't experienced any of those things, good for you. Watch the film for the fun of it. It's one hell of a ride. :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This sequel ranks at 2nd in my best sances ever: I have seen it on its release, in my first trip to London and after visiting the British museum and having tea with my old Greek friend next door. In other words, it was the ideal movie to conclude an amazing day.As I said before, Spidey is maybe my oldest passion because i was offered his comics at 6 years old and was totally swept by the bright colors and realistic art. Spidey wakes me up of the boring French comics and since, i have never let him down. In thirty years, I read thousand Spidey's stories, some bad but some unforgettable (the Ditko, Romita Sr and Jr, MacFarlane) and to watch him live and on screen was his second earthquake. I think the Raimi's movies have totally captured the soul and heart of the characters. He succeeds putting in his movies all the trademarks of Spidey that the other Dynamic Concurent has never been able to deliver (in its comics as well an in its movies): a NYC icon, a soap opera, a big heart and a lot of laughs! It's hard to distinguish between all the movies because it's about an evolution but what i really appreciate in this second movie was:1) the opening credits: it's a terrific idea to have a talented artist (Ross?) have drawn the first movie because it's a cool homage. 2) The songs: there are only two songs in the movie: "hold on" and "raindrops" and if they can be listened for themselves because they are really good, they are also perfectly in harmony with the mood of Peter 3) The fire rescue: Raimi has always found the perfect person to every character, big or small, and this little Asian kid was excellent as a mini-hero! 4) Doc Ock birth was really scary and violent and it was funny to see "Evil Dead" coming into Spidey!Well, i could go on a long time like this. When you have a movie with such depth and details, you can be sure that's a hit and this trilogy won't never catch web in my bookcase!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favorite super hero movie~</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really enjoy this film so much.You will never guess what the spider-man wants to be. He is flying all around the city to save the people who is suffering the dangerous. I think everyone will love the hero like spider-man. And I believe there is a hero around us. Theykeep us be honest, give us strength, make us noble, and finally allowus to die with proud. Ever though sometimes we have to initiativelygive up the thing we want most, even our dreams. Spider man will alwaysencourage us.The movie demonstrates what's wrong with a lot of other superhero epics: They focus on the superpowers, and short-change the humans behind them. Readers could identify more completely with heroes like themselves than with remote godlike paragons. Peter Parker was an insecure high school student, in grade trouble, inarticulate in love, unready to assume the responsibilities that came with his unexpected superpowers. It wasn't that Spider-Man could swing from skyscrapers that won over his readers. It was that he fretted about personal problems in the thought balloons above his spidery face mask.But he has the heart to help the people without any return, it is worth for me to learn.Spider-Man 2 is a wonderfully conceived and executed film. There are some stylized moments&#xff0c;however&#xff0c;particularly those dealing with Peter Parker as just a typical, somewhat hapless guy. And these decisions may prove to be a detriment for those wanting to see a superhero be super. The tone of the film is certainly more lighthearted than the Dark Knight. And that may be a detriment depending on taste. The objective truth is that Spider-Man 2 is one of the best films I have ever seen. The real hero is selfless and has the strong sense of responsibility!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sam Raimi, along with his cast and crew, raise the bar in Spider-Man 2, the sequel to 2002's biggest cinema hit, Spider-Man, and creates one of the greatest superhero movies of all time.SPOILER ALERT!! SPOILER ALERT!! SKIP FOLLOWING PASSAGE IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BE SPOILED!! The cast from the first movie returns for the next adventure of the iconic superhero. Peter Parker struggles to find balance in his double-life as a college student and a superhero, while also dealing with both his feelings for Mary Jane Watson and his declining friendship with Harry Osborn. It does not make things any easier when new villain Doctor Octopus (or just Dock Ock) arrives on the scene, whom in this movie is more sympathetic than his comic book counterpart. Things get even more complicated for our hero when he discovers that Mary Jane, now popular stage actress, is engaged to marry the son of his boss, J. Jonah Jameson, who never misses an opportunity to slam the web-head's heroics with his own newspaper.SPOILER END!! SPOILER END!! Spider-Man 2 towers over the first installment in greatness. When Sam Raimi says he is a fan of Spider-Man, you can tell he means it. The acting is superb, the story is great with a great meaning, and the CGI has improved greatly from the last movie, and the love story is even more heart-wrenching than the previous installment. If anything, some will probably find the extended version more fulfilling than the theatrical version.A must-see! 10/10!</fullReview>

All in all it is a blast.The characters of Peter, Mary-Jane, and Harry, are well acted and fun to watch as they bring the story of a distressed superhero to life.Picking Up were the last one left off it builds upon itself, rather than pulling the last one down, as is the case with so many sequels.

		<fullReview>Considering the fact that almost every sequel out there sucks, I was very surprised and pleased to see that Spiderman 2 pretty much lived up to its word. Slightly weaker since most of the characters were already introduced in the first movie, but the action and story helped it stay new and fresh.It starts where it left off. The characters have grown a bit, but you can still tell they are the same people, both character and actor wise. In the first movie I could easily relate to the nerdy reject. In the second movie he's less of a reject and more of a mix between a nerd and a popular kid. Just like how I feel. Into girls but also into science.I enjoyed the... "mature" (if that word even works for this context) way they had some of the characters find out who Spiderman really was. They didn't have any unnecessary scenes, each one, each person who finds out, each things that Spiderman does, all helps the movie go forward.This is only rated 8/10 due to swearing. But other than that, I'm very impressed and am looking forward to the sequel Tonight!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the great misconceptions about the appeal of superheroes, and one that is constantly put forward even by well-meaning individuals connected with them (just watch the behind-the-scenes interviews on the Spider-Man DVD's)is that the audience is REALLY rooting for and relating to their alter-egos, the Clark Kents and the Bruce Waynes. Or in this case, Peter Parker. The logic behind this argument is that we can all identify with the poor schmucks who have trouble at work or school, or have all kinds of problems with the opposite sex, etc. Fair enough. But I dare anyone to make a movie about a Peter Parker who WASN'T Spider-Man. Just a nerdy kid who has trouble paying his rent and daydreams a lot in school. There's a film that would gross $300 million. Yeah, right. Nope, sorry to burst everyone's bubble, but the only reason film audiences give a damn about Peter Parker is because he IS Spider-Man. That is the appeal. We don't go to the movies to see ordinary people who are bored with their jobs and short on money; most of us live that every day. (To go off on a tangent- is anyone really surprised that all the films about the Iraq War bombed? Same thing. How many wives said to their husbands, "Honey, let's go see that new movie about the Iraq War?" Not too many, apparently.) No, and this should be a no-brainer: the appeal of a superhero movie is the superhero. That's what both the kids and adults go to see. Which brings up another dichotomy- the actors who play them are inevitably cast to be believable as the alter ego, not the superhero. (The only reason Michael Keaton was convincing as Batman was that when he put on that muscle-rippling bat-suit, he ceased being Michael Keaton.) Unfortunately, Tobey Maguire never stops being Tobey Maguire, even when he's Spider-Man. There is a scene late in the movie when Spider-Man is angry about Mary Jane being kidnapped; he rips off the chains that bind him and we are ready for a great roar of fury, but no, all that we hear is that whining, Mickey Mouse/Peter Parker voice pleading with Harry Osborn to help. And yet, this is something that is not immediately noticeable and Spider-Man 2 is certainly one of the best superhero films ever made, with enough great action scenes and wonderful special effects to make up for the dead spots. And was there ever a more fully realized super-villain than Alfred Molina's Dr. Octopus? Costumes, computer graphics, and model work are melded seamlessly with Molina's inspired performance to make a truly unforgettable screen character. It's fair to say that the presence of Doc Ock is what pushes Spider-Man 2 over the top into something much more than a comic book flick. J.K. Simmons is a joy to watch as always as the blustery J. Jonah Jameson. Kirsten Dunst remains a very fetching Mary Jane Watson, the quintessential girl-next-door who it's impossible not to fall in love with. But the director, Sam Raimi, loves to focus on down-on-his-luck Peter Parker and it frankly becomes depressing, almost morbidly so at times. Someone should tell him that a minute and a half of happiness at the end of the film doesn't make up for two hours of Peter Parker being yelled at, dumped by his girlfriend, hit on the head, and in general endlessly humiliated by everyone from his landlord to his supposed 'best friend.' It's actually a relief to see Dr. Octopus come along and taunt Spider-Man; at least Spider-Man fights back. Peter Parker is just a hopeless wimp. I know... maybe that's the point, but Raimi's approach is overkill to me. So a mixed bag, but between Molina's menacing portrayal and the slam-bang action sequences and effects, there's plenty to enjoy here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alright...I thought the movie director (whoever the heck he is) did a great job combining different types of movies into one (Comedy, Action, Drama). And unlike some other movies, he sewed them together, not taping them together. My favorite character would have to be the mad scientist (humor at times, funny robotic arms), or the head of the newspaper guy ("if promises were crackers, my daughter would be fat!").Overall, this is a movie that shouldn't be missed by anyone. At first, I didn't really want to go, because all the first flick was was fighting and "believing." But the second take really is a charm! It's certainly better than the 3rd.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Greatest cmic book movie ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is probably one of the best sequels ever made. Sam Raimi is a genius. He gave that film the breath of a marvel comic and that sounds like music in my ears! I've never seen such a incredible mix of action, romance, fun and suspense(!) in one single movie. The actors are great, the casting was good. And the plot is not too thin which is very important nowadays! Can't wait to get to see "Spidey 3" cause it will be very interesting how the relationship between Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson will move on. But it's very difficult to make the next film better than this one. But I think if Sam Raimi even topped the first one he will also top this one! And that's almost impossible!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a lifelong fan of the comic-book i do not need to mention that my expectations were very high indeed going in to see this movie....well I guess I kinda mentioned it anyways. Lets get down to it then! I loved the first movie and I love the second one just as much. I did not find that Spiderman 2 was better than the first one though, but it was just as good. I do not really think the comic book could have been realized in a better way than this. Sam Raimi captures everything from Peters personal inner struggles to the fabulous dynamics in the fight scenes between Spiderman and Doctor Octopus extremely well. Most of the special effects were great and a few lacked some in my opinion, but it did not matter strangely enough. If some of the effects looked a bit cartoony in some scenes, It must be because the Sam Raimi wants it to have that cartoonish feel and look....thats what I tell myself anyways. But it was truly a great movie indeed and well worth being viewed many times over again. As a fan for life, i'm very satisfied and can only look forward to the third installment (SPOILER COMING UP!!!) where our hero must again battle the Green Goblin and the Lizard as well it seems (Dr.Connors is being introduced)....coool. Personally I would have liked to see some of Spideys other great enemies come to life on the big screen for the third film, like The Sandman,or Venom but i guess I can wait until the fourth film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The major Principles Return for the Sequel to the Mega-Hit and Deliver, once again, about as much Fun, Social Commentary, and Mayhem one can expect from a Mega-Budgeted Movie of this sort.One could comment, and many have, about the endless Restating of Spider-Man and Mary Jane's on again off again Romance and the Heavy Handed retelling of both the Yearning and Dismissal of the Two. It gets to be a Bit Much.Putting that aside, the New Villain, Doctor Octopus, is brought to the Screen with an Incredible visual Accuracy of Doc Ock's First Appearance in the pages of the Sixties Comic. Alfred Molina is a Scary piece of work. Along with His Alter-Ego it is a Villainous Vulgarity. He has No Qualms about Dropping and Old Lady to Her Death in a Heartbeat.The Effects are Outstanding for the Creature and His Metal Limbs become a Presence to be reckoned with. The Battles between Spidey and the Good Doctor Gone Bad are truly worth all the Money it took to put on the Screen.There may be too Much Mary Jane and James Franco can barely Contain His Bad Acting and Harry Osborne's constant Complaining about Spider-Man becomes an Irritant. J. Jonah makes His mark again as Spider-Man's Public Relations Nightmare.Overall, a Big-Budget Bonanza both Artistically and Commercially. The Spider-Man's Created angst, by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko, that Revolutionize and Personalize the Super-Hero with Problems made Us think of Them in a completely New Way. In Fact, it was the Marvel Line in General that brought Comic-Books a New Face that fit perfectly in the Zeitgeist that was the 1960's. Sam Raimi and Crew Captures that Long Ago Metamorphosis and brings it to Modern Audiences. It may not seem as Fresh when told Today but it is a well thought out Recreation of a Time when Comic-Books were more likely than not Thrown Out with the Trash. Times and Attitudes sure have Changed. Thanks Marvel Bull-Pen Guys, for bringing a New Look to Comic-Books that Defined a Generation of Fan-Boys.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sets A Higher Bar For Superhero Films To Follow!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the finest sequels ever made and still counted amongst the greatest superhero flicks in existence, Spider-Man 2 is a remarkable follow-up to its already-impressive predecessor that skilfully builds upon the solid foundation provided by the first film, presents significant upgrades in each filmmaking aspect and beautifully balances all its elements to succeed as not just a de-facto standard of its genre but also as one of the best films of its year.Set two years after the events of the first film, the story of Spider-Man 2 finds Peter Parker struggling to balance his personal life &amp; his obligations as Spider-Man. His love interest is engaged to someone else, his grades have been steadily declining and he also seems to be losing his powers. Meanwhile, a brilliant scientist named Dr. Otto Octavius transforms into a supervillain with four robotic tentacles fused to his spine after his effort to sustain a nuclear fusion reaction goes horribly wrong.Directed by Sam Raimi, Spider-Man 2 is a far more mature effort from him in comparison to his previous venture and presents the director in sublime form for this sequel picks up the story right where it left off the last time despite the 2 years span, progresses the arc of its reprising characters amazingly well while giving a proper introduction to the new ones, and also does an outstanding job in balancing its storytelling elements with moments of action in a seamless manner, due to which everything about this sequel just works.Alvin Sargent's screenplay is worthy of praise as well for the story takes a darker approach than the last time yet packs in enough humour to prevent it from becoming too bleak, and although the cheesiness of the first chapter isn't reduced, the narrative flow is much more stream-lined than before. Production design team comes up with bigger, more refined set pieces, Cinematography preserves the vibrant camera-work but has a firmer grip on it this time while Editing is definitely one of its strongest aspects for there isn't a dull moment in the picture.Visual effects is much improved as well and by not overdoing its CGI elements, it keeps the artificiality of its universe at bay for the most part. Sure a number of moments are over-the- top but most of them still fall under the realm of on-screen believability. Last but not the least, Danny Elfman delivers again with a splendid soundtrack that stays true to the original film's score, works as a wonderfully evolved successor, and captures the darker tone with finesse just like it did the last time. Even the existing songs used in the picture are nicely chosen &amp; help compliment the respective sequences.Coming to the performances, Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, James Franco &amp; J.K. Simmons return to reprise their respective roles of Peter Parker, Mary Jane Watson, Harry Osborn &amp; J. Jonah Jameson and do a better job than before. Maguire builds up on his earlier input to impress once again and what he lacks in star presence, he makes up for it by chipping in a complex performance. Simmons is hilarious as before, Dunst &amp; Franco are still on base level but it's Alfred Molina who impresses the most in what is a sympathetic rendition of Doc Ock, thus making him a classic foe in every way.On an overall scale, Spider-Man 2 delivers everything one can expect from a sequel. It goes bigger, better &amp; more action-packed than before yet stays completely true to its origin, plus finishes on a high with enough open choices for where it can be headed in later instalments, something that Sony failed to take advantage of. Sam Raimi has weaved a magical web yet again that tightly grasps on to every necessary ingredient to come up with an incredibly fun, highly enjoyable, wildly entertaining &amp; thoroughly satisfying extravaganza that promises yet another high-flying, web-sligning roller-coaster ride and effortlessly delivers it.</fullReview>

I've decided I don't like Tobey Maguire as an actor and especially as Peter Parker. Alfred Molina makes for a bland villain. Some parts are really corny and needlessly stupid. The love story takes up way to much of the film and feels endless.On the plus side, the action scenes are pretty cool and do capture the feel of the comic. If only there had been a little more of it.Just a few quick comments. Overall, a 6. Don't believe all the ridiculous hype. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>POS syndrome (SPOILERS)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In theatre, if your first night performance has been a big success, you relax when the second night comes. You think, hey, this is easy, I've done it once before, acting isn't so hard. This is called the POS syndrome. It stands for "Piece of- you get the idea" syndrome. Spiderman 2 suffers greatly from the fact that the producers know you'll come just to see Spiderman and Doctor Octopus, so they can do whatever they want inbetween. What they put inbetween in two hours of awkward, poorly acted feelings, between Peter and Miss Eye Candy. When she's not screaming continuously she's having completely random flights of fantasy concerning her emotions for Peter. The director obviously believes that you will sit through these two hours of mind-numbing awkwardness, boredom and clichd emotions, just to see the final fight between Spiderman and Doctor Octopus. Well I didn't. I walked out when MJ ran across the city in her wedding dress to be with Peter. I went outside and was sick in the bathroom. I had to get my sister to tell me what happened. Did I like Spiderman 2? No. Decent acting from Peter's aunt and Doctor Octavius made this movie slightly more bearable. A rubbishy script, MJ and clich "Hero" speeches every ten minutes made it the blight on movie making that it is. You may think this is the review of a child who only wants to see action and special effects. Not true, I enjoy a good drama as much as anyone. But I only enjoy a GOOD drama. POS at its worst.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>good action, decent effects, and the chance for some good acting...unfortunately the last of these three aspects of spider man 2 was squandered yet again by horrible screenwriting! it happened in the new installment of the "star wars" movies and it appears it's going to happen with all the spider man movies as well. i wouldn't be surprised if george lucas somehow managed to convince this movie's scriptmen to take some notes from his shipwreck of a script.don't get me wrong, i definitely thought the action was decently well done, although the rubber-looking cgi spider man looks about as real as the agent smiths do in that overdone scene in matrix: reloaded where neo gets swarmed by a hive of cgi agent smiths. i think it looks tacky and it in no way allows me to immerse myself in the movie. that said, the action sequences were nicely constructed in terms of pace and intensity. and the subway train was probably one of the best action sequences of the movie. they (stan lee and friends) could have cut out well over half the overly cheesy dialogue, and everyone would still have known what was going on. i haven't seen the first movie, but it didn't take me more than about 2 minutes into the movie to realize that spiderman/peter parker would have to juggle and eventually sacrifice certain parts of their existence in attempts to find a balance. i didn't need the entire cast to preach it at me every 10 minutes or so. even parker's doctor gives him a life lesson talk, as if he were his father or something. you can get away with a bit of cheesy dialogue in comic book movies, but this was far and away too much, particularly when the caliber of actors in this movie was enough to warrant some good acting.tobey maguire isn't quite Oscar-worthy, but he's been a part of some intelligent films with well-written scripts and tight directing (cider house rules, pleasantville). and alfred molina was superb in "frida;" it was a passionate and severe man who portrayed diego rivera in that film. in my opinion, only the screenwriters are to blame for blunders like spider man 2.everyone else in the cast should get their huge paycheck for having been made to suffer through such an atrociously-written script.speaking of money, i also wouldn't mind my 7 bucks back, mr. lee. i would have rather just checked the movie out at the library.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being utterly disappointed with the first Spider-Man film, I thought for some bizarre reason that this one might be better. I think that I thought the villian (Dr. Octopus, in comic terms, Doc Ock in this film) would be a cool, but of course I was wrong. First off, Tobey Maguire is unbearably annoying with his nerdiness, but then he becomes a total bad-ass when he puts on his suit - that's really stupid. The CGI was over done and done poorly. Spider-Man was too concerned with ballet while flying through the air, and lost all of what made him an admirable super hero. What's worse is that there was an irritating over-doing of women screaming at EVERYTHING in the movie. This reminded me of those old horror movies where people just stare and scream - it didn't work then, and it sure as hell doesn't work now. I was bored with this whole movie because it moved so unbearably slow, and any action that took place wasn't too exciting compared to the bland scenes that came before it. There was several irrelevant scenes in the movie that further destroyed its potential. I think that Sam Raimi would make a better Peter Parker, but it doesn't really matter because this series is beyond repair. Don't see this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First I want to admit that I am not really a big fan of the actionadventure genre. I heard such great things about this movie though thatI felt I had to see what all the buzz was about. I also had not seen thefirst installment, although I didn't really think that was aprerequisite. It wasn't. I caught on just fine. First I'll say this was entertaining. I definitely was not bored,however I just did not love it. I thought the evil guy, the octopus guywas terribly cheesy, especially the way he'd enter a room with his shirtunbuttoned and dark glasses. He wasn't scarry to me. I thought he lookedlike some reject from a singles bar in the 70's. I thought KirstinDunsts performance was very flat. I could not see why a superhero wouldgive up his superhero powers for her. I liked Tobey Mguire and thoughthe did a nice job in the role. I loved that he was dorky and kind of aloser. I thought it made his character very sweet and endearing. Ididn't like that Spiderman practically flew like superman. From what Iknow of Spiderman, having watched the series as a kid Spiderman does notfly. In this movie he used his webs, but the way he got around was likehe was flying. I suppose to keep up with this type of blockbuster moviehe'd have to be able to fly.Much of this story reminded me of Superman II where he gave up hispowers so that he could be with Lois Lane, but then the 3 villains fromhis home came and practically destroyed the world so he HAD to go backto being Superman. I felt the Superman movies (the first 2) were farmore effective and entertaining stories. They were funny, fun,suspenseful, and exciting. I felt this film lacked much of what mademovies like Superman great. I also loved the Indiana Jones movies andthought they were EXCELLENT. I will say that Spiderman II was a decent flick, enjoyable, butultimately forgettable. Just on</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best of the Sam Raimi "Spider-Man" trilogy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the commercial box-office success and critical success of the 2002 film, Sam Raimi signed on to direct two sequels and the actors from the first film signed on to two other films. On June 30, 2004, a sequel titled, SPIDER-MAN 2 was released to box office success and critical acclaim, receiving a 94% on RottenTomatoes.com.Set two years after the events of the last film, this film focuses on Peter Parker struggling to manage both his personal life and his duties as Spider-Man, while Dr. Otto Octavious becomes diabolical following a failed experiments and his wife's death.He uses his mechanical tentacles for threaten and endanger the lives of New York City's residents. Spider-Man must stop him from annihilating the city.This film along with "The Dark Knight", is considered being one of the best superhero films ever made and this film is really amazing. The dialogue is so amazing in this film and it was really amazing to hear some of the stuff all of the characters and Mary Jane &amp; Peter's relationship is really cool.The CGI in this film is really amazing and spectacular and I could have not been more happier with what they did. The fights between Doctor Octopus and Spider-Man was well done and the fight choreograpaher really did a great job in this film with those action sequences.The acting is amazing, but James Franco is just completely crazy and really bad in this film. Thankfully, the next film makes up for this. Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst are really good as Peter Parker / Spider-Man and Mary Jane Watson. Alfred Molina plays Dr. Otto Octavious / Doc Ock and he was amazing. Willem Dafoe also plays the role of Harry's late father and he is not in the film that much.This film has one of the greatest endings ever made and this film is just freaking amazing.Overall, I love SPIDER-MAN 2 and I'm giving this a 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I honestly feel that I must have seen a different movie than the one critics and audiences are eating up by the spoonful. The flick I saw had horrible dialogue - lows including the Henry needs a hero speech, every time Harry Osbourne spoke to himself about his hatred for Spiderman, Molina's nonsensical fusion speech... the list goes on forever - also the action was largely uninspired and overly CG, the Villain's plot super lame(he's going to destroy the city because he is a incompetent scientist and can't get his experiment right?) and worst of all, the picture was plain boring.I had high hopes for the film as I loved the first one and Raimi appeared to be shrewdly stealing the plot from Superman 2 (a great sequel), but in the end, the movie turned out flat and uninspired. Spiderman, like Superman, should be the fun, light-hearted superhero movie where you jump out of your seat to cheer for the hero. Aside from the "Go get 'em, tiger" line at the end, I never once felt like cheering for our hero.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Major Flaws in "Super Hero" Film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really enjoyed the first Spiderman Film. I thought it did a good job establishing Spiderman and had a lot of action. Also it layed a good foundation for future sequels. I thought the second would be an action packed follow up that further developed characters. I was half right.Basically in this film Peter Parker is learning to live his life as both himself and Spiderman. THis leads to him constantly being late which affects his schoolwork, jobs, and most importantly his relationship with MJ. Meanwhile a doctor named Doc Ock is performing a fusion experiment but it goes horribly wrong and he has four metal arms that are really powerful fused to his body and he becomes Doctor Octopus. Parker soon decides that it may be best for him to hang up his Spiderman Costume and live as Peter Parker and not Spiderman. But will his decision be final? Too much of this film drags. For one the first half of the film Peter is still affected by his uncle Ben's death. That was a problem that should have been done after the last film. But through the film the characters are still coping with Bens death and it just would have been nice if that was not still an issue.Also this film deals more with Peter Parker than Spiderman. It should have been called Peter Parker. It is all about his relationship with MJ, his aunt May, and his best friend. The main conflict of the film is not dealing with Spiderman himself then.I thought the villain in this film, Doctor Octopus, was OK. However he does not get to fight with Spiderman enough. In fact after his first encounter with Spiderman you do not see him for a while and I think that all of the conflict concerning Peter Parker takes away from time that should have been with Doctor Octopus and Spiderman fighting.Spiderman could have been in the film more also. The core of the film barely shows Spiderman. I was hoping since they already established Spiderman in the first film that in this one he would get to do a lot more action and fighting but there really is a shortage of great action. SOme of it is good like how Spiderman battles Doctor Octopus on the side of the building, but there is not enough of it.Also what is the deal with Spiderman wanting to take off his mask in this film? That just seemed out of place.The conflict within characters is somewhat interesting though. It does not necessarily make this a bad film, just a boring at times Super Hero film. I came to see this film to see Spiderman get in a lot of action, not see Peter Parker try to work out his life.So this sequel does not have enough action for me. It has an OK villain, but there are a lot of major flaws in this super hero film. I do not recommend it greatly, the first Spiderman Film I think is much better but this is not that bad either. Worth seeing once or twice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From a fan's point of view: "Spider-Man 2" is FLAWLESS!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spider-Man 2 is best described like this: Take the original Spider-Man and multiply it by 5 and you get Spider-Man 2. it's literally that good. From a fan's point of view it was simply perfect. PERFECT!!! but from a critic's point of view, it has some minor issues but nevertheless, it's definitely an improvement on the original Spider-Man. I keep asking myself how on earth does it have an overall score that's the exact same to the score of the original Spider-Man (Both have 7.3/10??!) This 2nd installment surpasses the original in almost every way. Think about it:The story: The story is darker and explores more stuff than the 1st one did. It shows how Peter Parker struggled after he defeated the 1st villain and it shows what are the consequences of that. It also shows how Harry Osborn became hateful to Spider-Man unlike before when he used to be kind with him. The story also has some shocking and unpredictable twists that flow very well.The villain: Alfred Molina is FANTASTIC as Dr. Octopus. The villain is menacing and has an excellent origin/build up for his actions and decisions. Visually he looks AMAZING &amp; SCARY!!The use of horror elements: Like the 1st one did. The use of horror in this movie is even better than the 1st one and fits perfectly for the villain. This one had some crazy jump scenes which works.The action: 5x times better than the 1st one. The amazing train fight sequence is PHENOMENAL and more intense than the final battle with Green Goblin from the 1st one.More Drama: The movie has more humanity in the characters and it's more emotional than the 1st one was. The Drama flows very well in the movie.Spider-Man 2 is highly recommended. You should never miss it if you're a fan of the character and the 1st movie. It completely blew me away as a fan. As a critic I had little issues that aren't really a big deal, but they're worth mentioning. The problem I have with this movie is that it sort of ripped off some the same elements from the 1st movie. Like for example, Dr. Octopus's motivation for becoming a villain is similar to the one from Green Goblin's. Also, There is a scene in which there is a building set on fire and Spider-Man has to go save some people who are trapped inside that building. The exact same happens in this movie. But I guess...I can pass on these two because the film was a BIG BIG surprise for me when I saw and it totally exceeded my expectations.**If you don't know me, when I rate superhero movies I have two sides. Fan &amp; Critic. By rating as a critic I give you my honest score. By rating it as a fan I give the movie bonus points, because generally, I love watching a superhero movie and I know they shouldn't be taken too seriously because it would be too easy to find flaws. I will give you both my grades from a fan &amp; critic's perspective and I shall leave it for you to decide which one is more helpful...OK? OK!**As a critic: 8.5/10 (Great).As a fan: 10/10 (Perfect).</fullReview>

The acting is superb, and Tobey once again is giving us a sense that Peter Parker is real. J.K Simmons is also great and funny, and Kirsten Dunst, Rosemary Harris and James Franco, along with Alfred Molina also do a very good job.By the way,this film has it's some entertaining moments.Must watch once 10/10;Probably the best movie you'll watch this year, much less this Summer.:</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first 'Spiderman' film was great. This second one though is a classic case of a sequel that's trying to do too much, and ultimately does not much at all.The second half, I grant you, is action packed and good fun. But oh dear it takes a long time to get there. Lots of in jokes and pointless scenes.I can't fault the actors though, Maguire and in particular Dunst are much improved from last time around, settling into their uneasy 'will they, won't they?' romance.For action sequences, it's probably the best of the three, but that opening hour spoils my interest somewhat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably my favorite Marvel movie. Everybody loves a hero!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was super engaged and blown away with this sequel, when I first saw it in theater. And for the most part this movie is so good with it's execution that it holds up even when it comes to today's standards. When it comes to the plot, it really delves into the mindset of Peter Parker and the sacrifices he is willing to make for the people of New York and his loved ones. And the struggles he is facing when it comes to financial issues and his selfless acts of pushing the things he wants away so others wouldn't get hurt. For a young adult it really shows why Spider-Man is such a awesome comic book superhero and I felt sympathy for the guy. So overall it's execution of balancing out Peter Parker's life as a nerd that is in love trying to get by and his superhero duties was done almost flawlessly. Because it really shows the price the hero is willing to pay for others. I also liked the portrayal of the villain more this time around, Doctor Octopus is one of my favorite villains when it comes to Spider-Man after all. I really liked how you can understand the villains point of view, you may not necessarily agree with his methods. But I could understand where he was coming from, because sometimes bad things come about from good intentions. The fight choreography is also much better this time around, the fight with Doc Ock is bigger and just more fun to watch. It's exactly how I would have wanted Spider-Man vs. Doctor Octopus fight to play out. And the train sequence about about 85% of the way through is not only heroic but uplifting and even enticing to sit through. There is even emotional scenes that actually works instead of it feeling like it's forced when it comes to the plot as a whole, which is quite a achievement when it comes to superhero movies. This is a life changing story when it comes to Peter Parker. And is can be a perspective changing movie for viewers when it comes to superhero movies because of how good it is. Like Aunt May says about a hero, a "courageous self-sacrificing people setting examples for all of us" and that is exactly what this film shows.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spider-Man 2 (2004): Dir: Sam Raimi / Cast: Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, Alfred Molina, James Franco, Rosemary Harris: Like Superman 2 we are given a film that surpasses being a sequel and examines the identity of the hero. Setup has Peter Parker struggling to adjust to normality as he is fired from his pizza deliver job. He still loves Mary Jane who has become a hit on Broadway. Central plot regards Dr. Otto Octavius or Doc Ock whose experiment goes wrong and four mechanical arms are welded into his back. Parker must also deal with Harry Osborn's plans of revenge against Spider-Man. Detailed and convicting with director Sam Raimi rightfully concentrating on identities. Tobey Maguire as Parker deals with his powers and whether they are a gift or a curse, but ultimately his identity will be at its most exposed by the conclusion in a way in which other films of the genre rarely go. Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane embarks upon stage acting. She is engaged but will discover something about Parker that leaves her committed to him. Alfred Molina steals scenes as the menacing Doc Oct whose tentacles conflict with her true nature. James Franca plays the vengeful Harry whose friendship is tested and loyalty to his father an open door. Rosemary Harris plays Peter's understanding aunt who still support him after the death of his uncle. Electrifying special effects serve as a worthwhile sequel. Score: 8 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spectacular Sequel!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's not uncommon for successful films to spawn sequels, some are just thrown together simply because a certain film drew large amounts of money at the box office. However, there are exceptions. This film is a perfect example of that. When I watch the first two Spider-Man films, it becomes clear to me that Sam Raimi had a deep understanding and love for the character. There are certain things that I want and expect to see in a sequel: I want to see the story arc(s) continue, and I want to see the characters grow. A good sequel will, and should always have these! To make a long story short, this is what I got with Spider-Man 2. The story borrows elements from the film "Superman II" and "The Amazing Spider-Man #50" (Spider-Man no more) In which the hero struggles with what he wants, and what is right for the people that he protects. Without a doubt, it's a great story for a comic book/superhero film to have. The returning cast are still excellent in their roles, as well as the new actors. This also goes for Alfred Molina as Otto Octavius/Dr. Octopus. It's just an excellent film all-around. So you may be wondering why I love these first two films, (I won't be reviewing Spider-Man 3.) and why I detest the reboot films? well here's why:Reason #1: There was no heart put into the reboot films. To me, the reboot films just felt like a quick cash-grab. A slapped-together attempt to keep Spider-Man from transferring back to Marvel.Reason #2: The supporting characters had no depth. In Amazing Spider-Man 1&amp;2, we never get a sense of who Captain Stacy, Gwen Stacy, Aunt May, Uncle Ben, and Harry Osborn are. The films just move way too fast to let these characters develop!Reason #3: The Villains have no charisma. The only things that The Lizard, Electro, and "Green Goblin", do in the reboot films is this: Fight Spider-Man, get defeated, get incarcerated. The villains in the first two Sam Raimi films on the other hand, have memorable lines of dialogue, intense fight scenes, and iconic looks. The original villains leave an impact on you, the only thing that the new villains leave you with, is a desire to fall asleep.Reason #4: Andrew Garfield's Peter Parker/Spider-Man is a horrible person! Whether he's in the costume or not, Andrew Garfield's Peter Parker comes off as a complete douche! He acts like he's above everyone else, never keeps his word, and only cares about himself. A FAR cry from the good-hearted hero from the comics. Tobey Maguire on the other hand, personifies the character of Peter Parker. As Peter, He's an awkward, shy, nerd, but also, he genuinely loves and cares about the people in his life. As Spider-Man, he's the underdog. Even if the odds may not be stacked in his favor, he'll still do whatever it takes to defeat the villain, and protect those that can't protect themselves. These are my reasons as to why I don't like the reboot films. In my opinion, the original two Spider-Man films were perfect. It took me a while to see it that way, but sometimes it takes something really bad to make you appreciate something really good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best of the Sam Raimi "Spider-Man" trilogy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the commercial box-office success and critical success of the 2002 film, Sam Raimi signed on to direct two sequels and the actors from the first film signed on to two other films. On June 30, 2004, a sequel titled, SPIDER-MAN 2 was released to box office success and critical acclaim, receiving a 94% on RottenTomatoes.com.Set two years after the events of the last film, this film focuses on Peter Parker struggling to manage both his personal life and his duties as Spider-Man, while Dr. Otto Octavious becomes diabolical following a failed experiments and his wife's death.He uses his mechanical tentacles for threaten and endanger the lives of New York City's residents. Spider-Man must stop him from annihilating the city.This film along with "The Dark Knight", is considered being one of the best superhero films ever made and this film is really amazing. The dialogue is so amazing in this film and it was really amazing to hear some of the stuff all of the characters and Mary Jane &amp; Peter's relationship is really cool.The CGI in this film is really amazing and spectacular and I could have not been more happier with what they did. The fights between Doctor Octopus and Spider-Man was well done and the fight choreograpaher really did a great job in this film with those action sequences.The acting is amazing, but James Franco is just completely crazy and really bad in this film. Thankfully, the next film makes up for this. Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst are really good as Peter Parker / Spider-Man and Mary Jane Watson. Alfred Molina plays Dr. Otto Octavious / Doc Ock and he was amazing. Willem Dafoe also plays the role of Harry's late father and he is not in the film that much.This film has one of the greatest endings ever made and this film is just freaking amazing.Overall, I love SPIDER-MAN 2 and I'm giving this a 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The power of the sun, in the palm of my hand.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is what I might consider the best superhero sequel yet. It is a lot more firmly directed and outdoes the original like never before. It is also partially an expansion of the origin story in Peter's illusion. This movie in my opinion outdoes even X2, which was promising in almost every aspect it had to offer. The awesome thing about Marvel is that they actually represent the inherent silliness of the comics, something I'd pretty much like to see in every superhero brand. Here are some of the best features of Spider-Man 2.1. Peter loses his powers so that he is so much easier to relate to as a person. Character development was seemingly a top priority in this movie, a faithful adaptation of Spider-Man: No More.2. The songs were perfect. (Hold on and Raindrops keep falling on my head, or even the one in the credits.)3. Doc Ock was a villain with believable motives and considerably more mature than the Green Goblin.4. At first I thought it lacked action but then the damn train scene changed everything!Now that SONY and Disney have collaborated with each other to make a version of Spider-Man linked to The Avengers, I sure do hope they top this masterpiece!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spider-Man 2 really is different......but is it different in a good way?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spider-Man 2, 2004. Good? Yes. As good? As which one, the first one? No, no it's not. I don't think this film is as good as Spider-Man (2002) because the villain, for a start, isn't as good. Not to mention the change in Harry is somewhat irritating, though it's understandable. I just prefer the way Harry was in the first film. Spider-Man 2 is practically great, but there a few things in the film that let it down. However, this review, from me, is spoiler free, so therefore I won't be naming the things we see in the actual film that are wrong, but other things like the dialogue, effects, scenery, acting and directing I can talk about. The directing, firstly, is good. It's as good as it is in the first film. The dialogue is pretty good too, as there is some fine scenes of pure dialogue and it doesn't feel too sloppy. And it's not wrapped up too quick. The acting is good, but I feel that Tobey's performance this time isn't as good. I dunno, maybe it's just me for that one. The effects and scenery - both great. Both really great. The effects in Spider-Man 2 aren't overly-used, look very realistic and are arguably better. The scenery and set is great too, and the end scenery is incredible. Overall, Spider-Man 2 brings out a great villain, but not near as good as the Green Goblin from Spider-Man. Good dialogue, good acting and much more. This was a positive review. Good film. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a pretty good and entertaining movie sequel to Spider-Man. Tobey Maguire reprises his role as the nerdy and shy Peter Parker, who is dealing with the downs in life of like seeing his crush, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), being engaged to somebody else, cannot hold down jobs, school grades suffering, and receiving bad press as Spider-Man. After giving up his alter-ego completely, obsessive scientist Dr. Otto Octavius is transformed into super villain Doctor Octopus while an experiment and begins a spree of terror.The acting was descent, like the first movie, and I think it helped enhance the steady-going plot. The special effects were neat and there are plenty of action to keep the story captivating and exciting. The movie's motto, "With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility!" never resonated more importantly as in this movie, since Peter Parker has to rise to the occasion despite his life woes and confront the new menace that threatens his city and, ultimately, the ones he loves. And, I like the part where innocent citizens in the city try to help Spider-Man when he is wounded at one point. This shows the bond and positive impact a superhero has on everyday people.Overall, an entertaining movie which I think is one of the better superhero sequels.Grade B</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is struggling to make ends meet and having a hard time keeping his secret. He can't even keep his pathetic pizza delivery job. Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) is having some success on Broadway. Meanwhile Harry Osborn (James Franco) hasn't lost his hatred of Spidey. He is now funding Dr. Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina) and his work on fusion. However something goes wrong in his demonstration and a new villain is born.Director Sam Raimi is able to inject a bit of spidey fun in this movie. The internal struggle in Peter Parker about his identity is very compelling. And Alfred Molina makes for a great villain. I especially like J.K. Simmons as Jameson. They're great characters. As for the CGI, they look very nice without looking like a video game. I like the arms and I like the web swinging. It's a well put together movie and may be even better than the first.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spiderman returns with a new enemy and more problems in my favorite film of the trilogy. Spider-man 2 regretfully beats the 1st film in every way. It even got a higher score on this website which is rare for some sequels. It had a great train fight sequence and Alfred Molina as Dr Octopus was OK but there might have been a better actor out there. The only problem with the film is that there are too much scenes revolving around Mary Jane and Peter Parker, though this is important, Sam Raimi should have just cut some scenes out. I have heard that Black Cat was going to be in this film but was taken out and that caused the film to earn better choice of plot being Spiderman loses his powers. Though I still would have liked to see Black Cat in the film, but she was then put onto the PS2 video game. Anyway the film is a great standalone film as well as being one of the best super-hero movies of all time. And so finishes my review on Spiderman 2. See my review for Spider man 1 or 3 if you enjoyed this...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Part II is one of the few sequels to match the original, as it looks and feels(helped along by clever opening credits that serve as a recap)like a genuine continuation of the original, as it should, since the returning cast(Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, James Franco, and also J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson, a perfect recreation of the comic book character) are most welcome. The plot picks up events two years later, where Peter's physics teacher Dr. Octavius, would become arch-nemesis Doctor Octopus, nicely played by Alfred Molina.Fantastic action scenes and compelling drama as this develops the characters believably from Part I, with a surprise development involving Peter's secret being revealed, that is quite moving, though not developed upon much later. Great fun in how to do a sequel right.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spidey is back, and this time he's battling Dr. Octopus (aka Dr. Otto Octavius, played by Alfred Molina). Doc Ock is transformed via a nuclear fusion experiment that goes horribly wrong, fusing 4 virtually indestructible mechanical arms to his nervous system via his spinal cord..and destroying the inhibitor chip which prevents them from controlling his mind. You see Peter Parker back once again as a hard-on-his luck geek, when he's not chasing bad guys. The problem is that all that time chasing crooks has left him exhausted..to the point where he's failing in college and can't hold a job (and as such can't keep up on his rent at the dive where he lives). He's still hung up on Mary Jane, who, much to Parker's chagrin, is now dating J. Jonah Jameson's astronaut son. His buddy Harry Osbourne is still obsessed with getting back at Spider-man for the death of his father. And Aunt May's home is in foreclosure. All these distractions get to Peter, and he finds that his spider powers aren't always working (and they pick some really bad moments to go out on him).Spider-man 2 has generally been reviewed more favorably than the first installment. I disagree. It's got great visual effects, but it's a bit tedious in places. When the action does get going, it's great, but there's a LOT of talking in this movie..too much (except for the parts featuring the insufferable Jameson, once again played perfectly by J.K. Simmons). And Spidey 2 doubles down on the "Peter Parker's a hard-luck nerd" angle. OK, first off, he wasn't that nerdy in the comic (I know, I'm being picky here, but nonetheless), but even assuming he was, it gets to the point where it's enough already..we get it. There's one scene in particular where Peter's heading for class (late, as usual) and is constantly getting knocked over and walked on by the other students. Part of that was to emphasize how exhausted he was from chasing bad guys, but still, it was too much.All criticisms aside, this is still definitely a superior effort as super hero movies go. All the performances are good. Alfred Molina does a fine job as the doomed Dr. Octavius. The effects are VERY good. There's a lot of CGI, but it actually isn't done to the point where it looks like a video game. Doc Ock's mechanical arms in particular look frighteningly real.Overall, a fine follow-up to my favorite comic super-hero movie. 8.5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This amazing Spider-Man film truly dominates the genre in my opinion. It uses clever comedy, morals, and action to tell a compelling story about a scientist driven mad by a crazed accident which leaves his wife dead and his mind in the control of a set of machine arms. The villain, like the first Spider-Man's Green Goblin, is a sympathetic character, forced to atrocity by a freak accident. You feel for Dr. Octopus, knowing he has to be defeated, but hoping that he gets away alive. Alfred Molina almost steals the show as Dr. Octopus, but one character really surprises the audience with her powerful performance.Rosemary Harris plays Aunt May, Peter Parker's spirited yet wizened Aunt. Every scene she's in, she demands the audiences attention. She truly forces Peter Parker to come to terms with Uncle Ben's death, and pushes the film's major morals without being overbearing. A truly amazing performance.Tobey Maguire has never been one of my favorite actors. I don't consider him a great actor, but in Spider-Man, he is perfect. He fits the role of Peter Parker like I never expected, being an avid lover of the original comic book. He captures the essence of the shy, intelligent kid that is suddenly thrust into this world of being a superhero. After showing us a great performance in the first Spider-Man, where he was overshadowed by the ever creepy Willem Dafoe, Tobey Maguire has truly sunk into the role of Peter Parker in this movie. The two supporting characters, Mary Jane, played strongly by Kirsten Dunst, and Harry Osborn, portrayed by James Franco, who isn't really a very good actor most of the time, but pulls it out of the bag for this movie. They both provide strong support, Mary Jane as Peter Parker's love interest who is getting married to the son of J. Jonah Jameson, and Harry Osborn as Parker's best friend who's obsessed with finding and killing Spider-Man, who he thinks is responsible for murdering his father, the Green Goblin.This outstanding movie sets the bar for superhero movies everywhere, and still gives the Spider-Man character hope after the mediocre Spider-Man 3 and the remake which I still refuse to see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most iconic comic book character returns to the big screen!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw the first Spider-Man film, I thought it was decent to watch but it wasn't really the superhero movie I was hoping for. If you want to see my whole Spider-Man review, then please do because I have a strong opinion on that movie. When I saw the trailer for this film and saw that Doctor Otto Octavius was going to be the villain, I was beyond excited.The story line is Peter Parker is trying to adjust his normal life while still fighting crime as the hero everyone loves. (expect for J Jonah. Jameson of course) Doctor Otto Octavius demonstrates a fusion reactor, everything goes wrong of course which leaves to his wife's death and his inhibitor chip for his robotic arms being destroyed. Spider-Man stops it and Octavius wants his revenge, Harry Osborn makes a bargain to him to bring Spider-Man to him alive so that he can get what he wants to rebuild his machine. Peter struggles with his personal life and being a superhero, as a result, it becomes too strong for him and he has made a choice to give up being Spider-Man. While adjusting to what he wants, Doc Ock comes in and kidnaps Mary Jane (just like Goblin did last time) which leads to Peter returning as Spider-Man. Despite my problems I had with the first film, the storyline is fantastic like I said before. Most of the actors from the first film continue to shine here. Alfred Molina is fantastic casting as Doctor Otto Octavius and looks like the character in the comics, he is a character that you actually feel sympathy for after the accident. James Franco was also good as Harry Osborn, you can definitely see the torment that Harry feels over his father's death and his desire to kill Spider-Man. J.K Simmons steals the show here as J. Jonah Jameson and he such a delight to watch. Like I said in my Spider-Man review, he captures the essence of J. Jonah Jameson from The Amazing Spider-Man comic book series and brings the comic book character to life in a superhero movie. I can't imagine someone else playing this character, how you can make a character so full of himself and so likable at the same time is just great acting. When they're going to reboot the Spider-Man franchise and cast someone as J. Jonah Jameson, they better get J.K Simmons to play him.As far as accuracy to The Amazing Spider-Man comic book series, the story was mostly influenced by Amazing Spider-Man #50 also known as "Spider-Man No More!" where Peter gives up being Spider-Man, but finds himself unable to let it go. The differences between this movie and the comic book is Mary Jane is the love interest of Peter instead of Gwen Stacy and Dr. Otto Octavius is the main villain in this movie as Kingpin was the main villain in the comic book but I honestly don't care, it still translates the story from that comic book really well and that's all that really matters, it doesn't have to be 100% accurate to that particular comic book. But it's not a Sam Raimi film without it's silly and dumb moments. For example, the extras they put in this movie. Some I didn't care for but some of them are pretty funny.I do have a few problems with the movie though. First, I'll start with The astronaut. (also known as John Jameson) He is the son of Peter's boss J. Jonah Jameson. I thought he would play a bigger role in the film and make a huge impact on everyone; we don't see him do anything space- related, what was the purpose of the character besides his brief relationship with Mary Jane? Tobey Maguire to be honest isn't any better as Peter Parker in this movie. His comic book counterpart's charisma and sense of humor isn't done right. The same thing applies to Kristen Dunst as Mary Jane, she portrays her very melodramatically, and at times it's just hard to watch.What about Doctor Otto Octavius robotic arms? After the inhibitor chip gets destroyed, they actually talk to him! I'm pretty sure his robotic arms didn't do that in The Amazing Spider-Man #3, if it did then...that issue had some flaws. They want him to finish what he started by robbing banks and kidnapping innocent people. That was pretty odd if you ask me. Not that this is too important but have you ever notice how scary the scene where Doc Ock starts killing the doctors when they were trying to remove the mechanical arms was? I think Sam Raimi was trying to imply from what did in the Evil Dead trilogy (I think that's where it came from?) but it feels so out of place in a Spider-Man movie. For a PG film (in my case anyway) this scene is really terrifying! The convincing screams of terror from the doctors and no soundtrack playing in the background gives us a more creepy tone! But aside from the flaws I mentioned, this film was great to watch! This was the best out of Sam Raimi's trilogy and was even better than the previous installment! It managed to show a great example of a superhero film by having some intense action sequences, improved special effects, some good acting by the whole cast (especially J.K Simmons), good emotional weight, the camera-work is astonishingly well shot, the story translates "Spider-Man No More!" very well and the villain is really memorable. This movie is definitely worth purchasing if you're a Spider-Man or a comic book fan. In fact, even if you're not a comic book fan, you will still enjoy the other elements put into this movie.Final verdict for this film: 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spider-Man 2 was a giant quantum leap forward for Superhero movies. It manages to get all the right ingredients needed for a franchise such as the Spider-Man movie series: It has awesome breath taking action scenes, its fair supply of good humour and wit (supporters known for it), romance, great cast, chemistry and Musical Score. This time round Sam Raimi combines all the mastery from his box of tricks, from films such as The Evil Dead Trilogy and Darkman (armed with a better budget lol). Raimi has matured as a filmmaker and handles the special effects and action sequences with real flair and imagination, but its in the dramatic scenes such as Peter Parkes would be confession to his Aunt May that he is Spider-Man and Peters heartbreaking dream sequence in which he imagines the ghost of Uncle Ben, really capture the heart of Marvel Comics characters. At this point Tobey Maguire really has the right angle on the character of Peter Parker/Spider-Man. He combines the sweet bookishness of Peter with the superheroic crime fighting qualities of Spider-Man and Maguire does really well in this situation, rooting as always for the under dog Peter Parker, then later Spider-Man. Once again though Spideys fails to be portrayed as a comedian, which is essential for the character to keep his wits about him. Alfred Molina as Doc Ock is a sheer revelation, Raimi and company came up with a really good interpretation of the character and Molina steps up to the plate and gives a really exciting performance, making Dock Ock both once evil and tragic. Again Danny Elfmans theme music is a miscalculation, bland and insipid, failing to capture the danger and excitement of Spidey's world. Spider-Man 2 is a brilliant example of how original, enjoyable and exciting the Superhero movie genre can be. With JK Simmons as Jameson and Kirsten Dunst delivering another good performance as Mary Jane, the ensemble cast work really well together. The action sequences are top notch throughout never more so than in the Spidey/Dock Ock battles and climax on the New York overhead railway sequence. A most enjoyable, top notch and bold Superhero movie, the best of the Raimi/Maguire series and one of the best genre films full stop.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best superhero film I've ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Forget about Batman Begins and Superman, Spider-Man 2 dominated those two and its predecessor single-handedly.Starting off on a note that leaves the audience feeling sorry for Peter, the story continues two years after the first film and perfectly carrying the story forward. Things between Peter and MJ rise and fall, and Harry's life is falling apart. Doc Ock soon enters as the villain in the film, complicating Peter's life to great heights. The world around the beloved Peter Parker is falling apart, and in an effort to escape his pain, he quits.Spider-Man 2 truly delivers on every level; drama, comedy, action, and superhero-ness. All the scenes fit warmly together, and the storyline never goes below great. It also includes some of Spidey's best action (the train fight scene, for example) and some of Peter's best moments (the diner scene with MJ is Spidey's second finest scene ((I personally liked the symbiote removal in Spider-Man 3 better)).) Doc Ock is a way better villain than Green Goblin was (although I absolutely loved GG). Character development was amazing beyond words, and the way the whole movie is set-up is a sign of some of Sam Raimi's cinematic genius.Where Spider-Man lacked, Spider-Man 2 made up. I give this awesome movie an 8.4; not perfect, but a truly great and solid film nonetheless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best......Spiderman!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have just seen the third installment and I liked it...but somehow number two is my favourite..Spiderman 2 - The Best storyline ever! - I thought the Doc Ock was outstanding in this film and certainly picked the right actor to play the part... The movie was just amazing to me since my favourite villain was in it and plus I thought they would off made it a little crap, but no, never, Sam Riami made the sequel brilliant, with some new cast and new directions of spiderman's life, he has certainly got the talent of making a good Spiderman Movie and this one made him a fantastic director.I hope he does Spiderman 4, third one was good, but could have been a little better, hopefully if he does make the fourth it will have Lizard in it. That Would Be Fun!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superior to the first</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is great. I watch over and over and it continues to amaze me. Doc Ock is definitely one of the coolest villains in the spider-man universe. Alfred Molina not only delivers a spectacular villain performance but he makes the viewer want to feel sorry for the six armed villain. Peter Parker has never been more portrayed brilliantly then in this film. You want him to get the girl, you want harry to forgive him, and he must stop Doc Ock. This movie has some of the best special effects to date. But the effects and action don't outweigh the story. Definitely an 10/10.Also try to spot Stan Lee's cameo in the movie. I wish there would be a lot more cameos in the movie from Marvel artists or characters. I'd love to see Peter Parker talking to Johnny Storm. I was on the edge of seat the entire show. This movie is superior to the first yet it feels like just a continuation of the first film. Keep up the good work Sam Raimi remember "With great power comes great responsibility".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much better than Spidey 1</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The computer graphics were rectified in this installment of the series. There is a little bit of dynamism that is added to the motion of the character this time though in the end the cartoonish effect has not entirely disappeared.One of the biggest strengths of this movie is the drama element. I found the sympathy factor a little bit too much in the first part and I thought I would puke if I continue seeing the same here but I did not. I, in fact realized that it was the strength of Spider-man 2. Peter Parker cannot come to terms with the selflessness a superhero with his powers is suppose to have. He wants to set his life right. The whole struggle is shown to be really great and Tobey does it really well considering that he is not the critical actor and more of an action figure not widely known until his role as Spiderman.Doctor Ock is simply one of the most sophisticated villains and full credit to the script writers for developing him in depth. But then again, the show-down scenes, I say this, either move the character and keep the camera still, or move the camera keep the character still and yes, time and now, please show some slow motion shots of a punch or something to bring about the realism (something like Wachowskis showed the slow punch of Neo in Matrix Revolutions). Fast, fast and simply fast. It would thrill the kids but not a single shot in the movie except the one where the car crashes into the caf just before the teen scene between Mary Jane and Peter would leave a lasting impression.Another thing I found was wrong placing of humor or should I call it humor? On the train crash scene Spidey fails in his first attempt to stop the train and we have a bugging old man who goes, "Any more bright ideas?" What is the meaning of the scene? I'd expect someone to say, "Please do something" with an expression of "staring at death". They say Sam Raimi is a talented director but I doubt if this is the opinion seasoned movie-goers would share.There are fundamental flaws that Spidey 2 shows but still it remains a good movie for improvisation in the graphics, some really cool moves, a highly justified emotional struggle of Parker. I would rate it higher than Spidey 1 but still it left a lot of room for critical developments.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome sequel!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spider-Man 2 is an awesome sequel. I originally had no interest in seeing this films, as I was never a fan of comic books or movies based on them. But a couple of weeks go I saw the first Spider-Man movie and I loved it. So I had to watch the second one. And I wasn't disappointed in the least. It has all the elements the first one had; action, a great storyline, a great villain, a love story, betrayal, and superhero status. In this film, Spidey must save New York City from the indestructible Doc Ock, a.k.a. Dr. Otto Octavius, played to perfection by Alfred Molina. He's a scientist who constructs a Geo-thermal "sun" that sucks up everything in its path and will destroy NYC if it cannot be stopped. He becomes a tentacled monster after a science experiment with this "sun" goes terribly awry and these mechanical arms are fused to his spine. And he is out to get Spider-Man as well. Meanwhile, Peter Parker starts realizing his feelings for Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) as does she realizes her feelings for him. And he starts losing his desire to become Spider-Man and save the world after being a full time student, having a full time job, and dealing with the death of his uncle takes a toll on him. But when the Doc Ock kidnaps Mary Jane and threatens to do away with her, then Peter Parker realizes he's destined to be Spider-Man and that he's NYC's hero.The action sequences in this film are breathtaking. Especially the one scene involving Spidey and Doc Ock on top of a subway train. I loved Doc Ock the villain. He was genuinely a nice guy at first but once that experiment went awry he became evil and destructive. Alfred Molina was the perfect choice for that role. James Franco was great as always as Harry Norman, who is still out to avenge is father's death and find out who Spider-Man is. Kirsten Dunst was great as Mary Jane. I don't normally like her but she was sweet in this film. And Tobey Maguire is always great as Spider-Man. He has that boyish charm and boyish good looks and he makes you want him to be your hero! The only part of this film that I thought was a little disturbing and overly violent was when Doc Ock was being operated on in the hospital and his tentacles "came alive" and killed all the nurses and doctors. I thought that was a little too graphic and violent and would probably scare children. But that was relevant to give the viewer a little insight on what had happened to Dr. Octavius and what he has become. Anyway Spider-Man 2 is a great film and any fan of comic book films should watch this. And if you're not a fan of comic book films then you should watch it for the action. I loved this film and I'm glad I watched it. I'm such a fan of the Spider-Man films now! Thanks for reading my review.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, geeks unite. Spidey is superhuman, Otto Octavius isn't--he's a "high tech wonder" by Marvel's definition. When they tussle, Spidey hauls off at least two full power punches to Octavius's head....his HEAD! Any self respecting Spiderman fan knows those punches would knock Octavius Silly--to say nothing of the full force kick he withstands on top of th train moments later. The thing in the comic about Ock was that he beat Spiderman because Spiderman couldn't lay a hand on him--because of the arms.I'm no complainer, but the physical strength of Spiderman should never, ever be downplayed.Thor, Hulk, Thing, Wonderman? Sure. Not Doc Ock.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Comic Book Movie Ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spider-Man 2(2004)Starring: Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker/Spider-Man Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson James Franco as Harry Osborn Alfred Molina as Dr. Otto Octavius/Dr. OctopusPlot: Peter's life as Spider-Man is taking it's toll on his life as Peter Parker. His grades are slipping, his jobs aren't going well and he can barely make ends meet. On top of all that, his long time love Mary Jane is getting married to John Jameson because he can't make a commitment to her. And on top of all of *that*, Dr. Otto Octavius has an experiment go wrong which grafts four additional arms to his body, making him Dr. Octopus. Spidey's life is about to get rougher.So I sat down in my theater for something, I can't remember what, and all of a sudden I see Peter Parker on the screen. I knew immediately what was following. A scene from Spider-Man 2, featuring Doc Ock. As with my feelings when the original came out, I know also got to see a favorite villain of mine hit the screen. So this one had something new to it, in addition to being a sequel to one of my favorite movies of 2002.In a word, this movie is the best comic adaptation ever. No question about it. Batman Begins runs a very close second, but Spider-Man 2 is flawless, in my opinion. And now I'll tell you why.First of all, the story continues to amaze. You continue to feel for Peter and it's like we never left these characters when the movie gets going. The actors bring something new to the roles again instead of just playing on what they had to go on from the original. If there's a new aspect of a character's life, they play it. The main and supporting cast continue to shine in their roles, as they have grown more comfortable in them. We even get some surprise cameos from Cliff Robertson(Uncle Ben) and Willem Dafoe(Green Goblin)!Secondly, we get the wonderful Alfred Molina being cast and playing perfectly Doc Ock. Not only that, but he's far more fleshed out than the comics ever thought about making him. That's right, this would be the second time Sam Raimi improved on the source material(the first being natural web-shooters...yes, I said it). Doc Ock was a bad guy, and you wanted Spidey to win, but it clearly wasn't that simple. He was developed and you knew exactly why he was doing what he was doing, and it wasn't just because he was bad.Third, the Spider-Man: No More story was here, in full! It's one of the comic's best stories, and they don't fail to adapt it here. Also, Peter's love of Mary Jane grows more complicated, as he can't seem to decide between making himself happy and being Spider-Man. Finally, the visual effects and action sequences improve on the original and there's more to see. It's all about the train fight. That scene alone was well worth the money spent to see this(twice!)Spider-Man 2 is still my favorite comic-book adaptation, and also one of my favorite movies ever. It's just an amazing film and a movie I can watch over and over and never get tired of it. Highest Recommendation.Rating: ***** of *****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Even better than the first Spider Man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having been a long time fan of Spider Man, I can't help but feel connected to this series. Seeing the web-slinger up on the big screen was a day dream that I indulged in as a kid often enough while reading the comic books. I was thrilled with the first Spider Man film and after seeing this second installment, I'm pleased to say, I'm convinced the Spider Man movies are in good hands.Spider Man 2 takes the familiar characters and moves them forward in their aspirations and their troubles. This was why Marvel Comics have been so successful over the last thirty years - because they put so much of these human elements in their stories. Alfred Molina joins the group this time as Dr. Octopus. I have enjoyed Molina's work for a number of years now (mostly British productions) and was glad to see him slated to play Doc Oc. Tobey Maguire instills in the character of Peter Parker very convincingly, the very issues that someone thrust into such a destiny would be faced with, he's just a college kid and still going through the rigors of growing up. I love the scene where he has saved the people on the run-away train from certain destruction and passes out, lying on the floor of the train without his mask, when a bystander says with a tone of astonishment - "He's only a kid." Excellent touch.This film is not without its flaws - but very few. The scene where Spidey confronts Doc Oc and tells him that he has to destroy his invention for the sake of saving the city and its people, and the Doc simply replies - "Yeah, you're right." is a stretch to say the least (I don't remember Doc Oc necessarily being that compassionate in the comic book - and he always came back to wreak more havoc) But I won't knock the whole film because of this scene - its too well done in all the other areas. The effects are better and the fight scenes exciting and the tension between Peter and Harry grows. And even the Aunt May character continues to develop well in dealing with the loss of her husband. And I can't forget Kirsten Dunst as MJ who struggles with her feelings for Peter - her last line - "Go get'em Tiger is perfect for the set-up for the next film and is a line right out of the comic book. The visuals are the real appeal of this movie but the characters are believable and you identify with them immediately. Can't wait for Spider Man 3.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spider-Man has big troubles in this film. His major power has, like his uncle had predicted, led to ever greater responsibility for mankind. But as Spider-Man is not only Spider-Man but also the student Peter Parker, he has to study, he has to work to pay his long-overdue rent and he is troubled by the guilt for his dead uncle and by the secret love to Mary Jane. This emphasis on the personal troubles of Peter Parker getting along with being Spider-Man is one part of the secret why also the second film in the "Spider-Man" series works very well again. The second part is Alfred Molina's villain, and for that matter also the partly really astonishing action scenes. The train fight of Doc Ock and Spidey is one of the great action scenes in the last years. And, surprisingly, also the overly soapy dramatization of Peter and Mary Jane's romance does no harm and comes over as being pretty charming.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think it is the best film that I have ever seen. It's a bit like spider-man1. But it is better than that. Doc Ock is more powerful than the Green Goblin. It is more realistic than spiderman1.Spider-man2 taught us not to work for bad guys. Doc Ock works for Harry Osborn, who wants to kill spider-man. An experiment turns Doc Ock into a crazy but powerful creature. I will never work for the evils. It is important to have the virtues to guide us, so that we will not go wrong...The character that I like most is spider-man. He is a hero. He is more realistic than heros in other science fiction. His story is the most exceptional. He always does the the right things. He is always the best in my heart.</fullReview>

The computer graphics are also very good and it's just absolutely amazing how they made Doctor Octupus' tentacles come to life like that, especially in the awesome scenes like the scene where Spiderman and Doc Ock fight on a train. I was never really a Spiderman fan until this, even though the first movie was quite good. Judging from "Spiderman 2" I know "Spiderman 3" will be awesome, but probably not as good as "Spiderman 2", for me, this will always be one of the best if not the best movie I've ever seen. This movie is a must see and I recommend it to everyone, but watch the first movie first.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent super-hero movie that is essentially flawless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In "Spider-Man" we got the introduction, and now we get the story -- a darker, deeper, more poignant tale that defies the boundaries of comic book movies and dares to venture into the territory of motion picture excellence.The first "Spider-Man" was a very good movie, and one of my favorite films from 2002. It contained a sort of underlying complexity, surrounded by a simple cover that made it worthy of recommendation. The setup of Peter Parker's superhero powers was the most entertaining aspect of the movie, and its fight scenes were explosive in more ways than just one.Now, in "Spider-Man 2," the complexity becomes even more elaborate. The film takes on a dark edge that deals with the hero behind the mask -- Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire), the human being, not Spider-Man, the invincible superhero alter ego. The action is reduced to secondary importance; the characters take first place. It studies them, their motivations; what makes them tick. The first film didn't only introduce Spider-Man, but also his friends -- now, we sit back and watch their progression unfold on screen.Probably my favourite film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spiderman 2's predecessor set the scale for all of the other modern superhero movies to be made after it- at least for me.I think that the magic of the Spiderman series is that it is not a "superhero" movie as much as it is a "human" movie. A lot of the time in the first movie was spent developing Peter Parker's character as a person and his everyday life.That theme continues in Spiderman 2, with even more force. Peter begins to question whether or not saving the world is worth sacrificing the things that are important to him in his life. His job, his school, his friends, and most importantly, the long-time love of his life, Mary Jane Watson.Spiderman 2 stands out as a superhero movie that behaves more like a drama than an action movie- which is typical of a lot of second-rate superhero movies. It isn't all about the villains and the flashy battles scenes- though those remain.So in a way, the movie provides double-gratification. I get to enjoy all the unrealistic, fantasy elements of a superhero film without having to sacrifice a great plot- and even a carefully threaded in moral. There's something for everyone in Spiderman 2.As with the first movie, the acting remains excellent. Tobey Mcguire and Kirsten Dunst are still excellent as Spiderman and Mary Jane. James Franco's performance is actually stronger than it is in the original, with his behavior in a certain scene (which I cannot mention to avoid spoilers) particularly impressive.Even after seeing it a second time, Spider-man 2 is still my favorite movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spider-Man blew me away back in 2002! I loved it! Spider-Man 2, wow, it leaped over the first one with a single bound! (Superman pun intended) The acting is the best I've seen since Smallville, and Christopher Reeve! Sam Raimi didn't leave a single scene of his movie dead. I mean, in each scene, there is at least one or more humorous lines or actions, (same with the first Spider-Man.) Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst do it again! They are phenomenal! First off, I'm a hard core, flat out, dedicated Spider-Man junkie!!! I read the comics, grew up watching the 90's animated series, I used too wear Spider-Man costume pajama's too bed when I was like, eight, plus my bedroom is completely decked out with Spider-Man posters and merchandise. I am pretty much a Spidey know it all. Mary Jane Watson is my favorite character, from the comics. Kirsten Dunst, who happens too be my #1 and only, #1 and ONLY favorite actress, played, no, not played, SHE BROUGHT MJ TOO LIFE!!!! She was wonderful in the first, better in the second, and I know, just by seeing how wonderful of an actress she is, she's going too steal the show for the third film, (along with Tobey. I mean, who can blame ya, He's hysterical! He's right there with Christopher Reeve's humor as Clark Kent and Superman!) Tobey, wow, he is a gem. I've only seen his movie's Seabiscuit and Pleasantville. But, he is Spider-Man!!! If you enjoy Kirsten, you'll enjoy Jumanji, Little Women, Mona Lisa Smile, and, one of my personal favorite's next too Spidey....... The Tower of Terror! She is, truthfully, she is the only actress who makes me smile, just makes my day. So, too all you Spidey fans out there, watch Spider-Man 2!!!!! (Sam Raimi, the director of the films, his brother Tedd, plays the hysterical Hoffmann, who isn't in the comics.) ROCK ON TOBEY! ROCK ON KIRSTEN! ROCK ON SPIDER-MAN!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first thing I have to say about this movie is that it deserved the Oscar!!! Better then the first one and amazing story. The story of Spider-Man brought up on the big screen as a Oscar-winning movie is a result of the work that many other directors, actors and crew members couldn't have done.I saw the movie has a lot of drama and every time Peter prefers to save the people, but not himself. Nobody wanted to help him and he never let anybody get near him... Not even Mary Jane.But when he can't have anymore, his spider-powers leave him and Spider is gone... in that time the crime in New York raised amazingly, but it was nothing what he could do. His Aunt May told him that they need Spider-Man back, a hero like him is something to give the people a good example. And he also heard other people and children praying for him to return.After a time, his powers returned to him and he was again Spider-Man. First of all, e had to save Mary Jane from "Doc Ock" and there she discovers who Spider-Man really is... She wants to be with him, but he don't let her.The day Mary Jane gets married with John Jameson, she runs away and go to Peter's place. There they decide that they must risk everything and live their love.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An improvement over the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Much more mature than the first one, leading to a more interesting story and a better film overall. The drama surrounding Spider-Man is more fleshed out in this one, and the problems are more believable. Instead of just a cartoony action film, like the first one, this is a comic book film with a more compelling story and realistic characters, not to mention better action and a superior villain - though one not seen nearly enough. Some of the romance still needs work, though, and there are long stretches where nothing happens, scenes that would have been better served by including the villain and advancing the main plot. Still, this is an improvement over the first film, and a great movie.Though the main plot of the movie involves Spider-Man calling it quits, there are far too many scenes where he listens to long speeches from various characters swaying him one way or another. Although at least one of those is useful, and the dialogue is better written than in the original, far too much time is spent on scenes like this. Unfortunately, it only takes time away from the villain, Doc Ock, who is much more intriguing and better realized than the Green Goblin from the first film. There are also far too many scenes between Peter and MJ, and since they all seem to dissolve into "I love you, I love you not", some of then could have been easily done away with. Indeed, what the film is most lacking in is action, which is too bad, because it's fantastic when it shows up. Though the special effects still need some work, it's a vast improvement, and the action is both exhilarating and central to the plot.Another improvement over the first film would be in the acting department. Tobey Maguire managed to lose some of his goofiness, although it still pops up periodically, and he's more than able in serious dramatic scenes; Kirsten Dunst is still not a good actress, but she's better, and can at least attempt some serious scenes; James Franco gives pretty much a one-note performance, as an angry, brooding villain-to-be; and J.K. Simmons is as hilarious as he was the first time around. But the real stand out this time around is Alfred Molina as Doc Ock - not over-the-top like Willem Dafoe in the first one, but simultaneously evil and pitiable. The only thing disappointing about his performance is that there isn't more of it - one of the main problems with the movie. The mechanical arms are perfectly realized, and the fight scenes between him and Spidey are spectacular. His character is so interesting that it is fitting, then, when he ultimately redeems himself and saves the day, instead of Spidey.Overall, an improvement over the first film, but still not a perfect film. It is still one of the top comic book films, but it spends far too much time on a poorly told romance and not enough on a intriguing villain. Still, the story is interesting, the action is fantastic, and the characters are believable. A nice lead in to the final (?) chapter in the trilogy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While the first attempt at the remake of Spiderman itself was quite excellent, this movie does go even further and what one would normally think as being a huge task and something very difficult to achieve, has been fully done in this movie. Perhaps the only area where it was slightly disappointing is that the villain is actually a good guy and his tentacles supposedly control his brain which is somewhat unrealistic and looks tailor made to fit the story and situation. Even so, it must be mentioned that the same is relatively minor compared to the overall goodness of the movie. Action = 10/10, Cinematography = 10/10, Screenplay = 10/10, Acting = 10/10, Story = 8/10, Music and Sound Effects = 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I feel that this movie is somehow special. It starts of some time after the first movie and shows Peter Parkers struggle with both trying to have a day job, mixed with school and of course being Spider-Man. What makes this movie special is the great mix of well acted characters with great action and feel throughout the whole movie, while it also has some cool references to old Sci-Fi flicks (but only in the feel of some scenes). Although there are some annoying faults in this movie (which you probably won't notice)it all weighs up great by the moving scenes(both action and drama actually) and the fact that it actually is based on a comic. Anyway a true must-see!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While the first Spider-Man flick served most as a launch pad for the franchise to come, this sequel is where the action and story come together to form a clever pack of whoopa$s. The chosen villain this time is the mechanically tentacled Doctor Octavius a.k.a. Dr. Octopus a.k.a. Doc Ock (imagine Beavis or Butt-head trying to read that last one and cue the snickering) played by the ever-so-cool Alfred Molina. Now that Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire, in the role he was born for) has decided he's Spider-Man, this movie shows him get carried away and cocky with his alter ego. This sets him up to learn the harsh lesson that he can't be everywhere he's needed, whether it's to see Mary Jane perform in an excruciatingly boring play or to save a cute little girl from a burning building. My favorite scene is everything that happens on the subway train; the fight, the visual effects, the rescue, the pleasant fantasy of an unplanned gathering of completely nice and understanding New Yorkers - I like it all. The Spider-Man films have captured a slightly corny magic with realism that fit the comic book genre as snug as spandex, but this one vastly looms over the first mainly for the revelation punch it packs at the end. I wish I could have seen the smile creator Stan Lee wore the first time he saw this work of art.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*only minor spoilers ahead* This was basically a very well made flick. The first one built much for this one, and now we could see Spider-man controlling his powers better. From the start, you can see that the camera drives, the action, just about everything is great to watch.The spider-man humor is still there, as are Peter Parker's problems with school, life and girls. It all works well, though I can understand if someone doesn't like these aspects of the movie. But, it's pretty faithful to the comics and delivers some fun scenes, some relaxed scenes, and also pretty serious stuff, as Peter is still fighting with his conscience. It builds up the character nicely, and raises some real-life questions for everyone.OK, that's it. What about the action? Perfect! Spidey flies like he's never flown before, and the camera drives, acrobatics and stunts are just huge. Almost every little action scene has something truly innovative. I love some of the scenes when spider-man uses his web in many different ways, and he does that a lot - and that provides us some very good looking action. There are tons of different aspects of the action that can be praised. The scenes are just nothing short of impressive.The bad guy, starring Ralph Molina, does great. Dr. Octopus was always my favourite bad guy. As many things, he was not exactly like in the comics - and why should he be? It works for the movie very well.My only complaint is, that I would have loved to see more action. I'm not saying that there was too little of it, I'm just saying it was so good that I can't get enough of it.Also, the movie gets a little darker that the first one. And that's not bad.Sam Raimi has done to Spider-man what Bryan Singer to the X-men.Can't wait for the third one...if there is going to be things like Venom or the Sandman, it's going to be hard for Raimi to pull it off. Green Goblin and Doc Ock were at least scientifically explained, at least to a point. But as long as it's Raimi, we should not doubt much.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spider-Man 2, by Will May 30, 2006.Spider-Man 2 begins with Peter Parker struggling to be both a superhero and a normal citizen. He believes that his crime fighting is getting in the way of his job and his relationship with Mary Jane, and he is right. All the while, an experiment goes horribly wrong and Dr. Otto Octavious is is put at the mercy of four mechanical arms welded to his skin....Confusing I know, but if you want it to make sense, you need to rent the film! "Doc Oc" and his metal arms plot to finish his failed science project, in an attempt to create a renewable energy source. What he does not realize is that his experiment could possibly destroy half of Manhattan. Spider-Man must stop Doc Oc before he destroys the city, and either accept or reject his identity as a superhero."Spider-man 2" takes a more intellectual route to the characters than the original, but still has it's good action sequences.Nominated for three 2004 Academy Awards, Spider-Man 2 thrives as an amazing action film with good character development. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If there is a list of ways you don't expect the sequel to an $800mil-grossing action-fantasy to start, then right up there near the top, perhaps around second or first, is seeing a superhero on pizza delivery. But after a brief reminder about Pete's crush and a heads-up that MJ didn't at the conclusion of the previous movie catch on to his dual identity crisis, that's exactly what we see. A bystander watches Parker disappear off into a sidestreet, pizzas in hand, and a moment later Spider-man emerges from the same alley with the same pizzas. The bystander's conclusion? "Hey! He stole that guy's pizza!" The writing team are tipping their hat to the ground rule that once again no one will ever realise that Clark Kent and Superman are never in the same room at once. For the brief moments with Spidey swinging up there among the rooftops again we'll wonder if that was what we enjoyed most the first time.But then minutes later we're back in the cozy still-60s office of J. Jonah Jameson and the laughs are once again coming thick and fast. His secretary ducks in. "Jonah, your wife's on line one, she says she lost your credit card." Jonah booms gleefully back: "Thanks for the good news!" Pete's soon arguing for more cash, saying things are tough at the moment. "Awww," Jonah replies with mock concern. "Miss Brant," he bellows out to his secretary, who immediately ducks in looking expectant: "get me a violin!" We think no. Maybe this was what we enjoyed most the first time.But soon Pete's entering the door of his old home. "Surprise!" come three voices in unison. The smiling faces of Harry, MJ and Aunt May are there. It's a major nostalgiac high, seeing them all again. MJ is dressed like a grownup now and Rosemary Harris has lost none of her charm. Harry has grown roughly three feet. The sullen, troubled youth is gone and we're beholding what looks like an action hero or a rock star. The clouds darken soon after as the tragedies of Uncle Ben and Norman Osborne are re-affirmed, both of these best friend's having lost a father. Especially with his remaining unrequited love for MJ still hanging over him, Spider-man is preventing Pete from being true in any of the most important relationships in his life. A whole movie of development awaits!!! Nope. Sorry Jonah, I wanna stay here for a while. Don't take it too hard if you find yourself feeling like that for the rest of the movie. The weirdest thing about being hooked within 15 minutes is that there isn't even a villain yet. But that soon enough? Apparently with part 1 they had tried to include the ambivalent scraper-scaling vixen Black Cat but discovered that they had so much story to get through with Goblin. With part 2 they tried the same thing. Doc Ock was slated as the ideal follow-up villain and once again they were going to get out the black lycra and bon bons but, you guessed it, again, too much story. Spidey 2 is a solid two hours. It's clear very early on that this movie is going to be both very busy and very entertaining for every second of that. You could say another tragic, science-gone-wrong villain was a safety measure but as Arad says, that personal connection Pete has with all of his enemy's is invaluable. There was little time for delay in the first flick but this time we get to explore these relationships and enjoy about 5 parts drama to 1 part action. That's the dynamite of this caper. Some of the set-pieces though are: a classic bank-robbery scene, enough wall-clinging acrobatics and punch-ups, a elevated train Spidey-Ock fight sequence, a token street-crime foiling or two and a classic emergence scene for the eight-limbed Doc Ock. A thought is that we may have just farewelled the best Spidey-villain yet, but by the end of the movie we're only anticipating the third chapter a whole lot more, though many might be a little ashamed for having survived all those years of Jane Austin and the soaps only to fall hard for this ensemble.With so much current fan-focus regarding Spidey 3 being on what villains it'll have, the true delight will be remembering on that grand day that the best moments of part 2 were the final ones, and they didn't involve a fight or a foe. Telling, could it be, that they signed Elizabeth "Peggy Brant" Banks on so soon? Hopefully 3 will raise the bar yet again in drama, taking Pete to brand new places and not fumble in delivering generously on part II's numerous establishments and potentials. Given my choice I wouldn't have brought Venom into the first trilogy. To begin with he's a completely different universe, but more importantly he was part of a whole saga (minus the planet) without which he might hardly be Venom. The fact that he's a big enough crucible to justify an entire movie standalone would indeed make him a useful pillar in a movie that was very busy otherwise, but it would also make him a wasted potential (great choice of actor if word is right though - making the journalist convincing and interesting is more important than the demon ? Rock and Diesel would have been bad ideas). It sounds like Manwolf is in too, certainly they'll need John to get Venom anyway. But how are they meant to carry Pete &amp; MJ, Harry's tormented rise, John Jameson's affliction and the Eddie Brock backstory all in one movie? It shouldn't feel like a constant onslaught of developments like a certain recent third-chapter sci-fi. Space is premium is Spider-man flicks and the movie has to retain itself. They've established great drama as the attraction. I'm glad they wanted to take their time nutting this one out, but latest evidence indicates no limit to their capability.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spiderman 2 is just amazing. Even the titles are great (thanks to Mr. Alex Ross). Nice production, perfect timing, moments for drama or action, moments for romanticism, and some astonishing special effects. Spiderman 2 is one of those movies that worth the money they've spent on it. Sam Raimi has finally left behind the shadow of "Evil Dead" and makes clear that you can count on him to do anything (specially if you want to see a man jumping' from one NY building to another).Tobey Maguire perfectly plays the spider-man, and Kirsten Dunst is still MJ, Spiderman's beloved. They two make a wonderful couple. This time Alfred Molina plays the wicked one, and it's nice to see him playing such a different role (from those he uses to play).Cinema and comics have never get on well, but sometimes there's a perfect connection between them: Tim Burton's first "Batman", The Crow, and, of course, this Spiderman.My rate: 7.5/10</fullReview>

James Franco did well, also, although he didn't have too big of a part. Kirsten Dunst, well, I don't really like her, but she was okay. Her acting sucks, but once in awhile it's not bad. Alright, so the movie is about a 9.1/10 until it gets up to Mary Jane's wedding. After that, it is a HUGE clich. She left her fianc and ran happily and gaily through the streets to her "man". I mean she had the dumbest smile on her face and as she was running through the streets her hair was blowing back in the wind and she ran, ran, ran to Peter,told him she would love him no matter what and that they should to be together, blah, blah, blah ...

		<shortDescription>The best of the trilogy, a great superhero movie - 84%</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everybody's favourite wall-crawler returns for a second outing, though let me say from the start that Spidey isn't my favourite hero. Never being a big comic reader, I'm going by movies and on that basis alone then the first "Batman" film stands as my yardstick. Anyway, Batman would kick Spiderman's arse into the middle of the next issue! But that's not the point - Spiderman just isn't as appealing to me as the Dark Knight. However, one of my favourite villains has always been Dr Octopus so that was justification enough to get the DVD. And he's miles better than the Green Goblin...Enough of the fan-boy language - there's a review to write! Tobey Maguire reprises as Peter Parker, the geeky student and part-time photographer for the Daily Bugle. Two years after the first film and things are getting a bit rough. Due to his constant dashing off to "save the world" (actually, catching a few bag snatchers), Parker's life is in turmoil. His unrequited love for Mary-Jane (Kirsten Dunst) is getting him nowhere, Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) is having severe monetary trouble and his grades are slipping. Parker decides that enough is enough and jacks in his crime-fighting career. Unfortunately, others aren't so keen for the web-slinger to retire. Dr Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina) is having a spot of bother with four mechanical limbs and the son of the deceased Norman Osborn, Peter's friend Harry (James Franco), is determined to get his revenge.No doubt about who this film belongs to. Molina is brilliant as Dr Octopus (who I always thought was German, not English) and the mechanics of the character, so to speak, are fantastic. He is a genuinely menacing creation, much scarier than the Green Goblin. Maguire is also very good at being Parker but somehow not as good being Spiderman. He looks too much of a geek so when he tries to look tough or angry, he just looks silly. But Parker spends much more time on screen than the wall-crawler because this is more about what goes on behind the mask. The impact on everyone and everything in Parker's life is substantial, as you'd expect and this is probably the first time a superhero has appeared to be human since Michael Keaton's portrayal of Batman in the first film of that series. Dunst seems too big for the part, being far too good an actress in an ordinary "love interest" role. Special mention must go to J.K. Simmons as Bugle editor Jameson, as it is a remarkable likeness - everything you'd expect plus a surprising good sense of comic timing.Where it falls down, for me, is the over-reliance on CGI. This is probably unavoidable if they wanted to banish the memory of those awful TV shows in the Eighties ("Yeah, just tilt the camera on the side and he's walking up walls, see?"). But you can have too much of a good thing, a point that was raised when I recently watched the two Matrix sequels. It can take over and the thrill you should get when Spidey swings between moving traffic or chases Doc Ock (and that shortening of the name is a terrible idea!) down the streets of New York is missing because you know you're watching a trumped-up cartoon. Harsh, maybe but it's a fact. The CGI is also very obvious in places, another bad aspect that really should have been dealt with in post production. But in spite of these flaws, the film does have several good points. It's loaded with references to other comics and films (even including a chain-saw for those fans of director Raimi's "Evil Dead") and has a deft comic feel throughout. Though I doubt that Peter Parker would clean his outfit at a laundrette somehow! And against my feelings towards him, Spiderman comes across as a genuine hero - one which has weaknesses in all the right places. He feels human and that could be what makes him so popular with the general public. I still prefer Batman (how can anyone not fall in love with the first Bat-mobile?) but at least I have a smidge of respect of the web-slinger now. Trouble is, who will he deal with next? Venom would be a good baddie in my eyes, probably the only time I've liked Spidey over Batman.Even if you're not a fan, you should still see this movie. "Spiderman 2" is, at long last, an intelligent superhero film that produces a classic bad guy to face a shaky hero - the sort of odds I like! It's also a surprisingly good date movie with strong romantic themes running throughout. Sure, it has its drawbacks but they don't detract too much from your overall enjoyment of the film. And trust me, it's so much better than "Daredevil"...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alvin Sargent, the rather thoughtful scribe who penned intimate, more cerebral movies like Streisand's "Nuts" and the arguably seminal family dysfunction-o-rama "Ordinary People," is a brilliant choice to pen Spidey 2, which digs far deeper into the web slinger's interior struggle as both a man and an Ubermensch--apologies to Nietzsche not forthcoming. There are few laugh-out-loud moments in the movie and at points I found it rather dreary--but then that is what is required. Peter Parker is hit left and right with one thing after another as he explores and is subsumed by his full-tilt existential crisis. We are at once amazed--yet not surprised--that he "gives up" the suit, but really it is a conceit that permits him to find his true self, which is of course that of Spiderman. His willing vulnerability is refreshing among cookie-cutter superhero movies and it is portrayed without too much ham or groping for a humorous effect. The sterling Maguire is apt for the role of the webbed one again and, though sometimes I find his eminent likability undermines the range of emotion he is called upon to explore, generally he seems to pull it off.The movie is squarely on his shoulders throughout and Mary Jane (Dunst) seems nearly relegated to the fringe, though she is clearly Peter's center. All the action, emotion, etc. rests on Maguire. J.K. Simmons' portrayal of the irreverent, fast-talking J. Jonah Jameson has to qualify as one of the funniest characters in film in the last 10 years. He deserves a Nobel Prize for humor. If there is any comic relief in S2, it's him by a long mile. It's hard to believe he's the same guy who portrays the somber police psychiatrist on the "Law &amp; Order" series.I found Molina's Doctor Octavius somewhat less involving than the Green Goblin, perhaps because much of the action/fight sequences--which were excellent, of course--seemed wrapped up in Spidey's internal struggles and were not just about mano-e-mano. The "scientific" aspect of a man controlling a fusion reaction with a fancy spinal-fused techno-suit in the open air seemed bafflingly stupid to me, but, hey, it's Hollywood and what do I know about nuclear physics anyway?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spider-Man 2 Outspins The First (tiny little spoilers, maybe one larger)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As much as I liked the first Spiderman, it pales in comparison to the sequel. This version has more action, more emotion, and better CGI. Tobey Maguire and James Franco push the emotional envelope here, with Kirsten Dunst offering the same reliable performance that she did in the first. Alfred Molina replaces William DeFoe as Spiderman's main adversary, although DeFoe gets a short but emotionally packed cameo. The movie opens two years after the end of first film, and things have changed for the better for Mary Jane ("MJ") Watson, but not for poor Peter Parker. He is still trying to sell pictures of Spiderman to newspaper editor J. Jonah Jameson with little success. His housing situation has been downgraded since the first film, now that he is no longer rooming with wealthy Harry Osborne (who has moved into his late father's mansion). Peter is failing his college classes, and has to take a job as a pizza delivery person (from which he is fired five minutes into the movie) to survive. Meanwhile, MJ has a lead in a major play (posters featuring her face are all over NYC), and soon becomes engaged to an astronaut. Conflicted and depressed by his inability to balance daily life and the world of the superhero, Peter must decide whether to continue to do good as Spiderman or leave it all behind to be with M.J. His struggle forms the heart of the movie, and Raimi deals with it nicely until the last scene of the movie, in which I feel he takes the easy way out (although the DVD commentary suggests that Sam Raimi and Tobey Maguire both found the last scene powerful). I hope that I am not giving too much away when I say that the closing scene lacks the emotional courage that the closing of the first movie had. All in all, though, an outstanding effort with many memorable moments.As far as adversaries go, I liked Doc Ock more than the Green Goblin, maybe partly because Doc's legs had personalities of their own, whereas the glider was just a form of transportation, and partly because I felt sorrier for Dr. Octavius than I did for Norman Osborne. The battles between Doc Ock and Spiderman were more intense, partly because Spiderman seemed more comfortable with his powers than in Spiderman 1. The audience also got to see more of Peter Parker as Spiderman, but without the mask. I, for one, always felt the mask was somewhat inhibiting, since it was easy to forget the humanity of the character of Spiderman when Peter disappeared behind those emotionless fabric eyes. I can hardly wait until Spiderman 3.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The main story of this sequel is similar to that of Superman 2 - the disaffection with supernatural gifts leads to soul searching and then a crowd-pleasing resolution. Only where Clark Kent demobs to be in love, Peter Parker bins the lycra because of it. The strength of this movie is that love cannot be suppressed. With this subtle difference to the Superman sequel, the film has a built in inevitability to its structure that allows it to really take some time to examine the dilemmas peculiar to the idea and characters.The problems, such as they are, come with the contrived nature of the way in which they're put. The acting's OK, but it's constrained - railroaded, if you like, by the ideology of the film-making. In fact, given the narrative tubthumping, the cast do a good job. I would really have liked to see more development of the unrequited interest of the landlord's daughter for the impecunious Parker - but quite reasonably, when there's only so much time in a superhero blockbuster, if in doubt stick in another action sequence. Yeah, they weren't too bad either 5.5/10</fullReview>

I know that there is a story to tell, but the comics weren't this boring so why should the movie be? Another problem with Spiderman 2 is that everything that was computer generated LOOKED computer generated. Even Spidey himself looked fake. Doc Ock looked fake, his arms and anything they were holding. In fact, the only things that looked real were anything that WEREN'T in a scene with Spidey or Doc Ock. It was almost like the writer was TRYING to write a big budget movie, not a movie that payed homage to Spidey. I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm glad I didn't pay money to see this movie, because I would've felt robbed if I had.1*</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spidey Rules</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my opinion, this was the first summer 2004 blockbuster. I have seen Spiderman-2 (2004) in theaters 3 times. It is a rarity that I see a motion picture that many times in the theatre. In fact, I think the last instance I did such a thing was when I saw 1989's Back to the Future part 2.This movie is excellent. It has all of the good things a movie is supposed to have. As customary, I headed get hot wings and Rocky Mountain Oysters after seeing it the first time, so I could really digest the film. As the wing sauce covered my face and hands, burning my lips, the impact of the movie started to take affect. The 'burn the seams off of a baseball hot' hot wings coupled with my recollection of the film made me start to sweat. And sweat joy for Spidey 2 did I.The movie had story. To avoid any spoilers, I will comment judiciously. While the film was chalked full of too many 'B-Movie' moments of camera staring, hands flailing terror screams, the mixture of comedy, action, drama and overall narrative is what makes this picture great.Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) wrestles with himself in this movie. He grapples with the fact that he is Spiderman, his super powers have been acting up, he loves Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) and doesn't want her to get hurt, he's behind on his college school work, his aunt is going through financial woes while he himself is penniless living in a dump owned by a rodent-eyed Russian immigrant with a cake-baking, Peter Parker liking and obscenely thin daughter. Maguire had a tall order to fill with this role. Peter Parker gets pooped on multiple ways. Nothing seems to go right with his life. Along with the great story are some spectacular actions sequences of Spidey web slinging through New York and a train sequence fight that is downright breathtaking. Alfred Molina as Otto 'Doc Ock' Octavious was the perfect villain with freakish mechanical arms grafted to his body. His character was human and at heart a good guy. James Franco as Parker's best irritating friend Harry Osborn reminded me of the whiny Hayden 'Anakin Skywalker' Christensen. I could do without Franco's character altogether. His very presence made me shudder with pain.One highlight of the picture was the scene-stealing J.K. Simmons as Daily Bugle editor J. Jonah Jameson. Mr. Jameson invigorated the screen with witty dialogue and comic relief. It was a delight to see the charisma he exhibited on the screen. He is a classic editor in the film genre. Did you know that J.K. Simmons is the voice of the yellow M&amp;M on the television commercials?Bruce Campbell of Evil Dead and Bubba Ho-tep fame made a surprising cameo as the Snooty Usher. Campbell was also in the first Spiderman as the Wrestling Ring Announcer.I loved Spiderman 2. It was hundreds of times better than the first movie. I saw it again. And again. If you like a combination of action, drama, comedy and slight horror, see it on the big screen today. And when they retool it for Imax, see it there as well. Oh and Catwoman looks thoroughly stupid so if you see it I will never speak to you again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really did not like the original, especially the sfx it always looked like Spiderman was glowing in the dark. And some of his moves were unrealistic. Having said that from the super hype surrounding the movie I thought I would give it a shot. Knowing that the hype would most likely sink the film. I was wrong this is a mean piece of action, that rivals any of the greatest action films of all time. Scenes will have you clutching the arms on your chair or pulling your feet up. This film is really that good. A bit little long at a few points but those moments are almost unnoticeable, compared to the spectacular pacing. Acting and the sfx are fixed. Man I love a good surprise. And this is a surprise indeed.note: You really want to see this one in the theater, don't wait for DVD ( 10 out of 10 )</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>To Be or Not to Be ? Spiderman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like Shakespeare?s Hamlet, Peter Parker aka Spiderman (Tobey McGuire) has problem. Like many young people (and even some older ones) the biggest question in his life is "who am I?"This has got to be a difficult question for a superhero, especially one as young and confused as Peter Parker."He lives in another reality," says his childhood sweetheart Mary Jane Watson, aka MJ (Kirsten Dunst).Should he hide himself under his Spidey suit and save the world, or should he chuck it all and go to college so he can get a real job and marry MJ?These are some of the ultimate questions being asked in Spiderman 2, the second installment in what is a worthy sequel to 2002?s Spiderman. But there is more to this film than Spiderman?s problems - everyone has to deal with similar issues - the good guys and the bad.The film opens with a bang as Peter Parker, working as a pizza delivery boy,is late for work again. (It's hard to save the world and hold a job at the same time.)He?s given one more chance to deliver a bunch of pizzas uptown in 12 minutes. The scenes of Spiderman whipping around the steel and glass canyons of Manhattan holding a stack of pizza boxes is a joy to watch and a special effects tour de force ? and it only gets better.Parker is broke. He's way behind on his rent, he has no job and he's about to be bounced from university because he's never there. The only way he can make any money is by selling pictures of Spiderman to cigar-chomping,headline hustling newspaper editor J. Jonah Jameson (J.K. Simmons). But that's not all: the bank is foreclosing on Aunt May?s house and MJ is thinking of marrying Jameson's astronaut son John (Daniel Gillies). Even though he's still afraid to tell MJ he loves her, he knows he can?t live without her. He feels his whole life slipping away just because he's Spiderman. Things are so bad his Spiderman suit even ruins his laundry!If that wasn?t bad enough a brilliant scientist, Otto Octavius (a powerful Alfred Molina) has bitten off more than he can chew by inventing the perfect fusion-based energy source that needs four metal arms grafted on to his spine to help control the reaction. "It's like holding the power of the sunin the palm of my hands," he says as his experiment backfires much to the detriment of everybody involved ? oops.Thus is created Doctor Octopus or Doc Ock. He can climb buildings, throw four people around at once (as in the brilliant hospital sequence) and hates the interfering Spiderman whom he fights relentlessly for much of the film.Spiderman 2 works so well because it blends reality and science fiction effortlessly. The main characters are all fully drawn, each with their own distinct personalities and problems. The so-called superhero questions his so-called life and the villains are the victims of their own self-imposed good intentions.At the same time the film is a soaring visual effects feast with amazing stunts and set pieces. The best of these has to be the heart-stopping runaway train sequence and the time Parker, as Parker and not Spiderman, saves the life of a child in a burning building.The acting is first-rate with McGuire playing a difficult part with passionate dexterity and a fine physical presence. Dunst does her best to keep up, Jameson is his usual scene-stealing self, and James Franco as Harry Osborne still wants revenge on Spiderman for killing his dad, but it's Molina as Doctor Octopus who gives Spiderman 2 its soul. A peace-loving scientist with only the best of intentions is transformed into a power-mad lunatic who, like everyone in the film, is given a choice at the end between living their dreams or doing what's right.Rosemary Harris is excellent as Aunt May and says it best when she tells Peter, "Sometimes to do what's right we have to give up the things we want the most, even our dreams."The special effects in Spiderman 2 are more elaborate and exciting than those in the first film thanks to magical work by special effects master John Dykstra ("2001" "Silent Running"). Each of Doc Ock's mechanical arms seem to have personalities all their own and the battles on the tops and sides of skyscrapers are masterpieces of Dykstra?s art.Director Sam Raimi has done it again. Since his first Evil Dead films through the extraordinary anti-superhero film "Darkman" to "Simple Plan" "The Gift" and 2002?s " "Spiderman" Raimi has been a storyteller first and an action director second. With Spiderman 2 he has made one of the best superhero films ever, in a genre that is littered with stinkers like "The Punisher" and "Daredevil."Just one minor peeve though: if all metal objects are pulled into the vortex of Doc Ock?s massive experiment, how come the Doc and his metal arms don?t go too? There is a lot of depth here and some very emotional moments as when Peter Parker, like Hamlet, begs the big question:"Am I not supposed to have what I want, what I need?" he cries hopelessly."What am I supposed to do?"That is the question.(Don't worry, in Spiderman 2 we get the answers.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a piece of garbage.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen both Spider-Man movies. I saw part 2 with the intention of it making up for how bad the first film was......Whew! What a piece of S***! I couldn't bare to watch any of it, due to such bad CGI. The sound editing was so obnoxious, it blew me out of my seat. And what's the point of even hiring actors anymore? 80% of the film was just CGI'ed versions of Maguire and Molina! I just watched the original SUPERMAN again tonight, and WOW, what a great comic book movie. That's how you make a man fly. That's believable. These "filmmakers" today are lazy. Too pampered with their little lap-top computers. Lucas started this nonsense back in '99 with Jar Jar, and it's now just out of hand. Try watching EMPIRE again, and look at how great the stop-motion AT-ATs look, or try the Alien Queen puppet from Cameron's ALIENS. Class acts, worth every minute of production and it paid off come Oscar time. I believe that the animators Spider-Man 2 will be staying home Oscar night.Get part 3 out and get it over with. American audiences have zero attention span and will go see whatever garbage is offered to them. What a horrible year for film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than the first (although that's not saying much)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story quality improves by leaps and bounds thanks to writers Michael Chabon, Alvin Sargent, Stan Lee (who wrote the issue of "Amazing Spider-Man" that this movie used as a springboard). A more loose, playful and energetic direction by Sam Raimi (with the camera occasionally becoming a character itself in this movie), a wider and more cinematic aspect ratio (you truly get the widescreen feel) and a different cinematographer all help "Spider-Man 2" get away from the boring, unreal, and static "Country Crock Spread commercial" look and feel of the original movie.Performances are fine, with everyone generally performing better than the original (the main villain, while inspired by one of Spider-Man's lesser villains in the comics is not played as broadly as Dafoe's rendition of the "Green Goblin", which grated on my nerves with subsequent viewings and is strictly for the kiddies. Molina does justice to the character, despite limited screen time), except for Kirsten Dunst, although perhaps neither Chabon nor Sargent can effectively write female characters (and anyone who wants to point to "Ordinary People" in defense of Sargent after that last statement will automatically be directed to both Judith Guest's source novel and actress Mary Tyler Moore's performance itself). The relationship between Peter Parker and Mary Jane still remains flat and unconvincing (possibly because no one making the major creative descisions got.... in high school...oh never mind).Elfman's score is still lousy, and I still prefer "Batman", "Batman Returns" and "Superman" and "Superman II" over this. Spider-Man 2 takes itself way too seriously with neither the crazy, Gothic, and comic imagination of Tim Burton to offset the heavy handed drama, nor an actor in a major role of Christopher Reeve's caliber who played that toughest and most one-dimensional of heroes and made him "real"-Rest in Peace, Mr. Reeve. The movie is occasionally so full of itself that its becomes laughable; the arch theatricality of scenes like Harry unmasking Spider-man and discovering-to his horror-that its Peter Parker play like a scene from Shakespeare performed by the Power Rangers. Sorry guys, there's only so far that you can go when people dress in costumes like these, and then you have to pull back and know how to crack a smile (not a self conscious wink).Still, its better than the original, and its, generally speaking, a good movie. I give it three stars and a mild recommendation for viewers over thirty five.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>better than the first, great visual effects</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved this film, both for plot and for characters interactions. Furthermore, the emotional tone of the story, along with the excellent acting and visual effects, makes it one of the best super-hero movies ever. What I appreciated the most is the ability to show Peter Parker's pain and suffering for being this great hero, unable to live a normal life and to love the beautiful Kirsten Dunst. Tobey Maguire is really convincing and impressive in his role, as the nerd guy turned into a hero; Raimi depicts greatly his sensitivity and vulnerability and makes him integrate flawlessly with MJ, who, in spite of her worldwide success,always gets to be the next-door beauty. I liked even the first spiderman, but unlike usually this sequel outdoes the original in every way.</fullReview>

Oh and while we're on this topic, that song is one of my FAVORITES)(If you want more articles, just go to google and type in 'Spiderman 2 Strings' and you'll get more articles)But, when I checked the soundtrack, it's not on there. And not even any of the soundtrack reviews/reviewers mentioned 'Strings' or 'a foreign-language song'. This is eating me up. Can someone help me figure this out?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I believe there's a hero in all of us.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I launch into my review of this movie, I'd like you (the reader) to know a few things: 1. I have never read a Spiderman comic book before. 2. I'm NOT a fan of action/superhero movies. 3. I'm NOT an immature thirteen-year-old who watched this movie for the pure purpose of seeing Tobey Maguire shirtless. But, I wouldn't mind. Hehe. 4. I have a brain. A working one.Okay, so, getting on with this review...I saw the first Spiderman movie and I could not believe how amazing it was! So, naturally, I was quite excited when I found out about Spiderman 2.The basic synopsis is this: it's two years after Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) gained his superhuman powers after getting bitten by a radioactive spider. He's failing college, his Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) isn't doing too well, his best friend, Harry Osbourn (James Franco), is obsessed with finding Spiderman to avenge his father, and of course, Parker can't tell the love of his life, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), that he's Spiderman.Alas, woe is Peter. Tobey Maguire's acting has this special little spark that makes you really empathize with him. Of course, Parker's life will probably never happen to me. But, there was something about the way Tobey played Peter that made me really connect with his character. James Franco plays brilliantly as his character, Harry Osbourn, slowly goes insane with his crazy obsession over Spiderman. Kirsten Dunst is delicious as Mary Jane Watson. Even though she becomes engaged, you can tell that she knows that Peter is the one that she loves and she's trying to cover it up. Kirsten Dunst wonderfully portrays that angst within, which is quite a challenge for even the best actresses out there. Rosemary Harris was probably the most inspirational character in this movie. She delivers this inspiring and heart-touching speech where she tells Peter about heroes and what it means to be one.Ah, but who can forget about the infamous villain? Alfred Molina plays Dr. Otto Octavius. However, the villain is just as complex as the superhero. After his mechanical arms are permanently welded onto his body, he says, "These monsters should be at the bottom of the river. Along with me." He isn't necessarily evil. He's just like Spiderman. They're both motivated by a single purpose, which leads them to do what they do.In Spiderman 2, Spiderman is much less of a comic book figure and more of an actual human with superhuman powers. The effects and fight scenes are mind-blowing and breath-taking. I was cutting off my brother's circulation in his arm during the intense fight scenes. There was so much chemistry between the actors, especially Mary Jane and Peter Parker, you could almost see bubbles rising and popping.All in all, Spiderman 2 was an inspirational film. At the end, the movie made me feel so wonderful and whole. It was more than just a film. It's an inspiration for people who've hit rock bottom and need to realize that the only way left is up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Hugely Entertaining Film that Challenges Our Values</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spider Man IIHere are some challenging questions posed in this film:  Is it all right to commit an evil act as a means to an end that is very good?  Can we defeat evil with diplomacy, rather than force?  Is it OK to lie to someone you love to protect him or her?  Can you renege on a promise to a deceased ancestor if you now see that the pledge is no longer good for you?  If the person you meant to destroy turns out to be a trusted friend, what do you do?  Should you marry someone who constantly flirts with danger like a racecar driver or astronaut?Few films ask these questions, and when they do, we expect the director to be a Woody Allen, David Mamet, Ingmar Bergman or Spike Lee, and the film to be a serious work of art. But these questions are all raised in Spiderman II. Believe it!Make no mistake that this movie delivers special effects, heroism, and exciting chase scenes. But the real payoffs for me were the cosmic questions posed above. The story is standard fare of an evildoer (to borrow Bush's expression) who wrecks havoc in order to monopolize a chemical needed to develop a super energy source. At first, he's a world-renown scientist (Alfred Molina, now playing Tevya in Fiddler on the Roof on Broadway) until his experiment backfires and turns him into an eight-limbed monster known as Doc Ock (for Octopus). It's then Spiderman's job to disarm him.None of the characters, however, are stereotyped as good and bad guys. All have personalities that reveal the good and bad in all of us, and each is challenged at some point to make a moral decision of great consequence. That these questions can even be framed for us to consider would in itself make the film worthwhile.The main actors, Spiderman/Peter Parker (Toby Maguire) and his girlfriend, Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) are as expected very likable: introspective, humble, caring and sweet. Unlike crime-fighters like Clint Eastwood and the Terminator, Peter doesn't sport macho mannerisms, and Ms. Dunst does not flaunt bare skin or hanging breasts. (As you may know, Peter is to Spiderman what Clark Kent was to Superman, his ordinary citizen identity.) Many male viewers will identify with Peter's hesitancy about commitment. Does he avoid asking Mary Jane to marry him because it would detract from his mission in life to fight crime and evil, or is that a convenient excuse?Other interesting people are Spiderman's sympathetic aunt (Rosemary Harris) and the flamboyant editor (J.K. Simmons) at the local paper. Cameo appearances by Willem Defoe (Green Goblin) and Cliff Robertson (Uncle Ben) tie this movie to its predecessor. James Franco, the Goblin's son, is back and wants to avenge his father's killer, Batman, who unknown to him is also his best friend, Peter Parker. You now see why I posed the questions at the start of this piece. The action scenes mix nicely with poignant moments. Some viewers may not appreciate this nuanced script with its moral complexity, but I expect them to be few in number. Early box office returns seem to support this opinion.Seeing this production at an IMAX made it more enjoyable, but you should appreciate it wherever you see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The chances of "Spider-Man 2" being little more than a rehash of the first movie were, when you think about it, pretty remote - the TLC with which the original was handled meant we weren't likely to get a soulless cash-in; indeed, the sequel gives characters the priority over action, and that's what makes this movie an equal to the first one. It may not have its freshness, but it has just about everything else.Director Sam Raimi and screenwriter Alvin Sargent (the latter successfully negating the influence of Alfred Gough and Miles Millar, who share screen story credit with Michael Chabon, and whose (dis)credits include "Smallville," "Shanghai Noon" and "Lethal Weapon 4") don't tell the most original story - as another poster pointed out, this shares some plot points with "Superman II," chiefly that of our hero wondering if he can continue playing the hand fate dealt him and choosing not to... at least for now (but better that than "Superman IV: The Quest For Peace," right?) - and on thinking it over it has its share of plot holes, but nothing that truly wrecks the movie. For a start, "Spider-Man 2" gives us a Peter Parker whose angsty day-to-day life is immensely easy to sympathies with - he may be able to zoom around the city spinning webs and have amazing strength, but that can't help him keep a job or pay his rent. It also gives us people who've moved on and been built up from last time - except perhaps for J. Jonah Jameson (wonderfully played by J.K. Simmons - "Miss Brant? Get me a violin," he says on hearing Peter's tale of woe), who wisely has more screen time... but not enough for him to swipe the movie. Apart from Rosemary Harris's Aunt May, the biggest beneficiary of this emphasis on people is Kirsten Dunst's Mary Jane, who is inevitably in peril in the climax but gets much more to do beforehand this time around; you wonder if the producers swore that come the sequel they'd do something about the first movie's flaws (speaking of which, the effects from John Dykstra and Sony Pictures Imageworks et al are considerably improved).Even the movie's villain isn't truly a black hat; as written and played by Alfred Molina, Dr. Octavius is more of an ambitious thinker trapped by his own devices than an all-out baddie - the way he becomes Doc Ock is more of an accident than anything, though I can understand why this pretty thoughtful approach would put some off - it takes a while before the action really starts (though when it comes, it's worth it), and the emotional moments aren't for the Michael Bay crowd. But if they weren't there, the action scenes wouldn't have any impact. Think about it.Leavened throughout with humour that works for the movie instead of against it (although having a street musician play the theme from the "Spider-Man" cartoon is a bit much - the Michael Buble big band version at the end of the end credits is enough), sporting a score by Danny Elfman (with a little help from John Debney and Christopher Young) that shows Klaus Badelt and Graeme Revell how this kind of thing should be done, and with a perfect set-up for "Spider-Man 3" thrown in - all this and Bruce Campbell - this shows again why few if anybody is plumping for Nicholas Hammond over Tobey Maguire. He IS Spider-Man, and this set of movies is the definitive portrayal of Marvel's most famous creation; wealth and fame he's ignored, but merited.Incidentally, those viewers who complained about the last image of the previous movie will have less to moan about here. Particularly the boys.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, I can now say that I have seen "Spiderman 2." But let me give you my multi-faceted review of the film.Of course, I really enjoyed "Spiderman 1." Willam Dafoe was a great villain as the Green Goblin. On a four-star rating system, I would give that film ***.With that said, let me state that, for the record, I liked "Spiderman 2." But I must admit that there had to be a lot to that movie I simply did not see. I will address that this way:1. Did you think it was better than the first one? Answer: No. Just the opposite, I found more enjoyment in the first film.2. Did you like the villain of Doc Ock? Answer: He was okay, but not overly menacing.3. Will this movie have a place in your DVD collection? Answer: Certainly. The wife and kids had plenty of fun with it.I thought the movie was too long. The running time was around 2:15, but a half-hour could have easily been cut. A lot of screen time was spent on the relationship of Peter Parker with MJ. There were long periods where I said to myself, "Okay, I have had enough of this lovey-dovey stuff. Where is Doc Ock?One super-hero movie sequel I liked a lot was "Superman II." Now, see if this sounds familiar: In that movie, Superman gives up his powers for the love of Lois Lane.In "Spiderman 2," Peter Parker comes to the realization that he can have his powers if he truly wants them. Does he need to lose his powers for the love of Mary Jane?Don't get me wrong. I am not saying "Spiderman 2" is a bad film. But I just need to be careful when I read reviewers who think it was the greatest super-hero film they have ever seen. I thought this movie was miles from that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before beginning, I have to inform you that going into this film I 1.) ? am not a fan of comic books; I've picked up a handful in my entire lifetime. 2.) ? never thought the idea of Spiderman was interesting enough for me to read one of his comic books. 3.) ? always felt Doc Oc was one of the stupidest villains ever conceived. And 4.) ? am irritated by the trend of overusing and abusing CG effects. Spiderman 2 is a comic-book based movie about Spiderman (obviously) with Doc Oc as the villain and it has lots and lots of computer generated imagery. And I'm still telling you that SpiderMan 2 is arguably the best movie of 2004.Sam Raimi has painted a wonderfully colorful, comic-bookish world in which outrageous CG fights fit nicely and seamlessly into the live action elements. Note ? I'm not saying the CG is unnoticeable (it's very noticeable), I am saying that it feels natural here as though it belongs. It plays into what Raimi was trying to achieve--a world that's *like* reality in a blurred surrealistic way, but at the same time we know that it is not reality. Not unlike a fairy tale . . . or the pages of a comic book.If CG will forever stand out, then make the film match the CG. Rock on Raimi!Next up: the villain. I've never been more happy to eat my words and be so wrong. Dr. Octopus came across much cooler, far more convincingly, and way more interestingly than I could have imagined. I never thought Jack Nicholson as the Joker would ever be dethroned as my favorite Hollywood super villain. Move over Jack, Alfred's taken the reigns. I was blown away by Molina's performance, by the artificial life given to each of his extra limbs so that they're practically a character themselves, and by intense over-the-top CG-infused hyper fight scenes. Were this another genre of film, I'd gear up into complaint mode regarding those fights, but as described above . . . these ridiculous exchanges feel right at home on Raimi's superhero canvas.With the first film out of the way along with the obligatory explanation of Spiderman's origins, an introduction to his powers, as well as introduction to most of the main players in Spidey's world, now this film has space to breath and explore the characters. Fortunately for us, we get a returning cast so we don't have to suspend our disbelief that Michael Keaton has magically morphed to Val Kilmer or George Clooney. Spiderman 2 explorers its character elements and subplots with surprising attention to detail and sincerity, giving the film a few more layers than I've come to expect from a 'silly superhero movie.'Throw in Raimi's trademarks mixed in with Elfman's taste for scoring, and SpiderMan 2 exceeded my expectations in every way. Will the die hard fans of SpiderMan like it? Keep searching for that review . ..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>They've done it again, the golden age continues. Spiderman 2 is another triumph, two hours of gripping action adventure backed up with a heartbreaking story. It's funny, heart stopping, everything you'd want or expect - it's better in so many ways than the first film, but also complements it. As though someone was reading my mind many of the objections I had to the first film have been addressed - it feels like one continuous story; it really looks like a man flying through the city now - its incredibly difficult to tell which is human and which isn't; it is also more willing to take time to tell the story.But - and here I am sighing by the way - it doesn't feel like Spiderman. Not the comic book hero. This isn't an adaptation it's a re-interpretation - and done so well. But the central character just feels too far away from the man who appears on the printed page. Before you start shouting that he's been humanized to make him acceptable for a general audience I understand but I have an argument. Over the years there have been many of adaptations of Sherlock Holmes and countless actors interpreting the role. But I think if you stand them next to each other, the general essence of the character remains the same, because he is what people are tuning in for, to see him solve a case.So why in putting Spidey on screen have they stripped him of all the characterization which made him such a joy on the printed page? At the basic level it's the wisecracks. At times Spidey's sarcasm is hilarious; the problem is that because he's such a troubled soul in the films it would be incongruous so out they went. Spidey also has a slightly na?ve arrogance which means he'll burst into a situation already assuming that he's going to win before realizing the odds are against him; he'll also seek out danger to a certain extent, look for mayhem when he can. In the films, it all seems so reactionary - Spiderman only ever crops up when someone in the vicinity of Peter Parker is in trouble - we never actually see him out on an evening 'patrol' - it's implied but we really need to be able to watch him taking out those petty criminals to get sense of what his life is like so that we can understand the tiredness in his eyes.There are rumours that Eliza Dushka is in the running for the third film to play The Black Cat. Which is fine - perfect casting in fact. The trouble is that part of that relationship arc is the verbal sparring and sexual chemistry between the two of them. But since this version of Peter seems to want to either look dumbfounded, awestruck or give a deep philosophical it's difficult to see how the dynamic will work. So top of my wish list for the third film is to let Spidey relax into his vocation a little and enjoy the power he has. Otherwise you start to question whether people are turning up for a film which happens to be about a character called Spiderman, or to see Spidey back in action.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like to make my reviews short, Sam Raimi has once again delivered another Spiderman film which has been done very well, a slight improvement of the first I must say but other than that, there is a bit more suspense.I feel that Sam Raimi has tried a different approach to this film than the pasted one, he has tried making it maybe more funny but maybe more grown up, there are some very emotional scenes to do with love in the film, some films don't deliver theses scenes well enough to make the audience understand what the characters are going through, But Spiderman definitely has emotional scenes which we can relate to.However I can say some bad things about this movie, I felt that the editing at the beginning was to quick, for instance at the end of scenes the screen goes black very fast and then a new scene starts straight away, which personally I do not like, films who have that normally flick straight to another scene, but it would just flick to the next day, but id say after 30 minutes it gains its full strength again like the previous film, but that's only my opinion, I notice things like that, and I also felt that some funny scenes dragged on, such as the mops falling out of the cupboard, and the lift scene.4/5 Adam- theafozlegend</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Spider-Man 2" is a great follow-up to its predecessor. In the sequel, Tobey Maguire is Peter Parker, who is struggling between identities. His Spider-Man persona takes up so much of his time, his personal life suffers. Plus, it seems to take a toll on his powers. Maguire fills his role with lots of emotion. Alfred Molina makes a great addition as Dr. Octopus, the new villain in the franchise. He outshines Willem Dafoe's Green Goblin with his hardware, and his own personal struggles. "Spider-Man 2" contains more excitement and action, plus has an opening credit sequence that features the art of Alex Ross. With entries like this, the "Spider-Man" franchise will continue going strong.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fabulous movie, true to the spirit of the comics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching Spider-man 2 was a true joy. It concentrates on action and characterisation in equal measure and is all the better for it. Lets face it - the Spider-man story is the best in all comicdom so you know they have great material to work from. The characters are joyful and the story itself is unique - this is not an all powerful superhero. He has plenty of problems - in essence he is just a poor kid trying to do his best. There is something in the character we can all relate to. That said, it would have been easy to play it safe with this movie, and just overload it with mindless violence and unbelievable subplots. Director Sam Raimi avoids these pitfalls by giving us a hero we can believe in. His weaknesses underline his true strength. All the leads play their roles well, and bring the fabulous comic book characters to life with ease. I only wish this could have been developed into a series because the only problem with a movie is that it has to cover so much ground in a short space of time. These characters develop quickly, but the movie is paced well and you find yourself happily coming along for the ride. One of the best scenes involved Peter Parker rescuing a kid from a fire and then realising that he could not save another from dying. Therein lies one of the key messages in this story - nobody can save everyone. The closing scene with Peter and Mary Jane really epitomises his selflessness and Mary Jane's strength of character. She is not just there as eye candy and you really feel she can be a real partner in future plots. Overall I would heartily recommend this movie to anyone, comfortably the best superhero film ever made. Lets just hope they continue to maintain films of this high standard.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superior superhero</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a kid, your traditional DC/Marvel comic book heroes didn't really do it for me (I tended to plump for the biting historical satire of Asterix and Obelix or the complex, highbrow morality of He-Man and the Masters of the Universe). I think my credulity was stretched too far by the sheer lack of imagination in the whole dual-personality idea: Now, let's see? How do we differentiate between Superman and Clark Kent? I know, we'll stick a pair of spectacles on him and instruct him to act goofy. Surely everyone who watched Christopher Reeve or Dean Cain lumbering around the newsroom at the Daily Planet lantern-jawed and biceps busting out of their suits must have joined me in screaming insults at Lois Lane's short-sightedness: 'My God, are you BLIND? It's the same man that pulled you out of that burning building, you myopic harpy!'Batman isn't much more convincing. He has at least got that ridiculous pointy-eared visor to disguise him, but even that becomes superfluous when you have a dimple like George Clooney's on your chin. The Dark Knight might as well have a sign above his head saying, 'Just call me Bruce.'Kudos, then, to Spider-man for being just a touch more believable with the secret identity thing. That said I was quite disappointed with Sam Raimi's first stab at transferring our web-spinning hero to the big screen. It was a curiously disjointed film preferring to fall back on slick CGI and a ludicrously artificial villain (Willem Dafoe's Green Goblin) rather than intelligent story development. The sequel is an altogether more polished affair and Raimi has evidently warmed to his task. The action sequences are kept to a minimum (which actually gives them greater impact) and the emphasis is more on more weighty matters.Still struggling to come to terms with his arachnid super-powers, Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is working as a pizza delivery boy to fund the college course he is flunking. He also earns the odd buck providing cantankerous tabloid hack J Jonah Jameson (JK Simmons) with candid photographs of the elusive Spider-man (though quite how he manages to take the pictures of himself is anybody's guess ? maybe he has a timer and a tripod, or collars a tramp to take the snaps for him in return for a nickel and a can of Kestrel ? who knows?). Not only is he stressing over his crime-fighting responsibilities, but his nascent romance with childhood chum M-J (Kirsten Dunst) has hit the rocks and his other best pal Harry (James Franco) holds him responsible for his father's death.Understandably miserable, Peter starts to doubt that swinging between sky-scrapers and chasing police cars is any great shakes after all and decides to can the Spidey suit and knuckle down to studying. But isn't it always the way that the moment you start to settle down enjoy the simple life, some selfish megalomaniac comes along and ruins it. In this case it is genius scientist Otto Octavious (Alfred Molina) who has morphed into a crazed, tentacled psycho after a botched experiment. Purpose re-installed, Peter sets about saving the day.All fairly standard super-hero fare, so why does Spider-man 2 seem just a little bit classier than the usual wham-bam effects-laden romp? Well, for starters, the casting is nigh-on flawless. Raimi is greatly assisted here by his hero's all-over mask of anonymity. Other directors have been hindered by having to squeeze muscle-bound hunks into nerdy alter egos: Witness Reeve and Cain as the bumbling Clark Kent ? are we really meant to feel sorry for these handsome devils? Raimi has carte blanche and can make Peter Parker as pasty as he likes without having to turn him into a convincing world-saving dreamboat. In Tobey Maguire he has struck gold ? the kid is a walking Clearasil commercial. This is a proper loser - one the audience can really empathise with - and the central emotional conflict works fantastically well as a result.Raimi has also reined in any temptation to ram the special effects down our throats. He cleverly lets the thrills creep up on you rather than orchestrating a telegraphed car chase or fight sequence. There is one great scene when a tender will-they-won't-they moment between Peter and M-J is rudely interrupted by a car flying through the window of a restaurant in super slo-mo. It is just a pity that the promoters decided to ruin the shock impact by showing it in all the trailers. Molina's Dr Octopus is about as preposterous as the Green Goblin, but somehow he manages to make him entertaining if not entirely convincing. Maguire is a talented actor, switching from comic to dramatic mode seamlessly. The Bert Bacharach 'Raindrops Keep Falling on my Head' musical interlude is as charming a scene as you will see all summer. His chemistry with Dunst is also spot-on ? she has carved out a niche as a refreshing alternative to the bland new Hollywood brat-pack ? and by the end you are really rooting for the pair of them.I hear there is a third installment in the pipeline which will inevitably drag the franchise back down into the realms of the mediocre. It is my humble opinion that they should just leave it be at two, but I suppose the lure of the dollar will prove too tempting to refuse. This is a shame, because Spider-man 2 really is a cracking film and it deserves to be recognised in its own right.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>spiderman 2 was not very good. in fact everyone is like oh spiderman 1 was amazing (which it wasn't) and spiderman 2 was even better than that. and they are wrong. this movie had its moments like when the granny was falling off the building and the lackluster attempts at making a good fight scene, like in the bank and on the train kept me from falling asleep. the story was very bad and the part with doctor octopus going crazy was just weird. however the one part of this movie that was better that the last movie was doctor octopus. I'm glad that the movie people finally realized that a green man flying around on a skateboard does not constitute for a villain. it seems as if they just used the martians from mars attacks as the villain in the first one. now doctor octopus doesn't look like much of a villain either, more like some old man thinking he can still trick-or-treat. in conclusion, this poor attempt at making what could be have been a fine sequel fell very very short.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>it's an entertaining movie, no doubt about it. it had a bit of depth and a pretty good storyline, something that summer movies don't really have much of.the only thing that i didn't like about it was the acting. i rate it a 6 out of 10 at best. sure, it's supposed to be a comic book movie, but the way the lines were delivered were inconsistent; some were delivered like a regular drama movie and others were just over-the-top cheesy.the effects didn't seem right (i'll give $10 to whoever identifies all the cgi-laden scenes correctly), but it helped achieve the overall comic book feel of the movie.the bottom line: spiderman 2 is a pretty good superhero/comic book movie, but not the best one in my opinion (that goes to 1979's superman). the acting isn't all that great, the story is pretty good, and as far as visuals go, it achieves the notion of a cartoon that both kids and adults can enjoy. i just hope that the cast and crew will be back for a third time because as far as movies has showed us, the third installment of a series (superman, batman, alien, back to the future, et al.) is best forgotten.(p.s., i'm not really going to give $10 to anyone.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spiderman was just an amazing film when seeing it in the Cinema, but when it came on DVD I didn't have the same effect on me but I still liked it. Looking at all the clips that I saw whilst watching other films of Spiderman 2 got me really fired up but after seeing it more than 5 times I began to lose patience as I thought I had seen nearly every scene just through all the trailers that popped up on TV and in the cinema but how wrong was I when watching this great action comic film.I have this knack for guessing whether the film is going to be any good or not before watching them and Spiderman 2 is a film that I thought I would find faults with which I did but they were minor and not even worth mentioning because it was a rip roaring and quite scary action flick. Sam Rami is definitely a director who knows how to please his audience and bring them back for more which is how it finishes. I don't take kindly either to any female leads like Kirsten Durnst who moan in movies like Spiderman because that's what I was lead to believe but in all fairness I never heard her speak out of tone once or even remotely annoy me at all. Like the first Spiderman the whole film is just nicely put together and the story is continued perfectly in the second instalment with everything from the action, the acting and quite a few scary moments. There is one with a hospital and the way the whole was shot was quite spooky but I won't say what happens in the scene itself, you'll have to watch it to see that but it sent some shivers down my spine. The characterisation which Rami has presented before our eyes is wonderfully handled and great to watch. Alfred Molina as Dr Oc is fantastic and couldn't have been better if he tried. Now is there anything wrong with this film? I would say yes and no, no because it is a very enjoyable film that anyone can enjoy and has plenty of action and great scenes to keep you busy and happy but it's not a masterpiece which is what all comic book fans are waiting. Batman Begins is likely to have the title if any comic film has but then again that is yet to be released so we will have to wait and see but in the mean time ut of all the comic book hero films I have seen since the day of the my birth, I can honestly say that Spiderman 2 is the best I have ever seen and has more thrills and spills than any other film of it's type has which is a noble thing to say.Just sit back and enjoy watching Peter Parker growing up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is far far superior to the first spiderman film.Quite surprising that this was only rated a PG in the UK, I would have thought the 12A rating would have been more appropriate.However, having not read any of the comics and only seen a few episodes from the old animated series for me there was the 'awww' moment when Mary Jane saw who Peter really was.Alfred Molina was superb as Doc. Ock, those tentacles remind me of another film (oh yes, Matrix: Revolutions). Quite forward thinking our crazed scientist was, building the much larger device on a disused pier. That was the only let down of the film for me - that getting his creation wet would stop it. How original!Nonetheless, this film deserves all the credit it gets. Fantastic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>awesome sequel to the first.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>the sequel to spider-man was just as great as i hoped it would be. not only were there awesome action scenes between spidey and doc ock but an underlying romance between peter parker and mary jane. in the 2nd installment of spider-man, i felt there was a lot more drama about what it is really like for peter parker to be a superhero while also trying to maintain a passing grade in college. **SPOILER ALERT** when peter decides that he's had enough of being spider-man, he throws away his spidey costume and is happy...for a little while, at least. soon, he discovers whenever something bad is happening in the city, he feels guilty for not being there to help out. he feels that if spider-man was at the scene of the crime, he could have fought off the bad guys and saved an innocent victim or two. the identity crisis was really intriguing for me. most movies i have a clear idea of what i think the main character should do and why he (or she) should do it. however, in spider-man 2, i found it difficult to take sides with peter parker or his alter ego-spider-man. as for peter parker, i agreed that the poor guy should give up being the hero and work on his own life. on the other hand, i felt like the city might just collapse if spidey quit.**spoiler alert over** anyway, this movie is ideal for anyone who's a really spidey fan, or if you like action that offers more than guns and blood, (even though spider-man is not without these things) and a really interesting plot. GO SEE IT. i give it 4 and 1/2 out of 5 stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After all the complaints Lucas got for Episode I about ethnic slurs that harked back to films of the 1930's, I am amazed that no one has focused on the obvious one in SM2. I do not think it is a spoiler to reveal that Peter Parker's landlord is portrayed as a money-grubbing, grasping Eastern European Jew. I found these scenes very distracting and disturbing for that reason and I felt such a slur was entirely uncalled for. Other than that glaring problem, I agree with the other comments that this film is far better than SM1. The Jonah Jameson scenes are always the best part of the film, IMHO, and he is fortunately given far more of them in SM2.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie, but not a "Masterpiece"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really liked this move. It was even better than the first one in my humble opinion. The action scenes are well made (not too long, not too much or less). The story isn't very original, but what did you expect? The cast is good (especially Simmons totally fits), the characters are not very "deep", but you still are able to like/not like them. The end of the movie is, of course, not the end of the saga. A second sequel will follow. I'm going to watch this too. I think the scene in the train was kind of stupid and pointless, but that's only my impression. Perhaps I didn't understand the message. I don't like the grandmother either. She is annoying and definitely not cute. Dr.Octopus is kewl (the actor+character). There's nothing else to say. I can recommend this movie, even I don't think this is one of the greatest movies of all time.It was all in all a very good summer movie and it was never boring during the 127 minutes.7.5/10 8.5 for Spiderman fans</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i don't no what it is with spiderman films but i don't seem to get that engaged in terms of plot effects or anything. The problem with effects laden films is that they do not stand the test of time, with only a few mentionable exceptions ie t2. Spidermans actual animation is not as good as it should be, and this is me saying this now what for in years time looking back? In fact the original had equal, if not better CGI, with much more fluid, vertigo inducing effects. The only stand out thing in terms of CGI in spiderman2 is dr Octos amazing tentacle effects which are convincing. The pacing is not great in this film, and the villain is not particularly evil in anyway. In a time were cgi makes up 99% of films these days it is refreshing to find a film with something that resembles a plot, but the characters never really interested me.Its sad to say that superhero movies have the most interesting concepts and potential, yet there are only a handful of decent films in this genre, X2 and batman returns namely, also there's something about superman 2, i dunno. Examples of terrible superhero movies are endless ranging from the godawful such as catwoman and batman and robin, the bad- spawn, punisher hulk, and then the instantly forgettable such as the recent Hellboy. ONE DAY Hollywood MIGHT MAKE A Truly GREAT SUPERHERO FILM...until then there's spiderman2.</fullReview>

Spider Man 2 was better it's prequel in many ways. Better action scenes, more interesting plot of events, and a much cooler villain. The train scene was probably the coolest of all. It was amazing. Spidey losing his powers was an interesting twist. Dr. Octopus is much more cool than Green Goblin. Acting was still pretty good. It was still faithful to the comics.

Top notch characters--including enough screen time in which to develop them and their relationships--was the highlight for me. I just don't know how the filmmakers could have done it any better.This second film beats that pants off of the first--and off of everything else this summer season. I loved it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good but boring too....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...strange comment, I admit but I felt both ways watching Spiderman 2.Good things first: Tobey Maguire is a very positive character and he is definitely the ideal actor to play Peter Parker/Spiderman, his opponent very well played by Alfred Molina. And the action was first-class, especially the one around the train, but here starts the negative thing... ...why do we have to stand Parker's problems throughout the entire movie? Yes, OK it is important for the story and it is very daring too showing a superhero being such jerk in private life but nevertheless I found it utterly boring after a while. Especially the love-thing between Parker and his wannabe-don't touch me yes/no/maybe/perhaps girlfriend was in my opinion stretched to the extreme and made me yawn several times.At least they finally got together and since this is now finally done with, we may return to a bit more action-laden Spiderman 3 with more villains and more twists and turns - the storybase here around evil Dr. Ock was a bit too easy to follow and foresee. James Franco might be the next villain, but to accomplish that he has to do a lot more than trying to look like James Dean in every shot. Especially since the Green Goblin was performed by an outstanding Willem Dafoe.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**SPOILER**This film is beyond brilliant and Sam Raimi has once again doen a superb job with Spider-man, this time along side the diabolical Doc Oc.When i first saw this film you could tell from the opening credits it was something unseen and completely different from ever before... But the first 20 minutes were weak and slow and had me worried that it wasn't going to be what i thought it would be... but boy was i wrong, when I first saw Octavius (Alfred Molina) I thought he was brilliant and everything Doctor Octupus was, except German... but he played the part wonderfully and got the message across that he wasn't a bad man, and this was important...Everyone played the parts like they did in Spidey-1, but better... Jame Franco's performance was brilliant considering it wans't too impressive in 1 but really shined as the vegence seeking head of special projects dude..But, a lot did change, like MJ (Kirsten Dunst), her character was a lot different from the first, very mature but unlike the first you saw how much they loved each other, peter and Mj that it...I think the film was too involved with the love story and not enough Doc Oc, yet, when Alfred was on screen he would steal the show! I really did think he was fantastic and I thought his finishing scene was fresh and fantastic! I thought they might go with the usual 'but i want to kill him, even after iv'e realized I'm wrong' angle, like they did with the Green Goblin but luckily they didn't and Doc Oc is smart enough to realize what he did wrong and then he goes down a hero with the touching words, 'I will not die a monster'. And thats what i think made Doc Oc such a powerful, yet touching villain, You knew he wasn't bad, just a man that got taken over... It was brilliantly done.The CGI wasn't half bad either, the train scene was great and i also loved Sam Raimi's signature Clock Tower scene, but to me my favourite scene was in the bank when you see Doc Oc, actually it wasn't the best scene, but the best with Doc Oc as he actually looks like the Octupus for the first time with the hat, coat and glasses, it was brilliant!Overall this is an unmissable film and now, i can't wait till 2007 for Spidey-3!10/10 Worth the slice of pie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A really wonderful feel good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought this movie couldn't possibly match the first one, particularly as I am a big Willem Dafoe fan (he played the Green Goblin in the 1st movie), but to my surprise it was even better! The special effects and the direction in this movie are superb.The story is most satisfying and at some points very moving. You really feel for Spidey.A wonderfully satisfying story, which touches the heart and amazes all senses.I really LOVED it and would recommend it to anyone.10 out of 10 - Excellent!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You must see this movie, it has a good everything, start finish you name it! Do not believe anyone who says it is bad. My favourite part of the movie was the end although it didn't really seam like they could make a sequel off the end. The comedy in this movie is pretty funny, the violinist singing the original spider-man theme is pretty top notch! everyone who worked on this movie deserves a thumb up. I still think Tobey Maguire is a crappy actor though, he's on 5'8 and he plays spider-man? what the heck? either way it is a good movie and you should go to see it! Kirstin Dunst is awesome in the movie and so are all the other actors save Tobey. It is clearly better then I Robot so you must go see this.!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a waste of two hours and eight bucks!I enjoyed the the first film, but this was total sh1te.Ham-fisted script writing is the main problem, as the cast does what they can. It must have looked as bad on paper as it did on screen though, so Maguire and Dunst and Raimi have sold out big time!If you were a young kid or willing to suspend any notion of reality then you might have fun here, but the dialogue and character motivations are so ridiculous that I sat there dumb-founded for and hour before accepting that it wasn't going to get any better and putting up with it.In hindsight, I should have walked out.I've lost all the respect I had for those involved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spidey flies again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well with a great movie like Spider-Man, it is very easy for the sequel to become a disappointment, but luckily for me and others the Spider-Man franchise does not take a fall after the first film, because the director and the cast did their jobs good as did the people who wrote the script. They all stayed true to the original Spider-Man comics and comic series as a lot of people learned to love them.I must say that I was really amazed at how well Tobey Maguire pulled off the nerdy Peter Parker once again, with him being even clumsier and unluckier than in the first film. This did not only make for some very funny scenes but it also made me feel for him as much (if not more) than in the first film. When it came to his personal life and the things that had happened in the first film, I was moved a great deal and I shed some tears as I watched. The amount of emotion and the feeling of honesty and reality created by the director and the cast that moves you to tears is something that is not usually found in ?action' films and I want to than the people involved in creating such a real and believable experience for the viewer in the cinema and at home.What I loved most about the Spider-Man comic series and what I love most about this film though is the way the writers are able to create dilemmas all of us can identify with. They are what give Spider-Man a very human face and not make him a superhero like for instance Clark Kent in the Superman films. He seems to have much less of a burden than Spider-Man, which seems somewhat unbelievable, regarding the complexity of a superhero life.In my view there is only one downside to this film is J.K Simmons who portrays Jonah Jameson. I found him to be quite annoying and to tell the truth I thought that he was a bit unbelievable in his role, but that is just me. The rest of the film was really good. The action, the comedy the story, the actors and the romance. It just was GOOD. All of it. I especially enjoy the on screen chemistry between Kirsten Dunst and Tobey Maguire and must confess that in my mind Tobey = Spider-Man and Kirsten = Mary Jane. I therefore hope that they will continue to make at least 2 maybe 3 Spider-Man films, although I doubt they will do another one after the third. But this is more than praise, this is a WARNING. This is a warning to all at Columbia Pictures and Marvel Enterprises. DO NOT DARE to replace Tobey or Kirsten and continue the franchise, for I will not stand for it (and many other won't stand for it as well). If that does not help, take a good look at the Batman franchise, that almost died after Michael Keaton left.As much as I enjoyed Spider-Man 2, I felt that the film was a notch worse than the first film 2 years ago. This does not mean that the film was worse, but rather that it isn't as new and exciting anymore. Sequels do not only have to live up to it's predecessor, but they also suffer from the fact that a the shininess has worn off a little bit and they've got more mileage. Still the best film I've seen in a while (including The Return of the King).8,25 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Review for the latest spider-man movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, I have never been much of a Marvel fan. Actually, I have never been much of a comic book fan myself if you do not include Batman. But I live with two sisters who are crazy for almost any kind of comic book so eventually, after all the bragging and ranting on how Spiderman was so good, I needed to see it for myself. I was not that new to the Spiderman universe as far as the main characters and villains go. Personally, I have never liked Peter Parker or Mary-Jane. I have always enjoyed Dr. Octopus, The Black Cat, and Morbius. But none the less I had to see it so I could write a review for an old forum I use to go to. I didn't like the story, but as far as everything else went it was pretty good. Good costume, music, and visual effects. As for Spiderman 2 I have to say it was pretty dull when it came to plot. The visual effects were good, but after the first movie web slinging no longer 'wowed' me. The music was the same and enjoyable, I would even but the soundtrack if I weren't more of an Opera fan. The costumes and the mechanical octopus arms were great as expected. And, the actor for Dr. Otto Octavius, Alfred Molina, was better than I could have hoped for. However, I was extremely disappointed with the rest of it. The storyline bored me, the action got old after the first hour, and I really didn't like the fact that Mary-Jane broke three guy's hearts not to mention played with them all in one movie. To be honest I would give it a seven out of ten. But I am going to say something good about this movie. If you are a Spiderman fan who is not as stubborn and hot headed as I am, I think you will really and thoroughly enjoy this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>many will complain about the plot being too involved, or say that the love story takes up too much of the film, or that there is not enough action to balance out the other aspects of the script like the inner conflict or money troubles. sure, if this was a 1980's Stallone flick, i might agree. this is, however, a movie about spider-man, and love and conflict and every day woes are what spider-man is about. spidey was never solely about the costume and the action that comes with it, spider-man has always been an overblown melodrama bracketed with outrageous action. any real fan of spider-man, or real fan of films made for people with an attention span longer than 10 seconds should find this film to be fantastic. my only complaint was that the CGI still doesn't look like a real guy in a suit, but other than that this film was outstanding, and outshone the original in every aspect. i especially liked the evil dead-like snap close ups employed in the hospital scene with doc ock, raimi is a fine and daring director that doesn't mind slicing the cheese a little thicker than most. i give this film a 90%.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was a *good movie*. There were some pretty intense moments, and I can see no need for them to make a 3-D version, as the 2-D was dizzying enough in places. There was a lot of fast-paced action in this one!The formation of the villain in this one is similar to watching the Borg in Star Trek: The Next Generation get their implants. It's done in a similar way, and it's just as creepy to watch.The special effects rocked. And, as always, Tobey McGuire looked really good in that spandex! (I think his legs have beefed up quite a bit since the first one, though.)They've done a really good job of setting up a springboard for a Spidey 3, too. We'll see what happens.There are cameos by two former WB television stars: Ted Raimi ("Joxer" on Xena and Hercules), Bruce Campbell ("Autolycus" on Xena and Hercules), as well as an appearance by one of my favorite comedic movie actors, Bill Nunn ("Bradley, physical therapist" in Regarding Henry and "Lt. Eddie Souther" in Sister Act).I highly recommend this movie to anyone who hasn't seen it. If you haven't seen the first one, yet, it will help you understand this one to see that first. It's not necessary, but it will help.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So good is the answer. I found the first outing a tad slow and failing to really capture the unique essence of 'spiderman' as experienced by those of us who read the original marvel story lines. But Spiderman 2 is another matter somehow Rami has done it. He's captured on film trails and tribulations of Peter Parker magnificently. Tobey Maguire might not have been my might first choice for this role but twinned with the female lead..name escapes me...together they are absolutely electric. This time round, it mattered if Parker failed or didn't get the girl...I really wanted Parker to succeed..(I always did you understand)...but I believed in it and that's what really matters in a film like this. I saw the movie with my son and one of his mates...at one point the friend (he's 8)got freaked out by Dr Oct.. I just told him to look away. There was no way in hell I was going to leave that cinema. That's how good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Do you know a really good comic movie ? I really have problems to remember anyone. Batman was bad (especially Batman and Robin), Spawn was harmless, Hulk was not that good, X-Men is improving, but hardly has reached a decent level yet.So Spiderman seems to be the only really good comic movie ever. And the second movie might be even better than the first one. I really have hated the first one for its bad ending, but the second one fixes it for me.Both movies brilliantly combine small, actorcentered scenes with big effects and action. Again Ken Parker, the Spiderman, has a lot of personal troubles to handle. The movie contains a lot of nice scenes and jokes, but of course also the big hunt of another supercriminal.This is the best comic movie known to me, and a very good piece of entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Hero in Us All...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At one point in Director Sam Raimi's "Spider-Man 2", Peter Parker's Aunt May (wonderfully played by Rosemary Harris) says of heroes: "...I believe there's a hero in all of us, that keeps us honest, gives us strength, makes us noble, and finally allows us to die with pride, even though sometimes we have to be steady, and give up the thing we want the most. Even our dreams."This nature or distinction of hero is what really resonates and distinguishes "Spider-Man 2". A hero resonates across cultures. He or she is distinguished by courage, selflessness, nobility, honor, and most of all-- heart. Whether or not the hero in this case wears a red and blue spider suit to save others, what matters is the inherent greatness of the individual in action. Hero is to the soul. Toby Maguire as Peter Parker/ Spider-Man embodies the possibility of the hero in all of us. Maguire has such a humanity about him, and is so commanding in his stillness and calm. His understated performance choices punctuates Peter Parker's courage and compassion. Along with Sam Raimi's masterful direction, and Alvin Sargent's character and plot driven screenplay, "Spider-Man 2" is compelling work. I think that it is better than "Spider-Man', and one of the best movies of the year. "Spider-Man 2" also has a more evolved love story between Peter (Maguire) and Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) which really works. And of course the CGI effects are phenomenal. This time around the storytelling is not so linear. Peter (Maguire) is burning out as Spider-Man. He has forsaken his love for MJ (Dunst), aware that if he revealed his love for her, her life would be endangered by his enemies. Consequently, Peter is suffering. The new enemy is Doc Ock (a compelling Alfred Molina), who because of a tragic fusion experiment becomes fused to deadly mechanical tentacles. Though the villain, Doc Ock is not entirely evil. Originally Dr. Otto Octavius is a good man who falls victim in the pursuit of his dreams to transform the world. This is a wonderful touch. Molina is effective in retaining his character's vestige of idealism throughout. Also returning in 2, is a charismatic James Franco as Harry Osborn, who has sworn vengeance on his father's "murderer", Spider-Man. Along the way, Harry and Dr. Ock form an unholy alliance against... Spider-Man. Sam Raimi is a master storyteller. His narrative style is powerful, compelling, and has a sense of humor. The action sequences and CGI effects are visually stunning. The scene in which Spider-Man attempts to save passengers on a runaway train is simply awesome. The romance between Peter and MJ is very touching. Raimi also provides some dramatic surprises. Toby Maguire's performance as Peter gives Spider-Man 2 its soul. As Peter, he is doing this best "to be steady", sacrificing what he wants most, and being true to the part of himself that is hero. A hero is one that inspires those around him or her to greatness. So a hero reminds us of the very best in ourselves-- the part that is compassionate, courageous, and noble. "Spider-Man 2", though just a movie reminds us all, of our own greatness.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To be honest, after having been disappointed by the Matrix sequels, (especially the 3rd installment) i always go to the movies ready to be disappointed. This was not the case with Spidey 2. There was no category i can say was flawed in this masterpiece of a movie. Simply put, this movie was one hundred percent pure action and entertainment, and within the guidelines for all age groups to watch and fall in love with over and over again. Being an old spidey comic book reader... i do hope they do NOT smash the green goblin idea into the dirt in future movies. I definitely feel Doc Oc. was a better villain, and spidey has many other villains of old (and new) that would make for a better movie in future sequels. The time of the goblin should have ended in part one. But maybe the producers feel compelled to finish his story before bringing out some of spidey's more deadly enemies such as sandman, venom, hydro, and john kerry. Oops... did i say john kerry? Well, he's just everyone's enemy, or at least should be. Ha ha.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie that beautifully combines witty comedy, a great story, marvelous visual effects and a ton of action and drama.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there is a reason the year 2004 will be remembered in movie history, it might be known as the year sequels struck back. After the amazing "Shrek 2," "Spider-Man 2" is another film that outdoes it predecessor. Even the greatest (or worst) nitpickers will find few flaws. "Spider-Man" was a movie that showed just how advantageous being a superhero could be. It meant easy money, superspeed pizza delivery and the ability to save lots and lots of lives. The theme was evident throughout the movie. By contrast, "Spider-Man 2" buries the theme, showing just how problematic being blessed with superpowers can be. Instead of superspeed pizza delivery, our hero is too busy to even arrive on time to the pizza parlor. There's no time to make money either. There's no time for ANYTHING, which doesn't help human relations. Yeah. It SUCKS. The story is much more complex in "Spider-Man 2." There's a lot more going on, and a lot more Peter Parker (Toby Maguire) has to deal with. While The Green Goblin (Willem Defoe) from the first film possessed a hoverboard, he was still a weak villain totally devoid of coolness. Doc Ock (Alfred Molina), by contrast, is a supervillain deserving of the title. The visual effects on Doc Ock are amazing. The menacing tentacles are robotic versions -- even their vocalizations and actions -- of the velociraptors from "Jurassic Park." It's clear that anything reminiscent of something so cool can't be anything other than an improvement. Where did these demon appendages come from? I'll explain.Dr. Otto Octavius is a famous scientist who has discovered a new form of clean energy that will change the world. He creates a machine, which is revealed publicly. Octavius wears four tentacles that are semi-intelligent, which he needs to operate the machine. However, the machine proves unstable, and the arms are forever welded onto Octavius. The tentacles control him, and he becomes Doc Ock, on a mission to reconstruct a bigger and badder contraption. For this he needs funding. The only possible source is Harry Osborn, who has been trying to avenge his father's death at the hands of Spider-Man. Doc Ock can bring Osborn Spider-Man in return for titium. Parker and Spidey have all this to contend with, as well as Parker's personal problems. The web-slinging antics of Spider-Man in "Spider-Man" were technologically impressive, but in "Spider-Man 2," they are awe-inspiring. You feel yourself swing with the bug as the camera swoops as the superhero swings in a great arc, and then again. The camera follows people plummeting for what seems like a minute. The thrilling climax is an unimaginable showcase of modern digital effects. Expect the unexpected, and you'll still be taken aback."Spider-Man" was almost completely seen through Parker's eyes, besides the occasional switch to the villain explaining his next diabolical scheme to himself. This time, Mary Jane Watson plays a much bigger part. In the first movie, the emotion springs from Parker's love of Mary Jane and the death of his uncle. In "Spider-Man 2," both M.J. and Peter are lost and confused. Peter struggles with telling Aunt May the truth about Uncle Ben's death. So, the solving of all these problems is all the more satisfying, and what makes it better is the way they are solved. Final word: "Spider-Man" was a very good movie. "Spider-Man 2" is an excellent one, a gem, and something that hints at how good "Spider-Man 3" might be, now the crew have proven themselves.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>By the time I write this, most of you have seen this movie in the theatre and you know I'm not exaggerating. This is one of the year's best movies. This movie will even appeal to those people that are not fans of the genre, it's that good. The script is great, the special effects (which are spectacular) serve the story rather than the other way around. The performances are excellent all around.After a slow start, catching us up on Peter Parker's life, (he's in college, not living with Harry, being a super-hero is a constant interference) the action is revved up by the appearance of Dr. Otto Octavius, a scientist who as a result of an accident during an nuclear fusion experiment, becomes Dr. Octopus, super villain with four mechanical arms. After the transformation, it's ON!!Included in this story (not a spoiler to the 9 or 10 of you out there who have yet to see this show) are Peter's romance with Mary Jane Watson, Harry's hatred of Spider-man, and Peter just plain dealing with his power and responsibility. All of these elements are given proper screen time and make this one a must-see.Pass the popcorn, I'm going to see it again!!</fullReview>

On closer inspection you will notice the charecter does very little of any note except nearly get killed by Doctor Octopus. Dr Oct is not menacing as a vilan. I like Alfred Molina, i like Dr Octopus from the comic, but the two do not mix. In fact they make Winnie the Pooh look as evil as George Bush on election day.</fullReview>

Tobey Maguire performed greatly as Spider-Man! I was really impressed how he acted! The many looks he got on face was really good! Kirsten Dunst, and Rosemary Harris were very good. James Franco also acted good. I thought J.K. Simmons really performed well and so did Donna Murphy. Ted Raimi is back in this the sequel. Dylan Baker was good in a short part but his Dr. Curt Connors character doesn't turn into The Lizard in this picture. Also Willem Dafoe has a surprise appearance, John Paxton, and Cliff Robertson has brief appearances. Bruce Campbell is in a very short part and he was very funny! But the one who really caught My attention was Alfred Molina! I was so amazed by his acting and the personality he gave his character Doc Ock/Dr. Otto Octavius! I can't say enough how good he was! His villain has immediately became one of My all time favorites! The villain is that awesome! Now on to a different subject, if anyone is complaining about this movie for any reason why don't you do something different and use your noggin and talk about the many wonderful messages this film has and how well the cast performed and how everything greatly was! Anyway back to other stuff like Danny Elfman's score, it was outstanding! The action was remarkable especially the battle scenes with Spidey and Dr. Octopus, the special effects were incredible, and the direction by Sam Raimi was astounding! The end of the movie may surprise many people! This film is a winner and I think its one of the best films ever with great performances, great characters interactions, great musical score, and a tremendous villain to boot! If you like Spider-Man check out Spider-Man 2 because I strongly recommend it!</fullReview>

As a huge Spidey fan, seeing things that made me smile, cringe, and want to complain still left me with an overall feeling that Sam Raimi and crew have done a wonderful job in adapting our favorite friendly neighborhood superhero. My only complaints revolve around Doctor Octopus, and how his character is changed to be much better than he is in the comics, cartoons, books, etc. However, the job they did with this change overrides that complaint, and I thought they told the story well. Plus, the ending does leave it open for those of us who know Doc Oc's habits and resilience.Other than that, the film was great, well put together, human, and powerful, all at once. Go see it. NOW!

		<shortDescription>Spidey's a loser, total loser. Where's the Hero?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I go to watch a superhero film to see a superhero - a being that has extraordinary powers, that can perform amazing feats and importantly be a WINNER. I don't want to watch him be a loser, be ordinary, and keep getting hammered, beaten up, and ridiculed. This movie...jeez, where's the superhero? Tobey MacGuire looks like a loser throughout, and is unconvincing overall. He (true to his usual roles) shows no steel or a desire to win. If the idea was to portray a mortal mushy goof, then don't call the film 'Spider-man'. 'Loser-Man' would be appropriate as he's in frustratingly (to viewers) loser situations all through this film.I believe most people don't give a hoot about their superhero wrestling with his goddamned personal issues and his desire to be a normal human. Just acknowledge your powers, beat the cr*p hard outta the villain, and be done with it. Then the audience goes out satisfied, having seen feats they aren't capable of. For them, to have such abilities is divine - why would they care to understand his desire to be ordinary? In this case, the humanized Spidey comes out a mortal sap, he is a loser - always humiliated. He never ever retaliates immediately or convincingly. There's NO sting, no quick strike-back that makes us go, 'Yea! Git the Bastard!'.

		<shortDescription>I Sing Of Arms &amp; The Spider! (a.k.a. - Courtesy Your Friendly Neighborhood Spoiler-Man)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you told me in April that there'd be not one but two sequels that outshone their predecessors I'd've looked you straight in the eye and laughed myself sick - maybe all over your shoes/feet! Then "Shrek 2" came along and even now I still say " * Boots, ha-hah! Hack, hak, hagh... hairball!" Well, and I believed the old adage about lightning strikes etc. Still wrong! SpiderMan 2 came along and yanked me kicking and screaming into an unexpected cornucopia of comic book lover delights of fancy!The last time there was a sequel that exceeded the original was SuperMan 2 in 1979! Sure, Peter's face may have been shown more than he intended but in his line of work do you expect his uniform to stay intact? The way has been paved for the Man-Wolf, the Lizard and Harry Osborn as Green Goblin 2 in future installments... As for the plots, there were so many and yet you could keep track of each thread (web-strand? ;p)... * Peter's all-out tiredness at trying to please his aunt, MJ, Bugle, College and Pizza joint - phew! * The on/off near-relationship between Pete and MJ; Doc Ock's love for his wife (and master touch implying his arms were what made him evil) juxtaposed with his fevered desire to prove science Is (I had forgotten what a great science student Peter was nearly as good as Curt Connors or Reed Richards - ye Gods! Ioan Gryfudd as Mr. Fantastic? Whoops! Wrong forum!)The cameos of Stan Lee (Marvel's Galactus) in another crowd scene and "Army Of Darkness'" Bruce Campbell (Sam Raimi's buddy) as the evil usher were well-timed and the re-appearance of "Xena's" Jaxur as the sycophantic assistant of JJJ was equally appreciated. This picture has many memorable quote-lines... "I am Spider-Man no more!" or "Mr. Jameson, your wife called to say she lost the checkbook!" and his instantaneous response? "Thanks for the Good News!" There was also Otto's "Ladies and gentlemen? Fasten your seat belts!" It doesn't seem likely there'll be a budding romance betwixt Aunt May &amp; Doc Ock in the movie version of Spidey's life as compared to the comics, not after the aborted bank robbery (and in this version, it seems Aunt May suspects Peter's truth?)... My final spin? Don't crawl, LEAP to the cinema and watch SM2!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Think of Superman 2 and how much better it was than the original. Then double it. You then get a bit closer to how good Spider-Man 2 is. With the exception of the Green Goblin being the villain with the greater fun factor, this sequel does for S-M what the plural did for 'Alien', and certainly what happened to the Superman series. I can't think of a better blockbuster, certainly not a comic one, in any event. Give the movie-makers a pat on the back. Average Hollywood fare can be forgiven in the light of this Marvel masterpiece. It really has everything a good film should have. Behind the guise of Peter Parker, we have a super-hero. Behind the guise of a comic book caper, we have just about all the ingredients of any movie classic. Tobey Maguire is on very top form, and that's saying something. He has the kind of high profile that holds mediocre films together. He is always watchable, but this is surely his finest hour, and I truly believe he should be nominated for Oscar glory, such is the magnitude of the performance. This is the Hamlet of the comic strip world. The great thing about this is that it can appeal to tastes on many different levels. Aside from the impressive, and sometimes frightening, action, there are moral issues and human dilemmas which soap operas would be proud to address. Danny Elfman's music, and the sharp, pinpoint direction, with no wasted or superfluous scenes, make this a thrill ride from beginning to end. They simply cannot top this movie. And finally. It had to happen sooner or later. Miss Dunst at last comes of age in a performance which makes Scarlett O'Hara seem like a bit part. She is truly outstanding, and gorgeous (even with the red hair), making this movie stand alongside such classics as 'Titanic', which most people seem to slag off these days. Well, the viewing public can't be wrong, because the money made by these movies says an awful lot. People still like good old-fashioned romances, and when combined with great spectacle, such as huge liners sinking, or Spider-Man saving MJ from Doc Ock (!)it proves my long-held belief that they don't make 'em like they used to, except in this instance, they clearly do. 9 out of 10. Don't know why it isn't 10 out of 10 really, but it must have some flaw..where?! I am not particularly a fan of comic book movies, but this is quite exceptional. NOT TO BE MISSED ON ANY ACCOUNT.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A good movie based on a comic book is rare, and a great one even rarer. Stories of larger than life heroes fighting against villains on epic scales is the keystone to a great adventure tale in any medium, but being able to adapt a thrilling comic into an equally thrilling movie has proven to be nearly impossible time and time again.'Spider-Man 2' is thankfully the exception, not the rule. Not only is this movie an excellent testament to a great superhero, it's also an improvement over the original film, which is quite a feat given how good that movie was.Being a superhero is beginning to take its toll on young Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire). Taking time out of his busy life to fight crime is costing him his relationships with love interest Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) and best friend Harry Osborn (James Franco). His academic and professional lives are beginning to suffer as well, leaving Parker to wonder if he even needs to be Spider-Man anymore.At the same time, Dr. Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina) is planning on unveiling a new form of energy fusion with the financial help of Osborn. He has even constructed an elaborate device to wear on his back with long tentacles attached to it to help him manipulate the machine necessary to operate the fusion device. However, when an experiment goes terribly wrong, the device becomes fused to Octavius, who is soon driven mad.Dubbed 'Doctor Octopus' by the tabloid paper Parker shoots freelance photos for, Octavius insanely goes on a crime spree to raise funds for another experiment. Parker is forced to make a choice -- does he live out his own personal dreams, or must he sacrifice his desires and live up to the responsibilities that come with his power.The fact that 'Spider-Man 2' plays with the price it costs to be a hero is certainly what makes it so interesting. Not since the original 'Superman' movie has a superhero film series invested so much into developing the life of the normal, alter-ego. Peter Parker is clearly a real character, not just a liability that gets in the way of the Spider-Man action.The movie has some awesome set pieces as well, including a lengthy battle between Spider-Man and Doc Ock that has them fighting over skyscrapers, bridges and eventually an elevated train. It's a fight every comic book fan dreams of, over-the-top, brutal, and full of nasty surprises.Director Sam Raimi manages to invoke his inner demolition derby again, giving us the same insane camera work that he used to bring 'Evil Dead II' and 'Darkman' to life, only this time he's given more room to play. Raimi manages to pull off a miracle once again, making a movie that is completely his within the studio system, without compromising the integrity of the characters or disappointing fans.Once again, Maguire gives a heartfelt performance as both Parker and the wall crawler. He makes Parker clumsy, goofy, intelligent and heartbroken, and Spider-Man tough, determined and brave, pulling off both sides of the personality flawlessly.Dunst is amiable as Mary Jane Watson, but not really distinguished. She does give MJ a certain flair, and doesn't do anything to sabotage the character, but her performance never comes off as anything other than adequate.Series newcomer Molina on the other hand is at his scenery chewing best, doing his best villain take since playing Snidely Whiplash in 'Dudley Do-Right.' He makes Octavius deranged but motivated by a good cause, which gives his evil a certain added punch.Smaller parts do not go unappreciated, either. J. K. Simmons is funny returning as J. Jonah Jameson, the anti-Spider-Man newspaper editor who serves as the movie's comedy relief. Longtime Raimi collaborator Bruce Campbell also has humorous cameo as a theater usher on a power trip.Special effects are of course top notch again, especially each of Doc Ock's tentacles, which have a distinct snakelike appearance. The webslinging scenes are still a joy to watch on the big screen, as are the otherworldly battles.If 'Spider-Man 2' has any hindrances, its due to the sometimes hokey script and other unnecessary extras. The story turns maudlin whenever someone goes off on a tangent about the importance of responsibility or about how necessary a hero is needed. A funny scene involving Spider-Man in an elevator goes on a tad too long, and a wedding subplot is thrown in seemingly randomly and resolved just as quickly.Still, 'Spider-Man 2' remains the best superhero sequel since 'Batman Returns,' and perhaps the second best of all time behind 'Superman 2.' It's rare to see a summer blockbuster get so much right, especially this summer which so far has been high on spectacle and low on humanity.Heroism remains a needed ingredient in this Post 9/11 world. You can't help but notice the strong verve on screen as New Yorkers cheer on Spider-Man as he swings into battle. His is a struggle that is powerful because, as we know, under his costume he is still just a human being. If that doesn't resonate with audiences, I don't know what will.9 out of 10 stars. This is everything a good comic book movie should be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A superhero for adults (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warning: this review contains spoilers. If you hate spoilers and have not seen the movie yet, run, run, while you still can.I need to bone up on my Spider-Man villains. So many names have been dropped in this movie that it's hard to tell where the next one will be coming from. Will it be Harry Osborn, son of the Green Goblin? Will it be John Jameson, aka Man-wolf? Will it be Dr. Connor, aka Lizard? Or will it be little, sympathetic, couldn't-possibly-hurt-a-fly-could-he Henry Jackson?You know someone in Hollywood is doing his homework and is paying attention to the fans when you can't immediately see where the next villain is coming from. True, at the end of the movie Harry Osborn finds the lair of his late father, where he stumbles upon all of Norman Osborn's Green Goblin paraphernalia. But the kicker is this franchise has been so well done that it wouldn't surprise me if the Green Goblin didn't reappear before S-M 4 or S-M 5. I just hope they won't descend into a pit of ridicule the way they did with Batman. I thought the first one was excellent, the second one was definitely not and then the downhill slope just became steeper with every following movie. Spider-Man has kept up the quality in two movies. Dare I say it? The second one was better than the first one. There, I did.Peter Parker's life is in shambles. He loves Mary Jane Watson but can't stay with her, in order to keep her away from his enemies. He lost his job as a delivery boy, he's not getting paid what he should by the Daily Bugle, his rent is way overdue. He misses class, he's under tremendous stress and that causes him to periodically lose his superpowers. Lesser men would have committed suicide, but good IL' Pete just keeps trucking along, just trying to survive.He's late for an assignment for which he wants to interview Dr. Otto Octavius, a renowned scientist that works for Osborn Industries. Dr. Octavius will demonstrate a form of fusion that yields a self-sustaining form of energy. The demonstration will go bad. Dr. Octavius will become bad. It'll be bad for everyone and their mama. But that's standard superhero fare. Where Spider-Man 2 shines is with the human emotions.Peter, as played by Tobey Maguire, is one tortured soul. More than Bruce Wayne or David Banner will ever be. He is ready to drop the whole superhero thing at the drop of a hat. And who would blame him? Everyone hates Spidey. His boss hates him, his best friend hates him, his aunt May hates him, his one true love hates him. Well, in the case of Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) she hates Peter, not Spidey. You have to be one strong-willed SOB to go through that kind of life without cracking under the pressure. Eventually, Peter cracks. He drops the whole Spidey bit and gets to taste Life, if only for a fleeting moment.Most of the movie is centered around the relationship between MJ and Peter. It's a big love story interrupted by some action here and there. This movie is not afraid to show a superhero with all his flaws and warts and shortcomings. He is the most human of all the superheroes portrayed on the big screen.A few things bothered me, though. A lot of them attack the credibility of certain situations. For example, when Peter saves a baby from a fire and gives her to the parents, they are all calm and smiling and "koo-chi-koo-chi-koo" with the kid. Come on. Any normal parent would have been so happy that they would have at least thanked the kid's saviour. That is, if they didn't plain jump on the guy to show their gratitude. Also, when the train is running a 80 mph straight for a 50-foot drop, how come everyone is packed at the front? Normal human beings would have gone running to the back to push back the inevitable as much as possible.There are some inconsistencies also. For example, when Doc Ock walks, the earth shakes... but the asphalt takes it without flinching and when he's fighting with Spidey, all that shaking' and groovin' stops.Another annoyance is the amount of screaming women in this movie. Jeez. Instead of standing there yelling their brains out, why don't they just shut up and get out of harm's way as much as possible?But like I said, these are details. The bigger stuff is more annoying. My personal beef with the whole superhero thing is that at the end of every movie, the villain must die. One of the redeeming qualities of Spider-Man and Batman, is that in the comic books, the villains they defeat keep coming back to haunt them. Of course, since they won't be doing as many movies as there are comic books, I suppose it shouldn't be that big a deal. But I find it too bad when they rub out good villains in the movies. The Joker, Doc Ock, and Darth Maul come to mind. The Goblin will come back, so we'll see how good he is. Will he really try to kill Spidey or will he chicken out, in order to spare his friend?I thought SM had great visuals. In SM2, they greatly improved the Spidey-Cam. The speed at which Spidey travels in New York and the view he gives us is mind boggling. There are some great scenes of Doc Ock and Spidey fighting, tumbling down a building and rolling on a train. All very well done. There was probably something to fault in there, but I didn't find it since I was so mesmerized by the whole thing.All in all, this is THE summer movie of 2004. Sam Raimi, the director, did a great job of transposing the comic book to the screen. Actually, I think Hollywood has realized the importance of making faithful adaptations of successful series, Catwoman notwithstanding.One of the better parts of this franchise, and the reason I say this is a superhero for adults, is the relationship between MJ, Peter and to some extent, Harry. But now that pretty much everyone in New York knows that Spidey is just a kid, I'm wondering how they'll keep the frustration level so high in the coming episodes. Without the human frailties and frustrations of difficult relationships, Spider-Man could become just another special-effect laden splatfest for the kiddies. And that would be a shame.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPIDERMAN 2 (2004)starring: Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, James Franco, Alfred Molina and Rosemarry Harris.plot: Peter Parker/Spiderman (Tobey Maguire) returns to fight off another scientist gone evil Doc Ock (Alfred Molina), who has four or six (kinda forgot) metal robotic arms. Meanwhile, as Peter continues to fall deeper in love with Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst), he finds that he is slowly losing his powers.What I Didn't Like: I don't think there was anything I didn't like. lolWhat I Liked: Each character: Peter/Spiderman, Mary Jane, Harry and Aunt May are taken to a new level and they each have something new and memorable happen to them in this movie.Also, Alfred Molina as Doc Ock is a great villain, much cooler than Willem Dafoe as The Green Goblin in the original. Spiderman and Doc Ock are involved in many cool action sequences that top the original in many ways!I give this a 10/10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>BETTER! THAN! THE! FIRST! (some spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was excited when the first Spidey movie was finally going to be released, seeing as I was waiting for it to see theaters since I was 12 years old. Once I finally saw it, I was rather satisfied. There were a few flaws, I will admit, but overall, it was still a dream come true. I believed that Spider-man re-defined the standard of what comic book movies should be.Now that I've seen "Spider-Man 2," I was beyond floored! Whatever flaws that were apparent in the first movie have been rectified. The story was fantastic, it was almost like it was a living comic book. You can definitely suspend and disbelieve in this one.Tobey Maguire has also become more comfortable in his role as Peter Parker. He's just as I envisioned him to be, a normal guy who happens to have superpowers, and is trying to maintain a semblance of a normal life.Kirsten Dunst is once again fabulous as Mary Jane Watson; my only complaint about her is since she liked the red wig in the first movie, she tried dying her whole hair red in the second, and it really didn't work...she looks more strawberry blonde (I know, I know, I'm nitpicking).The choice of Alfred Molina as Doctor Octopus was fantastic; Doc Ock is my favorite Spider-Man villain, and he did the character justice.Most improved award goes to James Franco. His Harry Osborn seemed a bit wooden in the first movie for my taste; this time around, he's a lot looser, and his ability has improved drastically! I can't wait to see what Sam Raimi has in store for him come Spider-Man 3.The supporting cast was just as good as in the first movie. Bill Nunn as Robbie Robertson, J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson, Rosemary Harris as Aunt May Parker. I loved every minute of them on screen.What really floored me was seeing Willem Dafoe make an appearance as Norman Osborn's ghost! For those familiar with the Spider-Man comics, you all know how much of an influence Norman Osborn has had even after his Death. Which brings me to...Sam Raimi. If I ever get a chance to meet him, I want to give him a hug. He is the best example of getting a director who knows the source material (are you listening Warner Brothers?). He knows that if you stay loyal to the story, the moviegoers will come.Spider-Man 2 is now the third example of a comic book movie surpassing its original; the other two examples are Superman 2 and X2: X-Men United. It's also earning its honor of being called not only one of the best comic movies, but rather one of he best movies ever made!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good film that achieves the equilibrium the first one didn't have.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think this is a good film. There are several reasons for me to think so. First, there is the screenplay that, although a little charged in some speeches, is rather appropriate to the kind of characters that appear on the film, and also gives a slight touch of humour here that the first one didn't have. Secondly, I think that the actors are perfect (and I'm talking only about this film) in their roles, above all Tobey Maguire, that seems for me to be the real incarnation of Peter Parker. For the part of Kirsten Dunst I have to say that she has improved in this sequel and seems to have found at least her place in the film. Alfred Molina is also great here, and has been able to give to his role as Dr. Otto Octavius the humanity that character needed. As for the rest of the cast, including James Franco and Rosemary Harris, they do their job quite good also. Thirdly I would like to send my congratulations to Sam Raimi, whom I consider the one that has made this film what it is. Instead of filming a purely action picture, in order to get right into the box office, he has achieved a great equilibrium between the story and the action scenes, giving the most important role to the characters and their feelings. In all the other superhero movies, there is no concentration on the hero and his feelings. That's why I think this is the best superhero movie that I've seen, because it deals with the whole idea of the inner dilemma that this superhero has. Finally, the action scenes are breathtaking and they give support to the whole story without eclipsing it. In general, this film isn't the best of the History for sure but I think that it has to have the place in it that deserves, if just for the sake of being a well-made film. I personally give it a 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spiderman 2, hyped more than the first, better effects than the first, better movie than the first? Not quite. This Spiderman had two missing factors. First off, Willem Defoe(spelling?). NO villain could ever measure up. He was absolutely amazing and I dont think even as good as Molina is, he had any shot at matching him. The other missing factor was a good ending. Spiderman is defeated by Doc Ock once, yet all he does is talk to the villain at the end and he submits and kills himself? thats too easy. The last 10 minutes were unnecessary, we already knew harry would become the goblin with out him finding that room and without the green tie at the wedding. Then MJ running through the city in a dress, i almost choked. Raimi is an excellent director, but he couldnt save that ending. I also think the screenplay from the first was better. This movie was still fantastic though, i'm just a picky comic book fan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Simply put, Spider-Man 2 is one amazing film. The complexity, depth, heart and action were off the charts. I honestly can't remember when I saw a better movie. I totally agree with film critic Roger Ebert when he calls this movie the best comic adaptation film of all-time. I echo the high praise his partner Richard Roeper and just about every other critic in the world has given this instant classic?thumbs WAY up from me too! I was stunned by how many times I was actually moved emotionally by the film's plot. I know many movies claim to have something for everyone but this one manages to pull it off while remaining interesting and compelling all the way through. There are spectacular action scenes as well as heartfelt family moments. There is romance and there is humor. I can't imagine anyone age 8 through 65 not enjoying some aspect of this film. Director Sam Raimi, the cast/crew and writers should all be proud of this masterpiece and take a bow.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spider-Man is not a superhero. He's two. He's an outcast just like the Hulk or the X-Men, but unlike those he has two very different personalities in Peter Parker and Spider-Man. He shares that with Superman and Batman. I hate to call Batman a superhero (where's his superpowers? ? last time I checked a large bank account didn't qualify) but you get the picture.Spider-Man (Tobey Maguire) is so depressed in this movie that he actually stops being Spider and just becomes Man. He realizes he wants a normal life with the love his life Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) who has become very tired of waiting and instead gets engaged with an astronaut. The first part of the movie is all about the bad sides of being a superhero. Tiresome work fighting bad guys, no money and a small and depressing apartment with a landlord that has decided to make your life a hell. Even a scene with symbolism for the insane where his Spider-Man costume colors his white clothes red and blue. Awww ... But just as he has thrown away his costume (why not sell it, if you're so poor?) the city needs him again. The physician Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina) installs four artificially intelligent and (apparentely) indestructible tentacles on his back that takes over his mind during a failed experiment. He becomes Doctor Octopus or "Doc Ock" and the enemy of the city (New York) and every person who lives in it. But Octavius is not evil in himself. He's more like Frankenstein's monster with the difference that he created himself. I won't comment on the high-tech part of the film, being so ridiculously unbelievable that it doesn't matter. Speaking of matter, did I forget to mention that once Doc Ock has been mean to a bunch of people and a bank, he hides outside the city to create some weird ball of fusion that will suck all matter surrounding it and become even bigger and stronger.Spider-Man 2 is funny, but not because of the dialogue. It's the small things that does it, and Tobey Maguire with his very subtle gestures. I actually laughed out loud once, and the rest of the cinema audience at least seven times. It is also romantic, more so than the first movie. Mary Jane's patience finally running out, Parker weighing superhero powers to love and deciding on the latter, etc. And the action scenes and special effects are better than those in the first movie. The tentacles are a nice work of art, and the fight on the train a thrilling moment, better than any scene from the first movie.So yes, I am concluding that Spider-Man 2 is better than its predecessor. The good parts are all better, and the ending (the worst part) is the same. But there are two other things with this movie that I don't like that weren't so apparent in the first one. First out is the role of Mary Jane. It's somewhat contradicting to itself, and let me explain why:In the intro, the only real photograph you see among all the drawings is Mary Jane's. It's a subtle way to say that her role is to Spider-Man what the sun is to the Earth (or anything that circles around something else). I don't mind her being passive throughout the movie, but here she is too much so. She even gets kidnapped and has to be saved a bunch of times by Spider-Man. I hope she gets a bigger role in the third movie.The second thing is the out-of-place dialogue. I don't know how many times people said stuff that no normal person would say in such a situation. For instance the train driver who mocks Spider-Man when he's about to save his life. Or Doc Ock's "important" comment on Parker's laziness in the end of the movie. Other than that this was a good movie. I rate it way higher than the Hulk and slightly above X-Men 2.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We have at least found a cure for insomnia. I am a frequent moviegoer, and that means seeing lots of bad movies along withexcellent movies, and this was the closest I've come to sacrificingmy 10 bucks and walking out during the middle.Kirsten Dunst and Tobey Maguire are just plain bad actors.There's no getting around it. Anytime there was dialogue betweenthe two, I swore it felt like it took over an hour, with them usuallyconveying the same message in the previous 2 or 3 on screeninteractions. The best character in the movie, Molina's Dr Octopus,we don't get nearly enough of in this flick. The plot of movie was predictable, but I was willing to accept thaton the basis of its a comic book movie, and we all know roughlywhat was to come to pass anyways. So, in that regard, I waswaiting for the acting and cinematography to blow me away, andall the movie did was put me to sleep. Even most of the actionsequences and special effects in the movie were just downrightlame. Instead of wasting your time with this drivel, rent the X menseries, thats how you translate a comic book movie onto the bigscreen.</fullReview>

Alfred Molina (Doc Ock) is quite poor also...they could have fitted the 'arms' to a dustbin and it would have looked better.J K Simmons (JJ) is good but tends to steal the movie away from the star (Parker/Spiderman).The script was awful and sounded like it had been knocked together in 5 mins, or less.

		<shortDescription>It's not about the special effects, it's about the story, the characters, and the human drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two years, ago Sam Raimi brought Spiderman to the screen in spectacular fashion. Of all the come book super heroes romping around on the big screen since then, some have managed to be good, a few have struggled to be just okay, and some have reeked of super doo doo. Absolutely none of these wannabes such as The Hulk, Hellboy, or Daredevil, have come close to matching the success of Raimi's Spiderman. For all their razzle dazzle CGI special effects, none of the writers and directors of those films seemed to be able to grasp the fact that when all is said and done, it's still the story, the characters, and the human drama that counts. Peter Parker could be the guy next door, your best friend down the street, your cousin, your nephew or even me. He is just an ordinary guy, who has been blessed with powers that he didn't ask for, and much of the time would just as soon not be burdened with the responsibilities and anguish that comes as part of the deal. So after almost two years and two full months since we last saw Spiderman, the question remains as to whether or not Raimi can recapture the magic. The answer is that he not only recaptures it, he harvests it, weaves it, and packages it in a film that surpasses the original in every way imaginable. This film surpasses the first one in so many aspects that I almost feel compelled to go back and lower the A grade I bestowed upon that one. That was then, however, and this is now, and this is as good as it gets. From the time the opening credits hit the screen you know there's something special in store. Raimi does a recap by using comic book paintings to recapture important details of the original film. I can't remember any film where I wanted it to start over again just so I could soak in the opening sequence. The artwork is done by an artist named Alex Ross, and this is the first time I felt it necessary to give acclaim to someone about film credits, but he deserves it.As for Peter Parker things aren't going too well. He still carries a torch for Mary Jane who has a new boyfriend, his best friend Harry Osborn is obsessed with avenging his father's death, his late night hours fighting crime as Spiderman are causing him to flunk his college courses, he's always late for work delivering pizzas, and his mother is in such bad financial straits that the bank may foreclose on her home. It's enough to make a guy want to give up the ghost, or failing that his Spiderman costume. Worst of all, as his personal life begins to weigh heavily on Peter Parker, his Spiderman powers seem to be diminishing, sometimes failing him altogether at the worst possible moment.In order to keep from failing one of his classes, Peter is doing a paper on Dr. Otto Octavious whom is experimenting with fusion as a viable energy source. Eventually Harry, who is financing the Dr.'s experiments, takes Peter to meet him and shortly thereafter with scientists and the press in attendance, Dr. Octavius begins his experiment. In order to handle the material needed to carry out the experiment, Dr. Octavious has huge tentacles connected to his body. When the experiment goes awry, the tentacles permanently fuse to his body and develop a will of their own, while controlling his mind and turning him into Doc Ock. Just as in the first Spiderman, we have another villain that is in some ways a lot like Peter Parker. Like Spiderman, Norman Osborne was changed into the Green Goblin, not because he wanted to be but because of an overzealousness in perfecting scientific experiments. Norman may not have been the best person on Earth, but he was far from being evil. The same can be said of Dr. Octavius. He is a good scientist working to better things for mankind, but just as Norman Osborne found out, you better make sure you know exactly what you're doing. Both of these are perfect examples of what makes a good villain. In a way, we can almost sympathize with their misfortune much in the same we sympathize with the dilemma of everyday life wearing on Peter Parker. Why other films such as Hellboy find it necessary to give us villains who come from incomprehensible mumble jumbo hooey phooey is something I'll never understand. Spiderman doesn't require us to take a notepad and pencil along with us so we can map a convoluted plot that we have to spend so much time figuring out that by the time we do we've lost interest in the film the characters and everything else.There was a time when Tobey Maguire was almost replaced by Jake Gyllenhaal for the sequel. I don't know how Gyllenhaal would have done and frankly, I'm glad we didn't have the chance to find out. Maguire is able to portray the burdens he faces as Peter Parker without falling into the trap of overplaying the role with so much angst that we lose our identity with him. As he worships Mary Jane from afar, we feel the love, we feel the pain, but not too much that the film becomes weighed down by it. To not have Toby as Spiderman, they should just as well put George Clooney in the role. Both James Franco as Harry and Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane manage to bring even more depth to their characters. Harry is still tortured by the fact that he never seemed able to live up to his father's expectations. The experiments of Dr. Octavius are crucial for him to be able to lift that burden because if successful, he will have surpassed anything his father had accomplished. When the experiment fails, the only driving force left in his soul is his desire for revenge against Spiderman whom he mistakenly holds responsible for his father's death. Mary Jane has become a model and an actress. She is now independent and self-assured, and despite the fact that she may love Peter, she is determined to move on with her life. Let's not forget Rosemary Harris as Aunt May. Unlike the first film, she is given much more to do here. She has some great scenes, some funny moments, and some very touching ones. Whereas the first film explored in depth the relationship between Peter and his Uncle Ben, we get more in depth story between Peter and his Aunt here. She is not in this film just to bake cakes and pat Peter on the head.As for the special effects, what can I say except that in every way they surpass anything you've seen before. The arms of Dr. Octavius wave around as if they have a mind of their own. When Spiderman goes to battle with him, it makes the confrontations between Spidey and The Green Goblin pale by comparison. There is an amazing battle in a bank, and an even more fantastic one aboard an Elevated train. Not to mention that we find out what it's like to be Spiderman and try to deliver pizzas as a superhero. Some found the special effects in the first film flawed. I was not one of them but just the same, they are done with such precision and expertise here, flowing seamlessly between CGI and live action. You won't know the difference.You'll also be happy to know that Raimi does an excellent job in wrapping up this episode, yet is able to already begin setting up Spiderman 3 in the process. It's a perfect example how to just wet your appetite for the next one, yet leave you completely satisfied with the conclusion at hand.For all the special effects, all the battles, and all the scenes of Spiderman flying around the Manhattan skyscrapers, without the human elements the film would be just another special effects extravaganza we would forget about as soon we walk out of the theater. Raimi understands this better than anybody else. So does Maguire and the rest of the cast. It's the burdens, the conflicts, and the passion that Spiderman carries inside himself that lift him so far above any of the other Super heroes. That's what has made these films truly something special. It has been years since I felt compelled to pay money to see a film twice in a theater. The last time I did was probably for one of the original Star Wars films. I think I'll be seeing Spiderman in a theater for a second time, and that's the highest recommendation I can think of. And if I'm going to the theater for a second time you can damn well bet I have no choice but to give Spiderman 2 an unqualified, resounding, A+.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was good from start to finish from the little "montage" introduction sequence featuring key moments from the first film to the action packed sequences featuring Spiderman and Doc Ock.What makes this better is that there is no story-line to set-up now, all the necessary characters are already accounted for, and it gives the audience more of an exciting Spider-man film!Doc Ock is a worthy villain (although not as famous as the Green Goblin) and Alfred Molina does a wonderful job as the doctor. He pulls off being sincere (as the good doctor) and "menacing" just as brilliantly!This film picks up where the last movie left off, with Peter trying to juggle between being Spiderman, a job and college. And in each respect, he seems to not be doing particularly well! In between this, Peter is still trying to maintain a "relationship" with MJ and Harry!During the film, Peter has many "revelations" about himself and about the people he cares about, and makes a "significant" choice about his future!This film is MUCH better than the original and the ending sets up the plot nicely for the third film! If you like Spiderman... GO WATCH THIS FILM!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Storytelling and comic books. It CAN BE DONE. (one spoiler)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked the first Spider Man, I thought it was handled very well, but when I went to see Spider Man 2 - I was totally blown away. First of all, the story --- a magnificently structured screenplay that hit all the right notes. Who says that great action films are made in the action sequences? The reason why the action sequences in this film were so fantastic, was because the characters were so fully drawn out, given time to develop, and it gave us time for us to developed a sense of them, caring about them, and then, the action sequences hit. Such amazing moments. The acting is top notch, especially Tobey Mcguire, who endowed the character with such depth of feeling.Ever the skeptic, I kept hinting at moments that would go wrong. At times, when the screenwriter would take the cliche way out. But then, something happen, the moment right after the action sequence in the train, a moment when the passengers hold on to spidey, and pull him inside, and a man says "he's just a kid." ---I don't mind saying, that I breathed deeply and tears rolled down my eyes. Why? because for one second, Sam Raimy, let me see the heart of the movie. Underneath this glossy, special effects action filled movie, there's something that is all too lacking in the comic book film adaptations that I have recently seen, and that's a heart as big and as deep as a child's imagination.</fullReview>

The relationship between Peter and Mary Jane got really annoying. The message is that Peters life sucks, but it just goes too far when he cant get a refreshmentnew not once but 3 times at the party.The movie could have been a lot better, and gone for next years Oscars, since there is no other major block buster this year.When you have seen this movie you will thinks its a good movie, worth the time and money spent, but it isn't great. It certainly isn't awesome, the way I felt after seeing the first Lord of the Rings.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spider-Man 2 is a modern classic. It is sad, macabre, funny, has haunting music, is wonderful to watch, exciting, powerful, has great acting, is thrilling, and should win Best Picture. Possibly the best film of the year. Tobey Maguire is subtle, quiet, and perfect as Peter. Alfred Molina is having great fun as Doctor Octopus. So is J.K. SImmons as J. Jonah Jameson. Everyone is terrific. The special effects are better then the first. And when Spidey is swinging through NY, the joy and wonder makes you feel like a little kid at a baseball game. And so I close with ***** out of 5. See it now in theaters</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Arguably the best superhero film to date</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow. Usually, sequels don't surpass the original. But this one did it with flying colors, and then some. "Spider-Man 2" was completely above my expectations, considering how good the first film was. I was blown away by the eye-popping visual effects (a solid improvement from film #1), the engaging characters (Tobey Maguire is the perfect Peter Parker), the heartbreaking and heart-lifting drama (all without being too clichd or corny while remaining true to the spirit of the comics), the bad-ass villain (Alfred Molina surprising us as a VERY convincing Doc Ock), and the comedy needed in a Spider-Man movie (i.e., the Laundromat scene; the elevator scene with Hal Sparks; the terribly off-key woman singing the "Spider-Man" theme; the "Raindrops Keep Fallin' On My Head" montage). While the first movie introduced us to Peter Parker and how the troubled teenager became Spidey, this movie shows us how difficult his life is. Juggling his schoolwork, paying his late rent, delivering pizzas, taking pics for the Bugle, fighting crime, AND trying to tell MJ how he feels about her, just shows how taxing Spider-Man has been on his life. And yet, he keeps at it, thinking that it's his moral obligation and responsibility to protect those who can't protect themselves, all because he was indirectly responsible for his uncle's death. And now he's reached the crossroads where he must decide whether or not he should carry on with this burden or start life anew, without Spider-Man. Sam Raimi does a brilliant job directing this film, and it doesn't hurt having an Oscar-winning screenwriter and Pulitzer-winning author at your side writing the screenplay. Tobey Maguire once again dazzles us with his performance as the tortured Parker, Kirsten Dunst does a great job as Mary Jane, and James Franco improves greatly from the first movie as the Spidey-hating Harry Osborn. But the real showstopper is Alfred Molina, fantastically portraying Doctor Octopus (considered by many comic fans as one of the best supervillains ever). Despite in the first film having Willem Dafoe's very good performance overshadowed by the clunky, Power Rangers-like costume, Molina has free rein as the sinister Doc Ock, accompanied by those four, bad-ass metal tentacles (an amazing marriage of CGI wizardry and live puppetry). There'll be some moments where you feel really sorry for him, and some moments where you want Spidey to bash his head in. "Spider-Man 2" will attract fans of all kinds of movie genres: action, adventure, fantasy, sci-fi, romance, drama, and comedy. If you're looking for a summer blockbuster, a movie that'll make you feel good, or a superhero movie at its best, see "Spider-Man 2". You won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

The scenes with Spider-man flying over New York, the script, the fights, the jokes, Doctor Octopus, the special effects... All the actors that appear in the movie are great in their roles (I think that's definitely Sam Raimi's merit as I do not consider Tobey Maguire a great actor) I loved Spider-man 1, X-Men or X-Men 2, but the "comic-book feeling" is so intense in this one, that I'm sure that anyone that has read Spidey comics will enjoy this to the limit.

		<fullReview>Spider- man one brought us into the life of Peter Parker (Mguire) then soon brought us into the life of his Alter-Ego Spider- Man. Developing story lines with the love of MJ(dunst), and the death of a villain(Defoe), that just happened to be the father of his close friend Harry Osborn(Franco).In the second one we are brought back into the life of Peter Parker, but life as he new it, has changed. MJ and Harry has split, school is getting harder to stay awake in, Aunt May is having financial problems, Harry has taken' over OScorp, a new villain is on the lose, and he's having problems with being spider - man. For a good chunk of the movie, you see how being Spider - Man tares Peter down, and then you get to see the other side of a totally different side of the universe, one without Spider - man. But as he figures out that the new villain Dock ock is running amuck, and he comes to realize the importance of having a hero, he comes to his senses.Sam Ramie I believe has over done himself, he brought in the most deadly villains known to Marvel fans, Doctor Octopus, a megalomaniac with four antiminium tentacles that are more than deadly, with Raids writers, who added in some really cool plot twists that will keep you going " what?" throughout the movie were also great. another thing I liked was how he keeps Marvel fans ( like myself) guessing who will be the next villain, cuz some plot twists suggest the Hobgoblin, The Lizard, or even Venom, who knows.I know a lot of people are talking badly about certain elements about this movie, like a " Rain drops are falling on my head" diddy in the movie, but I think it totally fit the mood at the time, and I found it cheesy but satisfying. they have topped the first in a dramatic point of view, but the first is still the best in the action view, some of the Ock fights were amazingly cool and edge of your seat fun, but I believe Sam this time didn't focus on the action so much as he did on developing characters that people will cheer for in the up coming film ( coming 2007). I highly recommend this piece of art movie for any one and everyone, even if you didn't like the first one. characters are more believable, and the effects have improved along with a story that makes this movie a loner in its own category. this is a very GREAT movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have read some posts that are very scathing of this movie..... See it again, or just stay away period........ I would like to hear what those individuals think is true fare, worthy of enjoyment.. Fans of Spiderman comics and TV will always be here..Newcomers expecting Olivier or Brando need to get a life...! Raimi does a fantastic job not letting this movie become the same as the first!Now, for Spiderman 3..... Remember the 1967 animated series that had Electro, Goblin and Sandman as a triumvirant of enemies...That would work, as well as MJ, dodging the inevitable capture/hostage thing.....Allow her to do well on her own, and not be a mere shadow....Not Ripley, just ....her own savvy existence........This next installment will be tough, but give Raimi enough time or ANY director for that matter, the latitude to direct, unimpeded by studios that insist on deadlines, as well as a small test audience screening on the 3rd installment, to keep from killing the HUGE following of loyalists that expect excellence from this series.A balance of the CGI action and fleshing out of the characters is sooooooooo important.... I am so happy that both Norman Osborn and Otto Octavious were GOOD people to begin with....THAT is the difference between these movies and soooooooooooo many others.....Kudos Raimi!!!!!! That now allows the criminally insane villains to be introduced down the road...I know of several of Spidey's villains who all fit that description , and they may be next up....I like that Curt Connors and John Jameson have been brought forth... The Lizard..... Harry's Goblin.... Jameson's Astronaut..... Mysterio..... Kraven the Hunter.... The Vulture..... The Kingpin..... The Rhino.... Sandman.... Scorpion.... Shocker..... Medusa....as a foil for MJ too? Now, that's a thought....! Doc Ock.....he's not dead, I know.........I would think that a Mastermind with maybe one or two of the aforementioned villains as henchmen, would probably do the trick.... And don't forget to use some of those old time jazzy background music ditties that used to be part of the '67 series, give 'em a millennium flair and we'll be off and running...I would avoid any of the retarded NEW SPIDERMAN villains left out..that cartoon series of a mess I see on TV these days.........forget about 'em, they don't carry the same weight as the original series villains...they're just too contrived.....Just do a GREAT JOB with the 3rd installment.. 'Nuff said.....And you TMC and Bravo classic types....Go seek your MacBeth elsewhere..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you've been climbing the walls waiting for the new Spiderman film, then your wait has been worth it. Without doubt the finest superhero film to ever be put on screen, Spiderman 2 encapsulates every frame from the best comic book/graphic novel you've read and more! Tobey Maguire returns as the love torn Peter Parker, who is caught between his love for Mary Jane Watson and his role as the crime stopping superhero. Parker knows he can never reveal his identity to Mary Jane as his enemies will go after her. And so he has to co-exist in two worlds, in one a masked avenger for good, the other a put upon photographer whose world is one of broken promises and missed opportunities. And so Parker decides to leave the mask and tights for good and try a life without crime solving. But he doesn't reckon on Doctor Octopus, a genius scientist, who after a freak accident is transformed into a super-villain with four metal tentacles coming out of his body. And so the fight is on, as Peter battles the evil of Doctor Octopus while wrestling with his feelings for the girl he loves. Directed by Sam Raimi, Spiderman 2 manages to outdo its predecessor on every level. Not one scene is wasted, not one character feels misplaced. Maguire as Parker/Spiderman gives the role a deeper quality than its creator Stan Lee must have envisioned when he penned the character. Kirsten Dunst, as Mary Jane Watson displays a chemistry with Maguire that makes her scenes full of passion, while Alfred Molino as Doctor Octopus brings the right touch of evil mixed with good that makes such characters so tragic. And JK Simmons as J Jonah Jameson is magnificent as the Spiderman hating newspaper editor whose opinion of the wall crawler changes with every newspaper headline. If you only watch one super hero film in your life, watch this one. A film that brings out the hero in all of us</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good movie from an unexpected source</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Spider-man 2', while caching all that money summer blockbusters make succeeds to rally unexpected fans, while drawing critics from the usual audience which one would expect to be happy to see one of their preferred products. The IMDB viewers column is full of comments from good cinema fans pleasantly surprised by the movie, while comics movies fans complain about plot holes and too much emotional stuff. I belong to the first category, and I do not regret having been dragged into the cinema theater by my teenager son. Besides the air-conditioning on a 40 centigrades afternoon, I really enjoyed the plot, which had logic - human and emotional logic for a change, the action scenes, which made sense, were clear and not confusing, and the fact that I saw the main character facing a credible human vs. hero dilemma. BTW, the theme of incompatibility between the super-hero status and human emotions is a classical theme, from ancient legends, through many other literature works - but we are not here for an art history lesson, are we? Certainly, the film would have been better without the last five syrup minutes, but overall 'SP-man 2' is a proof that there are no forbidden genres, and that a good director in a season of inspiration can turn almost any material into real cinema. I am no fan of Tobey Maguire, and I did not become one after having seen the movie. Kirsten Dunst is better in the role of the love interest of the hero, and I will keep watching her, as well as the rest of the feminine crowd in 'Mona Lisa Smile', which kind of defines the new generation of actresses in the US cinema. Best act comes from Alfred Molina in the bad guy supporting role. Good cinema lovers, you deserve a break from time to time from 'serious' movies. Take this one for a relaxing, but still decent cinema experience. 8 out of 10 on my personal scale.</fullReview>

The chemistry between the actors, the well paced and spaced action, the absolute great stroke of genius casting and portraying Doc Occ and JJJ. This follow on to what was a great first movie, has more story, deepens relationships, and creates more drama. Your first hints that this movie is well done, start with the artwork in the opening credits, they are a great representation of the first story. I would certainly have liked the "secret" of spiderman kept a bit longer, but I suppose they aren't making a 7 year sitcom, I think in the end there won't be enough sequels for my liking :)It's not a 10 imho, I would reserve that for the true epics, but it is well placed among the top of great movie releases.</fullReview>

X-Men was better than the 2nd, but this is the SPIDER-MAN 2 comments..and this movie ROCKED.Anyone willing to challenge this comment, go for it. Because I am fully willing to debate this one. Spider-Man 2 was a great movie. And I'm not even close to being a comic-book fan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Made with a lot of love and care</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen the movie only once and I have been itching to watch it again ever since. This movie is a rare combination of storytelling, action and character development that we see only in classics. Directors usually forget that action is only exciting if you care about the characters involved. Moreover, sequels often fail because the characters are more or less the same as the first movie or the sequel doesn't even bother further development of the character. The main characters have all moved forward with their lives and are each facing their own problems. They could each have their own movie which says a lot about how finely developed the characters have become. Aunt May is now a widower and alone. Peter is failing in life as his superhero skills are becoming more polished. Harry is now running Oscorp and is starting to fall under the weight of hatred against Spiderman.The only character staying more or less the same is MJ...I would have liked to have seen a more dramatic character arc for her. Perhaps really disliking Peter at one point.Take away the action scenes and this movie can stand on its own as an entertaining drama. A lot of love and care..and skill clearly went into making this movie. Editing was fantastic. There were two well done music video-like segments in the movie. Its very hard to suddenly jump into music video mode but Rami does it very effectively and makes good use of these segments. The transitions into these segments were flawless. The "Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head" segment really had me smiling. A good director can use these segments to convey a lot of information and feeling in a short period of time. In that segment, Rami shows us passage of time, Peter getting his life back together, and his adjustment away from Spiderman..and lets us understand that this is a good thing. This was a critical juncture of the movie and Rami took a risk doing it this way but really pulled it off. The segment was also a great change of pace from what had been a rather dark first half. The first music segment was also really well done as well.The action sequences are good and moving but there is a lot more going on in this movie. The cinematography is first rate. Every shot in this movie could be a movie poster.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A money spinner - again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why are superheroes so angst-ridden and reluctant to embrace their persona of power? It might be because they know that, in any sequel, they'll have to face an even stronger villain or that the costume will make a relationship difficult or that there will be pressure for the follow-up movie to be as financially successful as the first. Well, Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) needn't have worried. Once he conquers his self-doubt and ejaculation difficulties, he's certainly a match for Doctor Octavius (Alfred Molina); like Clark Kent in "Superman 2", he comes to a new understanding with his girlfriend; and, as far as the box office is concerned, he's proved to be a money spider. Although it drags at times, there is plenty of bone-crunching action here, leavened with some neat touches of humour, and the runaway train sequence is especially thrilling. When S-M is swinging through the streets between the towering skyscrapers of New York, it is very obviously CGI-generated imagery, but still exciting. What is so brilliant is the realisation of 'Doc Ock', a really good bad guy that is one of the very best translations from comic strip to celluloid. Kirsten Dunst, as Sarah Jane Watson, still doesn't do anything for me, looking most of the time like the girl next door who's lost her glasses, but Peter is keen to net her and he's pretty doe-eyed himself. Director Sam Raimi has come well into the mainstream since making gore feist "The Evil Dead", but there's still enough violence here to push at the boundaries of the PG certificate and the scene is well set up for "Spider-Man 3".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lots of people want to characterize spidey 2 as a flaming pile when it was anything but. First off, it was a comic adaptation/action movie. What were you expecting, spidey haters? As to the claim that this one was better or worse than the first, I think everybody's missed the boat on this one, as I find them both to be about the same (that is, not as good xmen or xmen 2, which I find to be possibly better than the first batman with keaton). So the effects were a lot better in spidey 2 though I didn't like the way they handled the villain monologues this time, it was still a kick butt movie (and I hope they develop whatever the deal is with peter's girly neighbor). bottom line: pick this over catwoman.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to see Spiderman 2 with an open mind having seen all the hype and even eaten the associated burger.I didn't see the first one on the big screen but was somehow drawn towards seeing the second so I bought number 1 on DVD and was impressed.This one however didn't live up to expectation...it was quite slow and lacked the pace in parts of the first one. The action sequences were good not as good as the first one.Alfred Molina was great as Dr Ock, Kirsten Dunst and Tobey Maguire as the hero were again on fine form. However it was spoilt as the love interest storyline took centre stage detracting from the Dr Ock plot and there was a noticeable period where the villain didn't appear.By far the best parts of the film were the inspired opening credits which briefly outlined the first film and the in-jokes about Peter hurting his back (Tobey Maguire hurt his back prior to making the film and they almost had to re-cast the role). I was the only one chuckling in the cinema when they came.....Overall I'd give it 7 out of 10 compared with 8.5 for the first one....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found this film surprisingly good. i thought i would sit down in the theatre for two long hours watching an all action-filled sequal that i'll blast on the internet the next day. Amazingingly, it's got quite some heart although I don't understand how spider-man loses his powers (oops... sorry for those who hasn't seen the film) other than it built a touching story.MJ and Peter's relationship built up perfectly like I thought it would and the revelation of Spider-man at the end made me even impressed and surprised. You don't have many super-hero movies ending that way and I thought it was good it did. James Franco did an OK job, although could've done a better job when he took the mask off Spider-man and was meant to be shocked. I love the direction and style Raimi took in the hospital scene although I really hate horror films and don't watch many of them. Raimi hit the Hitchcock style on the button with that scene.</fullReview>

Spider-man 2 is a definite must-see for all ages. Tobey Maguire does well playing Peter Parker aka spider-man as a young adult facing all his spider-man responsibilities, as will as his alter ego's ones. The movie made you feel sorry for poor peter and when you think it's bad enough, Doc Ock just has to come into the picture. I absolutely love the music for Spider-Man 2 and I've seen it in theaters numerous times. I can't wait for it to come out on VHS and DVD. I rank it number 1 on my top ten movie list.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This will just be a short review. But not too short or IMDB will keep telling me to add more lines.THIS IS A GREAT FILM! SEE IT NOW!Sam Raimi is brilliant. I've loved his films for years, but with Spidey he has surpassed himself. The way he balances the emotions with the action is amazing. You wouldn't expect a summer action blockbuster to have this much introspection and angst, but it does! And it works!Lots of people will talk about the special effects, which are great, but unless you have a good story to go with it it just doesn't work (see Van Helsing for confirmation). My only gripe with this film is that Doctor Octopus is underdeveloped as a character. But that's only a small gripe.I have a feeling that I will enjoy this film even more on subsequent viewings, and I can't wait to try. Roll on Spidey 3 in 2007!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You've heard the old rule that sequels are never better than the original - but rules are made to be broken.This is superior to Spider-Man in so many ways. The story is more involving, with several different threads interweaving to keep the viewer interested. Tobey Maguire has settled into his role as Peter Parker and, in many scenes, conveys his emotional turmoil without the need for words. Doc Ock is an infinitely more interesting villain than the Green Goblin, and as a result, the action scenes are much more highly-charged.In fact, with less reliance on action to keep the film moving, and better special effects when these scenes do appear, this is the most fun I've had in a cinema all year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went into this one feeling reasonably nonplussed, having seen the first one which got rave reviews from everywhere in the UK and yet I thought was good, but not great.This, however, is not the same as Spiderman 2. Here we have a film that is far more mature than its predecessor, with much more action and a most intriguing storyline. There are no real twists as it's fairly apparent what's going to happen, but the acting was excellent throughout and there was a genuine care and loving attention to detail captured in this film, once again showing just what a great Director Sam Raimi can be and how good the cast and crew are that work with him on this franchise.Well recommended, in my opinion far superior to the first film and far better paced, one more for the adults perhaps, but still good, clean pop-corn fun for all to enjoy. Hats off as well to 'Doc Ock' who seems a far more realistic and believable villain. In some ways, this film reminded me of Superman 2. When you watch it, you'll know exactly what I mean, but it stands on its own as a genuine crowd-pleaser and certainly deserves the praise and business it's receiving from the Box Office.If this is the direction the Spiderman franchise is going, then roll on Spiderman 3, I await with much anticipation!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spiderman is not a movie star!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm sure that, in one way or another, most of us have some connection with Spidey. Maybe, we read the comics, maybe we saw the cartoons. For many, he is their cherished figurehead of the comic book universe. He is human enough for us to identify with him, yet powerful enough to be totally at home amongst the ranks of Superman, Batman, Wolverine, etc as a true super-hero. However, I don't know if he'll ever be the centrepiece of a truly excellent piece of cinema.I'd found the first film mildly entertaining, but far inferior to the first (and then the second) X-men film, and while I thought that this was slightly better, there is hardly a scene or a line that has stuck in my mind a week after my first viewing. Its not that Raimi did anything particularly wrong, in fact I think that his direction was generally very good, though the pacing was a little slow at times. I thought that the casting was excellent again, as well, with the exception of Dunst. Her relationship with Jake Gyllenhall seems to have been taking its toll, as like Gyllenhall, she looks increasingly like she's about to fall asleep (come on Kirsten, you can do it, open those eyelids.A little more, a little more, oh forget it...) Doc Ock was ace, and I don't think could have been done much better, either in characterisation or special effects. I enjoyed the flying cars (especially the cafe scene), the wall crawling battles, and the subtle comic moments. In fact, the only scenes that attracted my violent dislike were the ridiculous scene on the train (people love you really Spiderman!) and the risible final wedding dress-through-the park sequence. Overall then, I have to admit, it was a pleasant and entertaining way to spend a couple of hours on a Friday night, but something was definitely missing. On reflection, I've got to say (and I know that I risk possible assassination for this next statement) that I think the problem was that Spiderman does not actually cut it as a movie star. Let's get this straight, I love the cartoons and the comics, and I think that the character is great as a 2-dimensional wise-cracking crime fighter, but I don't think that he or the world that Stan Lee and others created around him transition as well on to the silver screen. Batman brooded with menace through his first two installments (lets forget about the Schumacher debacles), and with the x-men, there were so many of them that I never got fed up with any of the characters, with Spidey though I didn't get anything new from watching Maguire portray him although I think he did as well as he could. If anything, the injection of another dimension to his cartoon persona actually made him seem flatter than before.Now, before the backlash begins, I don't think I'm directly attacking Spiderman as a character. My point is that to move from cartoon/comic to movie star is not always a good career move. Its not always a welcome promotion. I think this is definitely the case with Peter Parker and his masked friend. Its not that he's not as good as the other heroes but that I believe that Spidey is specially suited to a graphic portrayal. Ask me why, and I'll have to say I don't know. I'm afraid I can't pin it down to any specific factor. It is totally possible that I was just having a bad day. Maybe, I'd just overloaded on films based on comics and Spidey happened to be the last straw. Who knows?Anyway, one thing I can say for sure, it wasn't as bad as Daredevil...</fullReview>

Doc Ock is the best Spiderman villain ever. Glad they made this one. Doc Ock was evil from the start in the comics but I am glad they make him more human gone mad in the movie. It made for a more interesting story. The ending left loose ends enough to keep you guessing on the next movie. I hope they go with Harry's storyline. This is clearly the movie of the year. I hope the Academy does not ignore it come March 2005. It would be a travesty. Alfred Molina should easily get a supporting actor nod. So should Rosemary Harris. The screenplay is clearly the best one this year and the effects are impeccable! This should be a no-brainer for the Hollywood set!</fullReview>

Tobey Maguire was born for the role and brings a level of humanity to the character that is intensely moving; you will feel connected to Peter and his struggles in a way that it would seem impossible to feel connected to a "superhero." The world needs Spider-Man, and yet, at the same time, who can blame Peter for wanting to have a normal life? I laughed out loud at parts and was close to tears by the end of the movie. Best of all, Spider-Man 2 passed my test of the mark of a truly great movie...upon a second viewing, I was just as enthralled as I had been the first time. Don't miss this movie.</fullReview>

So where are the truly memorable set-pieces: the Eiffel Tower elevator, Niagara Falls, the arctic ice palace? Where are the villains who are actually bad, rather than temporarily misguided, and who you actually have any interest in seeing killed? I'm talking about Superman 2, of course. This second Spider-Man movie is a slight improvement on the woeful trash of the first, but it's still banal, joyless, forgettable tripe; it's the kind of perniciously inane summer fodder that seems to lower the IQ of anyone who sees it. And the idea that we need a third one of these, with the guy in the goblin costume again, just beggars belief.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finest Marvel Film Yet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERSPersonally, I'm not an enormous fan of the original "Spiderman" movie. Whilst some friends are huge superhero buffs, the limitation of aspects of Spiderman's life is enough for me. Anyway, the first time the web slinger featured felt irritating and dull and a film to be watched once and ignored. The sequel, by comparison, has been reviewed by others (in particular Jonathan Ross) as the finest superhero film ever, and this is probably a fair description.In this second chapter in the life of Peter Parker, we are placed twelve months after the original. Beautifully explained by a quality animated beginning which explains all, we are shown straight away the problems our hero faces. Simply put, Parker's life is s**t. Unable to hold down a job, he also finds it impossible to focus on his education and his love Mary Jane is engaged to an astronaut. With a fellow scientist, the brilliant Doctor Octavious, turning evil, Peter is forced to choose between his own life and the life of his alternative being.In "Spiderman 2" we have perhaps the finest superhero film ever created. With an emotional Peter Parker questioning his calling, we are faced with a far from perfect hero. Aside from the physical problems Superman might have regarding Lois Lane (see Jason Lee's theory in "Mallrats" 1995), Spiderman is arguably the one superhero to suffer the most. Parker is caught choosing between his "gift" and his love for those around him. As a result of this choice, he chooses what most of us would probably choose, he chooses a life of freedom. As Peter Parker, Tobey Maguire sums up this mood perfectly. At times, Maguire shows genuine affection for this desire to help others, whilst simultaneously he shows a deep rooted passion for Kirsten Dunst's Mary Jane (to be fair, I think ANYONE would show passion for Dunst's beautiful portrayal, whether mentally or physically. Beautiful!).Even Parker's latest two rivals, the magnificent James Franco as Harry Osbourne and Alfred Molina as Doctor Octavius are superb. Franco as Harry demonstrates a boy who's mind is slowly deteriorating as he becomes more and more bitter. In comparison, Molina steals the entire film as "Doc Oc", a genius who is turned to evil by some robotic arms. Whilst the first film featured Willem Dafoe as an extreme Norman Osbourne, this second installment has a badguy we can truly feel for and associate with. Molina's Doctor is a genius with a perfect lifestyle who simply wants to sacrifice as many lives as possible to achieve his goal. This is something many have dreamed of for centuries, and this unusual badguy is no different.Ultimately, as with most films nowadays, it is the special effects that win through. It is impossible in personally opinion to be able to differentiate between the real Spiderman and the CGI Spiderman. Both look and act identically and both are exactly as the fan would imagine. The same is true of Doctor Octopus and his arms. All in all, "Spiderman 2" is the ultimate superhero film. Whilst VERY biased due to being aware of potential story lines, I find it difficult to condemn this film. Whilst the original film felt like a huge disappointment, the Green Goblin being useless for one, this film has reaffirmed my faith in the series. My one worry is that we are shown a potential Harry Osbourne becoming the second Green Goblin, and I fear the third film reviving the hideous Green Goblin costume of the first. Personally I'd convert Doctor Connors into the Lizard or I'd introduce Spawn. Ultimately however, with this film, Sam Raimi has demonstrated a beautiful understanding for the Spiderman series and I'd willingly trust him with any Marvel creation he saw fit. This film is not the best film of all time, but by far and away it is the best Superhero film ever. 10/10. See this film!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Spider-Man 2" was great fun to watch, the most exciting $100 million plus budget movie I've seen this year. A lot of it has to do with casting Tobey Maguire as Spiderman. I know it's a comic book, and none of this would ever happen in real life, but it doesn't matter. I cared about what happened to Spiderman, and was on the edge of my seat during the train sequence (the best part of the film), largely due to Maguire's ability to make you care about a guy in a Spiderman suit. Alfred Molina was an inspired choice as Doc Ock, Maguire and Molina had a lot of intense moments together. It was the most visceral, non-cerebral fun I've had at the movies in the last few months!

		<fullReview>Spiderman 2 avoids a lot of bad marvel characteristics that would've made it a B movie. The original Spiderman was, I think, the best marvel movie of its time, that being said, I'm not a big fan of the marvel franchise. They all have a basic formula, and seem a little too far fetched, in a corny, random way at times. Sure, a mad scientist with 8 limbs who's name is Oswald Octavius is pretty far fetched, but the fact that Peter Parker is torn between being a superhero and just a regular geeky kid in college made the movie actually feels quite believable. Alfred Molina (Doc Ock) does a superb job at not overdoing his part, so he's not only evil, but cool. Definitely a better villain than green goblin in Spidey 1. The special effects in Spidey 1 were great and Spidey 2's effects are even better(no surprises there). Tobey Mcguire is PERFECT for the part, and he's a believable actor, and it's nice to see Kirsten Dunst do a little more than just screaming and looking helpless and pretty like in Spidey 1. Great movie , go see it! 8.8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Genre Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a huge fan of Comic-Book films, I must admit that I get irritated when people berate a film like Spider-man for being unrealistic or unbelievable. If you want something real from a cinematic experience, then maybe you should go andwatch a Lars Von Trier film (that is not meant negatively, I think he's done some great work.) But Spider-man 2, more so than the first film, is of the Comic-Book genre. I believe Spider-man 2 is more like the film Sam Raimi would have made thefirst time around, had he been braver, or received less badgering from thestudio (or whatever it was). A Comic-Book film has to be big and bold, and it has to have little regard for realism. . .because, such as in this case, the story is about a guy who acquires superhuman powers from a genetically modified spider. . . if that is the premise, and you know that before you enter the movie theatre, why on earth are youcomplaining about a lack of realism. I loved this film, in all its outrageous, cheesy, fantastical, big budgeted glory. If you know how to watch a film of this genre, its a joy. We all know about sequels never living up to the expectations of the original film, but Spider-man 2 exceeds them. The story is well structured and carefully conceived, continuing many of thethemes from the first film. The wealth of screen writers that seem to accompany projects such as this have made a well rounded story and script. . .a rareoccasion when too many cooks haven't spoiled the broth.Peter Parker's struggle with his identity is both comical and heart-felt, and Tobey Maguire does a fantastic job. Alfred Molina makes a superb villain, a hard act for James Franco to follow as the next nemesis to Spider-man.The film is consistently stunning from start to finish, thanks to the amazing visual effects, and ace cinematographer Bill Pope (of Matrix fame). And once again, a Comic-Book film isn't a Comic-Book film without the hugeorchestral sound of Danny Elfman. After working on 'Batman', 'Darkman', 'Men in Black' and 'The Hulk'. . . its not surprising that he was picked for this gig too. . .and he does a fine job. Spider-man 2 is a fine effort and in my opinion, it is one of the best genresequels we've seen, along side the fantastic X-men 2.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This post is not supposed to be interesting to everyone, OK? I'm just sharing a detail in the movie I liked a lot.When Peter and Dr. Otto were talking about sleeping before the great day, and Dr. Otto gave examples such as Edison, Marconi and Beethoven, Peter said something like that "Did Bernoulli sleep before finding the curve of fastest descent?"This curve of fastest descent is the brachistochrone, that is, the curve joining two given points along which a particle falling from rest accelerated only by gravity travels in the least time. It can also be seen as what shape should a roller-coaster through two points have in order to get to the bottom in the least time possible.This is the major theme in my Masters thesis, on History of Mathematics, and that is why I find this phrase interesting.It was Johann Bernoulli the first one to solve the brachistochrone, although it was first stated by Galileo Galilei. Bernoulli then challenged the mathematicians of his time to solve the problem, an it is said that when Isaac Newton received the challenge, in spite of being tired after a day of work, he didn't sleep until he found the solution, which is an arc of an inverted cycloid.If you want to know more about this (which I doubt!), just type brachistochrone in yahoo, google,...Crente (that is, "believer" in Portuguese)</fullReview>

I thought there should have been more moments between Peter and Mary Jane who was quite outstanding in the few moments she did have on the movie. I was slightly disappointed that the identity of Spiderman has now been revealed, and wonder how this will impact on the future episodes of this wonderful franchise. Still, I am confident that the team led admirably by Sam Raimi will come through.

True, I am within the target audience of elder teens to 20 something's, and I have grown up adoring Spiderman, but I've also grown up seeing how the film industry can destroy my heroes (batman and robin being the prime example). Spiderman 2 is not just a magnificent 'superhero film', it is also a magnificent film compared with any other.I loved the way the plot unfolded, and the different stages the story went through. It worked as a comedy film, a romantic film, a personal conflict film, and an action film.In fact, on reflection, I reckon Spiderman is only in about 10% of the film, the rest is Peter Parker, and wonderful character development.This film is nothing short of marvelous, great direction, and brilliant build up. It worked perfectly on my emotions. The film, of course, is not perfect. Many part of the Doc Ock plot are a bit too superhero (like the end in xmen 1), especially the whole "power of the sun" bit.Yet this film had me crying. Three times.Twice with emotion, to do with the romantic storyline, the other was crying with laughter at the wonderful and hilarious 'raindrops keep falling on my head' scene.All in all, this film has much more depth, emotion, and character and plot development than most Oscar awarded films, and deserves to stand with them, regardless of genre, or believability.In my brother's words, "the best sequel ever made".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A one line summary? OK then. THE GREATEST SUPERHERO MOVIE I'VE EVER SEEN!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So the long awaited sequel has arrived and it certainly does not fail to be everything I'd hoped for, absolutely fantastic!!!It is superior to the first movie in every respect but one, the soundtrack is not quite as good (but I really didn't expect someone to produce a better song than Chad Kroeger's 'Hero').The story picks up something like two years after the end of the first film. The main story involves Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) struggling to juggle his double life. He wants to use his spidey-powers to help people, but this seems to be interfering with his own life leading to him being fired from his job, slipping behind on his science course, but most importantly having a major affect on his will they-wont they relationship with Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst). This causes Parker to doubt whether or not he thinks being Spiderman is what he really wants.There are also several side stories such as Harry Osbourne's (James Franco) on-going obsession with catching his father's killer and, of course, the villain of the piece, Dr. Otto 'Doc Ock' Octavius (Alfred Molina)!This is where, I believe, the strength of the film lies. Alfred Molina plays Doc Ock flawlessly and, with the help of the writers, gave birth to the greatest comic book villain in a movie ever, in my opinion anyway. Yep, even better than Nicholson's Joker! Doctor Octopus is such a great villain because he's not just a two dimensional character and you don't just feel one emotion for him (hatred, or a desire for him just to be destroyed). *SPOILER* For example, and without wanting to give too much away, his final scenes made me feel so sympathetic towards him and made me think, 'awww how brave'. If done badly, that kind of exit for a villain would've irritated the hell outta me, but not in this movie, no sir! *END SPOILER*Yes it does have a good, emotional (but not as emotional as City Of Angels) plot, but I couldn't get the smile off my face whenever Doc Ock and Spiderman fought. The fight scenes are absolutely remarkable!Rosemary Harris returns as Aunt May to add a bit more conflict in Peter's choices, Donna Murphy plays a good role as Otto Octavius' wife Rosie, and J.K. Simmons is back is the wonderfully hysterical J. Jonah Jameson with the best line of the film:Miss Brant: "Sir, your wife just called. She said she's lost her checkbook." J. Jonah Jameson: "Thanks for the good news."I don't know too much about the comic so I can't really comment on how faithful it's been, but I did notice the dedication to spidey's usual cheesy sayings with the line "Here's your change."God I do waffle don't I? Well let's sum up. Spiderman, I believe, is more about the action than the story, and in this case it's a good thing. The plot is nice enough but nothing too deep. There's enough twists and turns to keep you interested, and every scene seems to succeed in achieving its desired affect. It's just nice and simple so you know what's going on and so you can shift all of your attention onto the top class action. For me it was an instant classic and the best superhero movie I've ever seen!!! 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Loved it!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spider-Man was my favorite comic book growing up and I loved both movies, but the second was better than the first. It seemed to flow better (not having to slow down for character development and jump around between gaps in the story). I liked the way it also introduced characters for future movies or spin-offs. My only complaint, if it's a complaint is, the fight scenes were to fast to even see, not the length just the speed it was shot at. I had trouble keeping up with the blow-by-blow fight scenes. One of the things I did like was that it reminded me a lot of the comic books, showing the sacrifices Peter Parker made to be Spider-Man and the way it set up the next sequel. I can't wait for the DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the best summer 2004 experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everyone has already said something about this movie, it is a complete hit in my country, I am a true fan of comic books but, despite the fact that my true greatest hero is Batman, Spiderman 2 achieved too many goals, great actors, great adaptation of the feel and breath of the comic books, great development of the story line and a very smart use of publicity and commercial influence.There are only 2 aspects of the movie that didn't work for me, hey, you gotta be honest at least with yourself, so I don't like that clock tower action sequence in the moment where a CGI aunt May got so lucky to grab the wall with her umbrella, there could have been a best way to resolve that situation.And number 2 that moment when Spidey saves the day and the people from that train railroad helps him, well, that kind of union, everyone knows his identity and anyone turn out evil and do something nasty like going with Jameson and reveal it to the world or at least take a shot with his or her camera, I mean, someone gotta has a camera in Manhattan this days, a tourist for example. I don't know, I realize that the message it's a good one, especially for the American people, but I think is too corny for my taste, anyway, it's my opinion and all this didn't do enough to stop for make me laugh, smile and bring an abanic of great emotions while I watch one of the greatest comic book based movie ever made (there is still that great place for another more dark film in my hearth, of course, Batman)</fullReview>

One: the script was good, but, in a way, it was a bit emotional, thus you get to hear kids saying they want to go home ( not good )Two: the villain had a much more attractive evilness than Green Goblin. They gave him so much more to work with.

		<shortDescription>Brings the comics and cartoons to life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a big fan of Spiderman and loved the cartoons as a kid. When the first was made, everyone was worried whether it would butcher the original story. Luckily the first was a success, and good viewing. But after viewing number two, in my opinion, this was a far better film than the original. The action was spot on and kept me hooked. The script was good, and a little surprising toward the end. I thought every actor performed well throughout, and i personally preferred Molina's (i hope i spelt his name right!) acting as a villain, compared to Defoe's in the first. (Defoe did sometimes appear to power ranger enemy like from time to time). I would say for all the films that have been based on Marvel and DC Comics, Spiderman two for me has now come into the few films that were brilliant (others i liked were Batman 1 and 2, Blade, and Superman). Getting Stan Lee involved is another bonus to keep the original Spiderman legacy alive, and Spiderman 2 was an excellent watch.Would recommend this to any true Spiderman fan, and a definite DVD in my collection. A great sequel, and well deserved in the top 250 list.9/10</fullReview>

I have seen each and every one of these actors do better. Alfred Molina and J.K. Simmons seemed to be the only ones taking this one seriously. Not that it was BAD or anything, just nothing spectacular.SCREENWRITING - 8/10 A nice mixture of dark and campy; all the elements I was looking for were delivered. Some of the dialogue, however, was pretty shaky.DIRECTION - 10/10 This looks more like a Sam Raimi movie than the first one did. Sam Raimi rules!VISUALS - 10/10 EXCELLENT CGI! From Spider-man swinging around the city to Doc Ock's mechanical arms, this one delivers the visual goods. Not to mention some nice costumes and beautiful cinematography.MUSIC - 10/10 Danny Elfman. 'Nuff said... Oh, wait. The song "Ordinary" by Train is AWESOME!OVERALL What I like about the Spider-man movies is that even though they're campy, they manage to be like Tragos (or for those not familiar with the theatrical term, Greek tragedies). All the elements are there. It's comedic at times, no doubt, but in the end, it's about a man whose destiny keeps him from the life he wants. Even though the ending somewhat drowns out this feeling, it's there, and knowing Sam Raimi, it will probably still be there in the next movie. Spider-man 2 lived up to its hype. Excellent work, Mr. Raimi.THE SMITTY APPROVES. (9/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>more than eye candy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two years ago, when I saw "Spiderman," I figured it would be an action movie--some good summertime eye candy. Boy, was I wrong! It was an intelligent love story which happened to involve a superhero. And at a time when most sequels are made to try gouge Americans at the box office, "Spiderman 2" is a rare exception.The story continues two years after Harry Osborne (James Franco) buried his father. Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) is a Broadway star, Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) delivers pizzas while studying as an undergrad at (I assume) Columbia, and Harry is running OsCorp. Harry is obsessed with avenging his father's death, which he still blames on Spiderman, and takes it out on Peter. Meanwhile, Jonah Jameson's (JK Simmons) is still ripping off his freelancers while he prepares for his son's wedding... to MJ.So Dr. Octavious (Alfred Molina), Peter's hero and the subject of his term paper, finds a way to harness the power of the sun using the four-clawed back attachment. Of course, the prototype is a complete disaster, and instead of controlling the prototype, it controls Dr. Octavious (now Doc Ock).Much of the action is formulaic, but the storyline (especially the love story) and the effects make up for it. It also helped that the entire cast of the original is back, including Rosemary Harris (as Aunt May), Cliff Robertson (as Uncle Ben), and Willem Dafoe (as Norman Osborne).There's a great foreshadow into "Spiderman 3," which will probably come out in the summer of 2006.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The movie Alfred Molina will be remembered for</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie for the first time on Saturday. I think it's safe to say that it was better than the first, and I was afraid it would be just another crappy sequel. But my family and I definitely got our money's worth. The special effects and the suspense and all that were beyond excellent, but my favorite parts were the elevator scene (of course!) and any scenes with Alfred Molina, who played Dr. Octavius Otto, a.k.a. "Doctor Octopus" or "Doc Ock". It's such a shame that such a wonderful actor doesn't get much recognition, even though he's already an A-list actor! But Molina made the role his own, and he will be remembered for this (and hopefully, his career will flourish even more!). The other actors (Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, James Franco, etc.) pulled off some exceptional performances too, including Dunst, whom I've always respected as an actress. Too bad action films hardly ever get nominated for Oscars- I could see this film getting several Oscar nods. Bottom line? The whole movie was good, but Molina was great. 10/10</fullReview>

This is the movie I've been waiting for since I was 10 and first heard rumors of a Spider Man movie. I'm 24 now, and I must say, if I were to make a Spider Man movie, THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT I WOULD DO!! And I didn't even like the first one! My hat's off to you Raimi, Tobey, Dunst...everyone! I regret ever doubting you. I think the only reason Spider Man 1 sucked so bad is bc the studio didn't have trust to let Raimi take the movie and run with it, and the movie had the burden of having gone through so many hands before Raimi got on board. This movie was his baby, and it shows. YAY FOR SPIDEY! LONG LIVE THE WEBHEAD!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spider Man 2 is one of the hottest movies of 2004 to go see. I personally went to go see it, and I can tell you its a great movie. If you have watched part 1 and liked it, you will love part 2. One of the things I love about part 2 is that the cast are the same people except for the new character doc ock. The movie is so entertaining. It's action, funny, sad, romantic, and it has awesome special effects, you feel like your actually in the movie. the movie is basically about peter parker making choices in life, and there's a lot of juicy plot to it. I'm not going to give much details on the movie because I want everyone to watch it. I recommend it for all ages. hope this helps!! thank you!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Doc Ock Lives! OK his character's motivation isn't the most convincing I've seen for a super-villain, but this is forgotten once you see him scaling the side of a building or dismantling a car for batting practice. Sequels are usually problematic, but I'd say this one at least equals the enjoyment of the first movie. The villain is more visually impressive and the character arcs progress realistically. Kirsten Dunst still isn't quite my idea of MJ, but that's just me being picky. She's a very talented actress. Tobey Maguire brings the right level of awkwardness to Peter Parker and J Jonah Jameson is rightfully given more scenes in which to expand as a character.Fans of the comic book Spidey must surely enjoy the direction these films' story lines are taking, as they pretty much summarise the comic's story arc over the last twenty years. Even though this is the case, there was still enough to surprise me. Like Bryan Singer's "X-Men", potential future characters are introduced slyly and without fanfare, giving them time to breathe. The film doesn't make the mistake of the last two Batman movies, cluttering the screen with supervillain characters whom we barely get to understand before the film is done."Spider-man 2" (and it's still a shame that they gave the movie this unoriginal moniker - "The Amazing Spider-Man" would have been so much better) introduces three potential supervillain characters from the comics who may or may not darken Spidey's door in the near future. I can't wait to see whom Sam Raimi chooses to showcase next. Will it be the obvious or the least obvious? Or both? I think there is room now for two villains, even if one is just a cameo.The only criticism I have of the film is that some of the plot is a little lazy - another burning building, another person hearing voices, and a big plot strand lifted from "Superman II"! But the set pieces are outstanding. I felt a tear in my eye at the sheer exhilaration of watching Spidey swing through the Big Apple's skyscrapers. It took my breathe away. Roll on the third movie. "Web of Spider-Man" anyone?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Big Improvement</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's no secret that I absolutely hated the first film. But Spiderman 2 has truckloads more excitement, pathos and humor. Almost every area where the first film lagged in improved upon.Though I'm still not keen on Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker (not tall enough, too much of a geek) he was better in the role this time around. Though I'm not sure why he's still a total nerd. This is not how Peter Parker is portrayed in the comic books and it's weird that in the movie he comes across more like Clark Kent. The CGI effects are miles better too. Some shots still looked a little iffy, but rest was so seamless I never noticed. Granted, it would be hard to get any worse than effects in the original but I was genuinely surprised at how good they were. A lot more time and care as been put into arranging them than before.Alfred Molina as Doc Ock was a hundred what Willem Dafoe's campy, power-ranger Green Goblin was. You could tell that underneath he really was a good guy who was just too carried away with his work. He really did have a menacing presence in any scene featuring him with his extra arms (surely more resembling a spider Peter Parker). The earthquakes signaling his approach are very cool. The sequel has a more structured feel to it and has more inventive set-pieces. The first one felt like an empty showcase for effects but here they were integral to the story.I'm not keen on Kirsten Dunst though (she looks far too much like my ex). In the comics she is an outrageously proportioned and glamorous woman. I just don't see that in Kirsten Dunst. However, she really did get into the character and I believed in her relationship with Peter this time as before it felt like rejected sub-Dawson's Creek trash.Spiderman 2 is also made in widescreen, which is cool as I was disappointed at Sam Raimi's inexplicably shooting the original 'flat'. A movie of this scale deserves scope and size and this time we get what we should have got before.Considering how the movie has already earned $40 kabillion in 3 weeks you hardly need me to tell you to go out and see it. But for once the box office receipts are validated by a good movie.Look out for some funny in-jokes to Evil Dead and Bruce Campbell in a funny cameo as an obnoxious theatre usher.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Basically my family had to take me to this movie kicking and screaming because I just don't like spiders. I don't like anything about them. I know we're all suppose to like how they eat all the flies and bugs of the world, but to me that doesn't make them any more attractive. "Look Timmy! There's a spider near your bed sucking the life out of that fly. I wonder what he'll do when he gets hungry in the middle of the night? Now get to sleep." So a movie about a Spiderman sounded like it would be the grossest thing of all. And the thought of him sucking on that cute Kristen Dunst was a horror too awful to imagine. But, I went anyway, and I'm glad I did! It turns out that Spiderman is...oh wait. I'm supposed to say there is a spoiler here. So, Spiderman is not really a spider at all. That's just some kind of movie hype. He's really a man who dresses up in a spider suit. Except it's really not a spider suit because it's not all fuzzy and it doesn't have suit fangs. There's no drinking of blood or sucking, in fact, the movie doesn't suck one bit! Oh boy! That's my review; it doesn't suck. Oh, and how about this... this movie's going to be around for a while, it's got eight legs! Oooooo-Ahhhh!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superior sequel (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original film with the web-spinning superhero was a good effort, but far from perfect. It had certain weaknesses in performance and storyline. However, the characters and the essential humanity of Peter Parker/Spider Man were strong enough to maintain the film's momentum. The weaknesses have been overcome, and the dramatic power upped considerably, for "Spider-Man 2".The story is now moved on two years, and Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is now balancing two jobs, his college studies and his duty as Spider-Man. Things are not going well: he loses his job as a pizza delivery boy, he is in danger of losing his one true love Mary-Jane (Kirsten Dunst) to a handsome astronaut, and as all this piles on top of him, he starts to lose his powers. This is not good, as New York is set to be menaced by another scientist gone mad, in the form of Dr. Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina), whose attempts to manipulate cold fusion have left him with four tentacles, pinned to his back, that have taken over his mind...Director Sam Raimi has wisely followed the sequel dictum that less is more. Throughout the opening forty minutes, we see less in the way of web-spun superheroics, and this considerably strengthens the story. It also continues the themes about morality, responsibility and power. Being a superhero in "Spider-Man" is not something to be envious of. It is a responsibility and heavy burden that interferes with your life, damages your relationships, and keeps you at a cold distant from those you're trying to protect. Tobey Maguire portrays this vulnerability with touching humour and pathos.As well as the themes, the various story threads from the original movie have been picked up and explored further here. Parker's relationship with Mary-Jane Watson has come under strain since he shunned her affections to protect her from his identity, and the dilemma about whether Parker should accept the loss of his powers in order to settle down with her echoes "Superman II". Kirsten Dunst has limited screen time, but is still very good. James Franco is back as Harry Osborn, who has now taken over his late father's company, and becomes increasingly bitter and obsessed with Spider-Man. Spider-Man killed his father (The Green Goblin, played in a cameo by a returning Willem Dafoe), resulting in a last-minute twist that seals his fate forever. Franco is excellent in a much expanded role.Even better is the chief villain of the piece, Otto Octavius, otherwise known as Doc Ock. It would have been better to let actor Alfred Molina use his natural English accent role for a more sinister effect, but otherwise his performance is spot-on. Early scenes emphasise Octavius's down-to-earth humanity, with a love of poetry and beautiful wife. He is not quite as frightening as the Green Goblin, but he is more well-rounded and more sympathetic. His is less a case of megalomania but more warped noble intentions. Unlike the Green Goblin, who remained a monster to the end, Octavius eventually regains his humanity, and his inevitable death scene is more satisfying as a result.There is still room for humour and action amidst all the weighty seriousness. J.K Simmons is back as newspaper editor J.Jonah Jameson. He was disappointing in the first movie, but is far better here with more screen time and much better dialogue. When told his wife's lost his chequebook, he replies "Thanks for the good news!" Terrific action scenes included Octavius' transformation, the finale in a riverside warehouse, and an exciting sequence where Spider-Man rescues a runaway train.There is plenty room for at least one more sequel, and a "Spider-Man" trilogy would be a fantastic way to round the films off. It would be a shame if this was turned into an ongoing franchise with endless sequels. Yet if further efforts are as good as this one, that might not be a bad thing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie, true to the spirit of the comic books</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a long time fan of the comic books I think this movie gets as close to the spirit of the comic books as is possible in a movie format. Knowing that a sequel will rarely if ever match the originality of the first outing this one takes a novel step. Instead of going for the bigger is better approach (a la Matrix 2 and 3) this movie goes back to the roots of the comic book and delves more into the characters and relationships than the action. As in the original comic book series the characters are not just window dressing to support the superhero action - rather the story is centered firmly on those relationships.Spider-Man was always about Peter Parker and his struggle to maintain two separate lives. I've heard reviewers say this story is very downbeat but anyone who has read the comics will see that as again very true to the comics.Also, a complaint about the movie I've read is that it is more like a soap opera, and again you will find that what made Marvel Comics different from the then dominant DC comics (Superman, Batman etc) was that they focused much more on characters and relationships than just on the super-hero action. The Marvel Comics of the 60s and early 70s very much were like soap operas, and therein lied their popularity.In an interview with Sam Raimi on this topic he says if people feel this movie is like a soap opera, he has succeeded in capturing the spirit of those comics and I agree in this he has succeeded.As with the X-Men movies there is a lot of history to compress into a few 2 hour movies and I think they are doing a good job of compressing Spideys 40 years of history. My one complaint is the Aunt May character. I'm not giving anything away if I say that it is hinted in this movie that Aunt May knows her nephew Peter is Spider-Man, and one of the enduring facts of the Marvel comics was that Aunt May never knows - in fact the comic book version is a much more fragile old lady and it's often suggested in the comics that if she found out it would kill her!Such very minor glitches aside it's a great popcorn movie, with great action scenes. Sam Raimi brings more of his own directorial style to this without going overboard. The hospital scene with Doc Ocks arms going on a rampage is pure Evil Dead 2 (with in-joke nod to the chainsaw scene), and Bruce Campbell again cameo's to great comedic effect, this time as a snooty theatre usher.The fights between Spidey and Doc Ock are truly spectacular and the CGI is far less aparrent I thought than in the first movie, and definitely much less apparrent than in, say, Matrix 2 and 3. I think there is plenty to enjoy in this movie, whether you are a long time Spider-Man fan like me, or entirely new to the web-slinger. More, more, more please!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spider-Man 2 improves on the original in many ways. Perhaps something is lacking, but, again, you'll be hooked.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rating: **** (out of *****)It appeared almost inevitable that Spider-Man 2 would go down as the ultimate summer blockbuster. The trailers made it seem so, as did the majority of reviews from America, some of which have labelled it the greatest superhero/comic book film ever made. Does Spider-Man 2 really live up to the hype?Well, in my eyes the answer is both yes and no. It lacks the constant energy of a Pirates of the Caribbean and the novelty of the first Spider-Man film. Yet that doesn't take anything away from the fact that it improves on the original in many ways.Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is struggling desperately whilst leading his double life as a college student and Spider-Man. His best friend, Harry Osborn (James Franco) still holds it against the web-slinger for the death of his father, and he can never tell Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) how he really feels about her, knowing the consequences it would bring.It's about to get worse. Not only does Mary Jane get engaged (knowing that she can't keep waiting for him) but a new villain emerges. An experiment carried out by scientist Dr. Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina) goes horribly wrong, leaving him with four additional mechanical arms with minds of their own. As Dr. Octopus (or Doc Ock), who can tell how seriously he will affect both the city and Peter ? who, not long after "giving up" and deciding to lead a normal life, must suddenly don the suit again? There are obvious parallels to be found here with previous superhero sequels, such as Superman II and Batman Returns. (Think of Peter abandoning his alter-ego, for example.) More apparent rehashes are likely to be spotted in the opening credits sequence, and certain scenes that seem like leftovers from the original's cutting room floor. But they differ significantly enough from their original source to stand on their own very well.Spider-Man 2 is a deeper film than its predecessor, with more entertaining action sequences and a more mature cast. The star of the show, Tobey Maguire, is as solid as ever, although in parts you feel the rest of the cast is catching up with him. Like Kirsten Dunst and James Franco, for example, who have both grown into their roles ? if Dunst is slightly less camera-friendly, this works to her advantage, as it makes her more believable. J.K. Simmons is back as J. Jonah Jameson, and this time he's even funnier. Even Rosemary Harris's Aunt May has a greater impact on the story. But the real standout is Alfred Molina, whose Doc Ock is very nearly on par with David Carradine's Bill as the most three-dimensional and sympathetic (if such a word can be used) screen villain of the past few years. The biggest coup the Spider-franchise has, though, is director Sam Raimi. His intentionally corny approach, coupled with his ability to keep focused on the story ahead of style (let's face it ? the music and special effects are hardly earth-shattering) has made both this film and its predecessor uniquely entertaining. He even throws in some brilliant light-hearted touches, just like he did in the first film (There's a musical montage that is certain to make you chuckle, and at least two notable cameos). Let's hope him ? and the cast ? stay in place for at least one more film.However much I want to agree with the critics and fans who rate Spider-Man 2 as the greatest comic-book film ever made, I can't. Nonetheless this is still a marvel-lous (please excuse the pun) adaptation which also, thanks to a certain "old friend", sets the stage nicely for Spider-Man 3.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mind Blowing and Better Than The First</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think one of the prime requisites in bringing to life a comic book action hero to the big screen is making him as believable as possible. We all want to relate to some part of this hero in our daily lives and when a movie accomplishes that, no matter how far out the situations might be, it succeeds. SPIDERMAN 2 succeeds in this by bringing more dramatic elements and a more carefully written story. Tobey Maguire is excellent as the confused teenager-cum-hero. He doesn't want to lose the love of his life (Mary Jane, played wonderfully by Kirsten Dunst) but at the same time he feels the obligation of fighting for justice, as means of honoring his late uncle Ben Parker (Cliff Robertson). SPIDERMAN 2's core is more about this repressed love than about chasing villains and saving the day. Even this movie's bad guy, Dr.Otto Octavious (played by Alfred Molina) is not as bad as he initially seems, but he eventually unleashes some over the top mayhem for good measure. You might even say this is a more "girly" sequel, but fear not: when the action hits the screen, is badder, wilder and more violent that the first movie. In one particular scene, Sam Raimi finally unleashes his true origins as a horror maestro, with camera angles, noises and film editing that will remind the gore hounds of the EVIL DEAD movies. For those of us that have known Raimi's previous work, the scene will be a joyride!Opinions out there might be diverse: I'm sure some fans would've liked a sequel with 2 hours of non stop action, seeing Spiderman battling foes left and right. SPIDERMAN 2 delivers because it has a GOOD story and you are anxious to know what will the next scene be like. I had a blast watching SPIDERMAN 2 and would put this movie along with other great sequels such as THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, ALIENS and THE GODFATHER 2. Yep, it's THAT good! Can't wait for the DVD to come out! 10* out of 10*</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than the First? By: ABBAS H.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A phenomenal entertainment piece with twists, turns and the occasional hero guessing his purpose. If you like action and a series of heartfelt chuckles than this movie is right for you. Now telling you the plot is a waste of yours and more importantly my time, so lets skip that. The movie offers you two hours of great action and humour. You don't have to be a genius to understand the plot. However if you are a typical " Nobody understands me!" teenager who wants Michael Bay type action - cars and planes blowing up - than go see I, Robot. As usual Toby Maguire, Kirstin Dunst and James Franco deliver more than believable performances that grab your attention and pull you into their characters. There are some flaws but an overall solid film. Spend your ten dollars on this movie and you won't regret it; unless you are an idiot. So sit back, enjoy and decide which one is better. But just in case you lack the proper knowledge let me put your mind - if you have one - at ease. Spiderman2 does in fact edge out the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spider-Man 2 (2004) Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, Alfred Molina, James Franco *********BIG SPOILERS*********After seeing the first film a lot was expected, and Sam Raimi has delivered. The first Spider-Man (2002) was a wonderful roller-coaster ride, a pleasure to watch. So in Spider-Man 2 they have developed from the first film showing the downs of being Spider-Man, the special effects are fantastic, some of the scenes in this film are Amazing such as the Doc Ock, Spidey battle on a train and on top of a clock tower. In this film the main storyline is Peter Parker is sick of being spiderman and missing out on relationships and a normal life so he quits being spiderman although Parkers Idol (in science) Dr Otto Octavius has a lab accident killing his wife Rosie. And to top it all off he has four extra mechanical arms. He is angry and wants to kill Spiderman and rebuild his experiment. But soon enough Parker becomes Spiderman again. Maguire in this film is fantastic he plays the depressed Peter Parker with brilliance. Dunst-Good,Molina-Good, But in my opinion the best actor in S M 2 is James Franco he does a superb job of playing Harry Osbourn. The only bad note i would give Spider-Man 2 is they have rushed into things with Mary Jane and Harry finding out Peter's Real identity. Overall EVERYONE should go see Spider-Man 2 is is FANTASTIC must see9.5 out 10 Joe Szwed</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just a short line........ This is the first summer movie in a LONG time that did not leave me exhausted from all of the CGI thrown at me...In fact, I wanted more than there was....But...The fight scenes were truly great...I couldn't keep up! Raimi does a masterful job of not bludgeoning us to death with effects, delves into the characters wonderfully and gives us a DIFFERENT movie than the first! That alone makes the difference! And Kirsten Dunst, on a side note, isn't the most attractive MJ they could have come up with, but she just somehow fits into her role. The ONLY drawback, is that some of the time, the dialog seems.......ehhh...sophomoric (?)....Like the writers were blocked on how to explain the meaning of life and the pursuit of happiness. Seemed to be a little banal for my tastes. I just thought that Mike Clark of USA Today would have knocked off a 1/2 star for that contrived dialogue. Great Movie, I will see it again. I pride myself in knowing what pure escapism is, and what isn't a "Cookie Cutter" of a Movie jammed in our faces just to meet the "4 month deadline" that studios think is a great idea for making money. They (studios)need to wake the hell up! Less is more, and Quality before quantity.Shrek 2 and this are the only ones that have brought about feelings of seeing it again.....Go see it....... 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Marvel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a masterpiece. It has a broad reach, genuine complexity in the emotional lives of the characters and a compelling storyline. I used to read Marvel comics all the time when I was a kid and this film captures those more fully than anything else in this genre. Peter Parker's anguish, star-crossed lovers, megalomaniacs running amok..it is like Hamlet, Romeo and Juliet and Julius Caesar rolled into an action movie.Speaking of action, some of the sequences in this film are jaw dropping. The elevated subway ride is the best use of a subway in a movie since The Matrix and is just breathtaking. At the same time the movie is very well paced, razzle dazzle action sequences are mixed up with quiet moments of tenderness. The original Spiderman movie was fine but not in this league. ( Hey, wish the matrix sequels had followed same trajectory!). I also really enjoyed the humor scattered through the movie. For everyone who loves this comic genre, I'd say this is the movie where they got it right. For people who don't, you will enjoy it anyway.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has to be the best comic book movie for at least the last 20 years, if not longer.Okay, its not perfect but as a comic book fan and a movie goer I have to say I loved it.Taking the lessons learned from the first one and the X-men films they've put together an irresistible film. The story holds the action scenes together and the moments of comedy stop the film from becoming too sappy and sweet. Plus its got Stan Lee in it, even if only for two seconds!The in jokes and the "ooh thats so-an-so's" hold the attention of the fans of the comic and stop you from thinking about time lines and continuity and why no mention has been made of Gwen Stacy or Felicia Hardy or a million other characters.All in all well worth watching. I guess we're fortunate in the UK that the hype is coming now after the film's premiered rather than building up over time.I'm definitely going to get the DVD when it comes out, and may even go and see it again. Something I've never done before...!</fullReview>

The acting is good from everyone but Molina steals the show. The effects are incredible,story entertaining and funny,and Kirsten Dunst is as stunning as ever.

		<fullReview>Take away all the high tech wizardry and special effects and what you have here is average Joe Spider-man - another young guy with, apparently, a lot of life's advantages who just can't make a commitment to a gal he loves and who craves him body and soul. I hope Tobey McGuire isn't like this in real life.Yep, that's Peter Parker (d/b/a Spider-Man) in a nutshell. Mary Jane Watson, aspiring thespian, played by Kirsten Dunst, most fetching and accomplished actress, loves Peter and he threatens to commit but predictably pulls back, breaking her heart. Any surprise that she's gets engaged to an Air Force astronaut as a consolation prize?Lots of action here but also a bit too long. Fifteen minutes could have been shaved off easily. And should have been. Also a wee bit too loud. Theater sonics were great but it got deadening at times with the uneding rolls of major chords.But...with all the computer-created effects and the ability to create any part of the world or a new one, can anyone explain how an inauthentic New York transit elevated train marked with Bay Ridge (in Brooklyn) as its destination winds up on a terrorizing sojourn on Chicago's Dan Ryan line? Very upsetting.Clearly a box office winner for all the principals involved.Nuff said.8/10.</fullReview>

But anyways, this movie was awesome! Tobey Maguire did a great job and was totally hot!! He needs to take his shirt off more per movie, though. Harry Osborn was GREAT, but he needs to look more like he did in the first movie. Doc Ock was pretty cool, but did they NEED to show the little wires or whatever they were actually being pushed into his skin??It was kinda sad that Aunt Mae got kicked out of her house. Has it really been two years since Peter's uncle died?? But they didnt need to show his uncle grave with the name "BEN PARKER" in huge letters across the screen. Thats my boyfriends name(SERIOUSLY!)and it kinda made me cry to see his name on a grave!!And I KNEW Mary Jane wasnt gonna marry that guy, but what the heck, he was HOT! anyways, this movie rocked and you need to see it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was brilliant and remember I am a girl, and therefore not into comic books at all.From the fantastic opening titles which briefly retold the first movie to help you remember it, in case you hadn't seen it recently, to the better than expected ending.Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst continued their good work from the first movie, and the rest of the returning cast were great, especially the newspaper editor, whose name I can never remember (sorry).The story had a good pace and enough impact moments to keep you going, and the dramatic portions were usually followed by some humor or a good action scene to move the story along, and there is still plenty to tell for a third installment too.I couldn't find any faults with the movie at all - the special effects were fantastic, I know a lot of it was CGI, but it was not obvious CGI, and the music really went with the movie in total.The only question I ever have with superhero movies is - where do their clothes go to? But that's too prosaic to worry about when it's a Marvel type story, so I will just brush that thought to one side.I gave this movie a 10 because in my view it is well worth the price of a movie ticket, in fact I could go see it again and would not begrudge paying twice (but since I have a subscription card I go free anyway!).The 10 vote was not because it is the best movie I have ever seen, it was because it is 100% worth seeing, just bear in mind there are some violent parts that may not be suitable for either young children, or people who are bothered by that kind of thing.Thank God for Spiderman, I watched it back to back with Thunderbirds and if you are reading this review for pity's sake, do NOT see that movie!</fullReview>

Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, Alfred Molina, and all the other actors said every line with exactly what it needed. They said every word as it was supposed to be said, whether soberly or with an as-a-matter-of-fact voice. It was as if every scene had a purpose, as if every smile and gesture meant something tremendous. That with the action sequences done so that I could feel every blow dealt and received, I believe that Spiderman 2 is something that you must see.Overall, I rated it 10 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before viewing this film I had heard the previews stating it was better than the first. Now that I have seen it, I agree. That puts this first sequel in rare company -- The Godfather II, Star Wars: Empire Strikes Back and Aliens come to mind. I was never a Spiderman comic book reader but I used to watch the animated half-hour show every morning before school. Doc Ock was a large villain (well-done by Molina) but I did not remember the mind control of his prosthetic arms as portrayed in this movie. It raises very interesting questions about man-machine neural interfaces. While mind control seems far-fetched, addictive dependency does not. The special effects were great. Peter Parker's internal conflict and time-management failures living the life of your "friendly neighborhood" Spiderman seems to be a natural progression of his whirlwind journey into superherodom. This is a departure from Bruce Willis's character in Unbreakable who has a long awakening period to come to terms with his extraordinary powers. I was a fish on the hook being reeled in with the romantic tension between Mary Jane (Dunst) and Peter (Maguire). Some felt this was too slow for the movie development. I did not. Maguire just comes off as the quintessential Clark Kent -- no way that guy is a superhero! This is why the elevated train scene is so powerful for this movie. The foreshadowing of the third movie seems to be setting up the return of the Green Goblin. I don't think I want to see the GG by himself for the next movie. Other than King Pin, I don't remember any other arch villains of Spiderman. The Spiderman movies are johnnies come lately in the superhero comics to movies. I remember saying, "not another one" when it was announced. I've been won over. It continues to stand tallest in the genre. The X-men are right there as well. Catwoman is next and there is the outlook for a Superman return -- should be interesting. They have hard acts to follow.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's back, and it promised razzle-dazzle galore and a tremendous amount of ass-kicking to go with it. The question, however, lied in if they would be able to equal the first one's uniqueness. They should, they created it, but the Wachowskis failed and they were masters and commanders of their creation. Good to know that, for the first time in years, the sequel beats its own predecessor. The bar was raised very high, the responsibility was huge. But with great responsibility, as the movie still says, comes also great power. And such power comes not from the jaw dropping set-pieces or the superior CGI. It breathes from its script, teaching a Jacksonesque lesson to Hollywood studios that movies can't rely in effects to amaze its audiences. They got to have a huge heart, and bathe everyone who sees it in its glow and its magic. To succeed, you gotta have great actors, and, most of all, great stories. And the way this story rages through the screen is unbelievable, all centered in one man: Peter Parker, a simple guy that, like many people of his age, goes through changes and personal conflict. That and a spider costume. We can be watching a CGI-filled scene with heavy explosions and hyperkinetic action, but we never forget that behind the mask is a human character, who suffers due to the incredible powers he has been given. And boy, does he suffer. Rarely a leading character was so put to the test in a Hollywood blockbuster. And I'm not talking about Doctor Octopus' fightback capabilities (which make him one of the toughest movie villains of recent memory). I'm talking about the way the way Parker, the man, dives to hell and comes back. And this is what really puts "Spider Man 2" among the best of the year: it is a haunting tale of fall and ascension of a simple guy who is trapped in many of life's webs, the story of the person beneath the layer. And such situation has its high point in a sublime sequence, after the showdown in the elevated subway (won't give it away). Of course, all the things that surround it are essential to the glorious sights presented here: it is still a joy to see Spidey flying among the skyscrapers to the powerful choirs of Danny Elfman's score. But after that you can always count on an having an even more powerful dialogue scene which could be taken from a melodrama. The movie's ending, unlike the first one, is such a punch for such an experience that it leaves you craving for the third picture. Superior fare, an unexpected move from Hollywood, that has learned much with the "Rings" trilogy, specially that the audience is getting more and more demanding these days, and the bar is always rising...</fullReview>

Recall that Dr. Oct visits Harry and requests some radioactive fuel. Harry asks Dr. Oct to bring him Spiderman and he'll (Harry) will provide the fuel.He directs Dr. Oct to Peter Parker to help locate Spiderman. Somehow Dr. Oct does track down Peter (how he does so is never explained, but that's another story). Dr. Octs kidnaps M.J. and eventually captures Spiderman and brings him to Harry.Harry is about to kill Spiderman when he pulls the mask off and sees Peter. Peter tells Harry that he must find Dr. Oct and that he has M.J. He says you have to tell me where he is to save M.J. and New York. Next scene, Spiderman is at Dr. Oct's hideout. How did he know where it was?? Harry never told him, and in fact Dr. Oct had never told Harry. I wouldn't complain except that Peter specifically asked Harry where the lair was. This is just one example of the poor script.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Uncle Sam (Raimi) needs you... to see this film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm sitting at my computer, trying to think of things to say about this film without sounding as though Sam Raimi and Tobey Maguire were my lovers &amp; this movie was the greatest sexual experience of my life. It's that good. I have read all the reviews and heard ordinary people wax lyrical about this film, but no one has done it justice. This is almost perfect film making. It is actually a summer blockbuster that has the brains to match its considerable brawn. The story picks up 2 years after the first movie with Peter Parker a.k.a. Spider-Man (Tobey Maguire) struggling to make ends meet as he juggles life as a student, pizza delivery boy and superhero. Along with this, he still pine's after Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) and is getting increasingly frustrated at not being able to tell his best friend Harry Osborn (James Franco) that his father was the Green Goblin and wasn't murdered by Spider-Man. Harry Osborn is now the head of Oscorp scientific research department, previously ran by his father, where he is funding the genius Dr Otto Octavius' work on creating a new form of energy that sustains itself therefore creating cheaper safer electricity for the world. Things go wrong for Dr Octavius when he demonstrates the creation of this new energy using 4 metal tentacles that are attached to his torso that he controls with his mind. He loses control of these in an accident, that also kills his wife &amp; they proceed to take over his mind and his body. After this all hell breaks loose as Doc Oc, as he is now known as courtesy of J.Jonah Jameson (J.K.Simmons) the editor of the Daily Bugle, goes on a rampage of robbery and destruction. OK, so its hardly Shakespeare. But you don't expect or even want the Bard when you are watching a summer blockbuster about a superhero. But when you've got a director with the talent and balls of Sam Raimi you know it will be more than your usual no-brainer, CG heavy, popcorn toss-fest (Van Helsing anyone?). This man just gets better &amp; better. Here is a man who has managed to keep his cult status and low budget sensibilities, yet produce a dazzling, eye-popping visceral thrill ride that not only leaves you breathless, but makes you care for its main characters. He has also been able to incorporate some of his trade mark visual quirks to please his Evil Dead fan-boy fan base. When Doc Oc's tentacles go on a rampage in an operating theater, you have a tentacle cam flying towards a chainsaw wielding surgeon. You half expected Bruce Campbell to be the surgeon (he pops up later on in his usual Sam Raimi cameo). You also see Raimi's love of slapstick shine through in a memorable pizza delivery sequence. But for all the impressive visuals &amp; stunning action set-pieces, the elevated train smack down between Spidey &amp; Doc Oc is worth the entrance fee, it's the smaller moments that make this film. The moments when you see Peter Parker at his most vulnerable, torn between what he wants and his responsibility that comes with his great power. Seeing his anguish at his inability to help his Aunt May keep up mortgage payments on her house as well has not being able to tell her that he was indirectly responsible for his uncle being murdered. When you see Mary Jane waiting in vain for Peter's love and commitment or seeing Harry Osborn obsessing over Spider-Man, seething at the thought of his best friend protecting the man he thinks murdered his father. Even Doc Oc's struggle with his own sanity and the blurring of right and wrong in his ever maddening mind. The entire cast give there characters real depth and believability that is a credit to them and again Sam Raimi for trying to emphasize the need for strong believable characters as well as stomach churning, edge of your seat action sequences. Again Tobey Maguire fits easily in to the Spidey suit (although it does ride up in the crotch sometimes) and gives a superb performance as our torn hero. James Franco is excellent as the brooding Harry Osborn &amp; Kirsten Dunst is, well, Mary Jane. Alfred Molina is clearly having a whale of a time as Doc Oc, showing he more than just a cartoon style villain like the Willem Defoe's Green Goblin. He actually creates a villain that you can feel for. And lets not forget the wonderful J.K.Simmons. He provides the comic relief with gusto relish. Chewing up and spitting out scenery and cigars in equal measure. If I had to pick a fault, it would be the limited screen time of J.K.Simmons, who is one of the most watchable character actors around at the minute. But that is just a minor gripe. Spider-Man 2 is a triumph from start to finish. A rare breed of film that actually surpasses it's predecessor in every way. Not many films can say that, X2, The Empire Strikes Back and The Godfather 2 being the only ones that really spring to my mind. Sam Raimi has truly raised the standard that all films, not just summer blockbusters, have to try to match. It's not just the greatest comic book Superhero film ever made, its one of the best films of the last 20 years, ranking along side The Lord of the Rings trilogy for sheer cinematic pleasure. Mr Raimi you are a genius. I'm just disappointed that I have to wait 3 years for the third installment of this marvelous roller-coaster ride.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outstanding, All Spider-man fans need apply.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For all the fans of the Spider-man comics, all the comics including the Ultimate Spider-man series, this movie is a pleasure to watch. Rami stays true to the spirit of the comic books by including many of the elements that made the series great. Notice I use the word spirit. It certainly is different in its presentation, chronology, and character introductions.For those who didn't like the movie... well to each his or her own of course. However, I can't help but think that if those of you who take objection to film were more familiar with the comics you may have found some credence to the course of events including the coming of age of Peter Parker and his love affair with MJ.In my view the Cheez factor was needed and well done. The dialogue was short and trite, but such is life during these moments. No time to wax poetic, as is literally shown in the film.I think MJ's (Dunst) role was particularly well done. Angst and all, she succeeds and we will see the result in the next iteration.Now... I've no idea what is to come, but if they introduce Gwen Stacey, we may have a clue as to MJ's fate ala Amazing Spider-man #121-122. That would certainly be a shocking twist to the movie rendition and would make even the harshest critics choke on their popcorn with surprise.9/10, in my book. Well worth the time and money more than once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the biggest anti climax since the phantom menace</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>****spoilers ahead******I am furious, never has a movie disapointed me so much since the 'power rangers movie' otherwise known as 'the phantom menace'. Lets make this clear, spiderman 2 is not a bad movie, it is a good movie...but...we are not looking for good here, we are looking for superb. The first spiderman was well scripted, acted, shot, edited, scored and left the audience with a feel good factor that lasted days no matter how many times before you had seen it before. In a word it was superb.Now spiderman 2 is good, the action sequences are cool and the train fight is some of the best effects ever seen...but...the acting is at times awful (toby seems to have given up trying and also seems to be aging VERY badly, Dunst looked bored throughout, Franco was okay but was given little to do except look angry and the only one holding the lot together was Molina and he even seemed to be struggling with the dialouge). The story was boring and the message so expertly crafted in the first movie was simply repeated (over and over) in this one till it go boring. This movie does not have an ending, it has three, all too long and badly paced and DeFoe pops up for a cameo in which he has none of the fire he had in the first. Spiderman reveals himself alot in the movie!!! In comic book film the hero being unmasked is a big thing, it happens four times in this one, i mean come on Raimi!This film is supposed to be the middle of three so obviously the story needs to be left open for the third...but...a little sub plot that concludes in this one would have been nice, a least a good one. I only hope they do better in third or the magic of the first film will forever be tainted by the other two. Please replace Maguire, he clearly has no dedication to the prioject(s).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's back, and it promised razzle-dazzle galore and a tremendous amount of ass-kicking to go with it. The question, however, lied in if they would be able to equal the first one's uniqueness. They should, they created it, but the Wachowskis failed and they were masters and commanders of their creation. Good to know that, for the first time in years, the sequel beats its own predecessor. The bar was raised very high, the responsibility was huge. But with great responsibility, as the movie still says, comes also great power. And such power comes not from the jaw dropping set-pieces or the superior CGI. It breathes from its script, teaching a Jacksonesque lesson to Hollywood studios that movies can't rely in effects to amaze its audiences. They got to have a huge heart, and bathe everyone who sees it in its glow and its magic. To succeed, you gotta have great actors, and, most of all, great stories. And the way this story rages through the screen is unbelievable, all centered in one man: Peter Parker, a simple guy that, like many people of his age, goes through changes and personal conflict. That and a spider costume. We can be watching a CGI-filled scene with heavy explosions and hyperkinetic action, but we never forget that behind the mask is a human character, who suffers due to the incredible powers he has been given. And boy, does he suffer. Rarely a leading character was so put to the test in a Hollywood blockbuster. And I'm not talking about Doctor Octopus' fightback capabilities (which make him one of the toughest movie villains of recent memory). I'm talking about the way the way Parker, the man, dives to hell and comes back. And this is what really puts "Spider Man 2" among the best of the year: it is a haunting tale of fall and ascension of a simple guy who is trapped in many of life's webs, the story of the person beneath the layer. And such situation has its high point in a sublime sequence, after the showdown in the elevated subway (won't give it away). Of course, all the things that surround it are essential to the glorious sights presented here: it is still a joy to see Spidey flying among the skyscrapers to the powerful choirs of Danny Elfman's score. But after that you can always count on an having an even more powerful dialogue scene which could be taken from a melodrama. The movie's ending, unlike the first one, is such a punch for such an experience that it leaves you craving for the third picture. Superior fare, an unexpected move from Hollywood, that has learned much with the "Rings" trilogy, specially that the audience is getting more and more demanding these days, and the bar is always rising...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What some people have labeled "character development" is nothing more than generic, unoriginal, and run of the mill scriptwriting. The story was boring and predictable, but what bothered me the most what a glaring hole in the plot. I just cannot get it out of my mind, and if anyone can explain it to me, please do so. Recall that Dr. Oct visits Harry and requests some radioactive fuel. Harry asks Dr. Oct to bring him Spiderman and he'll (Harry) will provide the fuel.He directs Dr. Oct to Peter Parker to help locate Spiderman. Somehow Dr. Oct does track down Peter (how he does so is never explained, but that's another story). Dr. Octs kidnaps M.J. and eventually captures Spiderman and brings him to Harry.Harry is about to kill Spiderman when he pulls the mask off and sees Peter. Peter tells Harry that he must find Dr. Oct and that he has M.J. He says you have to tell me where he is to save M.J. and New York. Next scene, Spiderman is at Dr. Oct's hideout. How did he know where it was?? Harry never told him, and in fact Dr. Oct had never told Harry. I wouldn't complain except that Peter specifically asked Harry where the lair was. This is just one example of the poor script.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Top Notch Comic Book Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can see it now the action fanatics are going to come out of the wood work complaining about this movie. That's the main reason I liked it though. There was more emphasis on plot and character development than the first one.People where complaining about Tobey Maguire's ability to play Spider-man. I how ever have to give him the nod. He is just like Peter Parker, a big dork. That's what attracts people to the Spider-man character, his human qualities. Qualities that are lacking in other super hero movies. It's kind of hard for me to relate to Batman, because Bruce Wayne is a rich business man with tons of money. I can't relate to that. I don't have tons of money!I can relate to Peter Parker's struggles though. Trying to get through college. Trying to hold down a stable job. Trying to acquire enough money to not get evicted. Trying to get the girl. These are all things I have struggled with or are currently struggling with in my life. So you can really connect with the character of Peter Parker.This movie was great with just a few flaws in my opinion. I pray that Sam Raimi and the rest of the cast stay together. Other wise I fear this movie may go the way of the Batman franchise. (Which will hopefully be redeemed.)Overall: 8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why Spiderman 2 is the best superhero sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1) Sam Raimi used the first movie to set up characters and relationships whilst still maintaining a good plot. 2) This meant that the sequel could focus more on Spiderman, no? 3) Wrong, the reason Spiderman 2 is so great is because it's not about Spiderman at all. In my interpretation of the movie the whole Spiderman/Doc Ock sequences are all Sub-plot. The main plot of the movie can be found in Peter Parker having to face his problems, including money, guilt and MJ.Unlike other superhero movie franchises Spiderman has created a mythology in it's big screen format. Can any Batman or Superman movie say that it's contained several potential villains for future movies?The interesting thing in film 3 will be how the Parker/Spiderman/MJ relationship develops. I would hope that it is dealt with in a way that doesn't distract from the film as a whole as in Spiderman 2.I believe that somewhere on the Spiderman DVD someone comments on the fact that you don't really notice Elfman's score or Raimi's direction yet you acknowledge that the movie would be poorer without them.The same applies here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay first of all everyone on the planet had high expectations for Spider Man 2 because the first movie was a spectacle of special effects. The special effects in this movie come nowhere close to disappointment and could put the first movie to shame. The characters in this movie are lively and special in their own way. Of course the hero is peter parker/Spider Man(Tobey Maguire). He is a college student struggling through life as a super hero with way to many personal problems. Then there is the villain is Otto Octavius/Doc Ock(Alfred Molina) who is trying to give the world free energy but on accident welds 4 mechanical arms on his back. Also, every movie has the beauty or Mary Jane Watson(Kirsten Dunst). She is having doubts and reluctancy on whether Peter may always be their for her. Finally, their is that extra character or in this case Harry Osborn(James Franco) who's father had been slaughtered by his own hand and thinks that Spider Mn had killed him. With all these characters and a lively plot Spider Man 2 can only be a recipe for success I give it a 12 out of 10, and I'm not joking</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Super Hero Movie of all time!!!!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, let's look at the realistic viewpoints of a surrealistic character. Marvel comics and Stan Lee have always done a superb job in bringing super heroes close to home. a) They live in real cities, not Metropolis or Gotham City .. and b) They always work with real world issues. What I loved about Spiderman as a kid was that he was the geek who got lucky/cursed. He spends his whole life wrestling with getting and keeping a girlfriend or a job and he's not always happy being who he is. He wrestles with telling family and friends about his alter ego and like anyone in the real world would do, it's impossible to keep that kind of secret, so it gets out. Once you tell someone, it gets easier to tell more people.Director Sam Raimi (also a childhood Spidey fan) remembered all the things he loved about the character in the comic and truly brought it to the screen. The special effects in this film were much better than the first, yet all of that played second hand to how well the characters kept me on the edge of my seat. It's how CG is supposed to be done. Not for the sake of saying "Wow, that's a cool effect", but to keep the story going.Spiderman has always been the closest thing to seeing a human side of super heroes as it gets and this movie won't let you down.

		<shortDescription>A true gem -- the year's best and my new favorite superhero movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spiderman 2 - My rating: 9/10This movie truly had it all and was very entertaining, and I don't usually enjoy overblown Hollywood productions like Spiderman 2.WHAT WAS GREAT ABOUT THIS MOVIE: 1.) Awesome action - The special effects were incredible. This movie perfectly brings comic book fantasy to life. 2.) Plenty of laughs - This movie could be light-hearted at time, and I found myself laughing out loud on a number of occasions (I should note I was one of the few brave enough to laugh out loud at the corny humor).3.) Characters we care about - See note below about dialogue... the characters were a little corny too, but the viewer cannot help but become emotionally invested. Very well done.4.) Strong story - While predictable (what action hero movie isn't?), the story had enough twists and suspence to keep me interested. Good pacing too: the movie flows well from scene to scene.IN RESPONSE TO MAJOR COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS MOVIE: 1.) Of course the dialogue and script are trite. Ever read a comic book? (Note: Spiderman is originally a comic book character) This movie never purports itself as intelligent... and...2.) In some respects, the superhero movie has "been done before." This movie takes the action to new levels and brings new levels of emotion to this often bland genre.A FINAL STUPID COMMENT THAT GIVES ME LESS CREDIBILITY: Spiderman 2 or The Passion of the Christ? This movie is peppered with references to Christ and Christianity, at least I thought so... Spiderman is the symbol of self-sacrifice (like Christ) -- see if you can spot what I mean.Ok, awesome movie, and I really mean it. 9/10</fullReview>

I don't think I've ever been as stunned as I was when I came out of the screening this afternoon.Raimi really has been given the kitchen sink and more with this one. You could see in the first film there was a lot more he wanted to say and God, has he said it. This in my opinion ranks higher than his other truly great film A Simple Plan.Viewers will also notice a vast improvement in Tobey Maguire's performance, and I truly believe this is Best Actor contention at next year's Oscars. T he train sequence has to be the best action scene ever to grace the screen. Also, the script has no fat at all and has the usual Raimi humour added in for effect.If you haven't seen this movie, I don't just urge you, I order you to go see this.God I can't wait for Spider-Man 3.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Swings past Shrek 2 as best family summer film of 2004.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two years ago, Sam Raimi got the original Spider-Man mostly right by not boring longstanding fans with the setting up and updating of the hero for the 21st century. Its World Trade Centre trailer also placed it in cinema history for a different reason. This year, the same cast is back in a film which is more a straightforward continuation than a sequel although a character makes reference to time gone by, and Peter Parker's at University instead of school, the director takes care to keep his movie-New York look similar to the original. The villain this time is Doctor Octopus, who gets his own setup and by choosing Alfred Molina, Raimi goes a cut above the usual Brit making the American movie star look good. It also differs from the first film in that we see the scientist as a normal if slightly misguided person, before he goes mad. Once he's mad though, the action gloves come off and CGI Spider-Man's more refined and moves like a human being when 100% digitised, more so than in the first.While the action's top notch, the human drama of Parker's relationships form the other hour of the film and there's a point of no return where it feels like everything's lost, and of course it takes the rest of the flick for them to reach a resolution. Those fractured relationships elevate the film to another almost better-than-the-original superhero sequel, Superman II, and keeps you interested. The ending does everything it needs to including the setup for the next film. It's the only Hollywood film released this year which I want to see twice. In fact I'm going back to do just that, tomorrow. See it. Only AVP2 might be a rival for the older summer audience, as this is a PG, take the whole family to watch it, don't wait for rental.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite a few silly moments in this movie but still a good film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alright, I just saw the movie and being a fan of Spiderman I know what was in the movie that related to the comics and what was just plain old plot line. The best thing about the character of Doctor Octopus, is that much like the character of Normon Osborne, the first twenty-five minutes of the movie are devoted to fleshing out his reasons and motivations. His sole motivation is the fact that he's been driven insane by the cybernetic equipment that he uses for his fusion experiments after his demonstration of fusion containment goes out of control due to exponential magnetic fields that destroy the building containing his lab, home, and his wife who dies when a window frame is pulled out of the building's wall. The glass from the window breaks, and kills her though you don't quite see it from the shot of her on the ground and the later shot of her body being wheeled out on a gurney by paramedics who cover her in a blanket after a brief glimpse that confirms she is indeed dead. The second puzzling moment occurs when Doc Ock has robbed the bank and only gets away with two bags of cash but in the following shots, proceeds to assemble a second, larger fusion containment machine from mail order parts. Only in Hollywood I tell ya. There's also a lot of rather meaningless sideplots that are indirectly related to the overall story of the movie such as the fact that Peter Parker is failing his college courses and is broke because he is preoccupied with Mary Jane and his life as Spiderman. However, it is the sideplot of him failing college that introduces a potential villain for the fourth movie, Dr. Curt Connors AKA The Lizard, who will probably end up as a full CGI character when in Lizard form. The only problem with that is that Dr. Curt Connors (comic-book version) was a biologist and not a physicist as the one in the movie is so the likelihood of him being the fourth supervillain that Spidey faces is rather remote. Spiderman 3 however will once again belong to The Green Goblin as Harry takes over the role his father played. I am guessing the next movie will be more of an action oriented picture with lots of good drama and whatnot. Anyway, the effects were vastly improved over the first thanks to overall progress in the VFX industry. The sound was great too, lots of active surround usage in action sequences but otherwise a fairly stereo oriented movie.</fullReview>

The graphics are about 50% better then then part 1, very seamless. The CGI flows perfectly it is very difficult to see the changes, though at one or two points you can probably guess what is real and what isn't. The story in this sequel was great as well... They knew they had to beat part 1 and they did just that, unlike some other sequels that came out such as the matrix reloaded, this movie actually makes you want to see part 3, which by the way is completely set up in part 2. A perfect introduction into a trilogy and who knows, maybe a huge batman like franchise. I highly recommend this for everyone to see at least once, twice if you get a chance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to see Spider-Man 2 and I was greatly surprised. I'm sure everyone knows that most sequels just aren't up to par with the first installments. I can honestly say that in this case, it not only isn't true but that Spider-Man 2 surpasses the first Spider-Man in quality.Tobey Maguire does an excellent job at portraying a college student who is trying (and failing) to keep a part time job, protect his city, stay in a relationship and keep up his grades. The thing is no one will ever know what it is like to be a super hero, but Maguire makes us somehow relate with Peter and his struggles. The rest of the acting in this movie is high quality as well. Kirsten Dunst is good, and can surprisingly pull off a British accent better than most American actors. A great performance is given by James Franco who does a lot with his minor character.Overall, this movie is able to have amazing action sequences and keep the audience interested with an actual plot. There are some parts that are a tad precious, and some lines could be improved but it manages for the most part to be pulled off. If you're not into action movies or superhero movies, you'll still be happy to see this film. If nothing else, you'll have a good time and won't regret paying 8 or so dollars.</fullReview>

I liked the struggle he faces, trying to decide if his gift which is also his curse, is worth it. He's trying to find himself, trying to find balance in his life. Something everyone can relate too. I enjoyed the action scenes. The love scenes weren't too mushy. I really like movies with good morals and this one made me feel good. There were a couple of times when I had to wipe tears from my eyes. One time was the scene with Aunt May, when she's going to sell the house. She tells Peter that kids need someone to look up to, they need a hero. That's what I like about the Spiderman character, he's selfless. Often he gives up his own desires to help those who cannot help themselves. It was a great movie. I definitely recommend it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>* May contain spoilers *This is a fantastic comic book adaptation! I believe it was Roger Ebert that said something along the lines of "...best comic book movie of all time..." and I honestly cannot dispute such a claim. . ACTION- The action sequences were intense and they were quite well done. From the cafe scene to the gravity-defying fight scenes to the simple detail of the "rumble" signifying the approach of the villain, it is a seriously tight package from end to end. . CAST- With the exception of James Franco (who, as Harry, is noticeably weaker than his cast mates), all players are more than solid. I especially enjoyed Molina's Doc Ock and J. K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson. Who would've thought Vern Schillinger had such a talent for comedy? . STORY- Although you *should* see the first movie first, it is certainly not a prerequisite. There is plenty of story to give you all you need to enjoy. And for a superhero flick, there is much more than a typical amount of stuff to consider from a philosophical standpoint: What would it REALLY be like to be Spiderman; not the 2 hours a day you're wearing the tights, but the other 22 hours? How would you earn a living? How do you deal with everyday situations? How do you get a bank loan? Do you sleep well? Again, this is all surprisingly interesting and quite well done. . SUMMER CHEESE- I've seen too many complaints on this board along the lines of "what a lame line MJ used on Spidey" or "when Spidey was holding up that 50-ton wall, why didn't MJ move quicker." C'mon folks, it's a freaking Spiderman movie! I'd say without hesitation that the Cheese Level was right on the mark. The aforementioned 50-ton wall scene, the front of the train "is that all you got?" scene, the pizza delivery scene, most every scene with JJJ... And I found the scene with Hal Sparks simply hilarious. Citizen Kane it ain't, but I didn't pay to see Citizen Kane.Parents, the PG-13 rating is about right, of course depending on the kid. The action sequences, as mentioned, are VERY intense and some of this will be quite scary for the typical child under 10 (in my personal estimation). No worry about language, nudity, etc.</fullReview>

It's nice to be able to go see an action adventure movie and not have it spoiled by the typical tired and obligatory sex, vulgarity, and graphic violence. It's especially nice having a movie of this type that's a fun action film and knowing I could take a child to see it and not have to worry about them seeing and hearing things that aren't appropriate for them to see. I wouldn't take a kid under 7 or 8 to see it though since they definitely have no concept of reality vs. fiction, depending on the individual child of course. It was a great movie, can't wait to get the DVD and see the next one and the ones after that when they come out!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't know a sequel could be this much better than the original!Raimi's second Spider-Man film is getting a pretty bad rap from all of us wanna-be Eberts, but this film exceeded my expectations. I for one thought it was great! Raimi really went deep into Peter Parker's psyche. The storytelling was outstanding. You also really get to see some of Raimi's film-making ability (A lot more than in the first one). It was entertaining and it was a great story, told well. Go see it, it's worth the 8 bucks.I'd give it a 4 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Thumb-Down Change of Spider-Man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The second run of Spider-Man is definitely disappointing for the ultimate fans-alike. The story line for this particular run is surprisingly slow and unlike its predecessor, a heartfelt attempt in displaying Peter Parker's life on screen. It is only after an hour and a half that the story gets interesting, especially in stressing the human-like problems that Peter Parker faces with studies and love life. The regression part is a drag in terms of the quality of the plot but later backed-up by the graphics displayed on the screen. There are redundants of repetitions everywhere but nowhere can we see the 'With great powers comes with great responsibilities' statement. Additionally, the acting sequences by Toby Maguire is played down by the story line and consequently, affecting the dramatic relationship of Spider-Man and his love interest.Spider-Man 2 needs the extra taste which was shown in Spider-Man 1.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spiderman returns !!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>wow, I loved this movie a part from some little grapes it was great.Spiderman is still the same except with a lot of loss, Aunt May looses her house,Peter and MJ grow apart etc., which all comes back together again. this is exactly what happened to Spidey in the comics, so Raimi has told the story again on the big screen and it works.people who think Tobey looks and acts dorky, well he's supposed to !Peter Parker isn't mature yet, he's still a boy. the action was great when it was on screen and it wasn't overused like some other movies who don't have a good story. the fight scenes between Spidey and Doc.Ock were awesome especially when he kidnapped Aunt May and on the clock tower.**spoilers** on to the small grapes: 1)why did Dr.Octavius drown ? seems to me this was too much like the death of the Green Goblin, I would have really looked forward to seeing a Sinister Six... 2)Spidey isn't telling any jokes/wisecracks when he's fighting Doc Ock, which I was really missing. 3) Why do I get the feeling were going to see the ugly "bodysuit" of the Green Goblin again... I preferred the older comic-look.Doc Ock is not stronger then the Green Goblin (which was shown in the movie, Aunt May ! clobbers him), being insane gives you more of an edge..All in all a great movie, maybe not one of the "best ever", but as far as comic translated movies go It's one of the best !! Spiderman being the best superhero (thanks to his humanity) could give me a more optimistic view of this movie off course...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They made Spidy into a Chick Flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has great action and awesome visual effects, but this was notable to cover some of the plot holes. The whole movie left a chick flickaftertaste. Where the conflict between Spiderman the superhero andPeter Parker the man with human desires gave the first part aninteresting spin and some depth, this personality conflict overshadowedthe action in this sequel. This was exercised to a point where catchingthe bad guy turned secondary. In addition the whole MJ story with marryyou, marry me, marry him, made me feel like watching a Julia Stiles orKate Hudson movie and not a movie about a superhero comic book. The only thing that reminded me of a superhero movie was the bad guywho made the whole thing worth watching, although he did not seem tohave the depth and impact on the movie than the Green Goblin had forthe first part. And maybe he will return in the next incarnation, and turnthe story back into a superhero catching bad guy thing with a little moredepth and screenplay than the Batman movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like many other reviewers, I loved this movie. It has been difficult to get me to sequels but this is one I am glad I have seen.Unlike many of the "we must do a sequel for kids and box office" films from studios of late, this one really has common sense. It shuts up all of those folks in the audience who don't have an imagination or think of entertainment as entertainment..or even a 'suspension of disbelief' theory. This IS Spiderman...human, conflicted, poor as heck but valant...and someone we can all identify with. And not only could we identify with Spiderman/Peter Parker, the "villian", Doctor Octopus was not a formula nut case as we have come to know in all summer blockbusters. He too...was very human.As was the rest of the gang. How refreshing. A great accomplishment for cinema.Excellent film, Good job. I can now say, I'm a fan!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strong Character Empathy (might have one VAGUE spoiler)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved this movie. It is one of about three movies (other includes Star Wars: the Empire Strikes Back) that made me literally feel what the character on-screen was feeling. The scary thing about this is that for more than half the time, that character was male, and I'm female. It was raw emotion, combined with identification/empathy that did this. The score, coupled with beautifully shot and edited visuals, also added to the experience. I most recently saw the movie 5 days ago and I STILL can't get "Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head" out of my head.I found the villain (Doc Ock) to be less shiver-down-the-spine scary and more, well, likable, if that is possible for an evil guy. Actually, I found the Spidey/ Doc Ock conflict to be similar to the final conflict between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader in Return of the Jedi. It had the same themes of redemption and the father ish)/ son(ish) and "you were right" aspect.Overall, I thought the movie fit together pretty much perfectly.My advice to any of you with questions/ doubts about the movie: read the novelization. It contains additional scenes, including one where Dr. Connors mentions his lizard research, and might clarify some points brought up in other user comments.E.g. the reactor had to be built over water because the fusion reaction drew energy from the water tank/river below it. Look closely in the OsCorp lab scene, and you'll see that the reactor's built over a pool of water.</fullReview>

Toby Macguire is the perfect choice for the role, as a pretty superstar would not have been as believable. This movie has just the right amount of action mixed with the right amount of romance and still leaves time to develop the story to show his love for his family and friends and why he does what he does. There is nothing worse than watching a movie that does not develop the plot, but that is not the case in this film.

Light-hearted and upbeat characters helped the story flow along nicely, needless to say it was your better than average pop corn action flick. Now with that being said, Spider-Man 2 is better than any element of the original and then some. The first one focused on "the gift" side of him transformation, and now the world seems like its crashing down on Peter which seems like the second movie focuses on "the curse" side of him powers. The script was a lot better, funnier, but darker at the same time. And of course the action KICKS ASS! Also Doc Ock was a great villain and somewhat hypnotizing just to watch him in action. The final battle between spidey and doc ock on the train will go down in history as one of the best fights between good guy vs. bad guy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great fun; but have they jumped the shark?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a great fun summer blockbuster of a movie, with great visually effects and a nice balance of action and humanity.* * Possible Spoiler Warning * *Tobey Maguire demonstrates a deadpan comic delivery brilliantly, especially at the party scene when he misses all the cocktails. And the newspaper editor is still top fun as well. In this sequel we also have the addition of the landlord's daughter, and even several passer-by kids (especially the ones who comment on Peter flipping over a racing car).But like a lot of people, I am definitely wondering if the storyline has shot itself in the foot, and given away too much too quick. There seem to be a heck of a lot of revelations in this movie, with about 99% of the dramatic tensions set up in the first film all sorted out. Sure, there is an obvious setup for an inevitable sequel, and the energy hasn't lost any steam (and of course there are a whole multitude of villains and other plot devices in the source material). But I am of the feeling that this may have taken away most of the dramatic punch out of the whole series.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, so I'm a Spidey fan...but I'd be the first one to tear the movie to shreds if it disappointed. Thankfully, Spiderman 2 did not disappoint. In extreme contrast, it was one of the greatest, if not, THE greatest, movie adaptation of a comic book character ever! Director SR is totally spot on when he chose to focus on the human aspect of Spidey...the heart of the superhero...the fight scene on NY's subway train and its eventual outcome epitomizes this aspect of the Big Apple's beloved wall-crawling hero. Just as HJ has made Wolverine HIS part, TM has made Peter Parker/Spiderman HIS part...I don't think I could ever picture anyone else to in those glasses or those tights.While Spiderman 2 represented a step forward in character and story development, my grouse is with the repetition of some scenes that looked somewhat like a cloned counterpart from Spiderman 1. Specifically, while I was brought close to tears during the scene where NYers carried Spidey over their heads in the train after his fight with Doc Ock, their expressed protection over him when Doc Ock came for our hero looked almost a carbon copy of the scene in Spiderman 1 when NYers expressed their protection over the hero as Green Goblin tried to kill Spidey over the dangling cable car. Other repetitive scenes include Spidey climbing up the wall as he lost his power (similar to when he first discovered he could climb walls) and Spidey trying to jump over roof tops after he lost his power (similar to when he first discovered he could jump across roof tops). I'm not sure I'd want to see any of these again in Spiderman 3.Still, all in all, Spiderman 2 is one for the movie hall of fame and I give it 10 out of 10 stars for what worked rather than what didn't work. Looking forward to Spiderman 3 where I hope it will not be just the Green Goblin as the villain but maybe the Lizard or the Jackal (as long as it's a NEW villain). Repetitions of any kind would have to be sufficiently justified...otherwise, don't do it...please...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Way better then the first, and even shows superman 1 a thing or two.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off id like to say that I'm a casual comic book fan. Me, having a love for drawing and cool and amazing action scenes in films, comic books have always been a cool source of entertainment. But, unlike my fellow comic book fans, i fall way short of a fanatic. I feel that knowing the basic story and not every single detail about every issue just issent warranted and somewhat pointless. But, i do have to say, i know a good comic book film when i see one, and i saw one in spiderman 2.I wont bore you with the details of the film or its story. chances are, if your planing to see the film, you have an idea of what the story is and the actors and director making it. What i loved about this film is that it had amazing action that actually had a heart and a sense of humor. You cared how spiderman would stop the run away train, you felt bad for peter parker because he was so busy saving new york as spiderman, he just dident have enough time for a normal life. and you understood doc octs motives and how he wanted to change the world for good even though he was doing wrong.now as in my headline, i feel that this is THE comic book film in which all other comic book films should be judged by. Yes, even the first superman is below this and before you comic fans shite ya pants, let me explain.The first superman although a good film, had just to many major flaws for it to be effective to me. Now, i was born in 83, so maby it just how films and comics were viewed in the 70s and all, but i felt that superman was way too unrealistic and piled on the bull shitz on way to high. the whole spinning the world back to travel through time? or how luthor was nothing more then some super con man, or how lois lane was nothing more then a stuck up reporter bitch? Also, the entire krypton bit was way too crappy for me to even stomach. whats the bit with krypton, i thought it was this beautiful planet with a shade of green to everything, and the film makes it out to be this planet without an atmosphere and everything looks, well, covered in thin snow? and the crystal thing, weird.I'm sorry, I'm ranting. But, i felt that spiderman 2 is the best comic book film ever made. its got heart, comedy, *thus putting the comic back in comic book* and just a really good movie. So all you fan boys, put down that old VHS or DVD of superman 1 which you all seem to hold so dear, and spend 12 dollars to go see spiderman 2.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Worked for me. "Spider-Man 2" combines great special effects, action, drama and even character development. I especially like the modest basis for Peter Parker: an average stiff with an above average task. I'm not a big fan of the superhero genre overall as it tends to be predictable and stale. "Spider-Man 2" won't exactly go down as a mystery thriller, but at least the characters have some personality and depth with an interesting enough story to hold it all together. With more action, better effects, added romance and a few surprises for the characters, "Spider-Man 2" surpasses the original. It should be a challenge for the writers to maintain the interest level heading into "Spider-Man 3" in 2007. "Spider-Man 2" seems to answer all the questions about its cast. What's left to build a story around? All in all, a fun ride for what it is. Worth my money. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better Than the Original Box-Office Hit</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had high hopes going into this movie, and I'm pleased to say that my hopes were met and then some. The movie doesn't waste any time and easily recaptures the charm the first one provided. The interesting aspect of SM2 is that the characters are much more mature; Peter is living alone and is struggling to pay rent, MJ is an actress and Harry is now running Oscorp. In the first movie, the characters were still struggling to find themselves. Even Aunt May has changed since the first movie; she still cannot find peace in the passing of Uncle Ben and is also on the verge of losing her home and losing sight of who Peter is. So overall, the character's are much different this time around.As you know, the bad guy this time around is Doc Ock, played by Alfred Molina. Molina played an excellent villain and what I think was the key success to him was his likable side. Before the horrible lab accident turns him into Ock, the audience is exposed to his nice side and you can see why Peter admired the man so much. While I liked the Green Goblin, the audience never really got to see the charming side of him and the movie portrayed him as nothing but an evil person. So again, by exposing Ock's good side, the struggle between good and evil has an added twist which really adds to the film and the climactic ending.Overall, this movie was phenomenal. It exceeded any hopes I had, and this really is a sequel that goes beyond its predecessor. The acting is incredible. Tobey really shines through and proves why he is perfect for the role, especially during the train scene. And Kirsten does a great job as a believable MJ. This movie is well worth seeing if not once than twice and if not twice than a hundred times because it is everything you could want in a movie: great acting, great special effects, great storyline, great action and even great comedy (funnyman J.K. Simmons is HILARIOUS!). Anyways, yes, this movie is awesome, so go seeit. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the best super hero movie yet made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPIDER MAN 2 is the new standard by which super hero films are made. Spider Man is a heavy duty fantasy film rooted in enough suspension of disbelief to make it work. SPIDER MAN is also rooted in enough adventure and thrills to make any kid or adult leave the theatre looking forward to SPIDER MAN 3 or perhaps to see SPIDER MAN 2 again. SPIDER MAN works on many levels; it works as a action picture, it works as a love film, and it works as a mad scientist movie. I seldom go to movies at the theatre any more do to excessive cost and I despise the crap mill in Los Angeles. This film was worth the $5.50 I shelled out to go see it. I remember the tag line to SUPERMAN "YOU WILL BELIEVE A MAN CAN FLY" there could be one for this film and TOBY MAGUIRE revolving around Maguire and his acting. His acting draws out the best in his lines and the potential in the films screenplay. The same could be said of of this films direction once again drawing out the best in the screen play and the comic book legend. I recommend this film to families as there is no objectionable material.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked the first Spiderman but could not quite understand why it was considered to be that brilliant. For me the silly Green Goblin "costume" spoiled much of the fun. With Dock Ock we have only the second best Spidey villain but as played by Molina he is much, much better for the film. He is exactly like I thought Ock should appear on the screen. Dito for J. Jonah Jameson. He was just amazing. Please Hollywood, there is nothing wrong in considering a best supporting actor?s award for him. There are a million great things in this one and I cannot thank the creators enough for giving us a sequel that captures the spirit of the original comic. There is really love and respect for the original but with a lot of unique new ideas that make this work perfectly. (Putting the Bugle into the Flat Iron Building was a stroke of genius.) I still think it was wrong to start with MJ instead of Gwen Stacy - the only real love of Peter Parker - but given the fact that today's readers would not know her that is okay especially as Kirsten Dunst plays her role in a way that unites character traits of both Gwen and MJ. When Peter gave up his Spiderman identity (I think in #50) it was one of the greatest issues in the series and writer(s) of this wisely built the script around this emotional highlite with nearly exactly the image from the comic. Bravo. I do hope the the third part will be as good as this. But if the creative team stays I have no doubts that it will.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful Sequel and Great Comic Book Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spider-Man 2 is a creative comic book film that is stronger than the original and better than other pictures of the genre like Superman and Batman. What pleased me about the first Spider-Man film in 2002 was an emphasis on character relationships and exploration into the psychology of Peter Parker. The sequel successfully expands on this and Parker becomes even more interesting and fascinating as he simultaneously struggles through a life of crime fighting and as a normal kid suffering with school and jobs. However, it is more complicated than that as Peter Parker becomes a real person who does not know who he is, what he wants to do with his life, and what his life means; and Parker represents that common experience every person must face as they get older. Even as Spider-Man/Peter Parker wears that outrageous costume and swings from building to building which may be silly, underneath that character is a realistic person and one more serious than Bruce Wayne or Clark Kent.Spider-Man 2 is a well written film and creativity seems to have gone up with sequels like Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings and now Spider-Man, but what makes the Spider-Man movies better films than other comic book pictures like Batman is that they are deeper and more serious examinations into the real world and unlike Bruce Wayne and Clark Kent, Peter Parker is easy to relate to. The Batman films seemed cold with villains who were both depressing and goofy, and despite the Superman movies being good they are corny compared to todays Hollywood films like Spider-Man and Lord of the Rings. The Spider- Man films have more heart, are warmer tales, have villains one can also understand and root for in addition to their hero, plus a strong and attractive female lead to provide us with a memorable love story; I never thought Margot Kidder as Lois Lane was cute and Batman's love relationships seemed sleazy and cold. Spider-Man 2 is the best film in the genre of comic book pictures, and I have high hopes for Spider-Man 3 which should explore Peter Parker as a husband and father but who knows what that film will be about. **** (out of 4 stars)</fullReview>

I'd like to see the next spiderman very very soon, hopefully next year. Think of it as a chain ("Spiderman" 2003, "Spiderman 2" 2004, "Spiderman 3" 2005?). Tobey McGuire is the right guy for this role, Kirsten Dunst is the beautiful, though down-to-Earth love-interest. The villains (though I don't think of Dr.Octopus as a villain at the end of the movie, more of a hero for correcting a huge mistake, which takes real guts) are very very difficult to beat. And now there are other villains on a row waiting to take on New York and Spiderman/Peter Parker. Thank god for letting Stan Lee having a say on making this movie, I would dread the result(s) otherwise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pure Crap</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was never a Spider Man fan. I hated the 1st and here is the second, the crappest out of the two. Well I went to go see it, The dialog was crap. It was cheesy, and unfulfilling. Although I give the creators this, the actions parts where very well done. However, once more back to the dialog was very bad. In addition, some of the part of the movie where spider man is hurt and is passed around in a small crowd like god, did make me hold down a very hurtful laugh. Also the part when Mary-Jane stops at Peter's doorway to his apartment still in her wedding dress and Peter never thought anything of it. But don't forget the part where a teenager or early 20s was getting mugged by two much older men, and since Spider Man has given up his duty, he watches the boy get beat for over a minute and then walks away Or the part where Mary-Jane walks into Peter's apartment (and yes this is crowned the worst ending line EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! *Mary Jane: Peter I have been standing at you're doorway, and I will always be standing in you're doorway* Wait, I may be wrong or something but doesn't mean that you're just out of reach of his love?). Over all Spider Man Two could have been a great movie, if the dialog could have been less cheesy and more what a real New Yorker would say. Do I have anything good to say about this flick? Yes. The actions sections where really well done. Even if a computer made it all, you could not tell between life and digital. I enjoyed this very much. And unlike the 1st Spider Man, he jumped from building to building very realist. Also Spider Man's being able to get away with all of New York knowing his face is a little off. 2 stars out of 5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superbly made sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my recent (and not so recent) memory, rarely do sequel's come out equal to the task, LOTR series is one that succeeded, Aliens another...add Spider-Man 2 to the list. The beauty of IMDb is it gives one a chance, almost in a blog type format, to empty their thoughts. As such, before I give my take on SM2, a moment to thank IMDb for the service, and more so Sam Raimi for a job well, well done...and to the writers, a simply great story.Superhero movies have come and gone over the years. First, the superbly made Superman movie, followed up by the not so great sequels. Then came Batman, which the original was well done, then degraded fast with each subsequent film until we reached the abyss with Batman and Robin. X-men broke somewhat with tradition, as the second was a no doubt a good time in the theater. The Hulk is one we would all like to forget -- I seriously doubt there will be a sequel here. SM2, however, did something the other superhero movies could not in a sequel...they built upon already strong characters with even more, better character development. The critics saw this and they nailed the analysis on this one. It is the primary reason SM2 works as well as it does. Other super hero movies assume in their sequels that the characters are fully developed. Film makers assume there is no need, or desire, to grow them any further -- they leap right into action, pitting good vs evil. SM2, on the other hand, spends a deal of it's time on progressing the main characters, adding the human element to a young man with super human abilities, Parker struggles with who he is and his responsibilities as a result, he wrestles with his dual role, while MJ comes out caring, but perplexed with Parkers apparent shield of mystery. Harry Osborne grows in his hatred of SM, heck even Jameson progresses. Very fun to watch, engrossing, and better yet we (the audience) gets to learn more about already intriguing characters. This is not completely the good guy vs the bad guy, as in the end we can sympathize with the antagonist...any more would be spoiling the movie. No, this movie has many messages in terms of responsibility, doing the right thing, honesty and above all interpersonal struggles.I will not publish any spoilers, there are plenty to be read....what I will say is see this movie! It is one of the diamonds in an otherwise very rough field of cruddy big-budget Hollywood tripe (aka Troy, Van Helsing, Chronicles of Riddick etc.).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Review from a fan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The thing that attracted me to this film is the exact thing that attracted me to the comic.Spiderman was unlike any other super-hero (of course, he was an anonymous, young man tormented by the loss of a love one), however the appeal for Spiderman is contributed towards the the colour (of spiderman, the surroundings, the villains), the action, the dynamics of his powers, the speed and agility of which he can use them, and the principles and morals by which Peter Parker lives by.I personally feel that Spiderman 2 captures all of these factors beautifully and still keeps the story to a logical flow of occurrences.Yes, certain themes were repeated from the first movie, however, these themes formed a part of Peter Parker's inevitable progress through the problems for which a super-hero such as himself would have to face. In all, Spiderman 2 is a wonderful adaption of a complex character, living amongst an array of even more complex characters and situations and still succeeds in delivering a wonderfully flowing and exciting movie.I cant wait for Spiderman 3.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked the first Spiderman but could not quite understand why it was considered to be that brilliant. For me the silly Green Goblin "costume" spoiled much of the fun. With Dock Ock we have only the second best Spidey villain but as played by Molina he is much, much better for the film. He is exactly like I thought Ock should appear on the screen. Dito for J. Jonah Jameson. He was just amazing. Please Hollywood, there is nothing wrong in considering a best supporting actor?s award for him. There are a million great things in this one and I cannot thank the creators enough for giving us a sequel that captures the spirit of the original comic. There is really love and respect for the original but with a lot of unique new ideas that make this work perfectly. (Putting the Bugle into the Flat Iron Building was a stroke of genius.) I still think it was wrong to start with MJ instead of Gwen Stacy - the only real love of Peter Parker - but given the fact that today's readers would not know her that is okay especially as Kirsten Dunst plays her role in a way that unites character traits of both Gwen and MJ. When Peter gave up his Spiderman identity (I think in #50) it was one of the greatest issues in the series and writer(s) of this wisely built the script around this emotional highlite with nearly exactly the image from the comic. Bravo. I do hope the the third part will be as good as this. But if the creative team stays I have no doubts that it will.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just another one of the production line</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As the sequel to the 2002 movie Spider-Man, this film hit the marked with record braking earnings. Now why is that I must ask ? This movie isn't much of anything. Don't get me wrong this is not a bad movie, but it's not a good one either. The movie has some good scenes and Tobey Maguire (Spiderman) has some good acting moments. But in overall nothing stands out in this movie. The story, action and effects looks just like all the other superhero movies we have been seeing lately in movies like The Hulk, Dear Devil etc. If you like these kinds of Hoolywool production line stuff, this flick will be right up you're alley. But as all the others they are forgotten quickly. This movie will not win any awards or sail up as one of the historic productions of the 21th century, but it will entertain you for about 2 hours.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's always one thing I fear when it comes to movies and that is sequels! I knew there was a lot of hype surrounding this movie so I tried to ignore it and go into the movies with no expectations. This movie actually blew me away by its content, it didn't focus on some "I hate everyone, I'm evil and I want to kill the world" storyline. Instead it focused on how heroes are within us all (as Aunt May said), how technology has consumed us and how its important to sustain love no matter how difficult the circumstances.Peter Parker (Maguire) is still fighting crime but he's also trying to fight his guilt over his Uncle Ben's death, his true feelings for Mary Jane (Dunst) and the truth about his identity to Harry (James Franco).I think its a movie people would really enjoy, I have it an 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spiderman 2 ****1/2/*****Spiderman 2 is the perfect sequel. It combines the character from the first one with improved special f/x and a more natural script. Spiderman 2 is also an action/superhero movie that appeals to more than just the teenage boy. The bulk of the film is not pounding rock beats and images of extreme stunts done mostly by the f/x geeks on their computers. Instead, there is human weakness in this movie. There is pain (yes, the emotional kind) allowing for compassion to be felt for Peter Parker, making it easier for the audience to root for him. The story picks up where it left off. For those who missed out on the first one (that's right, we judge you for it) will be brought up to speed by a cleaver set of comic book style animations shown with the opening credits. Even if you were one of the millions of people that saw the original, the pictures are a good reminder and help jog you memory of those key plot events. Knowledge of Spidey's first film is essential because this second story is not a new adventure all together, as most sequels tend to do, but instead it continues to dig into the effect earlier events have on Peter Parker. Peter (Tobey Maguire) appears to be a failure. Perhaps this is why we love him. We see that he is no different than us and that appeals to our perhaps subconscious desire to be superhuman in one way or another. He's a failing school, his career and his love life. Who can't relate to at least one of those? Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst), on the other hand, is doing fabulous. Her acting career has picked up and she's becoming that star we all also want to be. She's going to get married to an astronaut and it appears to be the ?it' life. But there's still Peter who she wants to be with but Peter just can't seem to make it happen. He keeps letting her down. In turn, Peter is heart broken about hurting MJ again and again and so he decides to start a new life.This is the story about Peter without Spiderman. Of course that doesn't last as a new villain appears on the scene. Doc Ock (Alfred Molina) is a man but he just happens to have four extra mechanical arms. The arms have a life of their own, thus making them superior to Willem Dafoe's Green Goblin that we saw in the first film. One of the important aspects about this genre of movie is that if you're going to make sequel, you must replace the villain. We've already seen how the first one was beat; we crave fresh blood. That, in a nutshell, it the action genre moviegoers attitude.Well, Doc Ock deliver and actually has the audience gasping here and there. Just like Peter, Ock is human too. He's simply exercising another desire, to be rich and powerful. He is the epitome of `How far would you go?'In a summer full of sequels, Harry Potter and the box office cash cow Shrek 2, Spiderman 2 is nothing short of its predecessors. In fact, it's much better. More than living up to the first one, Spidey is good time had. ****1/2 out of *****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best comic book movie ever! - (SLIGHT SPOILERS)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first heard this movie was coming up, I thought: "Why Bother? It's just going to be the same thing over and over again". Good guy goes insane, captures Mary Jane and Spider-man saves the day. But boy was I in for a surprise.Probably the most surprising thing about this movie is how all the characters have matured into real people. Before they were all cardboard, now you get a feel of what they are like inside. Tobey Maguire gives an excellent performance of Spiderman who has to work extra hard to pretend that he doesn't love Mary Jane (Kristen Dunst) and it's touching. However, I think the whole thing of creating sympathy for Parker was a bit over done. It's not bad enough that he loses the girl of his dreams, but he loses his health, his job, his home, etc. It almost becomes a comical joke and it's because they didn't have anything to build on from the first movie.The script was also far superior as well. They managed to raise the stakes emotionally, as well as the danger. Dr. Octopus was also a much freakier and stronger villain than the Green Goblin ever was because you knew he was mentally ill, insane and a powerful freak. I also liked how they adapted his arms to each have a mind of a own and to be able to see - which I think is really cool. Even better was the fight scenes and the webslinging was even better!.Now here's the spoiler!. Some people felt disappointed with the ending because they felt all the loose ends were tied up when Peter Parker and Mary Jane chose to be with one another. Well it's not and here's why. In the comic book itself much of the story is dealt with Mary Jane being Spiderman's sidekick. Though she has absolutely no powers at all, they make a great team couple and are supposed to throughout their lives. They're young, funny and go through a lot of mischief and adventure. It's also interesting because you get to see what it's like to be the wife of a super hero.The second dumb part is when the trains people see Spiderman with his mask off. One of them says, "Don't worry Spiderman, we won't tell". Yeah right, how can you ever trust a 7 year old kid.Last but not least, I thought it was STUPID to have the Green Goblin come back. Harry will now mostly become the new Green Goblin. That sucks because I want to see a new villain and not see them reuse the same ones over an over. Of course, there's no final word on whether or not Doc Oc is dead - for I certainly like to see him back once again to fight Spidey. Despite it's flaws and the fact that it may have been a little too long. It's a worthy movie.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well, it did what it was supposed to...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's hard to compare a movie with very simple aspirations, with other movies that are more complex. As I'm writing those lines, SM2 is in the top 250 at IMDb and is one of the best reviewed movie of the year. That is very misleading since not many people will name this film the best of the year, or even among the top-10. So why such unanimity over it? Its genre attracts a wide audience and the film does pretty much exactly what it's supposed to do.There is a lot of time spent on the love story and Peter Parker's personal problems but that is exactly what a Spiderman movie should be doing. You don't like that, the movie is not meant for you. Sam Raimi didn't go the Tim Burton route. His love story isn't just there because every film needs one. He gave one that was more heartfelt and added a few scenes with Parker working as photograph. It took some time of the clock but very rarely does the film suffer because of this. Humorous scenes are funny, sometimes laugh out loud funny. Romantic scenes are... well, okay for the genre. It's not greatness but since it's part of a whole, it does add some tension when needed. The only real problem is that dreadful Aunt May speech about heroes, that felt forced, overlong and completely out of place. Old people don't talk like that unless they turn senile. They have to stop using that character like it was some character devoid of any personality.As for the action scenes, well, they are great. There was a much needed upgrade over the CGI, giving the film a much more realistic look. Okay, I learned you could throw an old lady in the air pretty hard without much consequences but the movie didn't take itself too seriously to have that "cartoonishness" becoming a problem. The train sequence is spectacular enough to be worth the price of admission and Dr Octopus is much, much better villain than the Green Goblin.There is still places for improvement but the bar has been raised for the genre. If you review it as it is, and don't compare with other, non-related films, this is worth 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spiderman 2 eclipses the first with a super engaging plot and well developed characters. Spoilers ahead. The movie commences with sketches from the first installment up to the point where Peter Parker leaves an emotional M. J. at the goblins funeral; for those who vaguely remember. After all two years have passed since Peter Parker was bitten by the spider but not a lot has changed. Peter is still tight for money, although M.J. has moved up with her career and has her face splashed on billboards. Harry is the only one who has not moved on, still consumed with anger for loosing his father. In spite of loathing Spiderman he has continued his father's legacy OSCORP and funded a new A.I. technology channeled by Otto Octavius, a determined scientist, which goes astray causing him to become controlled by his invention. The underlying premise is Peter Parker's struggle between being the super hero and being Peter Parker as well as admitting his love for M.J without compromising her safety. His uncle's words, `with great power comes great responsibility' are revisited. All in all Spiderman two is a great sequel with lots of action and great Spiderman moments. Tobey Maguire is awesome!</fullReview>

Alfred Molina the actor who played the Russian agent in The Man Who Knew Too Little and the most under rated actor in movies today steals the picture as Doc Ock. Kirsten Dunst is adorable as MJ and her chemistry with Tobey Maguire makes the picture memorable. Yes the special effects were great and the ending was wonderfully. Durst (MJ) has the last line in the movie, a line taken directly from the Spiderman Comic 'Go em Tiger,' Great movie but I will have to have some assurance that Web Head's life will be a bit better in the next movie before I will see it in the theater.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went and saw this with my husband(we are in our 30's), our three children from 11 to 6,and three nieces 12-5 and 1 nephew 10. It was such a good movie. Much much better than the first and I actually went in thinking it would bomb because sequels haven't been that good as a whole lately. I can't believe some of the things that they opened up in it but it really sets up for a multitude of things to happen in Spidey 3. The only thing I can say negative is that my 6 yr old son and 5 yr old niece who both really like the whole Spiderman thing... did not sit through it, they fidgeted through the whole movie except for maybe the train and warehouse scenes. So beware if you take little ones, it may not keep they're attention really well (alot of softer points in the movie) Otherwise the rest of the family walked away with huge smiles asking if we could go see it again and can't wait for the next movie. As for me bring on the DVD, can't wait to see the extras and hopefully any plugs for 3... ( i hope they bring in Venom or Carnage) lolol enjoy the movie!!!! It's awesome.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best film of the summer, so far</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now Roger Ebert gave this bad boy 4 stars and said it was the best superhero movie since the first Superman. I'm not sure if I would go that far because I have to say that so far my favorites are still the two X-men movies, but this is probably a close third. Anyway, Dr. Octavius is a much cooler villain than the Green Goblin and although the movie hints at a third villain that isn't Venom, the plot was written perfectly. Any fan of the comics knows the story and the movie follows it perfectly. Mary Jane's back to her usual good looks and calling Peter Parker "Tiger." Harry Osbourne is back to his hating of Spiderman but loving his best friend Peter Parker. Will he find out Spiderman's true identity? The coming attractions kinda gave that one away, but if you ever watched the cartoon or read the comic you'd know the answer anyway. Thus the hinting at the third villain. So without giving too much more away, let me just say that this movie lives up to its many reviews and it truly is a great movie. The best movie I've seen in the theaters this summer. So go see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Looking back on the other major super hero franchises (Superman, Batman, X-Men), I think in each case the franchise took a step backward in the sequel...that was certainly not the case here.....a good film was followed by a great film.In my opinion, the greatest thing about the film is the nearly top-to-bottom- casting. Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, and James Franco are just perfect for their roles. The chemistry is dead on. Even the supporting players do exactly what they need to do for their characters.&lt;Possible Spoilers&gt;The only problem I had in the whole film was with Alfred Molina's portrayal of Dr. Octopus. When we first meet him, he is perfect for the role...a very loving down-to-Earth person. As he transitioned into the villain, I found myself simply not believing the performance....I'm really not sure if this is a problem with how he chose to approach the role or how it was written, but it was the one thing I didn't like. Once he becomes the villain, everything was pretty good.Overall....even Dr. Octopus...I found the characters of this two-dimensional comic book world far more three-dimensional than most films I have seen. Even if you are not a die hard comic book fan, this is a film that might give you some respect for the genre.</fullReview>

Kirsten was looking stunning and Toby looked a lot more in shape than last time. With this film opening in the UK as a PG it still has a lot of dramatic and violent scenes.Which leads more questioning (again) over the rating even if has been cut. but in summary i really enjoyed the film and has many memorable scenes which i cant say for many other films this year.

		<shortDescription>One of the Best Comic Book Adaptations...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the aspects needed for ANY decent story is a sense of characters, motivation for them, and personal CONFLICT. This film hits all the right notes. From the quick summary of S1 with the credits, the viewer is quickly brought right up to date. This film underscores how important it is to have an ACTOR in a lead, despite 1/2 of it being in costume. Like Michael Keaton did for Batman, Maguire gives Peter Parker a soul. He creates a character we feel so much empathy for. But...the film doesn't slight supporting characters in the least. This very worthy, superior sequel should be required viewing for any screenwriting course. Note the character nuances, the CONFLICT each faces, their MOTIVATION. There is far more here than a guy wearing a black hat who kicks puppies vs. the white hatted hero. These are BELIEVABLE characters, despite the SPFX. Dunst, Molina, Franco, and of course, the incomparable Rosemary Harris as aunt May, keep the story and characters grounded in humanity. This is the greatest conflict, not the CGI FX, although they are stunning. Add this in with the LOTR trilogy and Harry Potter films. Hollywood hopefully will take note. RELATABLE CHARACTERS drive great films. Not explosions, wacky, inappropriately humorous one liners, but CHARACTERS, and only great actors can deliver these.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I heard from my brother that this movie was supposed to be amazing, but wasn't sure. That is, until I finally saw it last night. I'm convinced that this was the step required for the Spider-Man legacy to reach a pinnacle. Spider-Man was pretty damn good, casted well, scripted properly, and was fairly impressive. Spider-Man 2 blew the original away without a doubt. Of course there were some very odd parts. For example, the park scene where Parker is just walking around. That just didn't make much sense, didn't fit in with everything else. And the whole elevator scene? As insanely funny as that was, it just didn't seem like something I would've wanted to put in a movie of this caliber. Minus those few parts, this movie was unbelievable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best escapist fare in years!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was the greatest pure escapism,along with films like "Raiders Of The Lost Ark",and "Superman",I've experienced in years.Being 12 again,and getting right inside the movie,was a blast!I mean,the fact that cornball dialogue and broad,predictable humor can be pulled off with such finesse is a massive achievement on Sam Raimi's and Alvin Sargent's part.Somehow,the whole tragedy of Doc Ock had some impact that is unheard of in this genre.Molina gave it some real humanity.The line "I'm not going out as a monster" brought a light mist to this viewer's peepers.By the way,what does anyone out there think of this 10 line minimum thing?I had to stretch this out-all I wanted was the first 2 lines in.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boring, boring, boring......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why this movie cash so big at box office? Why people rate so high this ugly and so boring movie. Everything looks old fashion in this horrible movie. It is slow, it is stupid and, over all, so boring. Tobey Mc Guire is so sad and anonymous, the story is so banal, fx are too few and bad done. I rate this movie 1 on 10. On the opposite I saw the beautiful "King Arthur" which is rated very low in this website and I loved it. (read my post about). What I have to think? Classical American characters achieve the success even if boring, on the opposite if the director is black the rate is always bad. I am white but I blame this way to do in this culturally pathetic Bush America. All my respect to: Kenneth Ivory Wayans, Spike Lee, Antoine Fuqua and all the other underestimated black great directors.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It transcends summer blockbuster status and becomes just a totally mindblowing motion picture in its own right. Wow...it made you laugh, it made you cry, and it made you appreciate the simple things in life, as well as the struggles we all go through. You really feel for Peter, because I'm sure we can relate to hardships in our life. The chemistry between Mary Jane and Peter is great. There were many touching parts! I'm sure it's been said, but the story in this particular film really makes it stand out. Not to mention the great special effects. If you have even a remote interest in Spider-Man, or none at all, I would still recommend you to go. Your g/f will love you for it, and you will love it too. Trust me on this.

I couldn't have asked for a better portrayal.For once, someone has taken the time to develop the characters in a way that takes you into the movie and along for the ride. Tobey Maquire can act with his eyes in a way that no words need be spoken. Aunt May, MJ, Harry are given the chance to be part of the movie without appearing two dimensional. This is a movie for lovers of comics or not. My son who is only seven asked if he could see it again.Bravo 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shrekerman II -- The poverty of contemporary screen writing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The following comments will no doubt be seen as controversial.Did I like Spiderman II? Yes, I did. Is it better than the original? Indeed, it is. Would I recommend the movie? Of course. So why am I complaining?Well, I feel bad about complaining. This is after all Spiderman II, not Days of Heaven or Vertigo. The movie probably takes the superhero format about as far as it can go. Indeed, I had some trepidation leaving the theater. How isSpiderman III possibly going to top this? And yet for all my positive feelings for the film, I confess to being frustrated. Considering the following plot summary for Shrek II:A humanoid hero, conflicted by self-doubt, has to rescue his sweetheart from the clutches of an incredibly power villain. Not only must he defeat this evil person, but in the meantime the heroine must free herself from the fate worse than death -- marriage to a perfectly decent white guy. In short, the overall plot ofSpiderman II and Shrek II are same. I wonder if I was the only person who was bothered by the abominable way that Mary Jane treated her fiance (who had done absolutely nothing wrong to her -- perhaps the role should have been given to Britney Spears.) In a movie thatstruggled to be sincere in its depiction of emotions (unlike Shrek which wasadmittedly a farce) this left a nasty aftertaste. The movie cannot have it both ways: i.e. it cannot say when confronted by this and other problems, that it is only a comic book movie, while being praised for the rigorous care it gives its characters as a true drama.This may be reflected in the complaints by others as well about much of thecharacter interaction seems to go nowhere. The action scenes between Doc Ocand Peter Parker (might as well call him that because by the end of the movie everyone in NY knows his identity) are thrilling, but we really don't know what drives the man to his ultra-violent and all consuming life of crime. We have hints, but that is it. Aunt May apperas to forgive him, but does she? And why, other than the need for a hero stuff.I praise the movie for its ambitions and its technical achievements. It has raised the bar substantially, and that is a good thing. But at the end, I feltuncomfortable and wishing the screenwriters had the courage to go into acompletely a different direction. Part of me wishes, in fact, that the movie had ended in the delightful (to the tune of "Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head")romantic interlude where Peter seems to get a grip on his life as a regular guy. And this is why I am not a rich Hollywood Producer. :P</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spiderman 2 was in almost every way better than the original (which was stupendous). It would take me a very long time, and more than my 1,000 word allotment to list every thing I liked about the movie, so I'll list what I didn't like with the understanding that means I liked everything else.There were a few spots where spiderman looked CG, the coloring/shadows on the costume were slightly off, and when Spidey's preparing to web sling shot himself out the window his movements are a little jerky (I think it was done intensionally to show the force being put into the web sling but I didn't like the result even with that being said).Mary Jane's (Kirsten Dunst's) hair wasn't dyed red enough.I wasn't quite sure of the reason behind Peter Parker temporarily loosing his powers, the "explanation" of it being psychological was speculated by a doctor who didn't know Peter was Spiderman and thought the conversation was about a dream Peter had of being Spiderman and not being able to stick to the wall. This hypothetical explanation was not pleasing to me since Peter has temporarily lost his powers a number of times for a number of reasons in comic books and cartoon shows, I was left wondering if it wasn't just in his head and was something more serious.So like I was saying, It was practically perfect; the fight scenes were great, the acting was great, the story was great, the scenery was great, and it had a good sound track and ... and ... and ... and... (you get the idea).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Highs: Great special effects (particularly the scenes with Spidey swinging through New York City), great fight scenes between Spidey and Doc Ock, Alfred Molina is perfect as Doctor Octopus, and shows how hard it can be to maintain both a superhero life, and a normal life.Lows: Not much, other than the fact that it dwells A LITTLE too much on the relationship between Peter Parker and Mary Jane (although I do understand that SOME time must be spent on it).Overall: With great acting all around, great special effects, and a surprisingly touching story, this is one of the few "blockbuster" movies out this summer worth seeing. It probably ties with X-Men 2 as my top superhero movie so far. I give it 8/10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The casting of this movie was all-around excellent but Tobey Maguire really makes this movie. He's the best Peter Parker anyone could hope to get.Back problems or no I hope he's in the third movie as well. He has a great mix of geekiness and studliness. He looked much the worse for wear in this movie but I'm sure that that was the intent what with Peter's life going down the crapper and all.Before I ever saw the first movie I was horrified at the idea of Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane but was very happily surprised at her performance. The second one has me doubting how to feel. She was just looking too skinny and rough round the edges to be the goddess of womanliness I remember from the comics.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>just what i expected, more thrill more action more humor more sentiments exposed and a really good storyline.Not an ordinary American movie but a really good action film that will appeal to people of all ages.I Vote for 10 out of 10 and i hope all of u do so.Furthermore,Spiderman 2 had a lot of outrageous scenes,to list some of them i would refer to the one with the train and how he manages to stop it by throwing masses of spiderweb to buildings so as to slow down his speed.Though unreal it was massive...Also there were a lot of humour scenes like the one shot in the elevator where a man standing next to him, in the elevator points out his cool spidey outfit,and also the scene where he tries to jump off from buildings shouting ''i'm back i'm back'' and what he finally ends up to is, screaming ''my back my back'' a really good ironical scene.Well to sum up,Spiderman 2 really came up to my expectations and went beyond them,i personally think there is gonna be a continuation to it since at the end we see Harry wanting to avenge his father for what damage spiderman had caused...Who knows? but we all would be happy to see how the movie will develop in the future.Take care all you spidey fans out there!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's Been Hit By The Overrated Stick!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well with the recent "wave" of comic film movies in the last couple of years (Spiderman/ Hulk/ Daredevil etc. ) I found myself fairly anticipated for the sequel of Spiderman. The first was was pretty cool and deserves its IMDb rating of 7.4...Yet Spiderman 2 being on the TOP 250 is completely out of place, there are SO many other films that deserve to be on this spot and in my own humble opinion, this doesn't belong..Spiderman 2 seems to have a fair bit of concentration on Characters "Development"...Thats if you want to call it that, you already know that his life sucks and totally loves MJ. People need to see through the Semi- Good effects and realize that this film definitely isn't as good as its said to be. Sure there are action scenes but most of them are very short lived, then are accompanied by boring talk talk talk...! Although its basically a famous thought that Sequels never seem to work, Spiderman 2 is a fair enough example of that- get off the hype and see this film for what it is..."Just another superhero flick"!(*MINOR SPOILERS**)ACTING: The acting was was mediocre. Tobey McGuire i would say had very little lines in this film, masked or unmasked he is just quiet. Kudos for wearing that seemingly uncomfortable suit though. Kirsten Dunst is no Meryl Streep, her performance is the same as any of her other films, nothing outstanding but she is a very beautiful girl. The others did a decent job, i can't say anyone here was a BAD actor, but definitely not great.ACTORS: Tobey McGuire, Kirsten Dunst, Alfred Molina, James Franco &amp; more...The casting is pretty good,i cant really say anything bad on this section as the cast are pretty well known and match their characters pretty well...Especially Alfred as "Doc Oc"SCRIPT: VERY WEAK! The script is basically what weighed down a lot of the film. All these people giving it a 8-9 really need to Watch the film again or READ the script, this is not quality work. Continuity is lacking, many conversations are entirely pointless, so many boring and yes pointless scenes that bare no relevance to anything really annoy me, some corny one liners too. Oh and one extremely lame part is when Aunt May is stuck next to a man in a bank that is being robbed by a guy with 8 robotic arms, well this dude picks up a coin he finds on the floor and Aunt Mary slaps his hand. How dumb! Other dumb parts are stupid lines like "I was always at your doorway" or another example would be "He died when he did the right thing" (Referring to his dad saying NO to an armed man wanting his car)...The writing is plain silly for the most part and there's barely any describing why Doc Oc had his intentions and suddenly turning him to Mr. Nice Guy, really screws it up!CINEMA: Cinematography was par good par poor. The cityscapes and Spiderman (CGI) looked pretty good. Yet there were so many errors and bloopers, continuity was so poor, them CGI helicopters looked ridiculous. In general though camera angles were fair and not overused when it came to being fancy. So some good points and some lame ones.ACTION: The action scenes had some things going for it. The train scene was pretty cool. Doc Oc was a cool, violent Villain (until he turned nice). Though it did get fairly repetitive with Spiderman doing the same things over and over again. There was quiet a lot of talk (that was pointless) that could have easily been replaced with fun action- but it never happened. All in all definitely not an Action packed flick, but i guess it hits its target audience of younger teens.MUSIC: The soundtrack is nowhere near as good as the original. There wasn't so much music used here, and some of it had the "Batman Essence"...That didn't impress me really, but it did have the classic "Raindrops fallin on my head"- but in general the musical score here really need looking upon as it was bland.OVERALL: Spiderman 2 is in no, way, form or shape a terrible film...But also in no way, form or shape is this a GREAT film, reading the reviews here I'm surprised as to how many people loved this flick, it was terribly flawed. All i can really say is Spiderman 2 was hit by the OVERRATED stick...BIG TIME! I found it occasionally boring, sloppy and full of errors and bloopers...For the amount wasted on this film i was expected a masterpiece, and in no section of FILM was Spiderman 2 a masterpiece.** 1/2 (2.5 stars out of 5)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst Film I've ever seen!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I honestly don't understand all the kudos being directed toward this film. My brother-in-law suggested seeing it when we were vacationing out of town. I hadn't seen the first one and admittedly wasn't too keen on seeing this one either. However, in the spirit of 'go with the flow' I agreed to go thinking maybe it would be a fun, relaxing evening what with all the special effects and positive reviews the film has received.I can't believe we wasted seventeen dollars and two and half hours on this very bad, very lame movie. The dialogue was sappy and generic, the supposedly funny newspaper editor was anything but, the aunt was a moron and even the action sequences got old after awhile. Apparently I wasn't the only one in the theatre with the same opinion as it was decidedly very quiet throughout the entire film -- hardly anyone laughed at anything!I was never happier for the credits to roll as I was at the end of this dull, bad, awful film.</fullReview>

From the extremely cool and well-made intro, cleverly giving us all we need to know if one didn't see the first installment to the slapstick first half-hour of us getting to know the life of Peter Parker to the second act with Doc Oc. raving around town to the finally with Harry turning against his best friend Peter, eaten alive by hatred and blame. This is a thrill-ride with sappy parts, your regular twists and turns and not a too complicated story, but it works. By god it works, delivering one of the best, if not THE best, comicbook-hero-adaptation of all time. Sam Raimi proves he masters the art of entertainment. Another plus is the homage montage-sequence where Doc Oc. goes berserk at the hospital. F***in' brilliant! If you haven't seen it, do. You won't regret it. This is good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spider Man 2: The Soap Opera</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You can't even come close to comparing the downfall between Spider Man 1/2 and the first two 'Matrix' movies - but you kind of want to.--------A basic rundown of the plot, via IMDB - Peter Parker (Tobey McGuire) can't seem to catch any kind of break. Being Spiderman has brought him nothing but problems as far as his personal life is concerned. Not only that, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) is engaged to astronaut John Jameson, and Peter may lose her forever. Things are so bad for him that he is pushed past his breaking point, so he decides that he doesn't want to be Spiderman anymore, until a freak accident transforms Dr. Otto Octavius into Dr. Octopus, a super-villian with four metal tentacles coming out of him. Peter realizes that only Spiderman can stop him, but of course, problems arise. Mary Jane gets caught in the middle, and Harry Osborn, who still blames Spiderman for the death of his father, Norman Osborn, also the Green Goblin, wants him dead. Spiderman will have to push himself past his limits if he's going to survive.--------The first movie accomplished something by combining a comic book hero with normal, every day problems. And it showed you a fairly equal balance between the hero and the normal person (Spider Man and Peter Parker, in this case).Unfortunatly, in this movie, we see way too much Peter Parker. The relationship with Mary Jane is mentioned every three minutes. The dialog with the supporting characters (Mary Jane, Aunt May, Harry etc) is way too long (esp Aunt May) and doesn't go anywhere. Even the comic relief from Jameson seems tacked on this time.Although the action is good (and you're relieved to see it after all the pointless blabber), it's too short when it is there. Plus it gets kind of old - seeing Spider man do Kung-Foo and shoot webs is only interesting for so long. It would have been nice if they would have somehow worked another power in there for him somehow. The one thing that almost came close to saving this movie was the villian. Alfred Molina as Doc Ock really shined. He was more interesting then the Green Goblin, and had cooler powers too. One thing I didn't like though was that he wasn't really evil - a problem with the green goblin as well. But it's a minor quibble. Overall, a vastly inferior (and overrated) sequel to a great movie. Save it for a rental. 3/10</fullReview>

I know that "depth" perhaps isn't a word that most people wouldn't associate with a comic book character, but it absolutely exists here. There's a lot of exploration and soul-searching in this movie that came off, to me, as being honest and natural. Plus the chemistry between Tobey Maguire and Kristin Dunst (former lovers, I might add) is genuine. Just go stand in line, pay your eight bucks, and see this on the big screen before the summer's over. No way will anyone feel let down after this movie. For eight bucks, you get more than your money's worth.</fullReview>

The villain could be a bit frightening to younger viewers, but I'd say 8 and up are certainly capable of tolerating the action. There were certainly a lot of loose threads leaving room for a sequel. I did think this movie was better than the first movie which is an unusual feat. It will be interesting to see how revealing the true identity of the hero will affect the next movie. Just a bit of implausibility in dropping the fusion core into the water and apparently putting it out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow, this movie is a pretty good sequel. While the first movie was basically a "see what we can do" film, the second one is based around the characters more. The acting is varied. Tobey Macguire is awesome as Peter Parker/Spider-Man. Kirsten Dunst is OK as Mary-Jane Watson, but I personally believe that Cate Blanchett would fit the role better. Whoever played Harry Osborn is good, but **spoiler** am i the only one that thinks that Harry was a pussy during the party scene? I mean girls slap, guys punch **end spoilers**. Everyone else does a good job. The bad guy was very emotional though. I mean **spoilers** going on a rampage because ur wife died?** end spoilers** I give it 9 and 3/4 * out of 10*, docking a quarter of a star for some poor parts</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Are you a Spider-man fan? You better get up and go now to see the movie. Common go, go, go, go before it goes to DVD.More Scenes outside. Two hours long. Great special effects. Great one lines. More story about Peter and the beautiful Mary Jane. It was very moving sometimes to change the pace. I laughed a few times. The sound was great too.It has many scenes to remember.The message of the movie to me is this:May Parker says, "I believe there's a hero in all of us. Gives us strength, makes us noble. Even though sometimes, we have to give up the thing we want the most". I hope you will enjoy it as much as I did. The kid inside of me will always enjoy it and it feels great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sam Raimi is a very good director. He has that certain knack for combining elements seamlessly. In this movie he combines the comic, with the absurd, and them jumps straight back into the serious, without missing a beat yet keeping the audience in the scene. He has managed to capture the various elements of comic books and its heroes and villains, as best as they can be portrayed in the film medium.Spider-Man 2 follows the exploits of Peter Parker, aka Spider-Man. The exhilaration and frustration that comes with that. Also the repercussions of his super-hero persona on his personal life. Peter Parker is not happy, yet handcuffed by his Spider-Man persona. Raimi portrays all elements of Peter Parker's life, no matter how unheroic and ordinary they may be. The action does not detract from the love story, nor from the comedy and the dramatic elements are enhanced by the conflicts. A major reason why it works is the inclusion of a super villain gone bad through circumstance rather than malice, as the counter balance. or mirroring for Peter/Spidey. It could have easily been Peter in the role. Now segue into the black outfit story arc and the next movie. As with most comic based movies and movies in general, there were some drawbacks to this movie. The element that threw me for a loop was the revelation of Peter Parker as Spider-Man to a train load of commuters, to Doc Oc, Osbourne, Mary Jane and anyone who has every stared onto the rooftops of any New York building. It seemed to ruin the idea of the anonymous hero. The Messianic theme didn't work for Singer's Superman and it certainly has no place here, with Spider-Man. Also, the Mary Jane character is a distressed female mostly, waiting to be rescued. She is much more than that in the comics. Also, there is no elevated train in the middle of midtown New York (nice "seamless" transition into Chicago).Sam Raimi has definitely included various elements from his indie film making days. The inclusion of Bruce Campbell and Sam's brother (Ted; whom you may remember as the incomparable Joxer and Lt. Tim O'Neill) is the proverbial cherry on the cake and a Raimi staple. Stan Lee returns in cameo fashion. Also, the horror movie female shriek is quite comical. It shows Raimi paying homage to the golden age of comics (too numerous to mention throughout). It is like the bank that has sacks of gold coins in the vault. Don't concentrator on it, or you will lose all the heavenly glory. Feel.One of the best comic book/themed movies. A must see.

		<fullReview>But enough about the Spidey comics. This movie was phenomenal. I admit, I'm a huge comic nerd, but this movie was great. I've gotten what little friends I have that aren't also comic nerds to go see it,and they all agree that this movie reeks of awesome. From the fights to the actual plot this movie is heads and shoulders above all the other solo comic book movies. It had pathos and ethos, it had love and laughter, it had cameos that I was shocked to see. I won't spoil it for you, but it was good to see him. It worked as a Sam Raimi film, most of all the doc ock in the hospital scene. It worked as a sequel, in fact I found the first one rather boring in that it just retold comic books no style, which this one had in spades. It just worked. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Sequel to the Box office hit movie of 2002 is perhaps the best sequel to a comic book movie, and In many ways is even better than the first. The special effects are better this time around and the plot is more defined. The returning cast is just as good this time around with Tobey Maguire playing the web slinger, along with Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane. J.K. Simmons who plays J.Jonah Jameson has more screen time this time and he makes the most of it with hilarious one liners that make you laugh. If there was such a thing as perfect casting, It would have to be Alfred Molina as Dr. Otto Octavius (Doc Ock). Molina and his four mechanical arms make him a better villain than Willem Dafoe's Green Goblin.(No offense to Dafoe, who did an awesome job). The fight scenes between Spider-Man and Dr. Octopus are choreographed beautifully from begining to end. Whatever mistakes director Sam Raimi made in the first movie he fixed them with this sequel. Because of his love for the Spider-Man characters he puts his heart and soul into the movie so it would be a crime if the Studios choose to film another sequel with a different director. Spider-Man 2 ranks up there with the best comic book movies ever. Get caught in a second web of fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Film of the Year! Best comic book movie ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spiderman on a world scale is arguably the most popular comic book character there is. Many polls have been taken and most of the time Spidey sits proudly, perched above Superman and Batman as the comic book character everyone loves. Generally in England we prefer Batman because Bruce Wayne has a kind of British sensibility and aura about him, probably because he is posh and well spoken, how us Brits are stereotypically perceived. In terms of film translations from the comics I thought the first film was definitely one of the best, alongside X Men 2, The Crow, Superman and Batman. It was a great film, full of action, drama, thrills and al made so effective because of the characters in it. Raimi has made the characters and their journeys the important thing of the two movies and it makes them not just good action films but good films. Spiderman was a great film and while the sequel could easily have gone the typical sequel suit and up all the action and make everything more spectacular and forget about characters to focus on spectacle, this goes the route of the first film. Simply put, Spiderman 2 is a film of pure brilliance and can now easily be named as the best comic book film ever made.Poor old Peter Parker went through hell in the last movie and this picks up pretty much near where the last one left off, with Peter unable to live the life he wants because of responsibility. He has several jobs to hold down, his studies at College and all this combined with the responsibility to the public as the cities vigilante crime-fighter. All of this while the one thing he really wants, Mary-Jane, is un-obtainable. The whole movie has you aching for Parker because you feel for him so much. The poor guy goes through hell and the character has real depth, the likes of which action films never ever have. He is a real person, and relatable, that is what made the character so popular to everyone since he first appeared eons ago. His best friend Harry is growing somewhat distant to him and Harry is driven by his hatred for Spidey and need for revenge. This tears at Parker so much as well. Harry also resents Parker because he makes money from taking pictures of Spiderman. Mary Jane has also been pining for Peter. She needs confirmation that he really loves her and she needs to know she can rely on him but when she can't she decides to get married. All this in conjunction with Dr Octavious who in the typical accident in his attempts to create a new super energy through fusion, ends up disfigured with 4 titanium arms welded to his spine and which control him. He is driven by the desire not to cause destruction and kill, but to finish his research but his maniacal state blinds him from the fact that this energy source could actually destroy half the city and in his attempts to get the resources needed he will rob banks, destroy buildings and kill. Parker through his stress and loss of enthusiasm for his job as city protector begins to lose his powers. He then calls it quits as Spidey and this causes a 75% rise in crime figures. This is all great stuff and soon Parker must try to regain his powers as he must save Mary-Jane from Doc Oc. There is a brilliant scene with Parker as a mere mortal. He spots a burning building and there is a child inside. The fire department can't do much but Parker runs into the building, he manages after a struggle and nearly killing himself, to rescue the child. It's an act of selfless bravery and he is commended for it by the firemen only to be told that someone was on the floor above and didn't get out alive. It dawns on Parker how special his gift was giving him an advantage over mortal men and women, he must use his advantages top help people and he knows he just can't sit by and let things like this happen, he could have saved both people from the burning building if he was still Spidey.The cast once again are superb. Toby Maguire was born to play Spidey, he is Superb. He gives a sensitivity and likeability to the role that perhaps casting more of a poster boy star would not have had. He's a great actor and that adds to the power of the film. Similarly Kirsten Dunst is excellent again as Mary-Jane. She brings warmth and natural beauty to the part. I was also really impressed with James Franco as Harry. His role is significantly extended in this film in terms of depth. Franco brings out the inner torture brilliantly, we see the first signs of a future insanity. Rosemary Harris is just excellent as Aunt May. She has nailed the role, plain and simple. Also to those who though that JK Simmons was excellent as Jonah Jameson and wanted more well you get it and his role is just as funny and much bigger. If you also thought that Willem Defoe was superbly villainous as the Green Goblin then you will love Alfred Molina as Dr Octopus. The cast really do add class to this. Also look out for Bruce Campbell as a snooty usher.The action is brilliant. The scenes are spectacular and as you would expect the effects are first rate. Raimi is a genius with effects. He really knows how to use them, he doesn't just put them in willy nilly and try to go for the coolest shots possible. He knows how to use them and combine them with the camera movement in a way that other effects geniuses like Peter Jackson and Jim Cameron can do. If you have also thought that Raimi has lost his raw edge and wackiness that he had in the Evil Deads and longed for full on Raimi style then you get it. This is Raimi unleashed. There are great references to Darkman and Evil Dead in this with P.O.V. shots and a lot more of Raimi's quirky style and humour. This film is not only dramatic and thrilling but it's also really funny and borders on slap-stick at times. Remember how well that blending worked in Evil Dead 2, well it's a combo that works superbly here. Also as ever Danny Elfman is the comic book score king. This is a great score.Overall this is almost certainly is and will remain the film of the year, easily. It's in the same ball park as how good the Rings trilogy was, it really is that good. Also look out for Stan Lee's cameo, it's priceless and had me jumping off my seat in applause. *****</fullReview>

Of course, I have always loved the angst ridden webcrawler. The writers gave me a whole lot of what I always loved about Spidey and a little at the end of what I always wanted. Fantastic effects, a Marvelous script (pardon the pun) and the sense to know when enough is enough. The movie races along through even the tender parts (very smart editing), without rushing things. Excellent timing, a little whimsy and a great setup for the next installment. Although, I think I would quit here - 'cause it just don't get much better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Holding no hopes what so ever for this movie, I walked into the theaters. I did not enjoy the first one at all in the least bit and would rather watch evolution take place or see water evaporate. But this was NOT the case with this movie. Though there are some scenes are a bit on the slow side they are redeemed by GREAT action sequences. The movie revolves around Peter Parker trying not only to deal with juggling a friend/family relationship, job and school but also with being Spider-Man. He looses his job, can't pay the rent and is only more discouraged when Mary Jane Watson, the love of his life, agrees to marry another man.The intertwining theme of Doctor Otto Octavius comes into play as well. During a demonstration of his latest work, everything goes wrong and the mechanical arms are fused onto him.As the movie opens, Peter looses his job, can't pay the rent and realizes that his spider powers are fleeting. When the Doc Ock situation occurs and MJ marrying another man, Peter decides to through in the towel? or the suit, rather. Doc Ock decides to recreate his experiment to make him stronger and to level half of New York. But in order to do so he must go back to the company that funded the original experiment to obtain a compound to run the machine? Oz Corp.Harry, still raw from his father's murder, decides to give the compound to the insane villain but only if he brings Harry Spider-Man? Alive.Spider-Man soon swings back into action when MJ is kidnapped by the Doctor, bribing Peter into bringing Spider-Man to him. Sam Raimi lets his inner horror movie maker show in the operation scene. Raimi, who wrote and directed the Evil Dead series, gives frequent camera shots and odd angles to give you that horror movie feel when the surgeons try to remove the mechanical arms only to be slaughtered.The movies peek is truly a triumph for Raimi. The scene really out did what could be expected for most movies. The train scene manages to throw so many different elements at you. With not only stylized action but also Spider-Man's facial exposure to those on the train.Though at times the movie's dialogue and scenes lag and acting is dry the movie is all around a great film. It may not be Hollywood gold but it sure is a precious gem.A- : The movie was great and had many twists in its end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I might have had high expectations since all of the newspapers are gushing about this one, but I was fairly disappointed. I was led to believe that it was a really good movie, not just a good blockbuster, which is what it actually is. Its not nearly as stupid as most summer blockbusters, so for that we can be somewhat grateful.However, the dialogue is truly terrible and corny. The love story is also all too predictable and stilted. There's absolutely nothing unexpected, and the plot involving Octavius is plain stupid.On the plus side, the action was well done, and left at a manageable level, not overwhelming the movie. It made some attempt at portraying real human beings even if they weren't that interesting. In the end though, probably a good compromise between 12 year olds and the rest of us.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In summary, I really enjoyed this movie. Others have said it before, but I'll say it again. It is probably the best comic book superhero movie to come around in a long time. The movie does a great job of relating the unlikely hero to the normal everyday person. I mean really, how DO superheroes pay their bills, right?This movie could have been a 10 except for a couple of things. One, some of the slow scenes were not necessary. Not that I have a problem with slow scenes in an action movie, but (for example) the entire scene with the next door neighbor and the cake was a waste of time and didn't add anything to the movie. Second, I agree with another poster that Kirsten Dunst does not elicit a tremendous amount of emotion. I could relate to Maguire's character, but not hers -- the feelings seemed disingenuous. And she played a critical role -- Peter was about to give up super-hero-hood for her, and I was never made to understand why she was supposed to be worth it.And OK, here's two other minor points that I'll just mention to be heard. 1) An elevated subway in New York City?!? I think the last el in NYC was taken down more than 50 years ago -- but I guess that scene wouldn't have meant much taking place underground. And 2nd, Aunt May's house being foreclosed?!?! What is an eighty year old woman doing with an outstanding mortgage? Didn't they save, didn't her hubby (RIP) provide for her, or at least have a life insurance policy? Did her crack habit force her to take a home equity loan? Yes, I can believe that a man can make spider webs come out of his hands and climb up walls, but I can't believe that this woman had a mortgage on her house at her age!I'll close by saying that this was a great movie, that I would recommend to anyone. It just wasn't 'perfect'.</fullReview>

In fact, this is the same story just told using different words. Why???I liked Spidey 1, no doubt it's one of rare 10/10 movies, but when you just repeat something it loses its magic, right? Why didn't they shift the story a bit? Why do we have to watch the same character's inner conflicts like in the first movie? --- SPOILERS --- SPOILERS ---Story goes: Mary Jane has a boyfriend, Peter feels miserable, the bad guy kidnaps Mary Jane, Peter has to save her... What movie is it? First or second? No one laughs at the same joke more than once. (Yes, I know people who do, and I envy them:-)What I'm talking about? I'll give you two examples of the best sequels I know (And can remember right now): Alien - Aliens or Riders of the Lost Arch - Temple of Doom. They are so much alike and yet so different. Spidey 1 - 2 are just so much alike. Remember how Hary found his father's hidden stuff? Scary, isn't it?Yeah, Spiderman 2 is a great sequel. However, Spiderman 1 was good enough to deserve more than just a sequel. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Firstly please excuse grammar + spelling, just knocking this out quick.Yuck, its a shame 'Mary' comes running out of the wedding at the end of the film to be with 'Spiderman' as its odds on she'll be in the next one. This is not good. This movie was at times like a chick flick. Mary (the girl Peter Parker likes) appears as a selfish, attention seeker that in all honesty Spidey should tell her where to go! wow she was an annoying brat - maybe she's a cast members daughter trying to get a break :)There was the usual action in the film at times (few and far between this 2 hour movie)the special effect were good (natrually for this day and age)but so were they in 'The Day After Tomorrow'The actor playing 'Dr Octo' was 'convincing' and acted the part well.As you might gather the 'lovey dovey' scenes cheesed me right off. This is mainly because I think the girl playing the part was lame in all areas. If I go to see a super-hero action film I expect to get that. People may argue that the scenes were needed to show that Spiderman is a human being with emotions. I argue that if 'I' was looking for realism (for example how the heck could spiderman ever change clothes in NY without being picked up on a CCTV at least once - if we are trying to be sold a true story) then I'd go for something a lot less comic hero based or sci-fi. Call me old fashioned but I want non-stop roller-coaster action for 2 hours and if it cant be delivered give it to someone who can. What next? Peter Parker spanking the monkey or Aunt May setting up a phone sex business from her new pad? please. no.The film conveniently sets itself up for the next episode which I personally wont be holding my breath for. It never seems to fail to surprise me that with all the money spent on some films and the brains behind them that all they come up with is an average movie. Well, that my pennys worth - saying that it'll probably be the No1 film this year with the way the advertising blows things outta proportion. Its a real shame. These superheros go back decades and decades (their our heritage!)- its a duty to show them at their best or don't show them at all just for the sake of $$??.One other thing,lol, there is a point in the movie where a girl shows Peter some kindness and gives him some choc cake and milk. I'm of the opinion that this was purposely put in by the makers humorously to show the duality of how the greater thinking public think. The girl (cake and milk) is everything that 'Mary' is not as she is humble, comes over as genuine and not self absorbed. Maybe most people will not even notice and just be carried away with the brainwashing that is. Maybe I'm the only one that viewed that portion that way, anyhow I'd go for the chocolate cake and milk girl everyday fo the week. regardless I'm pretty sure I know a decent movie when i see it and i did not see one here. byepeace. Realistically 6.9/10 for effortobtw - if your UNDER 18 u prob will dig this film lots :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Summer Movie of 2004</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WOW that was one hell of a good movie. It was way better than the first One, Don't get me wrong the first one was great . But the second one was Amazing. I was On the edge of my seat thought the whole movie. I loved the villain Doctor Octopus was cool very cool. But what I like the most was that Aunt May &amp; Mary Jane both know that Peter Parker &amp; Spider-Man are one and the same.Also I loved the elevator scene &amp; The I'm Back scene where he runs &amp; jumps into the air screaming "I'm Back !!!!!!!!! &amp; then he falls down into the ally &amp; says "My Back" &amp; the train scene was amazing!!!!!! Plus I pretty sure that Spider-Man 3 peter &amp; Mary Jane are going to get married now that she know. I can't wait for Spider-Man 3 !!!!!!!!!! I give Spider-Man 2 10/10 This by far is going to be the best Summer movie of the Year !!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I guess I've noticed some longtime comic fans ripping on this movie, saying it didn't follow the comics close enough. Very true, for the most part.I just don't see the sense in following the comics that closely myself. I think what they have done with the first, and now the second, are stunning. I've been a Spidey fan since the first time I picked up an early issue of Amazing Spider Man. I watched a wimpy Peter Parker grow into one tough super hero, go through his trials in life, about give up on being Spider Man, fall in love with Gwen Stacy, only to have her die at the hands of the Green Goblin. And his romance with M.J. I'm kind of curious on who they are planning for the third movie, with several references, such as The Lizard, Harry as the Green Goblin, Mysterio,(mentioned by J.J. Jameson) among others. Guess we will have to wait and see. I think Tobey plays an excellent Peter Parker, and Kirsten plays an excellent M.J. I am content with what they have given us, I will take it without a complaint. Excellent job done by all. Keep up the fantastic work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I might have had high expectations since all of the newspapers are gushing about this one, but I was fairly disappointed. I was led to believe that it was a really good movie, not just a good blockbuster, which is what it actually is. Its not nearly as stupid as most summer blockbusters, so for that we can be somewhat grateful.However, the dialogue is truly terrible and corny. The love story is also all too predictable and stilted. There's absolutely nothing unexpected, and the plot involving Octavius is plain stupid.On the plus side, the action was well done, and left at a manageable level, not overwhelming the movie. It made some attempt at portraying real human beings even if they weren't that interesting. In the end though, probably a good compromise between 12 year olds and the rest of us.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Surprisingly satisfying for the Raimi fan. The sequence where Doc Oc wakes up in the operating room is straight out of EVIL DEAD. The sound, cuts, and pacing are pure Raimi. Good to see it again after so long. One doctor even pulls out a chainsaw to defend himself! Bruce Campbell should've been cast for that part, though he did do quite well as the theater usher.As for the film itself, I enjoyed it. Much more so than its predecessor. Sure, it can be criticized as mindless or poorly acted. However, it's a comic book movie and vastly superior to the large array of comic book adaptation pieces of sh** being put out these days (is anyone really going to waste their time with CATWOMAN?). So, it was utterly satisfying to me as a childhood fan of spidey. Made me feel like a kid again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While I enjoyed this big-budget sequel very much, my inner-teenager who read The Amazing Spider-Man, Peter Parker the Spectacular Spider-Man, Marvel Team-Ups, and the old Marvel Tales re-hashes wonders one thing: Where's the chatter?That was the coolest thing about Spidey! He would get under his foes' skin with the constant wise-cracking. He was a joker, a motormouth. It was his relentless head games that made the action so sweet in the original comics! That's why I'm not digging the Tobey Maguire casting...the wide-eyed vulnerability should be giving way to the razor wit by now.Then there was this little issue (SPOILER warning!): Spider-Man has the strength to stop a runaway locomotive. Why, then, did his half a dozen punches to Doc Ock's face do little or no damage? Aunt May at least broke his sunglasses with her umbrella handle!Spider-Man pummels him to no effect? Huh? How's that work? Also, I cringed to see the web-slinger's "secret" identity thrown out to anyone who was ever curious. And that scene where he's lifted and passed overhead in the train car? Oh, brother.Don't get me wrong; I had fun with this movie. Raimi did some excellent work (the "Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head" montage was classic!). But those of you who read the comics as a kid or have enjoyed the recent Ultimate Spider-Man series will understand what I'm saying. Tobey is a decent Parker, but a listless crime fighter. I'd have cast Topher Grace (Eric Foreman from That 70s Show) as the wall-crawler. Geekier build, quicker comic delivery. And I'd have hired that Brian Michael Bendis guy from the Ultimate series to do the screenplay.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to admit, I'm somewhat of a Spider-man freak, and I also have to admit that, as much as I did like the original Spidey flick in 2002, I really thought that the visual effects were just disappointing. That was not enough to weigh down the entire film, however, and now, Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst and James Franco alongside Sam Raimi at the helm are back for Spider-Man 2. I went into this movie wanting to enjoy it. Wanting to eat it alive. When I left, I was positive that Raimi had delivered exactly what I wanted. First off, Spider-Man 2 is much more than a simple comic-book-turned-action film...it is a real movie. The first entry had Peter Parker trying to deal with these newfound powers while at the same time combating the menacing Green Goblin. In this film, we have Peter Parker going through a complex of whether or not he really needs to be Spider-Man while also trying to reveal his love for Mary Jane, pay the bills in the crummy apartment that he lives in, try desperately to be on time for any job and make sure that does well in college...oh yeah, and there is a newly created baddie who goes by the name "Doc Ock" rummaging through the streets trying hard to finish his once prominent project surrounding nuclear fusion and four mechanical arms that are impervious to extreme heat or magnetism. There is just so much to work with in this film as opposed to the relatively two-dimensional plot of the first. Spider-Man 2 doesn't rush the viewer into the Spidey-patented action. It eases the audience into this world where Peter Parker has become a real character with real problems (very faithful to the comics, if I may add). Peter Parker is experiencing a time when it feels like the world is crashing down around him. He feels that his love for Mary Jane and the relationship between them is waning and because of his split-responsibility as Spider-Man, he is late for everyone and everything that he needs to attend, including Mary Jane's starring role in a play. Meanwhile, through all of this stress, his Spidey powers begin to fail him and (I have to mention this) the audience is treated to one of the best scenes in the movie as Spidey is forced to take an elevator complete with the sarcasm of Hal Sparks from I Love the 80's. Doc Ock is a great villain and is not as forced as the Green Goblin was in the last film. Everything about Spider-Man 2 is fluid and flows exceptionally well and I was really impressed to see how much better the villain works as a side story than as a major wedge in the main plot. I would applaud this with all six of my arms if I were Doc Ock, but I am not, so I will have to settle for a simple IMDb.com review. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Holding no hopes what so ever for this movie, I walked into the theaters. I did not enjoy the first one at all in the least bit and would rather watch evolution take place or see water evaporate. But this was NOT the case with this movie. Though there are some scenes are a bit on the slow side they are redeemed by GREAT action sequences. The movie revolves around Peter Parker trying not only to deal with juggling a friend/family relationship, job and school but also with being Spider-Man. He looses his job, can't pay the rent and is only more discouraged when Mary Jane Watson, the love of his life, agrees to marry another man.The intertwining theme of Doctor Otto Octavius comes into play as well. During a demonstration of his latest work, everything goes wrong and the mechanical arms are fused onto him.As the movie opens, Peter looses his job, can't pay the rent and realizes that his spider powers are fleeting. When the Doc Ock situation occurs and MJ marrying another man, Peter decides to through in the towel? or the suit, rather. Doc Ock decides to recreate his experiment to make him stronger and to level half of New York. But in order to do so he must go back to the company that funded the original experiment to obtain a compound to run the machine? Oz Corp.Harry, still raw from his father's murder, decides to give the compound to the insane villain but only if he brings Harry Spider-Man? Alive.Spider-Man soon swings back into action when MJ is kidnapped by the Doctor, bribing Peter into bringing Spider-Man to him. Sam Raimi lets his inner horror movie maker show in the operation scene. Raimi, who wrote and directed the Evil Dead series, gives frequent camera shots and odd angles to give you that horror movie feel when the surgeons try to remove the mechanical arms only to be slaughtered.The movies peek is truly a triumph for Raimi. The scene really out did what could be expected for most movies. The train scene manages to throw so many different elements at you. With not only stylized action but also Spider-Man's facial exposure to those on the train.Though at times the movie's dialogue and scenes lag and acting is dry the movie is all around a great film. It may not be Hollywood gold but it sure is a precious gem.A- : The movie was great and had many twists in its end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERS (But don't worry, nothing could spoil this movie as it's already rotten!)I cannot in any way fathom the praise being heaped upon this pile of crap movie. I loved the original; it was balanced, exciting, witty, and romantic. Spider Man 2 was none of those things. A short list of the bad parts:- The villain had no motivation or explanation for his bad behavior- Peter Parker can't get any better employment than pizza delivery boy? He's supposed to be a genius. Wouldn't his buddy hire him at his mega huge corporation? - His aunt gets evicted and that's that. No further resolution or explanation. Did she end up at the homeless shelter? Maybe they could've had her go to one of those suicide clinics like Charlton Heston's sidekick in "Soylent Green".- Sudden new very unspiderlike powers. Wouldn't his legs have shattered when he was trying to stop that train? - No motivation or development whatsoever for MJ's romance with the astronaut (who just happens to be the newspaper editor's son). They seemed like they were together on a bad blind date.- No consistent visual style. The color palette and design were all over the map.The pacing was atrocious. We vault from action scene to boring dialog to painful unrequited romance.This has to be one of the worst flicks I've seen in many moons. Those responsible should be forced to watch "Hell Boy" over and over so they can see a successful execution of what they were apparently attempting.</fullReview>

I also like how Mary Jane Watson asserts herself on Peter Parker in order to save her love. Doc. Ock. was a wonderful villain and played the changing moods or dispositions so very well. As far as Harry Osborn, he's just one of those characters who will not change, and after the reappearance of the dead Norman Osborn, he is all but locked into the role of resurrecting Green Goblin now. One must remember that Peter Parker, with his spider powers, is still a real boy and different from other super hero's. I feel that the movie was very well done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best surprise in a long time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Generally in most cases sequels are just scams on making money and they generally disappoint fans of the first film. There are a few exceptions however. The Empire Strikes Back, Back to the Future part 2, the Indiana Trilogy, Lord of the Rings, etc etc. I would also like to say that I am a big fan of Sam Raimi. I grew up watching his Evil Dead series and all his other early works. Its weird how his counter part from New Zealand (Peter Jackson) had the same start and is now directing major blockbusters as well.Spiderman 2 is in every way better than the first film. The music stands out, the camera work pays tribute to Raimi's early works. And Raimi is not afraid to slow things down to build up the drama and story. At any given time I found myself in tears because of the subtext meanings of the hero myth. Particularly when spiderman is in the arms of all the people on the train. And when aunty talks about the importance of a hero to Peter.Several scenes feature the rapid cuts and tight shots that Raimi used in his older films. (Evil dead 1, 2 and Army of Darkness) Those hardcore Raimi fans know what I'm talking about. And yes rumors are true, there is a CHAINSAW. There is also a slapstick element that showed up a few times. For instance when parker went to bring in the pizza and he couldn't get the mops to stay in the closet. Also one can not forget the rather funny cameo of Bruce Campbell as the snooty doorboy. I wish they would let him play a villain! Bruce Campbell could pull something like that off easily. And for those of you that said the homages and cameos made the film too comical forget that the film is based off of a COMIC. Comics are supposed to make you laugh, cry, etc etc. It is a perfect drama that everyone should go see.There is quite a bit of CGI but it does not bother me one bit because the story is so rich. Also at times it was also breath taking. With the music and subject matter at hand the action sequences worked perfectly.The Danny Elfman score is solely responsible for making me cry. At dramatic points in the film his touch gave all the scenes a perfect feel that is traditional with his work. Fans will not be disappointed.I generally despise most modern summer action films because they are usually rushed and over hyped. Spidey 2 made me realize how much I enjoyed the first film and how much potential the third will have. Don't let us down Sam!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't name a single sequel movie that was better, or even came close to the original. This is the exception. I loved the first Spider-Man movie, but this one completely blew it away. By far, I think the best part of this movie was the conflict. For this reason, Peter Parker ranks at the top of the hero list. Every hero has conflict and struggle, but none so much as him, thus making him a true hero.Without going into too much detail, I'll just say that the first half of the movie portrayed this conflict perfectly, and really was able to put the audience in Peter Parker's shoes. Aside from the conflict, every character in this movie (particularly Peter, MJ, and Harry) played an incredibly genuine part. Each actor's personality was etched right into the movie, as if you were watching them in real life. Simply put, the acting was incredible. Every second of the movie had me in awe and on the edge of my seat. Well done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great in some ways, not so in others</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In summary, I really enjoyed this movie. Others have said it before, but I'll say it again. It is probably the best comic book superhero movie to come around in a long time. The movie does a great job of relating the unlikely hero to the normal everyday person. I mean really, how DO superheroes pay their bills, right?This movie could have been a 10 except for a couple of things. One, some of the slow scenes were not necessary. Not that I have a problem with slow scenes in an action movie, but (for example) the entire scene with the next door neighbor and the cake was a waste of time and didn't add anything to the movie. Second, I agree with another poster that Kirsten Dunst does not elicit a tremendous amount of emotion. I could relate to Maguire's character, but not hers -- the feelings seemed disingenuous. And she played a critical role -- Peter was about to give up super-hero-hood for her, and I was never made to understand why she was supposed to be worth it.And OK, here's two other minor points that I'll just mention to be heard. 1) An elevated subway in New York City?!? I think the last el in NYC was taken down more than 50 years ago -- but I guess that scene wouldn't have meant much taking place underground. And 2nd, Aunt May's house being foreclosed?!?! What is an eighty year old woman doing with an outstanding mortgage? Didn't they save, didn't her hubby (RIP) provide for her, or at least have a life insurance policy? Did her crack habit force her to take a home equity loan? Yes, I can believe that a man can make spider webs come out of his hands and climb up walls, but I can't believe that this woman had a mortgage on her house at her age!I'll close by saying that this was a great movie, that I would recommend to anyone. It just wasn't 'perfect'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>are you kidding me?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a huge marvel comic fan- i grew up watching X-men on Saturday morning cartoons and idolize superman. With that being said, Spiderman 2 was one of the worst superhero movies i've ever seen.Spiderman (the first one) was incredible in my opinion- it only strayed slightly from the true story in the comics, had a realistic ending (not happily ever after) and set up what should have been a killer sequel, with Harry avenging his father's death.Instead, the movie brings in a random villain and doesn't focus nearly enough on Harry's hatred of Spiderman. The script is cheesy and the story is silly- Spiderman using his super powers to deliver pizzas? Are you kidding me? The emotions portrayed aren't believable from any character and Kirsten Dunst's hair couldn't be a more putrid color. The movie was laughable at many points and I was tempted to just lay down and take a nap.After such an incredible first movie and set up for the sequel, I was incredibly disappointed by the story, acting and script. The concept for the movie was just not as good as it could be and I found myself cringing when the 3rd movie was set up. Please...make it stop.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Incredible was the only word to describe the latest installment in the Spider-Man series. This could possibly be the best super hero sequel. Unlike most movies that rely on star power and plenty action, Spider-Man actually has a story that keeps you glued to the screen. We see characters from the original film develop. And the ending of the film leaves much to mind about Spider-Man 3.One thing that it lacked was the pure evil of a villain. Willem Dafoe's Green Goblin gave Jack Nicholson's Joker a run for his money in the original Spider-Man. Alfred Molina's role of Doc Ock was good but not convincing. It didn't creep me out quite like Green Goblin.Spider-Man 2 was worth the $8.50 and my time.***1/2 out ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a triumph for everyone who has been complaining that 'no one has done a comic book movie right'! Spiderman 2 does it right - the action is better and better paced, the human elements are more complex and gripping, and the plot addresses Big Ideas without getting distracted from being a movie. The effects are great, the writing is solid, and the acting is also great. Molina is in fine form as Dock Ock, MacGuire has Peter/Spidey down pat, and the rest of the cast is as good as one could hope. I just hope that Spidey is as successful and long-lived as the James Bond franchise</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For once, here's a sequel that actually tops the original. "Spider-Man 2" is not only better than the first movie from 2002, it's one of the best movie sequels ever made. It features dynamite acting, writing, directing, and special effects. What more could you ask for?One of the strongest aspects of "Spider-man 2" on why it works so amazingly well is the story. This is an extremely well written movie, and what director Sam Raimi puts up on the screen is the best superhero movie since the original "Batman". Plus, he gets great acting from his stars, from Tobey Maguire as Spider-Man/Peter Parker to Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson to Alfred Molina as Dr. Octavius. Everyone puts on a show of absolute greatness, and it's great fun to watch. Oh, and lets not forget about the special effects and action scenes. They're top notch. "Spider-Man 2" is a must-see!***** (out of five)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to see SpiderMan 2, having heard reports that it wasn't as good as the first one (normally, sequels aren't!)...It's a strange thing under-expectations, as I absolutely loved it...in fact, I liked it better than the first one. Tobey Maguire was great, and sure the plot in general was a bit cliched, mad scientist and all, but the emotion and humour intertwined, made it a great movie experience. The acting all over was terrific, the special effects were magnificent, and it was no trouble to get caught up in the storyline. I gave it a 9/10. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie "Spider-man 2" in the theater today. It was pretty suspenseful in certain scenes. I was on the edge of my seat today. In this movie Peter Parker played by Toby MaGuire, is battling his ego whether or not he can continue to be "Spider-Man". Other conflicts in this movie is that he is trying to maintain the friendship with Mary Jane Watson, and his reliability with his jobs, and college. Peter Parker is attending a science experiment at building for a college assignment, when the man to be called Dr. Octopus's experiment goes bad, turning him into a super villain. Now Spiderman is the only one who can stand to up him. Overall this is a movie well worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Spider-Man truly is amazing. the best superhero movie ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>July 6 2004The wait is over, Marvel Comics has finally delivered Spider-Man 2 to us, and my, did they deliver. not only is this a rare example of a sequel outdoing its predecessor, but it is arguably the greatest superhero movie ever, at least tied with 1978's Superman: the movie. What makes this movie so great? It's Sam Raimi's ability to interseam style and substance. While most super hero flicks focus mainly on stylized action sequences and flashy special effects, this movie realizes there are human beings involved in this story. it acknowledges that Spider-Man is indeed a man underneath the costume. We witness his struggle to balance his private life with his public one. How does one manage school, two jobs, being in love and saving New York? The movie gets even more complex then that, but i only have so many words. Alfred Molina is also great as Dr. Octopus, my personal fave Spidey villain. The effects in this movie are even better than in the first Spidey, you'll be quite convinced it's Tobey swingin' around town. note the lifelike detail in the movements of Doc's tentacles. And though the action scenes are quite entertaining, the plot fleshes out the characters and situations so well that there are no lulls where you're wondering "when are we gonna see more action?" In summary, this is truly a movie for those who don't care for superhero movies. and i cant blame those folks. most superhero movies relegate their heroes to grimy dark worlds fighting grimy dark villains wearing a grimy dark costume, grim, emotionless fare. Not the Spider-Man franchise. These movies bring the excitement and sense of wonder of being a hero back to the movies. Instead of dark and grimy, Raimi wisely goes for bright and vibrant. 10/10 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>((WARNING: SPOILER))This movie is great. Besides all the kissing I give it Thumbs up. My absolute FAVORITE character is Dr. Otto Octavius. He is and always will be my favorite of all time villain. They picked a wonderful actor, Alfred Molina, and I will be sure to see other movies with him in it.I don't know WHAT makes me like him so much, but after the movie I have been looking up him and his character, Doc Ock. I've been looking at the trailers again and again, to please myself since I can't go to the movie a third time. I might be able to later.Anyway... I have been reading up on the character, and I do believe that he didn't really die. ((I did warn that it was a spoiler)) It says that he can be under water for a long period of time.... and besides... whatever happened to the Sinister Six?!?!?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Spider-Man 2" is a great, fun movie. The special effects are some of the best I've seen. I was especially glad to see that the effects of Spider-Man webbing his way around the city looked a lot less CGI-ish than in the first. When the action is going, then this movie is hard to beat in terms of pure fun. I also liked the bits of comic relief. The elevator scene with Spider-Man is great, but J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson steals the show. I laughed at just about every one of his lines. He is perfectly cast. But I have a few complaints that keep me from giving "Spider-Man 2" a perfect score:*Kirsten Dunst can't act. Well, if she can, then she sure didn't show it in this movie. She showed NO EMOTION whatsoever, and she and Tobey Maguire demonstrated NO CHEMISTRY at all. Whenever she'd spew out a "Go get 'em, Tiger" line, my eyes started rolling like a slot machine. I honestly couldn't have cared less if they got together.*There are too many close-ups of Maguire and Dunst. Personally, I don't think Dunst (Skeletor, as I like to call her) is attractive. You may call this shallow, but if they insist on showing extreme close-ups of actors, then I'd like to not be repulsed.*I thought Molina's PORTRAYAL of Dr. Octopus was very good, and I really like the character. Unfortunately, every time I saw Molina with his shirt off I burst out laughing. Couldn't he have gotten in at least a little shape? Seeing Dr. Octopus' man boobs flapping around isn't very intimidating. I laughed especially hard when he was walking around in his wife beater and white pants. What was THAT?? Doc Ock was cooler than the Green Goblin, but Willem Dafoe had a better look than Molina.*James Franco (as Harry Osborne) was underused. He's the best actor in this movie, and you know what, he actually SHOWED SOME EMOTION! Personally, I would've preferred Franco as Spider-Man (I know Stephanie agrees, believe me), but I guess Peter Parker is supposed to be a bit of a dweeb, and well, Maguire definitely fits that part. But Franco should've been given more to do. Hopefully he'll have a bigger role in the next one, and I'll pray that Dunst gets lost in the shuffle. Don't get me wrong; "Spider-Man 2" is a fast-paced, entertaining movie that I'd recommend to everybody. Not only will I add it to my DVD collection one day, but I also wouldn't mind seeing it at the theater again. But let's lighten up on the Maquire/Dunst close-ups, give Franco more to do, and please, somebody find Alfred Molina a stinkin' shirt! Rating: 4 (out of 5)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Granted, I will admit to not be an avid comic book reader, but I do have some Spider-man knowledge from the cartoon (the 90s one, not the MTV one) and things I've picked up here and there. Thus, I'm obviously not going to be very nitpicky with Spider-man (unlike I am with Harry Potter. Er... wrong movie.)Anyway, this is gonna be short, since I don't feel any need to defend such a great movie. Awesome action, great introspection, some lovely poignant moments, good laughs, and if you do have some background you may catch some subtle and not-so-subtle hints here and there about what the next installment may contain. Some people apparently didn't enjoy the ending, but I loved it; it balanced out the first movie's conclusion perfectly and left me completely satisfied.In short, don't miss this one! Totally worth the price theaters are charging these days for evening showings. Seeing a matine is a great bargain! Go! Go now!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPIDER MAN 2 has great sound design. Listen as our hero (Tobey "The Greedy Blue Eyed" Maguire battles Doctor O (Alfred Molina) and gets tossed into walls and through cars and breaks lots and lots of glass.In fact, the sound is a true offspring of the mother of all action flicks: T2 (remember Arnie battling the T-100 and the amazing advances Jimmy Cameron and co made).SPIDER MAN 2 has dazzling effects. Watch as he flies through the air and rescues the beautifully dressed Mary Jane Watson (Kiki Dunst). Or saves her from a tumbling automobile (noticing a fascination with motor vehicles?).Finally, SPIER MAN 2 has a tremendous cast and crew. Sam Raimi is a master of the visual eatery, while Maguire and Franco hold potential for an incredible show down.Unfortunately, like its predecessor, SPIDER MAN 2 has a stinky script. Words are forced and Harry Osborne's character (Franco) has nowhere to go. As a result, the picture is a box of empty popcorn: delightful on the outside but disappointing on the inside cause not a single kernel actually exists.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***Caution: Spoilers All Over the Place*** So Doctor Otto Octavius is going to demonstrate real live fusion to a small audience. To do this, he needs to attach himself to a set of strong, flexible, and artificially intelligent mechanical arms.These arms have nothing to do with the actual fusion, but he still needs them because they... you know... move around, and help him somehow or other.Unfortunately, the experiment gets out of control and he fuses the arms to his spine, causing them to (somehow or other) take over his brain. These arms feel bad about the failed fusion experiment, and they want to try again. They want to have a really, really BIG fusion experiment. God only knows WHY four mechanical arms should be so passionate about fusion, but they are.And that's how most of this movie is. Like the arms, it's pretty sweet to watch, but it's also extremely dumb, and you just have to forget about that in order to enjoy the movie. This is pretty hard, though, because there are a LOT of dumb things to forget about, such as Spiderman losing his powers because of self-doubt (huh?), approximately 70 people seeing him without his mask on and promising to keep it a secret (yup), etc. I personally had a hard time with all this dumbness, but of course it's a blockbuster superhero movie, so I should probably just shut up and enjoy it. It does have some great stuff in it: I loved the action sequences, as well as the good drama and acting (I disagree that Kirsten Dunst is a bad actress)... but I still walked out of the theater thinking, MAN that was dumb.6/10 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although this is by far the best superhero movie I have ever seen, it is also among my top ten favorite movies of the year. Tobey Maguire brings to this role a human vulnerability that I have never seen portrayed in a superhero. I watch him play Peter Parker/Spiderman and I think to myself "this is what MY life would be like if I had to be a superhero". I mean, really... you can actually sympathize with this guy. Alfred Molina was great as the brilliant Doc Ock who struck the perfect balance between madness and ultimate sadness. We sympathize with everyone in this movie, and combined with the heart-pounding action, it was very much the perfect package. This is definitely not your everyday special-effects/action extravaganza. The characters here have a dimension that is absent from others in this genre, and I hope it is a franchise that will continue. Tobey Maguire is really the only person I can see playing Spiderman, and I sincerely hope that his back problems won't be too much of an obstacle for him. Maguire is very much due for an Oscar nomination, and even though the Academy is known to snub the actors of special effects franchises (e.g. Lord of the Rings), I really hope that they will stop and consider Maguire in this one.Definitely see this movie. Definitely see it on the big screen. You will not be disappointed!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Predictable but....(some spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie reminded me of Superman 2 and in my case, that didn't stopped me from liking this wonderful sequel. I like Spidey 1 but I think this 1 is a lot better than that. The FX are better though I must say, it still needs a little work in some cases but overall, it was great. I also like how they developed the characters. The movie is predictable but how many people out there don't really know the story of Spidey in the comic books. (Some spoilers) I admit that I I don't know everything about Spider-man but I do know that MJ and Peter got married. It's also in the comic books that the son would replace the father as arch-enemy of Spidey so the movie was just being true to this points. As for the actors, I think they did good with what's given them and kudos to Sam Raimi for a job well done. I never thought that a man whose only movies I liked a little are the Evil Dead series could handle such a gigantic task and do it well. Now he already made 2 movies(both Spidey movies), I would love to watch over and over again. I would also like to say that I can forgive plot holes or unusual scenes in movies based on comics because if you read the comics, you'll find a lot more holes in there but we still love those. We love watching these movies to escape even for just 2 hours the harsh realities of life and Sam gave it to me. Now it's back to CNN.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sam Raimi corrects the mistakes that he made in the first part. He gives every character his/her own importance in this movie. That includes MJ. There is never a dull moment. After seeing part one I was thinking that Harry would be coming back in part 2 as 'Green Goblin'. Good that he did not. But there is an obvious hint in part 2 that this might happen in part 3. I wish that Raimi would come up with something better than that for the third part. 'Spider-Man 2' is a good movie. Tobey matches his role perfectly. Anybody wants to bet that 'Spider-Man 2' is going to beat 'Titanic' to be the highest grossing movie ever? 'Titanic' made around $1.3 Billion. I think 'Spider-Man 2' would not stop until it rakes in like $1.5 Billion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sam Raimi is a genius in the sense that Spider-man 2 did not become a sequel of bang 'em up action pack no dialog but a lot on killing sequel. This movie is very moving in the sense that each character has become more involved and developed especially Maguire's version of Spider-man. Raimi takes the character Peter Parker and shows a side that all audiences can identify with, which is a sense of sorting out oneself and the soul searching path we all have taken at one point or another to learn what our limitations are and what expectations we put not only on ourselves but the expectations of what others desire of us. The continuing loves story between MJ and Peter is very sweet and filled with angst and longing. The cast of characters are as equally moving and fill their rolls completely. As for the action in the movie it will not disappoint the fans of action genre. The train scene alone will make you cringe and think twice about riding public transportation. Stan Lee, I am sure, is quite proud and this is one of the best versions of his comic book characters. Much better than the X-Men. This is a definite must see sequel. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can't wait for a third.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not being as good as the first? I think not! Yes, the second movie is usually not as good, but this movie was different. Spider-Man 2 was amazing on many levels. First of all, the special effects were the perfect amount. We can all clearly tell that Spider-Man is computer generated, but it was well designed. Another thing that made this movie great was the transition from the first to the second. You didn't really have to see the first to understand the second and you don't have to know a lot about Spider-Man to understand it either. Although this movie was probably the best put together movie and well written movie I've seen in a while, the fact that Spider-Man's mask comes off in front of citizens in the train and even Marry Jane finding out wasn't the best move. Maybe the fact that Marry Jane knows that Peter is Spider-Man is foreshadowing for the third movie, but I just don't know if that was the best idea. It doesn't really matter if Harry knows because he's clearly going insane and will most likely become the Hob Goblin. All in all Spider-Man 2 is a must see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Outstanding! Movie-making at its best! The only thing more that could have been done with this film would have been to have Peter's best friend Harry (James Franco, also as Joey in "City by the Sea") hit on MJ. It would have been more fun to see MJ almost marry Harry rather than the astronaut. Of course all Spidey fans have figured out that Harry Osborn will be our next anti-hero and in Spidey 3, Harry will be the Green Goblin reborn.I'm really excited about the Oscar possibilities for this film. Special effects, Fx, and animation, for sure, and maybe even Raimi for directing.How can one choose a favorite between Spidey 2, Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, and Schreck?

		<fullReview>If you even liked the first 'Spider-Man', you're sure to at least love the next installment. 'Spider-Man 2' does everything a sequel is supposed to do. It's so good that it felt like the first movie was doing nothing but setting the stage for this one.Peter Parker is in college now, having trouble balancing his personal life with his heroic duties. He's still longing for Mary Jane but nothing he does helps that situation. His buddy, Harry Osborne has taken over his father's business and has just funded the fusion research of Dr. Otto Octavius. Obviously, things go wrong and Dr. Octavius becomes Dr. Octopus, a madman with four mechanical arms welded to his spine, calling for Spider-Man to save the day.Take everything from the first movie and upgrade it. This includes the story, action, special effects, suspense, and character arcs. This is what gives you 'Spider-Man 2'. Those looking for a good comic book adaptation will be far from disappointed, as this movie delivers everything a fan could possibly want. Make no mistake, for 'Spider-Man 2' is a summer blockbuster not to be missed by anyone. I hear that they're putting Venom and Carnage in the third installment, my favorite characters from the series, so I'll be sure not to miss that. But for now, this'll be perfect to tide me over.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll hold back to keep this spoiler free. This movie is a perfect comic book film.Generally speaking, the actors were superb, the story flowed flawlessly, and the special effects were top-notched.Speaking as a long time Spider-Man comic reader, this movie couldn't have been any better. Sam Raimi really captured the essence of Peter Parker. It was amazing to watch two decades of Spider-Man comics run the gamut in three hours. It was equally impressive how Raimi got MJ and Aunt May. There is no doubt that Sam is a a Spidey fan.This movie restored my faith in comic films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I believe that is the way Sam Raimi, must feel after witnessing the success of this movie in it's first few days.Since I was old enough to go to the movies by myself, I have never seen a film twice in the theater. I mean it's expensive $8 bucks for the film and then $10 more for soda and popcorn, but that all changed today. Some 20 years later I have found myself in a strange position, I have returned to the theater only a few days after watching the Midnight Screening to see this astonishing film again. I paid without feeling like I had wasted my money. I hope to return once more for a 3rd time. It is simply that good. Worth every penny.I don't know if Tobey Maguire or Kirsten Dunst turned in Oscar winning performances, but that's not why I went to see Spider-Man. The film was delivered in pure comic book form. Although you do not need to be a Spider-Man comic book fan to love this film it helps if you want to follow some of the inside jokes and why some dialog may sound familiar from old issue of Spider-Man.The film is graced by a great many things, fantastic special effects without over doing it, astounding performances from the entire cast, the right amount of comic relief to get you past the more somber moments, a super evil villain to set the pace and last but not least the beautiful and talented Kirsten Dunst who can keep your attention all by herself.It is not surprising that both men and women will love this film. Guys and kids will flock to see the greatest superhero ever swing through the best superhero movie ever, while women will surely enjoy the love story and moments that will bring a tear to ones eye. The only thing that was bad about this film is that it set the stakes to high and may be impossible to follow up this film with another squeal of equal or greater appreciation, I mean this truly is a hard act to follow. I have given a score of ten out of ten to movies that I can count on one hand from over 1400+ I have rated, but their is no doubt that this film gets that rating as well.In short this is the best film of 2004 and I doubt anything else will even come close.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>******WARNING SPOILERS*********Some major plot holes that I've noticed:1) If Doc Oc was so evil, why didn't he just torture Harry Osborn to get his Tririum instead of wasting time trying to hunt down and torture Spidey, Pete Paker, and MJ Watson? Obeying Harry was out of character for Doc Oc.2) Despite clear instruction from Harry Osborn to interrogate Pete Parker, Doc Oc hurls a car at him (into the cafe window while with MJ Watson). Doc Oc should have known that a dead person can't be interrogated. It was a spectacular scene, but again doesn't quite fit into the rest of the story.3) Why did Doc Oc die underwater? Did he die of old age? There was no explanation at all !Overall 9 out of 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What's the hype? (Spoilers below)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just finished watching Spiderman 2, and was left with one thought: "Eh". Not only was most of the storyline (that pertaining to Peter Parker and MJ's "relationship") monotonous and repetitive, a large portion of the action is just not explained, and/or is ridiculous. The 20-something son of a newspaper editor is an astronaut? Peter is struggling to get by when his best friend is a billionaire industrialist? Dr. Octavius is building a "fusion" reactor from an isotope of hydrogen which is used to power glow in the dark toys? AND he is able to create an AI, cybernetic organism that fuses to the bode via acupuncture needles? AND he hasn't already won the Nobel Prize for that accomplishment? What's the deal with Peter's skinny neighbor? She seems to serve no purpose whatsoever. Manhattan now has an elevated train? Peter is able to control his genetic enhancements via his emotions? What is he, an X-Man? And for Christ's sake, can someone explain the science behind halting a nuclear fusion reaction via dropping the whole getup into a river? I could go on. But then I'd sound as long-winded and annoying as this movie. All in all, this was an utter disappointment to both movie and Spiderman fans. However, if you like trite, teary romance flicks, this might be a good choice. Wait for the DVD...</fullReview>

I never get the sensation that a certain scene must pass right away, but enjoy every single one of them. Spidey 2 is what every summer flick should be.Yeah, the dialogue is not Ghost World, and it was never intended to be that way!!! Gee, have you ever read a Spider-Man comic? The dialogue is not that deep, but it's the facts and the movement of the whole concept that counts, and this movie has every single aspect of the comic book ?with it's minor changes to make it into cinema. Sam Raimi got a great kick a** movie, and we do care about everyone on Spidey 2. I really can't wait to see how the try to top this. If the don't succeed, at least there's Spider-Man 2.

		<fullReview>This movie is amazing. I saw it opening day and I have to say that it is even better than the original (which if you ask me is pretty hard.) I was afraid that it wouldn't live up to my expectations because it was a sequel and usually they are not as well written or as well performed as the first ones. This one made me think other wise. The script is one that lets you know the seriousness of the story and yet at the same time it gives you small little bits of humor that keep you laughing. The performances are such that the viewer believes that they are watching the real people. You can almost believe that these aren't actors but really Spider-Man having trouble with his life. The end is good and complete it makes you happy and yet sets you up perfectly for the third movie, which is planned to come out in 2007. You don't really notice the two hour length of the film because you are absorbed the whole time in the plot. It keeps you on the edge of your seats and yet at the same time it is very human. remove the action and you still have a film that would be worth watching. It was great.</fullReview>

You can tell that people really put their souls in the making of this movie and for me, it totally paid off.It isn't the best comic book movie though and there are things that probably could have been done different. For example, Aunt Mae's speech about heroes goes on way to long. And there also seems to be moments of humor that really doesn't belong, but they are funny.The story is great and I can't wait for the next installment of the Spider-Man franchise.</fullReview>

The storyline speaks very true of the comic book and sets the audience up for having true feeling about Peter Parker and his family. The only dull point of the movie is the fact that some of the CGI does look noticeably fake as with the last movie but there are other scenes where the line between the computer images and the real ones is unnoticeable . This movie is a must see and is a instant classic that will mark the highlight of this years films. I only hope the 3rd movie will be just as good as the first two.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a big Spider-Man fan, even though I'm sorta young but hey all fans come in different shapes, sizes and ages. For one I think that this is one of the best summer movies I've seen all summer. But I must say that the first one was way better. Only because we didn't know what was gonna happen next. Spider-Man 1 was a joy ride and even though we all knew he was gonna win in the end, that was a lot better than the second one. But I would enjoy to see this movie more than once and there's nothing holding me back from buying this when it comes out on DVD. All in all, this was a great summer movie. More so for a boyfriend/girlfriend thing...Are a movie to see with your best friend. But if u see it alone just make sure you sit next to one so you can talk about it over a cup of coffee.

		<fullReview>Wow... what a thrill to be sitting in a theater seeing this emotional but charming spidy rocks!! To be frank, I first expected it would little decline as the movie is a sequel of a smash hit heroic character in 2002. first thought there would be no more interesting scenes or screenplay except all actions which would be the same as containing in the first one. I was completely wrong !!! Rich and complex for many characters and the action scenes are extremely gripping as well as those sharp comedy that hides and jumps in-at a right situation-from time to time. The movie also makes us think logically for being a good man in society. Whenever Spider man puts on his mask, he has a duty to perform and it's very noble of him to spend almost his time helping others. This movie may seem to have only all fun but I think there is something behind it. With the line "great power comes great responsibility" lies in somebody's heart of being a responsible man. Parents who take their little kids to see the movie may admire and praise the spidy as he has set a very good example for them. Sacrifice is the key to the philosophy of the movie. After all ,Tobey earned it, Sam succeeded , the producer gains an immense amount of money and movie goers sleep safely under the spidy's arms.....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not really a fan of the Spiderman comic book, but I am familiar with Spiderman and I do believe the movie, Spiderman 2, has done justice to Stan Lee's creation. The story may have been adjusted a bit in order for it to be adapted onto the big screen, but the basic presentation of Spiderman was excellent. The director, Sam Raimi was successful at making the audience feel for Peter Parker. He did a good job at showing the contrast between the normal person, Peter Parker, and the hero, Spiderman. When I watched the film I couldn't help but feel for spidey when all the things in his life were slowly falling apart. Toby, on the other hand, was also very good at playing the web slinger. He was convincing as Peter Parker as well as spiderman (with the help of the great special effects of course). Alfred Molina also played as a formidable adversary for Spiderman and played a very good villain in the movie. The movie in general was great, with the right balance of drama and action to keep the audience glued to the screen. This movie is a must see for all spidey fans, and for those of you that aren't Spideman fans, brace yourself coz you soon will be. Can't wait for the third installment in 2007.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPIDER-MAN 2 (4 outta 5 stars)Yes, it's true... another sequel that turns out to be even better than the first one. The young cast (Toby Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, James Franco) are back from the first movie... as is the director, Sam Raimi. This time the action scenes don't look as clumsy as they did the first time. The CGI effects look a little less fake and the editing is a little tighter. Best of all, there is a story APART FROM the action and the fights! Peter Parker is not having the bets luck in the world... mostly, he decides, because of the burden of being Spider-Man. When his powers start to weaken he decides that maybe he needs to give up the whole superhero thing and concentrate on just being a regular guy. But, naturally, events take place which make that impossible... most notably the threat posed by Dr. Otto Octavius... Dr. Octopus. The movie has a great blend of humour, action and sentimentality... I confess that I got a little misty-eyed a few times. It's not all perfect... a lot of the close-ups of screaming bystanders look a little corny, the crappy alt-rock muzak they play at the end seems really hackneyed... also it's getting to be a bit of a stretch to have Aunt May and Mary Jane always at the mercy of whatever super-villain happens to be in town. Minor quibbles to be sure... the main problem with this movie is that it's such a vivid distillation of the Spider-man mythos that it doesn't leave much else to be said in any future sequels.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow!, I read a review somewhere on this film where a lot of people put it down but I thought I'd watch it anyway. What were these people on about? Was their a bad single second in the movie? When I had read these reviews then watch the movie I can only assume that the people slagging this film off in anyway either were too drunk, made the movie in their head before they watched it! (know it all's!), they died half way through and came back from the dead to use their pc or they are sad pathetic losers who have nothing better than to try make theirselfs feel and sound important or special, well special they are! :) This film was AMAZING!, I will say right at the end their was probs extra footage that probs was not needed but then with some of the reviews I read maybe it was! :O :D But in all its great to have really great movies to give us something to look forward to when we watch no so great movies :) But I want to keep this short and believe me this is short LOL for me that is but I want to just say if ya want a FANTASTIC! movie to watch then go see Spiderman 2, but I do have one really big prob, having to wait for Spiderman 3! :) But look if I have to wait 2 to 3 years to get as good a film as no.2 then I'll wait! :D and to all them who groan, I didn't think it was that bad! stop talking whilst the film is running and let others watch it! :P ALSO whats with people doing spoilers? no one listen to you in RL? This is mearly for people to give an IMPRESSION of a movie for others not a re-written BOOK of the movie! LOL :D</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*slight spoilers*Spiderman 2 is a decent sequel to 2002's spiderman, and if not for minor quibbles, would be an excellent movie. This is probably one of, if not the best, comic book adaptation in the history of film. Like the first movie, the way the movie is shot parallels the way comic books are drawn, witch scores major points for the movie with me. The dialogue is also faithful to that found in comic books, and this is were the movie falls short for me. In comic books, conversation between the characters doesn't have to be good; there is an ongoing and ever-evolving story to keep the reader interested. In a film however, were characters (that in books span entire volumes) are condensed into one appearance per film, and when that appearance focuses on the origin and destruction of the character, you better have some interesting dialogue to back up the movie. It's nice that the movie focuses on the "humanistic" side of a superhero, but many of the films scenes feel drawn out and almost redundant. OK, we get that Mary Jane and Peter Parker are inexorably doomed to be apart, isn't that what most of the first movie is about? The beginning is especially slow-paced. One major flaw of the movies is (spoiler) the scene in the cafe were the car fly's through the window. If Dr. Octopus were merely trying to scare Peter Parker, he would not hurl a car directly through a cafe window at him...it would more than likely KILL PETER PARKER THE MAN. The only reason he survives is because he is Spiderman. Unless Dr. Octopus somehow knows this, and there is no hint in the movie that he does, than this scene makes absolutely no sense, and exists just for the purpose of showing a really "cool" scene were spiderman flies through the window and Peter Parker dodges it. Actually, if I remember correctly, later on in the movie when Spider-Man reveals himself, Dr. Octopus says "Parker?." The person I saw the movie with said that the scene did make sense, because if he happened to kill Parker he would just go back and rough up Harry until he gave him what he needed. In that case, why would he go through the trouble of finding Parker just to kill him? Unless he knew he was spiderman, witch he didn't, and in witch case Harry would probably not believe that Parker was Spider-Man anyway.This one flaw really killed some of the movie for me, but if you don't mind errors like that, then this movie should be pretty fun for you and your family.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is amazing. I saw it opening day and I have to say that it is even better than the original (which if you ask me is pretty hard.) I was afraid that it wouldn't live up to my expectations because it was a sequel and usually they are not as well written or as well performed as the first ones. This one made me think other wise. The script is one that lets you know the seriousness of the story and yet at the same time it gives you small little bits of humor that keep you laughing. The performances are such that the viewer believes that they are watching the real people. You can almost believe that these aren't actors but really Spider-Man having trouble with his life. The end is good and complete it makes you happy and yet sets you up perfectly for the third movie, which is planned to come out in 2007. You don't really notice the two hour length of the film because you are absorbed the whole time in the plot. It keeps you on the edge of your seats and yet at the same time it is very human. remove the action and you still have a film that would be worth watching. It was great.</fullReview>

You can tell that people really put their souls in the making of this movie and for me, it totally paid off.It isn't the best comic book movie though and there are things that probably could have been done different. For example, Aunt Mae's speech about heroes goes on way to long. And there also seems to be moments of humor that really doesn't belong, but they are funny.The story is great and I can't wait for the next installment of the Spider-Man franchise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sam Raimi has done it again. He has made another excellent movie with wonderful writing, a sharp and extremely talented cast and eye popping special effect. The storyline speaks very true of the comic book and sets the audience up for having true feeling about Peter Parker and his family. The only dull point of the movie is the fact that some of the CGI does look noticeably fake as with the last movie but there are other scenes where the line between the computer images and the real ones is unnoticeable . This movie is a must see and is a instant classic that will mark the highlight of this years films. I only hope the 3rd movie will be just as good as the first two.</fullReview>

Alfred Molina also played as a formidable adversary for Spiderman and played a very good villain in the movie. The movie in general was great, with the right balance of drama and action to keep the audience glued to the screen. This movie is a must see for all spidey fans, and for those of you that aren't Spideman fans, brace yourself coz you soon will be. Can't wait for the third installment in 2007.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sam Raimi has done it again. He has made another excellent movie with wonderful writing, a sharp and extremely talented cast and eye popping special effect. The storyline speaks very true of the comic book and sets the audience up for having true feeling about Peter Parker and his family. The only dull point of the movie is the fact that some of the CGI does look noticeably fake as with the last movie but there are other scenes where the line between the computer images and the real ones is unnoticeable . This movie is a must see and is a instant classic that will mark the highlight of this years films. I only hope the 3rd movie will be just as good as the first two.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a big Spider-Man fan, even though I'm sorta young but hey all fans come in different shapes, sizes and ages. For one I think that this is one of the best summer movies I've seen all summer. But I must say that the first one was way better. Only because we didn't know what was gonna happen next. Spider-Man 1 was a joy ride and even though we all knew he was gonna win in the end, that was a lot better than the second one. But I would enjoy to see this movie more than once and there's nothing holding me back from buying this when it comes out on DVD. All in all, this was a great summer movie. More so for a boyfriend/girlfriend thing...Are a movie to see with your best friend. But if u see it alone just make sure you sit next to one so you can talk about it over a cup of coffee.

		<fullReview>Wow... what a thrill to be sitting in a theater seeing this emotional but charming spidy rocks!! To be frank, I first expected it would little decline as the movie is a sequel of a smash hit heroic character in 2002. first thought there would be no more interesting scenes or screenplay except all actions which would be the same as containing in the first one. I was completely wrong !!! Rich and complex for many characters and the action scenes are extremely gripping as well as those sharp comedy that hides and jumps in-at a right situation-from time to time. The movie also makes us think logically for being a good man in society. Whenever Spider man puts on his mask, he has a duty to perform and it's very noble of him to spend almost his time helping others. This movie may seem to have only all fun but I think there is something behind it. With the line "great power comes great responsibility" lies in somebody's heart of being a responsible man. Parents who take their little kids to see the movie may admire and praise the spidy as he has set a very good example for them. Sacrifice is the key to the philosophy of the movie. After all ,Tobey earned it, Sam succeeded , the producer gains an immense amount of money and movie goers sleep safely under the spidy's arms.....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not really a fan of the Spiderman comic book, but I am familiar with Spiderman and I do believe the movie, Spiderman 2, has done justice to Stan Lee's creation. The story may have been adjusted a bit in order for it to be adapted onto the big screen, but the basic presentation of Spiderman was excellent. The director, Sam Raimi was successful at making the audience feel for Peter Parker. He did a good job at showing the contrast between the normal person, Peter Parker, and the hero, Spiderman. When I watched the film I couldn't help but feel for spidey when all the things in his life were slowly falling apart. Toby, on the other hand, was also very good at playing the web slinger. He was convincing as Peter Parker as well as spiderman (with the help of the great special effects of course).

		<fullReview>... these adjectives are usually in front of the words "Spider-Man" on the comic books in which he stars, and they also are the way I'd describe the movie I saw opening morning at 12:01 AM and again today. It is indeed, as reviewers have been saying, better than the first one. From the opening credits, which I won't spoil for you, to the ending I was hoping for, the movie had me completely enthralled. The action had me on the edge of my seat, the humor had me laughing out loud (and at one point it was hard to stop), and the emotional scenes had me really feeling for Maguire's character. At one point, at the end, I actually started to shed a few tears. I am definitely seeing this movie again, multiple times in the theaters, and am looking forward to each additional viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you Don't like this, you Don't like movies.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was thinking... how can I top what Roger Ebert and just about every other critic has said about this film... and then it struck me. "If you don't like this, you don't like movies" or more accurately, "if you don't like Spiderman 2, what is it you seek from movies?" Seriously. Every frame packs emotional resonance of some kind. Whether it be dramatic, comedic or just the kind that gets your heart pumping. The film values its character's so much, that it never betrays them. There are no shortcuts. And despite what a lot of the (internet) critics of the film are touting, it's not really overly talky or preachy, and it's never boring. Raimi and Co. have masterfully let what's up on the screen do most of the talking, through images, looks, sounds. It's been said that to critique a film you must make a better one, I think that applies here. Spiderman 2 makes Spiderman look somewhat rudderless. The action this time packs more of a punch, the villain is creepier, the romance hits higher highs and lower lows, the pace is smoother, the comedy is funnier, and all the characters get just about the right ammount of screen time. In the first Spiderman we had a lot of odd fills (Aunt May at the Hospital), and scenes too misplaced to have meaning, (Gobby and Spidey meet on the building). Raimi looks to have come to terms with the source material's medium this time out, and he and his crew don't waste even a minute of screen time.Who here didn't just love that scene in the elevator with Spiderman and Hal Sparks? That sense of fun combined with the drama, and some fantastic performances by Tobey, James, Kirsten, Molina, JK and uh.. the woman who played Aunt May (sorry ma'am), made this a can't miss film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not only a Comic book Movie, but a movie of the conflict of human beings!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spiderman 2 was a fantastic and exhilerating movie. It has all the thrills and chills that movie viewers are looking for. The action and CGI is fantastic. Where this movie is different than all other comic book movies is that it dwells deeper into the conflict that super heroes go through trying to balance both a regular life and being a super hero. The sacrifices that have to be made to save people's lives. People can relate and sypathize with the character of Peter Parker as well. You actually feel for the characters in this movie. Go and see this movie, not once but twice. I give it a 10 out of 10. Also, to those who feel this movie is a 1, what were you on?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first "Spider-man" was kind of slow and boring. I was hoping "Spider-man 2" wouldn't be. And it wasn't. The action was much better, the dialogue wasn't as cheesy, the plot and villian were better, and I liked the ending better. Go see this except a non-stop, edge-of-your-seat adventure, filled with action, drama, romance, sacrifice, destiny, choice, and all that good stuff. Plus, it was extremely clean for a PG-13: brief mild language, one or two kisses, and stylized action/violence. So bring the kids--you won't be disappointed. Spiderman 2: 9.5/10 stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Contrary to popular opinion, Dr. Octopus was done perfectly...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>?By now (only a few days after the movie's release) I've seen many reviews saying that Dr. Octopus (Alfred Molina) is an underwritten villain.Anyone who knows the comics will know that he was done just right. Doc Ock was always a mercenary-type villain, hiring himself out to do others' (usually more powerful, social types) bidding, all the while working for an agenda of his own. This shows in the movie, when he strikes a deal with Harry Osborn (James Franco), which I wont spoil. Also, Doc Ock was never a complex character anyway ? he practically wasn't human. Always out for himself, always concocting some master plan for Spider-Man to foil. He never shows a shred of decency or human compassion; he is, basically, a robot.I was wondering how they were going to do that for the movie, because movies need complex characters, of course. And Raimi and the writers did it effortlessly: having Ock be a good man taken over by the AI of the tentacles attached to his body, so that he is, actually, a robot. It perfectly explains why the villain character is so `one-dimensional'.But the other half of him, the good, human half (Octavius) is a complex character. He's smart, determined, and a bit too prideful about his life's work, making him and the tentacles a perfect mix for a villain character. Sure, he's not a major part of the movie, but Ock was always a mysterious character that only left the shadows if he desperately needed something for himself, exactly like it is in the film.And a great film it is, too, may it rise on the Top 250, 8.5/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rated PG-13 for Stylized Action ViolenceGenre: Action/Sci-Fi/Fantasy/ThrillerStar Rating: ***** out of 5An excellent follow up of the 2002 blockbuster hit movie Spider-Man! As we follow up in the sequel we find mild-mannered, Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) having a hard time in his life especially with the whole Spider-Man and fighting crime thing. With the Spider-Man thing going on, it was effecting Peter Parker's life and his grades, his jobs and his relationship with Mary Jane Watson (Kristen Dunst) and his friendship with his best friend Harry Osborn (James Franco) and Mary Jane was about to get married to J. Jonah Jameson's son, John Jameson (Daniel Gillies). One day when Dr. Curt Conners needed Peter Parker to write a report he goes to get information from Dr. Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina) when Osburn Corporation has him perform an experiment with these mechanical arms in the experiment. But when the system in the experiment overloads the mechanical arms start controlling Otto Octavius making him become Dr. Octopus! Dr. Octopus decides to restart the whole thing from scratch and go after Spider-Man! Peter realizes that only Spider-Man can stop him, but of course, problems arise. Mary Jane gets caught in the middle, and Harry Osborn, who still blames Spider-Man for the death of his father, Norman Osborn, also the Green Goblin, wants him dead. Spider-Man will have to push himself past his limits if he's going to survive. The ending to this movie gets this whole dark moment coming in for Spider-Man 3! The first movie just showed how Peter Parker became Spider-Man and this movie just had all the good stuff happening! I also recommend X-Men, X-Men 2, Daredevil, The Hulk and Spider-Man 1.BOTTOM LINE: THIS IS A MOST SEE MOVIE AND SO IS THE FIRST SPIDER-MAN MOVIE!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well Spidey is back after two years and what a return. And poor Peter still has struggling to pay his rent , have a stable job and taking care of his aunt. Besides his love Mary Jane seems to have a new boyfriend and getting away from him. Well what are you expecting Spidey ? You put barriers at Osbourne's funeral two years ago.This movie is more about choices we made and doing right thing. And it is more about Peter Parker. He is struggling to survive as both Parker and Spiderman. Once he started his second career as superhero he is failing as Peter Parker. So he shall do a choice. Or events shall force him to make a choice. Tobey Maguire is playing Peter Parker , his unlucky or incompetent behavior brilliantly.Now we have a great new villain. Dr. Otto Octavious ( Dr Ock ) with his mechanical arms. He used to be a good guy in fact we still see goodness in him has not gone at the end of movie. But after he lost his wife in a tragic way and his implanted mechanical arms began to whisper nasty throughts in his head he became a meganomaniacal bad scientist who wants to complete his experiment regardless its consequences. Now Dr.Ock in comic books was a real villain with no consequence but in movie he was presented as a character who has the sympathy and almost pity of audience. Don't get me wrong. Alfred Molina played Dr. Ock magnificently. I just wanted him to be more villain.My last respects goes to James Franco. He is great as Harry Osbourne who is bent on revenge , thinks nothing else. There is even a little role of Willem Dafoe as Norman Osbourne. I hope we see Harry as Green Goblin version 2.0 in third one and a little bit more Willem Dafoe as Norman Osbourne.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this might contain itsy bistsy spoiler. I STRONGLY recommend this movie. Parents, you want your kids to see this movie. It has a relevant and wonderful moral. Even if you're ultra-conservatives, this movie has much less objectionable content than the comicNow, the review. We got our heroine/hero, it's a "growing-up" movie, hero/heroine lose self confidence/identity, lose power, shock comes causing hero/heroine to finally understand true self identity, hero/heroine gain power back and saves the day. But truly, even though Miyazaki &amp; Ghibli are great with plot and character development, Spiderman 2 is superior for it's more relevant and closer to home (it's at home actually) OK, maybe it's not Kiki afterall. As already mentioned by others, this movie is EXCELLENT, which means the plot is believable, great character development, choice of soundtrack, flawless special effect, believable villain, some humor, and a righteous message. Unlike blade, hulk, daredevil, etc, our Spiderman is just like our everyday ordinary guy, making it very easy for the audience to relate to his struggle, confusion, and resolution. We follow and feel along as Peter learns he has a choice afterall, and finally receives his aunt powerful message. "To be right, sometime we must give up what we want, even our dreams," how true, there's a hero inside all of us.Now if I can just hope for the best IMHO, please, please, Venom on Spiderman 3 (Venom can take goblin out in the first 20 min) and keep Tobey in. I'm not sure if the movie could cover Venom storyline like the comic, but after seeing Spidey 1 and 2, I'm rest assured it'd be just great.With great power, comes great responsibility</fullReview>

Honestly, I enjoyed it more and I would see it again.In the beginning of the movie, it showed that Peter worked at Joe's Pizza, but got fired, he's failing his college classes and he's slacking off on his job at the Daily Bugle. Suddenly, the love of his life, Mary Jane Watson decides to get married and Harry Osborn has his mind on only killing Spiderman. Peter Parker only wants to have a normal life, so he quits.Peter later thinks that New York still needs a hero, so he decides to become Spiderman again. What happens next?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent job Sam.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sam Raimi did an excellent job directing and I'm thrilled to hear he's going to direct the third. He combined comedy, complex character development, and action that surpasses the first movie by far.There were some stylistic references that I laughed at. I wish I had seen this with future the roomie because he's a huge Army of Darkness/Evil Dead fan (sam directed those). There were at least two Evil Dead cameos that I caught. I felt kinda silly for laughing though, because nobody else around me seemed to catch on. I also found myself laughing when "Doc Ock" would grab a woman and she'd let out the blood-curdling, king-kong-like scream. There was a lot of comedy in the oddest places. Once Peter Parker decided to put away the spidey costume and focus on his personal life, there was a scene where he's walking through the park, sun shining, girls smiling -- while B.J. Thomas' "Raindrops keep falling my head" plays in the background. At the end of the sequence, there's a stop-frame on Peter smiling and looking at the camera. Very retro. The audience ate it up.The few action scenes packed such a punch that they weren't missed during the story-driven sections of the film. But when there was action, I was on the edge of my seat. The antagonist, Doctor Octopus (Octavius), was such a better character than the Green Goblin of the first movie for a few reasons: better acting, more humanistic character traits, and less time on screen. The Green Goblins alter-ego wasn't the most holy business man and the viewer really doesn't care for him. Before before being taken over by artificially-intelligent arms, Doctor Octavius was a philosopher and a kind and loving man. I do have one criticism on him, however. There was a hospital scene where a doctor was using a buzz-saw to try and cut off the tentacles (another reference to Evil Dead). After the tentacles took retribution on the doctors and nurses, Octavius wakes up and realizes what has happened. He raises his hands in the air and cries out "Nooo!!!" and the arms simultaneous "screech" upward.... I realize this movie is based off a comic book, but this was just silly. In fact, I think I laughed out loud. Before the outcry, the tentacles and Octavius are viewed as two separate characters, but after this point they have some sort of single-mindedness. I realize the need to convince the audience of this union, but I think there could've been a better way to do it.I didn't expect the plot to be as complex as it was. When we weren't watching action, peter parker was dealing with personal problems. Peter loses his job, is behind in bills, and is struggling in class. He has little time to devote to friends and as a result, they are losing interest in him. Mary Jane, frustrated because Peter doesn't seem to care for her, decides to move on and find a husband. Harry Osborne becomes increasingly frustrated with Peter for refusing to help Harry gain revenge for his father's death. And to top it off, Peter admits his responsibility for his Uncle's death to Aunt May and she becomes angry with him. Many smaller characters are introduced, but not elaborated on, to please the comic-book fanboys. Doctor Connors, "The Lizzard", is introduced as Peter's teacher. Jameson junior (can't remember his first name), the astronaut who would eventually become Venom, is also introduces as Mary Jane's fiance. There is still plenty of room for a few more sequels. And it seems there will be plenty as old characters are drawn out (Harry finds his father's stash of Green Goblin supplies).All in all, it was a blast. I wasn't a fan of the first movie but I now see myself buying both when the second is released on DVD.</fullReview>

Spiderman seemed vulnerable and you actually feared for his safety which is uncommon for a superhero. I thought the villain was a strong foe for spidey and ties nicely with all the scientific story lines so far. His relationship with MJ ( I don't like that nick name) was good but not great. You felt they were destined to be together and at times rooted for them but this movie alone didn't make me feel this strongly. Maybe i needed to see the first one to refresh my memory. I do like Kirsten Dunst in the role as the girl next door who is his dream girl but not totally out of his league.Overall I enjoyed this movie and recommend it.8.5/10-sahbidee</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Comedy, romance and action. What more can you ask from the latest installment of the Spiderman movies. Maguire's portrayal of the cursed hero is endearing and often sad as he battles on through his dual identity. Doing laundry (badly) and complaining about the comfort of his Spidey suit allow you to see just how human a superhero can be. Kirsten Dunst and Tobey Maguire's on screen chemistry grows throughout the film providing a touch of romance and it is not too difficult to become sympathetic with the movie's main villain. With special effects light years ahead of those used in the first, Spiderman 2 is the best film this summer. The ending is expected but sets up the third installment and I for one, hope the entire cast return.</fullReview>

We follow and feel along as Peter learns he has a choice afterall, and finally receives his aunt powerful message. "To be right, sometime we must give up what we want, even our dreams," how true, there's a hero inside all of us.Now if I can just hope for the best IMHO, please, please, Venom on Spiderman 3 (Venom can take goblin out in the first 20 min) and keep Tobey in. I'm not sure if the movie could cover Venom storyline like the comic, but after seeing Spidey 1 and 2, I'm rest assured it'd be just great.With great power, comes great responsibility</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitely more laughs and better than the first</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I honestly thought that this sequel was definitely better than the first. It had a little more comedy and it showed the real life decisions of Peter Parker and Spiderman. Honestly, I enjoyed it more and I would see it again.In the beginning of the movie, it showed that Peter worked at Joe's Pizza, but got fired, he's failing his college classes and he's slacking off on his job at the Daily Bugle. Suddenly, the love of his life, Mary Jane Watson decides to get married and Harry Osborn has his mind on only killing Spiderman. Peter Parker only wants to have a normal life, so he quits.Peter later thinks that New York still needs a hero, so he decides to become Spiderman again. What happens next?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent job Sam.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sam Raimi did an excellent job directing and I'm thrilled to hear he's going to direct the third. He combined comedy, complex character development, and action that surpasses the first movie by far.There were some stylistic references that I laughed at. I wish I had seen this with future the roomie because he's a huge Army of Darkness/Evil Dead fan (sam directed those). There were at least two Evil Dead cameos that I caught. I felt kinda silly for laughing though, because nobody else around me seemed to catch on. I also found myself laughing when "Doc Ock" would grab a woman and she'd let out the blood-curdling, king-kong-like scream. There was a lot of comedy in the oddest places. Once Peter Parker decided to put away the spidey costume and focus on his personal life, there was a scene where he's walking through the park, sun shining, girls smiling -- while B.J. Thomas' "Raindrops keep falling my head" plays in the background. At the end of the sequence, there's a stop-frame on Peter smiling and looking at the camera. Very retro. The audience ate it up.The few action scenes packed such a punch that they weren't missed during the story-driven sections of the film. But when there was action, I was on the edge of my seat. The antagonist, Doctor Octopus (Octavius), was such a better character than the Green Goblin of the first movie for a few reasons: better acting, more humanistic character traits, and less time on screen. The Green Goblins alter-ego wasn't the most holy business man and the viewer really doesn't care for him. Before before being taken over by artificially-intelligent arms, Doctor Octavius was a philosopher and a kind and loving man. I do have one criticism on him, however. There was a hospital scene where a doctor was using a buzz-saw to try and cut off the tentacles (another reference to Evil Dead). After the tentacles took retribution on the doctors and nurses, Octavius wakes up and realizes what has happened. He raises his hands in the air and cries out "Nooo!!!" and the arms simultaneous "screech" upward.... I realize this movie is based off a comic book, but this was just silly. In fact, I think I laughed out loud. Before the outcry, the tentacles and Octavius are viewed as two separate characters, but after this point they have some sort of single-mindedness. I realize the need to convince the audience of this union, but I think there could've been a better way to do it.I didn't expect the plot to be as complex as it was. When we weren't watching action, peter parker was dealing with personal problems. Peter loses his job, is behind in bills, and is struggling in class. He has little time to devote to friends and as a result, they are losing interest in him. Mary Jane, frustrated because Peter doesn't seem to care for her, decides to move on and find a husband. Harry Osborne becomes increasingly frustrated with Peter for refusing to help Harry gain revenge for his father's death. And to top it off, Peter admits his responsibility for his Uncle's death to Aunt May and she becomes angry with him. Many smaller characters are introduced, but not elaborated on, to please the comic-book fanboys. Doctor Connors, "The Lizzard", is introduced as Peter's teacher. Jameson junior (can't remember his first name), the astronaut who would eventually become Venom, is also introduces as Mary Jane's fiance. There is still plenty of room for a few more sequels. And it seems there will be plenty as old characters are drawn out (Harry finds his father's stash of Green Goblin supplies).All in all, it was a blast. I wasn't a fan of the first movie but I now see myself buying both when the second is released on DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good sequel.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wasn't expecting that much from this sequel and as a result I found myself enjoying it. Spiderman seemed vulnerable and you actually feared for his safety which is uncommon for a superhero. I thought the villain was a strong foe for spidey and ties nicely with all the scientific story lines so far. His relationship with MJ ( I don't like that nick name) was good but not great. You felt they were destined to be together and at times rooted for them but this movie alone didn't make me feel this strongly. Maybe i needed to see the first one to refresh my memory. I do like Kirsten Dunst in the role as the girl next door who is his dream girl but not totally out of his league.Overall I enjoyed this movie and recommend it.8.5/10-sahbidee</fullReview>

Action fans will enjoy it a lot. 3. A love story between Mary Jane and Peter Parker, everyone loves a good love story. 4. Comedy was in it, everyone likes a movie with some jokes in it. 5. A good ending, all good movies have a good ending, and this one sure did.So you see Spiderman 2 had everything, this is definitely the best movie of the year, either this or Lord of the Rings. Spiderman 2 will always be a classic, and I am sure we will see a couple of more spiderman movies in the upcoming future. I can't wait.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than the first!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Comedy, romance and action. What more can you ask from the latest installment of the Spiderman movies. Maguire's portrayal of the cursed hero is endearing and often sad as he battles on through his dual identity. Doing laundry (badly) and complaining about the comfort of his Spidey suit allow you to see just how human a superhero can be. Kirsten Dunst and Tobey Maguire's on screen chemistry grows throughout the film providing a touch of romance and it is not too difficult to become sympathetic with the movie's main villain. With special effects light years ahead of those used in the first, Spiderman 2 is the best film this summer. The ending is expected but sets up the third installment and I for one, hope the entire cast return.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rated PG-13 for Stylized Action ViolenceGenre: Action/Sci-Fi/Fantasy/ThrillerStar Rating: ***** out of 5An excellent follow up of the 2002 blockbuster hit movie Spider-Man! As we follow up in the sequel we find mild-mannered, Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) having a hard time in his life especially with the whole Spider-Man and fighting crime thing. With the Spider-Man thing going on, it was effecting Peter Parker's life and his grades, his jobs and his relationship with Mary Jane Watson (Kristen Dunst) and his friendship with his best friend Harry Osborn (James Franco) and Mary Jane was about to get married to J. Jonah Jameson's son, John Jameson (Daniel Gillies). One day when Dr. Curt Conners needed Peter Parker to write a report he goes to get information from Dr. Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina) when Osburn Corporation has him perform an experiment with these mechanical arms in the experiment. But when the system in the experiment overloads the mechanical arms start controlling Otto Octavius making him become Dr. Octopus! Dr. Octopus decides to restart the whole thing from scratch and go after Spider-Man! Peter realizes that only Spider-Man can stop him, but of course, problems arise. Mary Jane gets caught in the middle, and Harry Osborn, who still blames Spider-Man for the death of his father, Norman Osborn, also the Green Goblin, wants him dead. Spider-Man will have to push himself past his limits if he's going to survive. The ending to this movie gets this whole dark moment coming in for Spider-Man 3! The first movie just showed how Peter Parker became Spider-Man and this movie just had all the good stuff happening! I also recommend X-Men, X-Men 2, Daredevil, The Hulk and Spider-Man 1.BOTTOM LINE: THIS IS A MOST SEE MOVIE AND SO IS THE FIRST SPIDER-MAN MOVIE!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent. (Spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original movie was good - fun, silly in the right places, decent action.But, for all of that, I always felt the original movie was more about the Green Goblin than Spidey. However, it was a nice, tight package that, had it not performed as well as it had wouldn't need a sequel.However, it did do well, and now we have a sequel. And this one is different. So very different.Not only does Raimi up the camp level (Peter acting out a day to "Raindrops Keep Fallin' on my Head," in hilarious nod to "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid") in order to give us some humor in a movie that, frankly, is not going to be dealing with funny issues: Harry's drinking himself to ruin, obsessed with finding his father's "killer;" MJ is not content with waiting for Peter and, to add insult to injury, she's going to marry JJ's son; Aunt May's house is going to be foreclosed on; Octavious's miscalculated experiment, one that will benefit everyone on the planet, has led to the death of his wife and his being driven mad when the tentacles fuse; and, finally, Peter can't reliably bring in money, is in danger of failing his classes, and is seriously second-guessing himself because of things happening around him.Spidey has always been the most human of superheroes. I remember, when I was a kid, reading a storyline in the comics with Dr. Ock and Spidey have it out on the rooftops and Spidey has a serious cold, has lost his mask and is wearing a cheap, costume store version (with, mind you, no lenses, so his eyes are visible) that he can't breathe through. All he really wanted to do was crawl back into bed and rest... but Ock wasn't going to go away until Spidey makes him.Thus, this movie is about the one issue that we all have to deal with in life: power and responsibility go hand-in-hand. You cannot have one without the other, and Peter has to learn that in this movie. And he does. The movie's main theme is that, sometimes, you have to let go of your dreams. Eventually, you have to be an adult and admit that you can't have it all. No one is saying they like it, but that is life - even for a superhero.The performances in the movie are strong, even Kirsten Dunst's (I've seen some complaints about her recently). Dunst plays MJ the way she has to be played: early 20's, wants Peter but is constantly put off by him, so she isn't going to wait... or is she? The bewilderment we see from MJ, that does become resolve by the end of the movie, is understandable and needed. Harry's decent into madness is impressive... so much so that I almost didn't need him to see Norman at the end of the movie (but that was an excellent touch and a nice cameo to tie to two movies almost perfectly). Octavious, with Molina having to act as both Otto and the tentacles' AI, makes so much sense. He was an excellent choice for the character.As for the plot construction of the movie: it very clearly set up as the second movie of a trilogy. That's why the end is anti-climatic - because this storyline is not over. As MJ watches Spidey swing off to save the day at the end of the movie, I remembered Luke and Leia watching the Millennium Falcon take off at the end of ESB. The audience knows of a lurking menace (Harry finding his father's Green Goblin stash hearkening the Hobgoblin in the next movie), and the secret of who Spidey is is out to MJ and Harry. Of course, we've now seen Curt Connors ( who, in the comics, is the Lizard) on screen, and John Jameson (again, in the comics, is the Man-Wolf), so the set-up for the next movie is clear: Spidey will have to defend himself against Harry. He will have to use all of his power to do it... and there could be two other villains floating around in the background.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What made Peter Parker/Spider-Man so interesting is that he was a superhero with everyday problems, that is why some of the comic book readers can relate to him so well. The movie takes place with Peter Parker(Tobey Maguire) who has trouble keeping a job, his grades in college are declining, and has trouble keeping up with Mary Jane Watson(Kirsten Dunst). And why, because he is off saving the city from criminals has the web slinging Spider-Man. The pressure of it all begins to catch up with Peter Parker and decides to retire from being Spider-Man. Meanwhile Dr. Otto Octaivus(Alfred Molina) experiment with fusion and mechanical arms go awry. And becomes Dr. Octapus. And begins to cause mayhem in the city. Will Peter stop him in time? A truly great superhero film. It really shows that being a superhero is'nt fun and games at all. James Franco, Kirsten Dunst, and Rosemary Harris(Aunt May) all give awesome performances. But it is Tobey Maguire's performance that was good he makes it allmost tearjerky. So does Alfred Molina has the villianous and tourterd Doc Oct, he was almost has memorable Willem Dafoes Green Goblin.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>what a tangled web we weave</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After years of moronic Hollywood action movies, when you go to a summer blockbuster these days you're simply hoping to be only mildly disappointed instead of grossly irritated by the proceedings. So it comes as a joyous surprise to discover that Spiderman 2, against all expectations, is a smart, funny and exhilarating movie that takes us back to when good movies made money, too.Like Raiders of the Lost Ark and Jaws, Spiderman 2 manages to combine a compelling action plot with good writing, sharp acting and assured visual film-making. Even the love story, usually the squirmingly-bad part of big summer movies, works like a charm. Director Sam Raimi puts together action scenes that are soaring, operatic tributes to Spiderman's comic book roots, yet at the same time have the grit and grime of reality, as slabs of rusty metal, shards of glass, and 2-ton taxicabs all come flying through the air at our web-slinging hero. Suffice to say that the Matrix directors could learn a thing or twenty from watching this movie.In an era when a lot of Hollywood movies have an almost fascist edge to them, with superhuman, square-jawed heroes dispensing one-dimensional villains and weakness with bare fists and bad attitudes, it is refreshing to see Spiderman's alter ego Peter Parker fully developed as a lovable schlub who can't even hold down a job delivering pizzas in his "real" life. Raimi's first act is as tightly constructed, and as enjoyable, as a Billy Wilder script, as Parker stumbles from one bad circumstance to another, rings under his eyes from staying out late fighting crime, flunking out of college, and late on his rent. Tobey Maguire is Jack Lemmon in "The Apartment", with a night job as a superhero. It's great fun and wonderfully executed.Likewise Alfred Molina's villainous Dr. Otto Octavius and his wife (played by Donna Murphy) are cleverly cast as uber-cosmopolitan, T.S. Eliot-reading intellectuals, whose liberal idealism runs amok when the Dr.'s scientific ambitions get the best of him. It's funny and compelling at the same time, and the cybernetic contraption that Octavius welds to himself, however cartoon-like, is considerably creepier than similar devices that pop up in "darker" movies. Indeed, the scene where the wicked sprites in the Doctor's machine sway him from good to evil with their impeccable (but silent) reasoning is a brilliant Shakespearean flourish, like Macbeth being worked into a lather by the witches of the Scottish moors.The battle Raimi sets into motion between his awkward hero and his romantic villain spins its own web, at the center of which lies a solution not born of violence, but of conscience. Ultimately Raimi turns Spiderman's flights of adventure through the city into a kind of lonely art, a physical release from Peter Parker's limbo, his alienation, and post-adolescent angst. It's hard to think of another superhero movie where you get such a charge out of watching the character fly, run or, here, even fall on his face. Raimi has made Spiderman human, vulnerable, and funny. The movie's best scene may be when Parker, suffering from a kind of superhero "performance anxiety", goes to a doctor. "I've been having this dream... where I'm Spiderman..." he tells the M.D. "Oh, so you're Spiderman?" the doctor asks wryly. "In my dream," Parker insists, then, growing fidgety: "Actually, it's not my dream, it's a dream a friend's been having." Spiderman 2 is the dream that Sam Raimi's been having, and it's the kind of movie summers were made for. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>X-2 and Superman 1 were the best superhero movies I had ever seen. I had gone into this movie with extremely high expectations and this movie exceeded them. This movie was awesome in every aspect. My friends and I kept discussing how the characters had so much more depth. The humans felt more human, and the heroes felt more heroic. You got to feel for their particular plights and this movie was excellent. It is the kind of movie you want to see in theaters. As I left the movie, I hadn't felt so satisfied with a movie since LOTR:ROTK. The action and plot are all excellently driven. And, what I liked most, the comedy was awesome! Since the comedy wasn't extremely blatant, yet extremely smart, I loved it! This is THE summer movie of 2004 (though other movies like King Arthur or The Village haven't come out). Spider Man 1 was the epitome of summer movies. The average to above average movie (along with Pirates of The Carribbean), but Spider Man 2 was one of the best summer movies I have ever seen.

		<shortDescription>With great Power, comes great Responsibility</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This seems to be the mantra from which Raimi has made this the second installment of Spiderman. Great power, for Raimi has once again made a fantastic film. Breathtaking special effects and great performances abound. But also great responsibility to appease the producers and merchandise moguls who regard spiderman as a franchise not a film. This great responsibility is perhaps reflected in the film where spiderman is frustrated and (spoiler) sometimes loses his powers. This does not stifle the production but does affect Raimi's freedom to eschew clich and shake up the lucrative formula. I would the compare this film to two other sequels: Superman 2 and Matrix Reloaded. Superman 2 because of its offbeat zest of humour and oddball characters( and lois lane is like and rhymes with Marty Jane) . Matrix Reloaded for the eyepopping action and the undercurrent(much stronger in Reloaded) that this is a stop gap to revive the franchise in peoples minds before the next installment.(pretty Big Spoiler) This feeling is no more apparent than the end. Instead of leaving the Spidey-Mary Jane romance unrequited we have to endure a cringe worthy Runaway Bride style sequence where MJ, in resplendent white, runs to the arms of her beloved. In trying to spin a web over not really that loose ends Raimi gets entangled. (Spoiler, sorry) The ending, of spidey swinging through the Manhattan skyline whooping with euphoria, reveals a shortcoming in the super hero genre. for one, its exactly the same as the first one. Does this means that Spidey will perpetually swing along the same routes to the end of his days. In many plot elements, the films are very similar. and another question, when the novelty powers wear off will Spidey's character be inert? On second thought this question is academic because Tobey Maguire is a great actor and I doubt the novelty will ever wear off. This film's thematic burden is a lot heavier than the originals but unlike many other films, notably Reloaded, not overbearing. while the wachowskis forced us to swallow an endless prescription of pulp philosophy pills, mostly delivered with an annoying french accent, Raimi uses a similar technique to cuaron HPATPOA: cinematic metaphor. Spidey's self doubt manifests itself in a kind of impotence, where his powers fail at important moments. His transformation in the two years since Uncle Ben's death can be seen in a nine year old boy, who idolises Spiderman. Sure, Spidey and co do have some speeches but they are poignant and pointed not prolix and pretentious. The action and actors in this film are fabulous. Raimi directs the former with verve and scope, producing breathtaking sequences. Alfred Molina has misguided malice as Dr Ock, with his metal tentacles acting like flotsam and jetsam in the Little mermaid, corrupting his soul and justifying his nefarious activities. J.K. Simmons provides almost constant comic relief as the hypocritical, cynical newspaper editor. Maguire, Dunst and Franco reprise their original roles with maturity and aplomb, especially Maguire who grapples with many conflicting emotions in the film.The film is also filled with subtleties that are very satisfying to uncover.In conclusion, Spiderman 2 is a really, really good film, blending soaring action and great acting. It hardly creaks under the responsibility of the Hollywood blockbuster. but if we ask the question what if it had been made without the shackles of Hollywood? Would it be any better. It is a question, unlike that if whether or not there will be a third Spiderman, for which we will never know the answer. The words of aunt may come to mind. In order to stay steady, we must sacrifice the thing we want the most. This movie manages( just) to uphold the former while not compromising the latter. We need our heroes and Spiderman is the most human and the most uplifting. Bring on Spiderman 3.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While I have always liked how these comic books are adapted into films, I really enjoyed the story in this one more than the comic book aspect of the film. Roger Ebert said it best, "This is a superhero movie for people who don't like superhero movies." There is so much depth to the characters and storytelling, especially the personal problems Peter Parker has to deal with. I liked this movie just as much as the last one, and I recommend this at any price, which means I give it a 10+ on a scale of 1 to 10. This is yet another movie I will definitely own. I am very excited about the next movie and can't wait until it's released.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would like Ebert's head on a stick with a refund in his mouth after having seen this lousy excuse for a movie. Ebert claims it's the "best superhero movie he's ever seen" Now, I know I can't blame him for the insanely loud volume at which the movie was played, but he sent me in there with the expectation that this movie would be hands-down the best the industry had to offer this year - and boy was I disappointed.Also, as much as I love Millar and Gough writing comic book movies, they've become overly formulaic and seriously threaten the downfall of this franchise. If Marvel has some intelligence they'll either change the writers or impose more sanctions that the movies follow the comic books more closely - I'm sorry, but Mary Jane does not ditch her wedding day to be w/ Petey; plus Peter has way more brains in the books then to take off his mask every five minutes while he's still wearing the costume.The movie plays too much like a comic book, with an endless amount of scenes that Raimi tries to disguise with visual fades and aural transitions; plus, the writing is just way too sappy, and at times becomes a series of monologues; the movie is loaded w/ recalls to other comic books, comic book movies, movies in general and previous scenes in the franchise, but this movie is sadly just a spectacle of how to kill a great franchise. The only saving grace, and this comes w/ a caveat, is the scene setting up Spiderman 3, which SHOULD be a showdown between Pete and his best friend in quite possibly one of the book's greatest rivalries; however, the one caveat I submit is that if MJ is not killed off in this next flick, then the big-wigs have seriously overlooked the value of their franchise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has everything. Action, good writing and dialogue, and unlike Amidala and Anakin, the love story component is the best I have ever seen. The struggles are real- both internal and external. The special effects have managed to surpass the first installment. When you leave you keep thinking how awesome it would be to be Toby and able to boast playing the part of Peter Parker. The movie only seemed to stall at one point, but it helped the movie because after that scene (the birthday) the movie turned up a notch and never slowed down. Also, there was no aspect of predictability. I won't say. You need to see it for yourself. The writers did a great job of setting up the next one, and rumor has it Peter Parker will be battling two villains next time. Oh yeah- It's also a very funny movie. But it is funny at appropriate times and it's not Jar-Jar Binks humor either. So, yeah. Go see it. It's pretty sweet and inspirational.</fullReview>

I enjoyed in the beginning, but as we got further into the movie, I had hoped that it would subside. It did not. THE UGLY: I don't think there was an ugly in this movie. It was brilliantly orchestrated, there was flawless transition between CGI and live action, and the acting was on par with the action in the movie.

		<fullReview>Obviously, the people who are grousing that this film is simply a 'rehash' of Raimi's original Spider-Man have never read the comic books.Unlike the first film, which by necessity must explain the basic elements of Peter Parker's complex world and how exactly he became the Amazing Spider-Man, the sequel maintains a focus on the theme that has consistently flowed throughout Spider-Man's 42-year comic book career: the burden of being Spider-Man and how heavily it weighs on Peter Parker and those he cares for.Yes, the visuals are perfect (some slightly dodgy CGI, aside) but it's the writing and the performances that truly make this film outshine its forebear. Raimi's casting choices from the first film are pitch-perfect again, maintaining the perfect balance between comic book- camp and real-world believability that compels the audience to empathize with characters that in most films would be little more than window dressing, such as Rosie Octavius.Lastly, to counter the charges by some reviewers that the movie suffers from a gigantic plot hole that fails to explain the 'physical changes' that affect Spider-Man and Peter - it's all explained by two scenes: 1) the doctor's psychoanalysis and 2) the "kiss me" scene in the diner. It's all about choices between responsibilities and dreams, and believing in one's own self (which are also central themes in many of Stan Lee's books).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What made Peter Parker/Spider-Man so interesting is that he was a superhero with everyday problems, that is why some of the comic book readers can relate to him so well. The movie takes place with Peter Parker(Tobey Maguire) who has trouble keeping a job, his grades in college are declining, and has trouble keeping up with Mary Jane Watson(Kirsten Dunst). And why, because he is off saving the city from criminals has the web slinging Spider-Man. The pressure of it all begins to catch up with Peter Parker and decides to retire from being Spider-Man. Meanwhile Dr. Otto Octaivus(Alfred Molina) experiment with fusion and mechanical arms go awry. And becomes Dr. Octapus. And begins to cause mayhem in the city. Will Peter stop him in time? A truly great superhero film. It really shows that being a superhero is'nt fun and games at all. James Franco, Kirsten Dunst, and Rosemary Harris(Aunt May) all give awesome performances. But it is Tobey Maguire's performance that was good he makes it allmost tearjerky. So does Alfred Molina has the villianous and tourterd Doc Oct, he was almost has memorable Willem Dafoes Green Goblin.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From Evil Dead to Spidey</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is so cool to see a director not loose his style, even when he is making huge blockbuster hollywood films. For those who don't know, Spiderman director Sam Raimi also directed some of the horror movie genre's cult clasics such as the "Evil Dead" . Anyone who is a fan of the Evil Dead movies will immediately pick up certain "Raimi-esque" camera work in Spiderman 2 (like Spiderman). This was once again, an all out fun film to watch. I love how we get to see the other side of being a super hero. Spiderman seems even more realistic whenwe see the little day to day happenings that are humorous. Did you ever wonder where Spiderman kept his suit? And does Spiderman wash his outfit? Thoselittle questions to ponder are actually answered. If you liked the first one, you will most likely enjoy #2 as well. This is a comic book character that I wouldn't mind seeing a few more sequels of- and I am one to not be a big fan of big budget action hero films. Some people have said it is better then the first. For me, it is hard to say. Being that I had high expectations of this, and they were pretty much met- that is saying something.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Are they kidding? It sucks major league</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After reading three or four absolutely glowing reviews of this movie I was stunned when I left the theater. For this Spider-Man fan, S2 was nearly as disappointing as "Hulk" and suffered from the same problem--way too much character development, yet not enough emphasis on the right character.For some reasons the people who made this movie think Peter Parker is more interesting than Spider-Man. Fair enough, but if you're then going to make a movie about Peter, MJ, Harry, Aunt May and all the rest, then at least make an interesting one. In S2, the relationships don't make any sense, the dialogue is witless and the character do exactly what the screenplay demands they do at that moment, even if it doesn't make any sense. And the whole thing is just dumb, dumb, dumb.Also, fanboys beware--the web-slinger merits minor billing in this movie. He is off screen for very long stretches of time, and when he is around he spends most of his time getting his butt whipped. Where are the amazing super powers? The funny wisecracks when he's fighting? All the things that make the comics so much fun?I think what we have here is a group of movie producers who, like those who made "Hulk," don't have enough confidence in their source material: comic books. I always thought that if you cut the many unnecessary scenes with Jennifer Connelly, Nick Nolte and Sam Elliott, "Hulk" could have been an absolutely kick-ass 90-minute flick instead of a 240-minute snorefest. Similarly, S2 probably could have been a terrific movie about Spider-Man and Dr. Octopus--both of whom get low billing in this flick. Instead, the screenplay focuses on the other characters, who have very common, everyday (i.e., boring) problems.You buy a Spider-Man comic book and the story focuses on Spider-Man, with Peter Parker popping in from time to time to balance the story and add a little depth. You go to a Spider-Man movie and it's the other way around. I don't know why the producers don't think Spider-Man himself is worth focusing on. There are a million Peter Parkers but only one web-slinger. They more accurately could have titled this movie "Peter Parker 1" instead of "Spider-Man 2."One of my favorite movies in the super-hero genre is "Batman Returns." Still too much character development, but at least the screenplay was witty and adult. I will say that J.K. Simmons was hilarious as J.Jonah Jameson; the writers were wise to expand his role. And the movie does come alive those few times when either Spider-Man or Dr. Ock take center stage. But overall S2 has been dumbed down to the third-grade level, and the ending seems very phony and hasn't earned the big emotional response it was obviously shooting for.If you're a Spider-Man fan, I recommend picking up the DVD with all 13 first-season episodes of the new animated series with Neil Patrick Harris as the voice of Spidey. The animation is awesome, the writing is good, the stories are engaging, and the dialogue witty.As for "Spider-Man 2," save your $9 and catch it on DVD or cable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I started reading Spiderman when he debuted with Steve Ditko doing the writing and the art way back in the sixties, and have to say that this movie captured the soul of Ditko's special version of Spidey better than I would have imagined. The casting is great - the woman playing Aunt May couldn't look more like her with that chin and that mouth if she'd had plastic surgery!- and the overall look and feel of the film is true to the original comic in almost every respect. Yes, you can pick some nits about things that have been upgraded to fit current technological knowledge, but it would be just that - picking insignificant nits of no consequence at all. Watching the fight scenes left me gawking at the way they animated Doc Ocks' arms, and Spidey's movement through the skyscrapers of NYC left me with vertigo. A great effort and what the Superman movies SHOULD have been. Too bad DC didn't have the vision of Stan Lee and the Marvel group!</fullReview>

What do I say to that? Bring 'em on, Raimi; bring 'em on. The cameo of Bruce Cambell was great, though it looks like he's getting older and gaining a couple of pounds, and I caught the Stan Lee appearance, though it's for a split second. (He pulls a lady out of the way of falling rubble.) Spider-man movies make me happy when I watch them, I'm not sure why. It just seems like such a cool concept that a nerd like Parker is actually someone much more powerful. The feelings I get from watching it may be because I see some similarities between the character of Parker and myself. Spider-man 2 was a joy ride, though at some times it did seem to get a little slow. The ending was MUCH less disappointing than the first one; she called him Tiger!

This movie was funnier than the 1st, more fights and we get to swing between buildings way more. Makes me want to buy the game. Overall, No movie is perfect, but this comes close.

		<shortDescription>Comics and Movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me first state my views on comic books and movies made out of them. In my opinion, there are three things that require consideration -Most of us have read comics when we were kids. A few of us may still read them now, when we are not kids anymore, but still subconsciously revert to 'kid-mode' when we read them. As for watching a movie however, I believe we do not automatically switch to 'kid-mode', and rare is the movie that makes us do so. This leads me to me second point - As a kid, what was your lasting image or thought when reading the comics? Mine was (and I daresay for most people) actually bring the hero. The thrill you experienced was so genuine, the action so exciting and the outcome so awe-inspiring because it was you, as the hero, that was responsible (in your imagination, consciously or subconsciously). This brings me to the concluding third point about comics and movies - In a movie theater however, the objective is, I feel, to show you a spectacle, rather than make you part of the spectacle. And like I mentioned above, the audience cant be taken to be in 'kid-mode', which may further explain the shift in perspective. We are shown real people, with their real human faces/mannerisms/actions/behavior/social interactions - the list goes on, resulting it being hammered into us that we are watching a hero, not imagining us being one.It maybe because active reading requires the reader to form the events in his own mind using his imagination, but the end point is that you can never recreate the same feeling you got while reading the comic, while seeing the movie in a theater. This installment might be similar to Spiderman 1 in that aspect, but I'd seen that one with a girl, and as long as she enjoyed it (and thought I was the hero for bringing her to see it) I didn't care two hoots about the movie. (She did, and I didn't :P). But I digress..Seeing this movie left with me mostly happy, with a few disappointments.The bad parts first -Maybe I'd hyped myself for the same reading-experience and didn't get it (see reasoning above). For all the devilishly evil villains Spidey fights with, there was very little feeling of danger that passed over to the audience. Sure we saw the gimmicks like girls screaming and the ground shaking, but did we feel the appropriate terror? I know they tried to make this a movie for all ages, and hence might have had to deliberately keep it that way.And what is it about characters thrown all around the screen, with bone-breaking force, that hardly draws a reaction? Maybe we are too used and jaded to it, but in one scene - Peter and MJ at the restaurant, Doc Ock hands out his ultimatum and then crashes Peter into the nearest wall: where was the customary whimper/anxious look from MJ? We know he can take it, they don't. A perfect place to add some of the missing 'danger' feeling, but it became just another stunt.What exactly is it about MJ that makes her so appealing? All that we're shown of her in the movie is mostly as a nagging/demanding/quick-to-doubt-love kind of person. Okay maybe that frame of mind is certainly possible with all that she's gone through, but for sake of cinema, show us something that'll make us too fall in love with her ! Ironically, the best Kirsten Dunst looks in the movie is when she's running in the bridal gown, with a full smile on her face - just a fleeting frame.As for the good stuff - everything else; well I'm running out of space, and most of it's been mentioned, so /skip ! I will say though, the film paid attention to detail, and that made a lot of difference.P.S. anyone caught the reference to the Matrix where Peter tries to jump off the building (just before the "my back, my back" scene ) ?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the very BEST sequels in movie history!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As sequels go, let's be quite frank: 9 times out of 10, they suck big time. And with superhero movies, they usually get it pretty close...but still they miss the mark (I've heard that Daredevil was a major bomb, and after Batman 2, things got really lame). Spider-Man, however, was a terrific movie, and Spider-Man 2 is just as good, if not better, than the first one. For one, we can actually identify with Peter Parker. He is, after all, just a normal kid who's suddenly given these incredible powers and is realizing the many consequences it can have on his life. We feel for him as he struggles to respect his responsibilities as Spider-Man while also trying to live a semblance of a normal life as Peter Parker. With Batman, Bruce Wayne was a millionaire, so money was never a problem. Also, we never got very much insight into his deeper feelings, or how being Batman affected his personal life. The X-Men were never really "normal" to begin with, so identifying with them is even harder. And the only time we see the angst of Superman is in the WB's hit series, Smallville. So yes, we completely sympathize with Peter--he loses jobs because of his duties as Spider-Man, which also cause friction between him and MJ, him and Harry Osborn and even, to some degree, him and his Aunt. We feel what he feels at one point: IT"S NOT WORTH IT BEING SPIDER-MAN ANYMORE! After all, New York has survived for decades at the hands of the boys in blue, long before Spider-Man's human counterpart was ever born. And it is through the wisdom and the love of his Aunt that we, along with Peter, are reminded of the magnificent effect that Spider-Man has not only on New York but all of us. Doctor Octavius is a man who, upon meeting him, we really like and warm up to; he's not a bad guy at all. He means well, but when the fusion experiment goes awry and it wreaks havoc on his mind, he is a force to be reckoned with...and feared. All in all, this is without a doubt one of the BEST superhero franchises ever made, and certainly one of the BEST sequels, as well. ***WARNING!! IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN SPIDER-MAN 2 YET, READ NO FURTHER!*** For those who have seen S-M2, I'd like to say that I thought it was really awesome how some of the traditional rules are utterly shattered: Numero Uno being that the superhero can NEVER, EVER let his secret identity be discovered by those closest to him (or her). Not only does Harry discover his best friend's secret, but so does MJ...and despite Peter's caution that they can never be together, she chooses to take the risks. Watching Smallville on WB, there've been countless times I've wanted to scream at Clark, "Just tell Lana the truth! Put your trust in her!!" Of course, I always found Chloe far more attractive than Lana...but anyway, I also really liked the fact that at the end, Dr. Octavius salvaged enough of the good in himself to sacrifice himself and his beloved project to undo the danger he's posed to New York and put an end to the menace his mechanical arms have become. In addition, not only do we get to breathe a sigh of relief as Peter's finally able to let MJ in on his secret (although unintentionally), but he also wins her over. Superman could never be with Lois...Batman is an eternal bachelor...even the WB's Charmed ones have a tough time with their love lifes. All told, it's a GREAT movie that's setting new standards and going where other superhero movies have not dared to.</fullReview>

We know he can take it, they don't. A perfect place to add some of the missing 'danger' feeling, but it became just another stunt.What exactly is it about MJ that makes her so appealing? All that we're shown of her in the movie is mostly as a nagging/demanding/quick-to-doubt-love kind of person. Okay maybe that frame of mind is certainly possible with all that she's gone through, but for sake of cinema, show us something that'll make us too fall in love with her ! Ironically, the best Kirsten Dunst looks in the movie is when she's running in the bridal gown, with a full smile on her face - just a fleeting frame.As for the good stuff - everything else; well I'm running out of space, and most of it's been mentioned, so /skip ! I will say though, the film paid attention to detail, and that made a lot of difference.P.S. anyone caught the reference to the Matrix where Peter tries to jump off the building (just before the "my back, my back" scene ) ?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the very BEST sequels in movie history!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As sequels go, let's be quite frank: 9 times out of 10, they suck big time. And with superhero movies, they usually get it pretty close...but still they miss the mark (I've heard that Daredevil was a major bomb, and after Batman 2, things got really lame). Spider-Man, however, was a terrific movie, and Spider-Man 2 is just as good, if not better, than the first one. For one, we can actually identify with Peter Parker. He is, after all, just a normal kid who's suddenly given these incredible powers and is realizing the many consequences it can have on his life. We feel for him as he struggles to respect his responsibilities as Spider-Man while also trying to live a semblance of a normal life as Peter Parker. With Batman, Bruce Wayne was a millionaire, so money was never a problem. Also, we never got very much insight into his deeper feelings, or how being Batman affected his personal life. The X-Men were never really "normal" to begin with, so identifying with them is even harder. And the only time we see the angst of Superman is in the WB's hit series, Smallville. So yes, we completely sympathize with Peter--he loses jobs because of his duties as Spider-Man, which also cause friction between him and MJ, him and Harry Osborn and even, to some degree, him and his Aunt. We feel what he feels at one point: IT"S NOT WORTH IT BEING SPIDER-MAN ANYMORE! After all, New York has survived for decades at the hands of the boys in blue, long before Spider-Man's human counterpart was ever born. And it is through the wisdom and the love of his Aunt that we, along with Peter, are reminded of the magnificent effect that Spider-Man has not only on New York but all of us. Doctor Octavius is a man who, upon meeting him, we really like and warm up to; he's not a bad guy at all. He means well, but when the fusion experiment goes awry and it wreaks havoc on his mind, he is a force to be reckoned with...and feared. All in all, this is without a doubt one of the BEST superhero franchises ever made, and certainly one of the BEST sequels, as well. ***WARNING!! IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN SPIDER-MAN 2 YET, READ NO FURTHER!*** For those who have seen S-M2, I'd like to say that I thought it was really awesome how some of the traditional rules are utterly shattered: Numero Uno being that the superhero can NEVER, EVER let his secret identity be discovered by those closest to him (or her). Not only does Harry discover his best friend's secret, but so does MJ...and despite Peter's caution that they can never be together, she chooses to take the risks. Watching Smallville on WB, there've been countless times I've wanted to scream at Clark, "Just tell Lana the truth! Put your trust in her!!" Of course, I always found Chloe far more attractive than Lana...but anyway, I also really liked the fact that at the end, Dr. Octavius salvaged enough of the good in himself to sacrifice himself and his beloved project to undo the danger he's posed to New York and put an end to the menace his mechanical arms have become. In addition, not only do we get to breathe a sigh of relief as Peter's finally able to let MJ in on his secret (although unintentionally), but he also wins her over. Superman could never be with Lois...Batman is an eternal bachelor...even the WB's Charmed ones have a tough time with their love lifes. All told, it's a GREAT movie that's setting new standards and going where other superhero movies have not dared to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Super Hero film ever! Spoilers below</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spider-Man was a good movie,great popcorn fun. But Spidey 2 is an excellent film period! The Best of 04 so far! We get a deep plot,we put our hero Peter Parker/Spider-Man through literal hell. He cant get to college on time,he is fired from his job,his friend Harry Osbourne,Son of Green Goblin 1 Norman Osbourner vows to kill him,and cannot tell Mary Jane how he really feels,all because of his alter ego Spider-Man. His Uncle Ben's words echo on..."With great power comes great responsibility",so Pete most carry on. But he finds it impossible to,and eventually quits. Meanwhile a certain Doctor Otto Octavis,Peter' s hero,grafts four claws on to his back,which begin to control the good doctor,and make him go mad. He turns into Spidey's second great villain Doctor Octopus aka Doc Ock. Who most continue his experiment on fusion,even if the fate of New York City is in the balance. Doctor Octopus,and an alcoholic Harry team up to kill Peter/Spidey.The bait Mary Jane. Peter most come to New York,and Mary Jane's rescue. Spider-Man 2 is superb,has great special effects,and an excellent story to back it up. Has some great moments,as in Peter's dream about his Uncle Ben,or Doc Ock's origin,and bank robbing scene,but my favorite has to be Harry discovering who his Dad really was,and becoming the second Green Goblin. Excellent film 4/4!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Most sequels can't hold a candle to the original, this one can. I wasn't sure what to expect but it was a pleasant surprise. The same wonderful cast with Tobey Mcguire in the lead role of Peter Parker, alias Spiderman, Kirstin Dunst reclaiming her role as the love of Peters life Mary JAne. It was nice to see that even Aunt May had a larger role this time with the problems she is facing since her husbands death, with the bank wanting to foreclose on her home. Peter (Spiderman) is having a change of faith and tries to leave Spiderman in the dust but realizes with great power comes great responsibility and gets back into it with dynamic results. Much better action scenes this time around, more natural looking. Would definitely go to see it again and recommend it to everyone, you will like the movie even if you are not a comic book fanatic. I wasn't and I thought it was great entertainment.</fullReview>

However, some of the scenes truly seemed as though they were lacking a point or were being repetitive. The storyline continued smoothly, but i don't feel they spent enough time trying to deliver the character Of Doc Ockt. In comparison to the first movie, the second was not quite as good through my eyes. However that may just be because I have a stronger taste for how heros get created, rather than what they are known for.

		<shortDescription>A New Type of Effect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back in 2002, the first Spider-Man movie in the trilogy was released. While director Sam Raimi did a good job of making the movie, it was still lacking one thing: good character development. Now, in the summer of 2004, the second Spider-Man movie is released. "Is it better than the original?" numerous people will ask. That answer is definitely a yes, because Spider-Man 2 introduces a new type of special effect: the effect of character development.Spider-Man 2 begins with Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire), our hero with superhuman spider abilities, facing the problems of becoming a superhero. Peter's grades are slipping; he gets fired from his jobs; he feels bad that he didn't help prevent the death of his Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson); his best friend, Harry Osborn (James Franco), is angry at him for being fond of Spider-Man; and worst of all, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), the girl he is in love with, is mad at him for abandoning her to fight crime. And in turn, she has decided to marry John Jameson (Daniel Gillies), who is the son of Peter's boss J. Jonah Jameson (played by J.K. Simmons).And there's STILL a villain for Peter to fight. Dr. Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina) has four mechanical metal arms welded onto his body after a fusion energy source accident, and becomes known as Doc Ock. Now, it's up to Spider-Man to stop Octavius before he manages to create another and larger fusion energy source and risks destroying the entire city!Other things have improved in Spider-Man 2 other than the addition of the new effect I just discussed. Special effects have improved dramatically, and Spider-Man moves more realistically. But the special effects also help make Dr. Octavius's four tentacles look and move extraordinarily, and therefore every scene with both Spider-Man and Octavius is amazing. Another thing that has improved is the screenwriting; screenwriter Alvin Sargent writes better dialogue and has better pacing, which works well during the dramatic and romantic sequences.While Spider-Man 2 is a very good movie, it's not absolutely flawless, but I only have one gripe. I just thought that Octavius's conclusion at the end was a bit clichd and predictable. I don't want to spoil the ending for you, but you'll understand once you see it.But overall, Spider-Man 2 is a very good movie and is improved dramatically by its added character development. As a final statement, I can't wait for the third installment in the trilogy!****1/2 out of ***** Rated PG-13 for intense action/violence</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Excellent movie. Particularly liked the nice warm moment on the subway train when the people gather around Spidey.Funniest bit was when Doc Ock (in front of loads of press) attaches his never seen before AI enhanced mechanical arms to his spine using nano technology - and the assembled press all go "Yeah, move along" - like he'd just said "I am now going to stir this cup of tea WITH THIS TEASPOON !!!!". Like a guy needs to harness the power of the sun in his hand to get anyone's juices flowing...The only disappointment - Ms. Dunst looking like she'd just got out of bed in most scenes (except on her wedding day).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm sure you may be tired of hearing this, but Spider-man 2 really did surpass the original in every way. It is not a sequel, but a continuation of a story. People who aren't into comic book characters will love this and the fans will adore it. It is a blessing to have Sam Raimi at the helm, directing this movie in such a way that no one else could have done better. Michael Chabon, one of the best screen-writers known was on board and made a great contribution to the film. Incredible feats in this film include a wide-scale chase throughout an El-Train, the amazing transformation of Otto Octavius to Dr Octopus, and a brawl inside and out of a bank. Great acting, great story, awesome effects, and a marvelous script. This one takes the cake.</fullReview>

The first one was great but as much as I loved it the 2nd one was way way way better. it had everything that a movie would need and i love it. i would watch it more than Pirates of the Caribbean and based on my screen name that is a lot of times. I recommend you to go see it and I bet you will walk out amazed and if you don't then you better not go see another action movie and stick to dull ones! It was full of action and love and anger and Peter Parker was never better. The actress and actors were so great in that movie and i think that they should be so proud of it! It deserves and Oscar and ever award that it is nominated for! You go Spder-Man!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This installment of Spiderman did the impossible: improved upon perfection. It's rare when a sequel can surpass the original. But in this case, it blew the original away. Doc Ock as portrayed in Spiderman 2 was an amazingly compelling comic book villain. This movie makes you hate to hate him, and that's why it was so great.The character development was superb, the action sequences (Especially the train) were the best among the comic book genre ever, it was full of humor and laugh out loud moments, and delivered to the very end.Deserving of being put among the top action movies of all time, including Raiders of the Lost Ark and Empire Strikes Back.I only had one problem with this movie: I didn't want it to end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Everything any person should want in a movie, darn it!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ahhh...... Spiderman 2.... what can I say... this movie was awesome. I love you, Spiderman! First, let's talk about the acting. Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, Alfred Molina, Rosemary Harris, and James Franco. Tobey Maguire, I must say, did a really good job of showing emotions, using humor, and giving Peter Parker/Spiderman a good character. Kirsten Dunst, still hot from the first movie gave another good performance. Rosemary Harris did an excellent performance with her experience in acting. Wow, Alfred Molina poured his heart into his performance of Otto Octavius/Doctor Octopus, in fact, I don't think anyone else could have done a better job of being the scientist turned villain. And James Franco, still good and without Willem Dafoe this time, not that it's a bad thing.Now, the story...SPOILERS, OH MY GOSH!!!...Peter Parker's life is thrashed and abused throughout the movie, and it left me feeling depressed and feeling bad for him, which made me happy because movies don't usually do that to me. Because of his life being thrashed, he begins to lose his powers and ultimately decides to stop leading a double life and throws his Spiderman costume in the trash. But when chaos erupts in the streets after he becomes Peter Parker again, he decides to become Spiderman again.On the other hand, there's Otto Octavius, a brilliant scientist who is trying to perfect interesting scientific stuff...you know what I mean... During a public experiment, though, while using his super special brain-powered tentacles, the experiment goes awry and his wife is killed along with his tentacles permanently attaching to his nervous system. He blacks out and is taken to a hospital in one of the most intense scenes that's not in a horror or war movie I have ever seen. Sam Raimi, the director of Spiderman, as many know, also directed Evil Dead, a really gory and cool B-movie, and this scene is hinting to the Evil Dead movie, I think. Anyways, the tentacles go crazy and kill all the doctors in the room and the doctors use chainsaws, yay!!! Well, Doc Ock decides to finish his crazy experiment in a rundown laboratory near the Brooklyn Bridge and Spidey goes to stop it and I'm not going to ruin that for you...On yet another hand, Mary Jane Watson, Harry Osborne, and Aunt May all have their problems with Spidey and Peter Parker. MJ has problems with Peter because he can't make time for her important things like her hit play on Broadway. Harry troubles Pete because of his "friendship" with Spidey. Aunt May troubles him with money problems and when Pete tells her the truth about Uncle Ben's death, she shuns him for a while...Finally, the graphics and sound... The first really cool sequence was when Octavius's experiment went awry; the sound was truly cool and the graphics went well with it... and Octavius's arms were looking real. Then Spidey and Ock's fight on the subway had me shaking in my seat... you'll see...All in all, this movie was crazy, cool, awesome, and hilarious with awkward moments like Spidey in the elevator and funny stuff like the violin player and J. Jonah Jameson. There are even surprise appearances by Stan Lee, creator of MARVEL COMICS, and Bruce Campbell, star of Evil Dead, who was really funny... And the end, the end sets up Spiderman 3 so well. I can't tell because it's like telling the end of the Sixth Sense, it would spoil the movie for you...Don't believe anyone who disses this movie... it can't be made fun of...That's my review, now go see the movie, DARN IT!!! **** out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What superhero movies would be like if left in the hands of the writers from the Oxygen network</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite the cynical title, allow me to preface this review by stating that I liked this film. I really, truly, genuinely did. In fact, I'll even take it one step further; this may be the VERY BEST SUPERHERO MOVIE _EVER_MADE...and that's coming from a fan, (though not a fanatic) of the genre.Why the ambivalence then? Because this movie is not perfect. In truth, it's far from perfect; it plays more like a rough draft or first cut of something that could be much better. What Spiderman 2 does do so successfully is introduce many new elements heretofore unseen in action movies: character, plot, drama, and real conflict. The director and writer are not content making Spidey and the people in his world one-dimensional comic-book cutouts (pardon the pun); instead, these are real characters, with real dilemmas, real feeling, and real conflicting sense of responsibility and desire. In other words, they are far more human. And successfully allowing viewers to be sucked in to another world, in which we can vicariously live through and observe others' conflicts and be riveted by what we see, is the hallmark of great film.The problem, in a nutshell, is that the movie does far too much of this. Sure, there are awesome special effects, great battle scenes, and wonderful vistas of real and computer-assisted, imagined New York (and Chicago standing in for New York; note train scene) but there is also almost as much melodrama and as many soap opera-ish momements in Spidey's world as you'd find in Susan Lucci. I got excited when I think I finally found one scene in which the major players' eyes did NOT well up with tears; they probably used more nitro-glycerine in this movie (or whatever chemical it is that they put into actors' eyes to create fake tears) than the number of doughnuts Albert Molina ate on set (and when you see how fat and blubbery this dude is in his sexy, revealing Dr. Octopus outfit, you'll know that that number ain't too small.) After a while, even the most seasoned Danielle Steel readers dragged into the audience by their violence-loving kids/husbands will start longing for another epic cartoon battle scene, rather than having to watch any more of James Franco's teary eye infection blown up on the huge screen scene after scene.But I admired the film. I really did. I think it will serve as a trendsetter for future action films. Hell, it may even be studied as an example of how one CAN make a film that incorporates wonderful fantasy violence, characters with super-human powers, bizarre villains etc. without insulting the intelligence of the audience and boring them to tears whenever the CGI doesn't have them gawking at the screen (are you listening, George Lucas?)The acting is uniformly good; Tobey Maguire, an actor I was never particularly impressed with (in no small part because we're about the same age, both actors, and while he's a mega-superstar, I'm sitting here writing reviews on IMDb at 12:44 AM), did a surprisingly excellent job. Kirsten Dunst is not just another pretty face, and whoever played Aunt May is clearly a seasoned actress. The only one I wasn't particularly thrilled with was Alfred Molina. I'm not certain if that's because he simply couldn't quite convey the same kind of electrifying excitement that other superhero villains have in recent years (Jack Nicholson, Willem Defoe, Gene Hackman) or because everytime he appeared on screen, I kept expecting him to rip off the tentacles, revealing a black caftan and a fuzzy hat, and break out into an impassioned, foot-stomping rendition of "Tradition". Kind of unsuspended my suspended disbelief. I've never understood why producers/directors of highly-anticipated, much-heralded, big-budget films choose not to sign the very *best* actors to play key roles. You know that Jeremy Irons, Alan Rickman, Patrick Stewart, and a host of other great middle-aged actors with funny accents would have been thrilled to play this role...why did they settle on the less-known, and far more droll Molina? Same goes for Hayden Christensen, but that comment is in that film's review.Speaking of disbelief, as I mentioned above, the writing is quite tight, and I loved the fact that they actually spent SOME of the $200 million dollar budget on writers who had taken courses in dramatic writing a tad more advanced than 7th Grade Haikus (are you listening George LUCAS?!) Nevertheless, there were a couple of scenes (cf. the doctor's conversation with Parker, and Aunt May's "Henry Jackson" speech) that seemed to come completely out of left field. They were clearly intended to push the plot/"with great powers come great responsibility" motif, but they were so contrived, and so out-of-flow with the rest of the seamless dialogue that those two scenes managed to unsuspend my suspension of disbelief. Those two scenes contained the only moments I'd reckon were entirely unbelievable in the film, and to be able to say that about a movie in which people fall from buildings without so much as a scratch, and a jumpy trapeeze dude in a Spider suit sets on a mission to stop a criminal with electric octopus hands from harnessing the sun's energy to destroy the world...well, that should tell you something about the overall terrible quality of the writing in those two scenes.All in all, a flawed film, about flawed human beings. But it's a trailblazer and a trendsetter nonetheless. Highly enjoyable, and I highly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not another mad scientist with 8 limbs !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Excellent movie. Particularly liked the nice warm moment on the subway train when the people gather around Spidey.Funniest bit was when Doc Ock (in front of loads of press) attaches his never seen before AI enhanced mechanical arms to his spine using nano technology - and the assembled press all go "Yeah, move along" - like he'd just said "I am now going to stir this cup of tea WITH THIS TEASPOON !!!!". Like a guy needs to harness the power of the sun in his hand to get anyone's juices flowing...The only disappointment - Ms. Dunst looking like she'd just got out of bed in most scenes (except on her wedding day).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Forget the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm sure you may be tired of hearing this, but Spider-man 2 really did surpass the original in every way. It is not a sequel, but a continuation of a story. People who aren't into comic book characters will love this and the fans will adore it. It is a blessing to have Sam Raimi at the helm, directing this movie in such a way that no one else could have done better. Michael Chabon, one of the best screen-writers known was on board and made a great contribution to the film. Incredible feats in this film include a wide-scale chase throughout an El-Train, the amazing transformation of Otto Octavius to Dr Octopus, and a brawl inside and out of a bank. Great acting, great story, awesome effects, and a marvelous script. This one takes the cake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Movie Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would like to say that SM2 was the best movie ever! The first one was great but as much as I loved it the 2nd one was way way way better. it had everything that a movie would need and i love it. i would watch it more than Pirates of the Caribbean and based on my screen name that is a lot of times. I recommend you to go see it and I bet you will walk out amazed and if you don't then you better not go see another action movie and stick to dull ones! It was full of action and love and anger and Peter Parker was never better. The actress and actors were so great in that movie and i think that they should be so proud of it! It deserves and Oscar and ever award that it is nominated for! You go Spder-Man!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest action movies of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This installment of Spiderman did the impossible: improved upon perfection. It's rare when a sequel can surpass the original. But in this case, it blew the original away. Doc Ock as portrayed in Spiderman 2 was an amazingly compelling comic book villain. This movie makes you hate to hate him, and that's why it was so great.The character development was superb, the action sequences (Especially the train) were the best among the comic book genre ever, it was full of humor and laugh out loud moments, and delivered to the very end.Deserving of being put among the top action movies of all time, including Raiders of the Lost Ark and Empire Strikes Back.I only had one problem with this movie: I didn't want it to end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Everything any person should want in a movie, darn it!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ahhh...... Spiderman 2.... what can I say... this movie was awesome. I love you, Spiderman! First, let's talk about the acting. Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, Alfred Molina, Rosemary Harris, and James Franco. Tobey Maguire, I must say, did a really good job of showing emotions, using humor, and giving Peter Parker/Spiderman a good character. Kirsten Dunst, still hot from the first movie gave another good performance. Rosemary Harris did an excellent performance with her experience in acting. Wow, Alfred Molina poured his heart into his performance of Otto Octavius/Doctor Octopus, in fact, I don't think anyone else could have done a better job of being the scientist turned villain. And James Franco, still good and without Willem Dafoe this time, not that it's a bad thing.Now, the story...SPOILERS, OH MY GOSH!!!...Peter Parker's life is thrashed and abused throughout the movie, and it left me feeling depressed and feeling bad for him, which made me happy because movies don't usually do that to me. Because of his life being thrashed, he begins to lose his powers and ultimately decides to stop leading a double life and throws his Spiderman costume in the trash. But when chaos erupts in the streets after he becomes Peter Parker again, he decides to become Spiderman again.On the other hand, there's Otto Octavius, a brilliant scientist who is trying to perfect interesting scientific stuff...you know what I mean... During a public experiment, though, while using his super special brain-powered tentacles, the experiment goes awry and his wife is killed along with his tentacles permanently attaching to his nervous system. He blacks out and is taken to a hospital in one of the most intense scenes that's not in a horror or war movie I have ever seen. Sam Raimi, the director of Spiderman, as many know, also directed Evil Dead, a really gory and cool B-movie, and this scene is hinting to the Evil Dead movie, I think. Anyways, the tentacles go crazy and kill all the doctors in the room and the doctors use chainsaws, yay!!! Well, Doc Ock decides to finish his crazy experiment in a rundown laboratory near the Brooklyn Bridge and Spidey goes to stop it and I'm not going to ruin that for you...On yet another hand, Mary Jane Watson, Harry Osborne, and Aunt May all have their problems with Spidey and Peter Parker. MJ has problems with Peter because he can't make time for her important things like her hit play on Broadway. Harry troubles Pete because of his "friendship" with Spidey. Aunt May troubles him with money problems and when Pete tells her the truth about Uncle Ben's death, she shuns him for a while...Finally, the graphics and sound... The first really cool sequence was when Octavius's experiment went awry; the sound was truly cool and the graphics went well with it... and Octavius's arms were looking real. Then Spidey and Ock's fight on the subway had me shaking in my seat... you'll see...All in all, this movie was crazy, cool, awesome, and hilarious with awkward moments like Spidey in the elevator and funny stuff like the violin player and J. Jonah Jameson. There are even surprise appearances by Stan Lee, creator of MARVEL COMICS, and Bruce Campbell, star of Evil Dead, who was really funny... And the end, the end sets up Spiderman 3 so well. I can't tell because it's like telling the end of the Sixth Sense, it would spoil the movie for you...Don't believe anyone who disses this movie... it can't be made fun of...That's my review, now go see the movie, DARN IT!!! **** out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What superhero movies would be like if left in the hands of the writers from the Oxygen network</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite the cynical title, allow me to preface this review by stating that I liked this film. I really, truly, genuinely did. In fact, I'll even take it one step further; this may be the VERY BEST SUPERHERO MOVIE _EVER_MADE...and that's coming from a fan, (though not a fanatic) of the genre.Why the ambivalence then? Because this movie is not perfect. In truth, it's far from perfect; it plays more like a rough draft or first cut of something that could be much better. What Spiderman 2 does do so successfully is introduce many new elements heretofore unseen in action movies: character, plot, drama, and real conflict. The director and writer are not content making Spidey and the people in his world one-dimensional comic-book cutouts (pardon the pun); instead, these are real characters, with real dilemmas, real feeling, and real conflicting sense of responsibility and desire. In other words, they are far more human. And successfully allowing viewers to be sucked in to another world, in which we can vicariously live through and observe others' conflicts and be riveted by what we see, is the hallmark of great film.The problem, in a nutshell, is that the movie does far too much of this. Sure, there are awesome special effects, great battle scenes, and wonderful vistas of real and computer-assisted, imagined New York (and Chicago standing in for New York; note train scene) but there is also almost as much melodrama and as many soap opera-ish momements in Spidey's world as you'd find in Susan Lucci. I got excited when I think I finally found one scene in which the major players' eyes did NOT well up with tears; they probably used more nitro-glycerine in this movie (or whatever chemical it is that they put into actors' eyes to create fake tears) than the number of doughnuts Albert Molina ate on set (and when you see how fat and blubbery this dude is in his sexy, revealing Dr. Octopus outfit, you'll know that that number ain't too small.) After a while, even the most seasoned Danielle Steel readers dragged into the audience by their violence-loving kids/husbands will start longing for another epic cartoon battle scene, rather than having to watch any more of James Franco's teary eye infection blown up on the huge screen scene after scene.But I admired the film. I really did. I think it will serve as a trendsetter for future action films. Hell, it may even be studied as an example of how one CAN make a film that incorporates wonderful fantasy violence, characters with super-human powers, bizarre villains etc. without insulting the intelligence of the audience and boring them to tears whenever the CGI doesn't have them gawking at the screen (are you listening, George Lucas?)The acting is uniformly good; Tobey Maguire, an actor I was never particularly impressed with (in no small part because we're about the same age, both actors, and while he's a mega-superstar, I'm sitting here writing reviews on IMDb at 12:44 AM), did a surprisingly excellent job. Kirsten Dunst is not just another pretty face, and whoever played Aunt May is clearly a seasoned actress. The only one I wasn't particularly thrilled with was Alfred Molina. I'm not certain if that's because he simply couldn't quite convey the same kind of electrifying excitement that other superhero villains have in recent years (Jack Nicholson, Willem Defoe, Gene Hackman) or because everytime he appeared on screen, I kept expecting him to rip off the tentacles, revealing a black caftan and a fuzzy hat, and break out into an impassioned, foot-stomping rendition of "Tradition". Kind of unsuspended my suspended disbelief. I've never understood why producers/directors of highly-anticipated, much-heralded, big-budget films choose not to sign the very *best* actors to play key roles. You know that Jeremy Irons, Alan Rickman, Patrick Stewart, and a host of other great middle-aged actors with funny accents would have been thrilled to play this role...why did they settle on the less-known, and far more droll Molina? Same goes for Hayden Christensen, but that comment is in that film's review.Speaking of disbelief, as I mentioned above, the writing is quite tight, and I loved the fact that they actually spent SOME of the $200 million dollar budget on writers who had taken courses in dramatic writing a tad more advanced than 7th Grade Haikus (are you listening George LUCAS?!) Nevertheless, there were a couple of scenes (cf. the doctor's conversation with Parker, and Aunt May's "Henry Jackson" speech) that seemed to come completely out of left field. They were clearly intended to push the plot/"with great powers come great responsibility" motif, but they were so contrived, and so out-of-flow with the rest of the seamless dialogue that those two scenes managed to unsuspend my suspension of disbelief. Those two scenes contained the only moments I'd reckon were entirely unbelievable in the film, and to be able to say that about a movie in which people fall from buildings without so much as a scratch, and a jumpy trapeeze dude in a Spider suit sets on a mission to stop a criminal with electric octopus hands from harnessing the sun's energy to destroy the world...well, that should tell you something about the overall terrible quality of the writing in those two scenes.All in all, a flawed film, about flawed human beings. But it's a trailblazer and a trendsetter nonetheless. Highly enjoyable, and I highly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>can't wait for spiderman 3</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most sequels can't hold a candle to the original, this one can. I wasn't sure what to expect but it was a pleasant surprise. The same wonderful cast with Tobey Mcguire in the lead role of Peter Parker, alias Spiderman, Kirstin Dunst reclaiming her role as the love of Peters life Mary JAne. It was nice to see that even Aunt May had a larger role this time with the problems she is facing since her husbands death, with the bank wanting to foreclose on her home. Peter (Spiderman) is having a change of faith and tries to leave Spiderman in the dust but realizes with great power comes great responsibility and gets back into it with dynamic results. Much better action scenes this time around, more natural looking. Would definitely go to see it again and recommend it to everyone, you will like the movie even if you are not a comic book fanatic. I wasn't and I thought it was great entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great movie that makes a true believer twitch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, forgive me. If I wasn't a complete geek, this movie would have gotten a 10. The entire movie was utterly awesome, and they managed to fit amazing action in with a very believable love story. So if you're not a life-long comic book fanatic, this movie will win high acclaim with you! Even if you are, you will thoroughly enjoy the movie. I suppose a few little details don't really seem "organic" to the plot line itself, like Doc Ock's creation story, but overall, it hung together pretty tight. Heck, they even wove some good Spidey classics in there. What the heck am I saying? I loved the movie! Why didn't I vote it a 10?&lt;&lt;&lt;SPOILER&gt;&gt;&gt;For those who have seen it, what was the POINT of Doc Ock's arms in his creation story, which was utterly lame? The plot could have easily carried on with him being a brilliant biophysicist or biomechanical engineer... even a computer science guru. The nuke was really not an essential end-of-city situation... it could just as easily been a swarm of nanotech machines that Doc Ock designed to cure people, but ended up reproducing and tearing people apart.... whatever. By no means would a physicist need four mechanical appendages to run a machine like the fusion reactor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good, yet not as good as the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just earlier today I saw Spider-Man 2. I thought the movie was very well done, especially in their animation. However, some of the scenes truly seemed as though they were lacking a point or were being repetitive. The storyline continued smoothly, but i don't feel they spent enough time trying to deliver the character Of Doc Ockt. In comparison to the first movie, the second was not quite as good through my eyes. However that may just be because I have a stronger taste for how heros get created, rather than what they are known for. I rated this movie an overall eight out of ten because it was very entertaining, but didn't quite live up to the hype.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A New Type of Effect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back in 2002, the first Spider-Man movie in the trilogy was released. While director Sam Raimi did a good job of making the movie, it was still lacking one thing: good character development. Now, in the summer of 2004, the second Spider-Man movie is released. "Is it better than the original?" numerous people will ask. That answer is definitely a yes, because Spider-Man 2 introduces a new type of special effect: the effect of character development.Spider-Man 2 begins with Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire), our hero with superhuman spider abilities, facing the problems of becoming a superhero. Peter's grades are slipping; he gets fired from his jobs; he feels bad that he didn't help prevent the death of his Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson); his best friend, Harry Osborn (James Franco), is angry at him for being fond of Spider-Man; and worst of all, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), the girl he is in love with, is mad at him for abandoning her to fight crime. And in turn, she has decided to marry John Jameson (Daniel Gillies), who is the son of Peter's boss J. Jonah Jameson (played by J.K. Simmons).And there's STILL a villain for Peter to fight. Dr. Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina) has four mechanical metal arms welded onto his body after a fusion energy source accident, and becomes known as Doc Ock. Now, it's up to Spider-Man to stop Octavius before he manages to create another and larger fusion energy source and risks destroying the entire city!Other things have improved in Spider-Man 2 other than the addition of the new effect I just discussed. Special effects have improved dramatically, and Spider-Man moves more realistically. But the special effects also help make Dr. Octavius's four tentacles look and move extraordinarily, and therefore every scene with both Spider-Man and Octavius is amazing. Another thing that has improved is the screenwriting; screenwriter Alvin Sargent writes better dialogue and has better pacing, which works well during the dramatic and romantic sequences.While Spider-Man 2 is a very good movie, it's not absolutely flawless, but I only have one gripe. I just thought that Octavius's conclusion at the end was a bit clichd and predictable. I don't want to spoil the ending for you, but you'll understand once you see it.But overall, Spider-Man 2 is a very good movie and is improved dramatically by its added character development. As a final statement, I can't wait for the third installment in the trilogy!****1/2 out of ***** Rated PG-13 for intense action/violence</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>can't wait for spiderman 3</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most sequels can't hold a candle to the original, this one can. I wasn't sure what to expect but it was a pleasant surprise. The same wonderful cast with Tobey Mcguire in the lead role of Peter Parker, alias Spiderman, Kirstin Dunst reclaiming her role as the love of Peters life Mary JAne. It was nice to see that even Aunt May had a larger role this time with the problems she is facing since her husbands death, with the bank wanting to foreclose on her home. Peter (Spiderman) is having a change of faith and tries to leave Spiderman in the dust but realizes with great power comes great responsibility and gets back into it with dynamic results. Much better action scenes this time around, more natural looking. Would definitely go to see it again and recommend it to everyone, you will like the movie even if you are not a comic book fanatic. I wasn't and I thought it was great entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great movie that makes a true believer twitch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, forgive me. If I wasn't a complete geek, this movie would have gotten a 10. The entire movie was utterly awesome, and they managed to fit amazing action in with a very believable love story. So if you're not a life-long comic book fanatic, this movie will win high acclaim with you! Even if you are, you will thoroughly enjoy the movie. I suppose a few little details don't really seem "organic" to the plot line itself, like Doc Ock's creation story, but overall, it hung together pretty tight. Heck, they even wove some good Spidey classics in there. What the heck am I saying? I loved the movie! Why didn't I vote it a 10?&lt;&lt;&lt;SPOILER&gt;&gt;&gt;For those who have seen it, what was the POINT of Doc Ock's arms in his creation story, which was utterly lame? The plot could have easily carried on with him being a brilliant biophysicist or biomechanical engineer... even a computer science guru. The nuke was really not an essential end-of-city situation... it could just as easily been a swarm of nanotech machines that Doc Ock designed to cure people, but ended up reproducing and tearing people apart.... whatever. By no means would a physicist need four mechanical appendages to run a machine like the fusion reactor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good, yet not as good as the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just earlier today I saw Spider-Man 2. I thought the movie was very well done, especially in their animation. However, some of the scenes truly seemed as though they were lacking a point or were being repetitive. The storyline continued smoothly, but i don't feel they spent enough time trying to deliver the character Of Doc Ockt. In comparison to the first movie, the second was not quite as good through my eyes. However that may just be because I have a stronger taste for how heros get created, rather than what they are known for. I rated this movie an overall eight out of ten because it was very entertaining, but didn't quite live up to the hype.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A New Type of Effect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back in 2002, the first Spider-Man movie in the trilogy was released. While director Sam Raimi did a good job of making the movie, it was still lacking one thing: good character development. Now, in the summer of 2004, the second Spider-Man movie is released. "Is it better than the original?" numerous people will ask. That answer is definitely a yes, because Spider-Man 2 introduces a new type of special effect: the effect of character development.Spider-Man 2 begins with Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire), our hero with superhuman spider abilities, facing the problems of becoming a superhero. Peter's grades are slipping; he gets fired from his jobs; he feels bad that he didn't help prevent the death of his Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson); his best friend, Harry Osborn (James Franco), is angry at him for being fond of Spider-Man; and worst of all, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), the girl he is in love with, is mad at him for abandoning her to fight crime. And in turn, she has decided to marry John Jameson (Daniel Gillies), who is the son of Peter's boss J. Jonah Jameson (played by J.K. Simmons).And there's STILL a villain for Peter to fight. Dr. Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina) has four mechanical metal arms welded onto his body after a fusion energy source accident, and becomes known as Doc Ock. Now, it's up to Spider-Man to stop Octavius before he manages to create another and larger fusion energy source and risks destroying the entire city!Other things have improved in Spider-Man 2 other than the addition of the new effect I just discussed. Special effects have improved dramatically, and Spider-Man moves more realistically. But the special effects also help make Dr. Octavius's four tentacles look and move extraordinarily, and therefore every scene with both Spider-Man and Octavius is amazing. Another thing that has improved is the screenwriting; screenwriter Alvin Sargent writes better dialogue and has better pacing, which works well during the dramatic and romantic sequences.While Spider-Man 2 is a very good movie, it's not absolutely flawless, but I only have one gripe. I just thought that Octavius's conclusion at the end was a bit clichd and predictable. I don't want to spoil the ending for you, but you'll understand once you see it.But overall, Spider-Man 2 is a very good movie and is improved dramatically by its added character development. As a final statement, I can't wait for the third installment in the trilogy!****1/2 out of ***** Rated PG-13 for intense action/violence</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Excellent movie. Particularly liked the nice warm moment on the subway train when the people gather around Spidey.Funniest bit was when Doc Ock (in front of loads of press) attaches his never seen before AI enhanced mechanical arms to his spine using nano technology - and the assembled press all go "Yeah, move along" - like he'd just said "I am now going to stir this cup of tea WITH THIS TEASPOON !!!!". Like a guy needs to harness the power of the sun in his hand to get anyone's juices flowing...The only disappointment - Ms. Dunst looking like she'd just got out of bed in most scenes (except on her wedding day).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Forget the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm sure you may be tired of hearing this, but Spider-man 2 really did surpass the original in every way. It is not a sequel, but a continuation of a story. People who aren't into comic book characters will love this and the fans will adore it. It is a blessing to have Sam Raimi at the helm, directing this movie in such a way that no one else could have done better. Michael Chabon, one of the best screen-writers known was on board and made a great contribution to the film. Incredible feats in this film include a wide-scale chase throughout an El-Train, the amazing transformation of Otto Octavius to Dr Octopus, and a brawl inside and out of a bank. Great acting, great story, awesome effects, and a marvelous script. This one takes the cake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would like to say that SM2 was the best movie ever! The first one was great but as much as I loved it the 2nd one was way way way better. it had everything that a movie would need and i love it. i would watch it more than Pirates of the Caribbean and based on my screen name that is a lot of times. I recommend you to go see it and I bet you will walk out amazed and if you don't then you better not go see another action movie and stick to dull ones! It was full of action and love and anger and Peter Parker was never better. The actress and actors were so great in that movie and i think that they should be so proud of it! It deserves and Oscar and ever award that it is nominated for! You go Spder-Man!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This installment of Spiderman did the impossible: improved upon perfection. It's rare when a sequel can surpass the original. But in this case, it blew the original away. Doc Ock as portrayed in Spiderman 2 was an amazingly compelling comic book villain. This movie makes you hate to hate him, and that's why it was so great.The character development was superb, the action sequences (Especially the train) were the best among the comic book genre ever, it was full of humor and laugh out loud moments, and delivered to the very end.Deserving of being put among the top action movies of all time, including Raiders of the Lost Ark and Empire Strikes Back.I only had one problem with this movie: I didn't want it to end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Everything any person should want in a movie, darn it!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ahhh...... Spiderman 2.... what can I say... this movie was awesome. I love you, Spiderman! First, let's talk about the acting. Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, Alfred Molina, Rosemary Harris, and James Franco. Tobey Maguire, I must say, did a really good job of showing emotions, using humor, and giving Peter Parker/Spiderman a good character. Kirsten Dunst, still hot from the first movie gave another good performance. Rosemary Harris did an excellent performance with her experience in acting. Wow, Alfred Molina poured his heart into his performance of Otto Octavius/Doctor Octopus, in fact, I don't think anyone else could have done a better job of being the scientist turned villain. And James Franco, still good and without Willem Dafoe this time, not that it's a bad thing.Now, the story...SPOILERS, OH MY GOSH!!!...Peter Parker's life is thrashed and abused throughout the movie, and it left me feeling depressed and feeling bad for him, which made me happy because movies don't usually do that to me. Because of his life being thrashed, he begins to lose his powers and ultimately decides to stop leading a double life and throws his Spiderman costume in the trash. But when chaos erupts in the streets after he becomes Peter Parker again, he decides to become Spiderman again.On the other hand, there's Otto Octavius, a brilliant scientist who is trying to perfect interesting scientific stuff...you know what I mean... During a public experiment, though, while using his super special brain-powered tentacles, the experiment goes awry and his wife is killed along with his tentacles permanently attaching to his nervous system. He blacks out and is taken to a hospital in one of the most intense scenes that's not in a horror or war movie I have ever seen. Sam Raimi, the director of Spiderman, as many know, also directed Evil Dead, a really gory and cool B-movie, and this scene is hinting to the Evil Dead movie, I think. Anyways, the tentacles go crazy and kill all the doctors in the room and the doctors use chainsaws, yay!!! Well, Doc Ock decides to finish his crazy experiment in a rundown laboratory near the Brooklyn Bridge and Spidey goes to stop it and I'm not going to ruin that for you...On yet another hand, Mary Jane Watson, Harry Osborne, and Aunt May all have their problems with Spidey and Peter Parker. MJ has problems with Peter because he can't make time for her important things like her hit play on Broadway. Harry troubles Pete because of his "friendship" with Spidey. Aunt May troubles him with money problems and when Pete tells her the truth about Uncle Ben's death, she shuns him for a while...Finally, the graphics and sound... The first really cool sequence was when Octavius's experiment went awry; the sound was truly cool and the graphics went well with it... and Octavius's arms were looking real. Then Spidey and Ock's fight on the subway had me shaking in my seat... you'll see...All in all, this movie was crazy, cool, awesome, and hilarious with awkward moments like Spidey in the elevator and funny stuff like the violin player and J. Jonah Jameson. There are even surprise appearances by Stan Lee, creator of MARVEL COMICS, and Bruce Campbell, star of Evil Dead, who was really funny... And the end, the end sets up Spiderman 3 so well. I can't tell because it's like telling the end of the Sixth Sense, it would spoil the movie for you...Don't believe anyone who disses this movie... it can't be made fun of...That's my review, now go see the movie, DARN IT!!! **** out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What superhero movies would be like if left in the hands of the writers from the Oxygen network</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite the cynical title, allow me to preface this review by stating that I liked this film. I really, truly, genuinely did. In fact, I'll even take it one step further; this may be the VERY BEST SUPERHERO MOVIE _EVER_MADE...and that's coming from a fan, (though not a fanatic) of the genre.Why the ambivalence then? Because this movie is not perfect. In truth, it's far from perfect; it plays more like a rough draft or first cut of something that could be much better. What Spiderman 2 does do so successfully is introduce many new elements heretofore unseen in action movies: character, plot, drama, and real conflict. The director and writer are not content making Spidey and the people in his world one-dimensional comic-book cutouts (pardon the pun); instead, these are real characters, with real dilemmas, real feeling, and real conflicting sense of responsibility and desire. In other words, they are far more human. And successfully allowing viewers to be sucked in to another world, in which we can vicariously live through and observe others' conflicts and be riveted by what we see, is the hallmark of great film.The problem, in a nutshell, is that the movie does far too much of this. Sure, there are awesome special effects, great battle scenes, and wonderful vistas of real and computer-assisted, imagined New York (and Chicago standing in for New York; note train scene) but there is also almost as much melodrama and as many soap opera-ish momements in Spidey's world as you'd find in Susan Lucci. I got excited when I think I finally found one scene in which the major players' eyes did NOT well up with tears; they probably used more nitro-glycerine in this movie (or whatever chemical it is that they put into actors' eyes to create fake tears) than the number of doughnuts Albert Molina ate on set (and when you see how fat and blubbery this dude is in his sexy, revealing Dr. Octopus outfit, you'll know that that number ain't too small.) After a while, even the most seasoned Danielle Steel readers dragged into the audience by their violence-loving kids/husbands will start longing for another epic cartoon battle scene, rather than having to watch any more of James Franco's teary eye infection blown up on the huge screen scene after scene.But I admired the film. I really did. I think it will serve as a trendsetter for future action films. Hell, it may even be studied as an example of how one CAN make a film that incorporates wonderful fantasy violence, characters with super-human powers, bizarre villains etc. without insulting the intelligence of the audience and boring them to tears whenever the CGI doesn't have them gawking at the screen (are you listening, George Lucas?)The acting is uniformly good; Tobey Maguire, an actor I was never particularly impressed with (in no small part because we're about the same age, both actors, and while he's a mega-superstar, I'm sitting here writing reviews on IMDb at 12:44 AM), did a surprisingly excellent job. Kirsten Dunst is not just another pretty face, and whoever played Aunt May is clearly a seasoned actress. The only one I wasn't particularly thrilled with was Alfred Molina. I'm not certain if that's because he simply couldn't quite convey the same kind of electrifying excitement that other superhero villains have in recent years (Jack Nicholson, Willem Defoe, Gene Hackman) or because everytime he appeared on screen, I kept expecting him to rip off the tentacles, revealing a black caftan and a fuzzy hat, and break out into an impassioned, foot-stomping rendition of "Tradition". Kind of unsuspended my suspended disbelief. I've never understood why producers/directors of highly-anticipated, much-heralded, big-budget films choose not to sign the very *best* actors to play key roles. You know that Jeremy Irons, Alan Rickman, Patrick Stewart, and a host of other great middle-aged actors with funny accents would have been thrilled to play this role...why did they settle on the less-known, and far more droll Molina? Same goes for Hayden Christensen, but that comment is in that film's review.Speaking of disbelief, as I mentioned above, the writing is quite tight, and I loved the fact that they actually spent SOME of the $200 million dollar budget on writers who had taken courses in dramatic writing a tad more advanced than 7th Grade Haikus (are you listening George LUCAS?!) Nevertheless, there were a couple of scenes (cf. the doctor's conversation with Parker, and Aunt May's "Henry Jackson" speech) that seemed to come completely out of left field. They were clearly intended to push the plot/"with great powers come great responsibility" motif, but they were so contrived, and so out-of-flow with the rest of the seamless dialogue that those two scenes managed to unsuspend my suspension of disbelief. Those two scenes contained the only moments I'd reckon were entirely unbelievable in the film, and to be able to say that about a movie in which people fall from buildings without so much as a scratch, and a jumpy trapeeze dude in a Spider suit sets on a mission to stop a criminal with electric octopus hands from harnessing the sun's energy to destroy the world...well, that should tell you something about the overall terrible quality of the writing in those two scenes.All in all, a flawed film, about flawed human beings. But it's a trailblazer and a trendsetter nonetheless. Highly enjoyable, and I highly recommend it.</fullReview>

The first really cool sequence was when Octavius's experiment went awry; the sound was truly cool and the graphics went well with it... and Octavius's arms were looking real. Then Spidey and Ock's fight on the subway had me shaking in my seat... you'll see...All in all, this movie was crazy, cool, awesome, and hilarious with awkward moments like Spidey in the elevator and funny stuff like the violin player and J. Jonah Jameson. There are even surprise appearances by Stan Lee, creator of MARVEL COMICS, and Bruce Campbell, star of Evil Dead, who was really funny... And the end, the end sets up Spiderman 3 so well. I can't tell because it's like telling the end of the Sixth Sense, it would spoil the movie for you...Don't believe anyone who disses this movie... it can't be made fun of...That's my review, now go see the movie, DARN IT!!! **** out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What superhero movies would be like if left in the hands of the writers from the Oxygen network</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite the cynical title, allow me to preface this review by stating that I liked this film. I really, truly, genuinely did. In fact, I'll even take it one step further; this may be the VERY BEST SUPERHERO MOVIE _EVER_MADE...and that's coming from a fan, (though not a fanatic) of the genre.Why the ambivalence then? Because this movie is not perfect. In truth, it's far from perfect; it plays more like a rough draft or first cut of something that could be much better. What Spiderman 2 does do so successfully is introduce many new elements heretofore unseen in action movies: character, plot, drama, and real conflict. The director and writer are not content making Spidey and the people in his world one-dimensional comic-book cutouts (pardon the pun); instead, these are real characters, with real dilemmas, real feeling, and real conflicting sense of responsibility and desire. In other words, they are far more human. And successfully allowing viewers to be sucked in to another world, in which we can vicariously live through and observe others' conflicts and be riveted by what we see, is the hallmark of great film.The problem, in a nutshell, is that the movie does far too much of this. Sure, there are awesome special effects, great battle scenes, and wonderful vistas of real and computer-assisted, imagined New York (and Chicago standing in for New York; note train scene) but there is also almost as much melodrama and as many soap opera-ish momements in Spidey's world as you'd find in Susan Lucci. I got excited when I think I finally found one scene in which the major players' eyes did NOT well up with tears; they probably used more nitro-glycerine in this movie (or whatever chemical it is that they put into actors' eyes to create fake tears) than the number of doughnuts Albert Molina ate on set (and when you see how fat and blubbery this dude is in his sexy, revealing Dr. Octopus outfit, you'll know that that number ain't too small.) After a while, even the most seasoned Danielle Steel readers dragged into the audience by their violence-loving kids/husbands will start longing for another epic cartoon battle scene, rather than having to watch any more of James Franco's teary eye infection blown up on the huge screen scene after scene.But I admired the film. I really did. I think it will serve as a trendsetter for future action films. Hell, it may even be studied as an example of how one CAN make a film that incorporates wonderful fantasy violence, characters with super-human powers, bizarre villains etc. without insulting the intelligence of the audience and boring them to tears whenever the CGI doesn't have them gawking at the screen (are you listening, George Lucas?)The acting is uniformly good; Tobey Maguire, an actor I was never particularly impressed with (in no small part because we're about the same age, both actors, and while he's a mega-superstar, I'm sitting here writing reviews on IMDb at 12:44 AM), did a surprisingly excellent job. Kirsten Dunst is not just another pretty face, and whoever played Aunt May is clearly a seasoned actress. The only one I wasn't particularly thrilled with was Alfred Molina. I'm not certain if that's because he simply couldn't quite convey the same kind of electrifying excitement that other superhero villains have in recent years (Jack Nicholson, Willem Defoe, Gene Hackman) or because everytime he appeared on screen, I kept expecting him to rip off the tentacles, revealing a black caftan and a fuzzy hat, and break out into an impassioned, foot-stomping rendition of "Tradition". Kind of unsuspended my suspended disbelief. I've never understood why producers/directors of highly-anticipated, much-heralded, big-budget films choose not to sign the very *best* actors to play key roles. You know that Jeremy Irons, Alan Rickman, Patrick Stewart, and a host of other great middle-aged actors with funny accents would have been thrilled to play this role...why did they settle on the less-known, and far more droll Molina? Same goes for Hayden Christensen, but that comment is in that film's review.Speaking of disbelief, as I mentioned above, the writing is quite tight, and I loved the fact that they actually spent SOME of the $200 million dollar budget on writers who had taken courses in dramatic writing a tad more advanced than 7th Grade Haikus (are you listening George LUCAS?!) Nevertheless, there were a couple of scenes (cf. the doctor's conversation with Parker, and Aunt May's "Henry Jackson" speech) that seemed to come completely out of left field. They were clearly intended to push the plot/"with great powers come great responsibility" motif, but they were so contrived, and so out-of-flow with the rest of the seamless dialogue that those two scenes managed to unsuspend my suspension of disbelief. Those two scenes contained the only moments I'd reckon were entirely unbelievable in the film, and to be able to say that about a movie in which people fall from buildings without so much as a scratch, and a jumpy trapeeze dude in a Spider suit sets on a mission to stop a criminal with electric octopus hands from harnessing the sun's energy to destroy the world...well, that should tell you something about the overall terrible quality of the writing in those two scenes.All in all, a flawed film, about flawed human beings. But it's a trailblazer and a trendsetter nonetheless. Highly enjoyable, and I highly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Most sequels can't hold a candle to the original, this one can. I wasn't sure what to expect but it was a pleasant surprise. The same wonderful cast with Tobey Mcguire in the lead role of Peter Parker, alias Spiderman, Kirstin Dunst reclaiming her role as the love of Peters life Mary JAne. It was nice to see that even Aunt May had a larger role this time with the problems she is facing since her husbands death, with the bank wanting to foreclose on her home. Peter (Spiderman) is having a change of faith and tries to leave Spiderman in the dust but realizes with great power comes great responsibility and gets back into it with dynamic results. Much better action scenes this time around, more natural looking. Would definitely go to see it again and recommend it to everyone, you will like the movie even if you are not a comic book fanatic.

		<fullReview>Just earlier today I saw Spider-Man 2. I thought the movie was very well done, especially in their animation. However, some of the scenes truly seemed as though they were lacking a point or were being repetitive. The storyline continued smoothly, but i don't feel they spent enough time trying to deliver the character Of Doc Ockt. In comparison to the first movie, the second was not quite as good through my eyes. However that may just be because I have a stronger taste for how heros get created, rather than what they are known for.

		<shortDescription>A New Type of Effect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back in 2002, the first Spider-Man movie in the trilogy was released. While director Sam Raimi did a good job of making the movie, it was still lacking one thing: good character development. Now, in the summer of 2004, the second Spider-Man movie is released. "Is it better than the original?" numerous people will ask. That answer is definitely a yes, because Spider-Man 2 introduces a new type of special effect: the effect of character development.Spider-Man 2 begins with Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire), our hero with superhuman spider abilities, facing the problems of becoming a superhero. Peter's grades are slipping; he gets fired from his jobs; he feels bad that he didn't help prevent the death of his Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson); his best friend, Harry Osborn (James Franco), is angry at him for being fond of Spider-Man; and worst of all, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), the girl he is in love with, is mad at him for abandoning her to fight crime. And in turn, she has decided to marry John Jameson (Daniel Gillies), who is the son of Peter's boss J. Jonah Jameson (played by J.K. Simmons).And there's STILL a villain for Peter to fight. Dr. Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina) has four mechanical metal arms welded onto his body after a fusion energy source accident, and becomes known as Doc Ock. Now, it's up to Spider-Man to stop Octavius before he manages to create another and larger fusion energy source and risks destroying the entire city!Other things have improved in Spider-Man 2 other than the addition of the new effect I just discussed. Special effects have improved dramatically, and Spider-Man moves more realistically. But the special effects also help make Dr. Octavius's four tentacles look and move extraordinarily, and therefore every scene with both Spider-Man and Octavius is amazing. Another thing that has improved is the screenwriting; screenwriter Alvin Sargent writes better dialogue and has better pacing, which works well during the dramatic and romantic sequences.While Spider-Man 2 is a very good movie, it's not absolutely flawless, but I only have one gripe. I just thought that Octavius's conclusion at the end was a bit clichd and predictable. I don't want to spoil the ending for you, but you'll understand once you see it.But overall, Spider-Man 2 is a very good movie and is improved dramatically by its added character development. As a final statement, I can't wait for the third installment in the trilogy!****1/2 out of ***** Rated PG-13 for intense action/violence</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Enjoyable (small spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spidey vs. Doc Ock and the usual travails of life. I'm one of the six people in America who haven't seen the original, so this was all fresh for me. I, of course, know the general mythos: Spiderman is basically a realistic Superman. He isn't just "nerd-like", he's an authentic nerd. His boss isn't just irascible, he demeans Parker and spends his days trying to destroy Spiderman. Etc. The joke in Spiderman is that being a super-hero doesn't do much to help you in daily life. The movie is well cast. Tobey Maguire is a very fragile Spiderman: he seems bowled over by the pressures of his life. It's a very interesting portrayal -- true to the character, but different than most superhero stuff we see on the screen (who are usually larger than life). It's best dramatized by the best sequence in the movie, an abolutely knockout fight scene that starts on a skyscraper and moves to a train. (The CGI effects throughout are exceptional). The other real highlight of the movie is the script, which is thoughtful and delicately done (an odd observation, but you don't usually see restraint in a superhero movie). The movie's been compared to SUPERMAN 2, and there's a little of that, but a closer comparison, I think, is BATMAN 2, with its themes of identity and "who's the real guy under the mask". I've always liked BATMAN 2, but I have to say this movie is better, far more coherent and engaging (while coming to the same basic conclusion).Well directed by Raimi, who has the rare gift of poking gentle fun at his story without ever condescending to it. (The elevator sequence is priceless). Kirsten Dunst is appealing in the always-limited role of "the girl"; Alfred Molina plays an occasionally sympathetic bad guy, and J.K. Simmons is the definitive Jonah Jameson.</fullReview>

Is way out better than the first one.Perfect mix of superb special effects, comedy relief and story, and achieving the almost impossible task of giving a human face to a comic book hero.Though CGI is still CGI, it is such a nice improvement over the first one, that 95% of the time you just forget it is there and pay attention to the movie and not to how fake or real it looks.To sum it all up: GO SEE IT, it's worth twice the ticket price.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Spider-man 2" is a much more serious movie than the original. This may catch fans of the first movie by surprise. Gone is the lightheartedness of nerdy Peter Parker's life (there may an odd scene here), gone is the sweet puppy love between Parker and MJ (here it's full on heart breaking, soul searching love)and gone is the joy of discovery of powers and responsibility (here it's about finding the right balance). For about the first 90 minutes of THIS movie Peter Parker can't catch a break. He loses (among other things) his faith, his ideals, and his reason for putting on the costume.The action is also very paced out in the movie, with the three major action scenes coming in the second half. There are interludes of speech which are deftly written, but makes the viewer pine for the movie to kick into high gear. When it does though, oh boy (!) does it deliver - the piece de resistance being a train sequence that puts movies like 'Speed' to shame. Each one of the action sequences are masterful, and it is evident where the money has been spent in this movie. Watching Spidey swing through NYC is sheer exuberance.Yet the brilliance lies in the depth of this movie, what some may believe is boring exposition, but don't be fooled. Raimi and co. have crafted a wonderful movie here. I just felt it could have been 10 minutes shorter.True to form, the movie ends on a spectacularly high note while setting up the sequel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>without going too much into details, this is a great, fun-filled movie that stands on its own and is a great sequel. They really touch on a lot of things but it all meshes very well. you have peter/spiderman fighting his own insecurities combined with the threat of doc ock, plus harry osbornes hatred of his alter ego, his feelings for MJ etc. its all combined quite nicely and the story flows. the spidey vs. doc ock scenes are splendid and the train scene had me clutching my girl in disbelief. all in all and great summertime flick that i will gladly see again. 9/10 cause very few things are perfect, namely lord of the rings. if you don't like this flick, you probably are either taking it too seriously or are not really a spidey fan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spider-man two is not about a big struggle between Spider-man and Dr Otto Octavius but is the struggle between Spider-man and Peter Parker...the real man behind the mask.I would like to congratulate Sam Raimi and the team for pulling of not just a top- notch comic book adaptation of Spider-man in the first and Second Movie, but the way they crafted it so full and abundant in story, character, and entertainment. The actors Tobey, Kirsten and Franco draw deeper into there characters, expanding on what they accomplished in film one. So many themes were interwoven yet not one felt out of place. The cinematography and music in the film is mind-blowing...only what one can expect from Raimi's style and Elfmans musical flair. The humour was funnier than your average comedy trying its hardest to be funny, because they didn't have heart...and plus movie two is the best time to pull out the spidey-in-jokes...like the worst way spider-man can be caught going down a building!!!Spider-man 2 sees the now infamous hero two years later on and still going strong. But not for Mr Parker. Because he spends all his time fighting crime and spinning webs, he is now facing serious issues with his life, love and friendships which causes Peter to have to chose one ego from the other. Not a good time for out friendly neighbourhood spider man to be having an identity crisis when the newest villain to hit the streets, with his out of control tentacles and obsessions, will have no-one stand in the way of his project.Doctor Octopus is by far the greatest villain to hit the cinema screens...to me that is...and not only has an actor been chosen who takes on the character with great dept and talent, but aided through spectacular visual effects this dude comes alive like no one would believe. If fact here's to the effects department for creating the magnificent visuals, not too realistic, but still effective in a comic book way.I give this a 10/10 because it deserves it. It is a movie i would make.</fullReview>

I was confident this movie would not be good but I was mistaken. This has to be one of the best sequels ever. When I talk about great sequels I mean Godfather 2, Empire Strikes Back... This definitely compares to that by giving amazing fight scenes and having a great plot. The movie might seem to have a dialogue of a 2nd grade level once in a while but you have to remember that this movie was targeted to children. X-Men started last couple of years of Comic Films but Spiderman definitely remains on top for the best out there. I must say, this could be the movie of the summer!</fullReview>

This movie packs more visual punch than the first and spends time developing the intricacies of Peter's duality.The only thing I wonder is if this movie will be too intense for younger audiences. The operating room scene with Dr. Octavius was a true Raimi masterpiece of manic camera movements and dramatic editing, but I wondered for a moment if it was too violent for some of the younger kids...I would say that this movie has definitely taken the summer blockbuster title thus far...This movie is equal parts stunning, hilarious and brilliant!

		<fullReview>I just returned from the theatre on opening day and joined IMDb to share my excitement. This is no sophomore slump. Director Sam Raimi cements his position amongst the great directors after his early work in horror-comedy by lifting the summer blockbuster back to respectability. If this movie doesn't enter IMDb's top 50 by years end, I'll eat my hat. The screenplay is top notch. Kirsten Dunst and Tobey MacGuire communicate more in some scenes of this feature than many actors/actresses do with entire soliloquies. Special effects enter a new level of realism. A movie to sit back and enjoy that doesn't spell out simple points or try to communicate any deep hidden meanings. A good old-fashioned, edge of your seat escape that you will probably hear so much about, you'll be sick of it by the end of the summer. See it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spiderman 2 joins the small fraternity of sequels that surpass the original.Movies such as Aliens, Superman II, X-Men 2, Toy Story 2, and The Empire Strikes Back are included in this group. Like those other sequels, they do not simply repeat the first movie (something I think Shrek 2 did) but develop the characters better. They also introduce new characters. In this movie, they introduce Dr. Octopus who is a three dimensional character. He is a man obsessed with his work to the point of madness. He will do anything to finish his work no matter what. Meanwhile, Peter Parker feels he must choose between his life as Spiderman or be with the true love of his life, Mary Jane. Of course, these two plot lines must intersect at some point. Fortunately, how they do is very satisfactory. The ending does set the stage for Spiderman 3, which I am already looking forward to. Not just a great sequel but the best movie of the year so far. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You wont walk away disappointed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You know a film with this much hype tends to do nothing but disappoint for it never seems to completely live up to the expectations of such loyal and true fans; however Spiderman 2 is not one of those films. The ending was greeted by a standing ovation and the theatre had a sense in the air of a group of people who did not want it to end. I know I did not. Spiderman 2 delves deep into character development, along with providing breath taking action, edge of your seat suspense, and laugh out loud moments. Its darker, edgier, more action packed (as stated before), better written, and better acted than the first film. Its is unequivocally the best superhero film to date. If it cost 200 million to make this film then I think Columbia just made the best 200 million dollar investment cause it will make it back in one weekend and maybe even more. Those reading this, stop what you are doing, get dressed, and go see it. You wont regret it and neither will all the friends you tell about it! Go spidey!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spider-Man 2ward the next Golden Age</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spider-Man 2 is a bigger, better, and faster movie than the first. The story is continued by the opening credits summing up the last movie. The cast is all growing older and even the storytelling is getting wiser, this seems to be a trend set by the new Harry Potter, LOTR movies. Long gone are the days with sequels with different actors in the main parts (like the Batman movies). The serial type feel is reminiscent of the Golden Age of Hollywood. An Age where the studios had the money and held great control over their employees. Is this all too familiar Golden Age( that fell in the 60s and 70s) reemerging? And if so, how would an independent filmmaker feel about participating in it?What has been evident in both of the Spiderman movies has been it's uncanny ability to borrow from other films. The first Spiderman movie included the infamous Matrix move in slow motion, the Superman striped shirt move to change costumes, the Mission Impossible sweat dripping off the forehead replaced by blood suspense scene, the Batman disappearing in mid conversation technique, and the many clich superhero scenes including babies in burning buildings and such. The New Spiderman Movie continues to use these well-known cinematic devices. From the stomping thunderous noise of the T-Rex in Jurassic Park, and a multi tentacle operating scene gone wrong found in Independence Day, Sam Raimi continues to use the films we all know and love in his movie. He borrows or makes reference to all the big budget films that we have already paid to see again and again... But why?The major difference between the first Spiderman and the second is Sam's constant reminder that it's just a comic book movie we are watching. These constant reminders are expressed through exaggerated characters and a sort of satirical tone to keep the adults laughing and the kids watching. The acting is more of a symbolic act to convey the story to an audience of all ages. These tongue in cheek scenes found in the first movie are not as prominent in the second film. This was my major problem with the first movie. The movie never took itself seriously and instead of being afraid of the Green Goblin when he's going mad, like I was in Batman with the Joker, I was laughing.At the same time Sam Raimi's reminders work at making the film satirical it also (especially in Spiderman 2) works at making the film smarter and more artistic like Godard did in Breathless. Sam Raimi uses not only other Big Budget movies but his own Big Budget movie Spiderman to make references with in Spiderman 2. It?s in his juxtaposition of his first Spiderman movie to his second Spiderman movie that the film?s most interesting aspects lie. We relive moments from the first film and are able to compare and contrast are heroes progress with the second film (similar to the end of Back to the Future 2).We find ourselves in the burning building, his uncle's murder scene, and the rooftop where he made his first jump. This time Peter is facing new problems. The major problem being himself. The film conducts a very fresh and interesting study on Peter's condition. A type of soul searching goes on in the story that is more mature and interesting than anything found in the first movie. I believe the film is most interesting when placed in juxtaposition with the first movie in a way Coppola introduced with Godfather Part 2. The Superhero movies of today have become our modern monster movies. Heroes or romantic villains take on their traits of symbolic meaning. It?s not hard to believe those monster movies where also part of Hollywood 's Golden Age. And now with the many Blockbuster Summer movies aimed at are pocket books with clichs and all too familiar scenes, jokes and characters we seem to be entering another Golden Age. So how would an indie filmmaker feel about this "show BUSINESS"?Now I?m not sure if it was Raimi or the screenwriters? idea to include the film references; But if a major production company was going to entrust an indie filmmaker to make a big budget film what better a way to ensure the crowds and stick it to them with your own artistic rebellion at the same time than by showcasing the over formulized films that everyone already likes in a light that shows their plastic and artless form that has become our modern pop culture. Because this idea would give Raimi more of a reason than the screenwriters I tend to give him the credit.On an emotional appeal Spiderman 2 makes you laugh, bite your nails, and feel overly sympathetic toward our friendly neighborhood Spiderman.Overall, watch for Raimi's many film references/influences and the juxtaposition not only between Spiderman and Spiderman 2 but Peter Parker and Doc Octopus. James Franco gives an incredible performance considering the world the acting is taking place in. And watch for how quickly he can muster pain, tears and charisma. One of the greatest scenes takes place in an elevator between Spidey and one of his neighborhood friends. The scene conveys in the truest sense Raimi?s take on Spiderman. Raimi's ideas expressed here and Spielberg's expressed in the Terminal could start the first American New Wave of intellectual and highly marketable films that represent the times as well as the artist and culture.Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>SPIDERMAN 2 ROCKS!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPIDERMAN 2 ROCKS!!! The sequel was way better than the first; lots of action and cool visual effects. Well, as most people know or should know, Peter Parker's alter ego is Spiderman, the web-slinging hero who keeps the bad guys in check; in doing so, he must give up the things he wants most, MJ or Mary Jane and what he wants most: a normal life. In spider man 2 he is faced w/ challenges and difficult choices. Dr. Otto Octavius, Doc Ock, is now one of my favorite villains and by far out does Spidey's other nemesis, the Green Goblin. After a freak accident, 4 mechanical arms are welded onto Dr. Octavius's body. The arms slowly turn him into a monster, physically and mentally. The thing about Doc Ock is, u can hate him for being the bad guy, yet like the good guy you know is underneath. Overall, Spiderman 2 deals with Peter's troubles and tribulations gracefully, turning this into the best summer movie yet.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>without going too much into details, this is a great, fun-filled movie that stands on its own and is a great sequel. They really touch on a lot of things but it all meshes very well. you have peter/spiderman fighting his own insecurities combined with the threat of doc ock, plus harry osbornes hatred of his alter ego, his feelings for MJ etc. its all combined quite nicely and the story flows. the spidey vs. doc ock scenes are splendid and the train scene had me clutching my girl in disbelief. all in all and great summertime flick that i will gladly see again. 9/10 cause very few things are perfect, namely lord of the rings. if you don't like this flick, you probably are either taking it too seriously or are not really a spidey fan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The amazing spider-man movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spider-man two is not about a big struggle between Spider-man and Dr Otto Octavius but is the struggle between Spider-man and Peter Parker...the real man behind the mask.I would like to congratulate Sam Raimi and the team for pulling of not just a top- notch comic book adaptation of Spider-man in the first and Second Movie, but the way they crafted it so full and abundant in story, character, and entertainment. The actors Tobey, Kirsten and Franco draw deeper into there characters, expanding on what they accomplished in film one. So many themes were interwoven yet not one felt out of place. The cinematography and music in the film is mind-blowing...only what one can expect from Raimi's style and Elfmans musical flair. The humour was funnier than your average comedy trying its hardest to be funny, because they didn't have heart...and plus movie two is the best time to pull out the spidey-in-jokes...like the worst way spider-man can be caught going down a building!!!Spider-man 2 sees the now infamous hero two years later on and still going strong. But not for Mr Parker. Because he spends all his time fighting crime and spinning webs, he is now facing serious issues with his life, love and friendships which causes Peter to have to chose one ego from the other. Not a good time for out friendly neighbourhood spider man to be having an identity crisis when the newest villain to hit the streets, with his out of control tentacles and obsessions, will have no-one stand in the way of his project.Doctor Octopus is by far the greatest villain to hit the cinema screens...to me that is...and not only has an actor been chosen who takes on the character with great dept and talent, but aided through spectacular visual effects this dude comes alive like no one would believe. If fact here's to the effects department for creating the magnificent visuals, not too realistic, but still effective in a comic book way.I give this a 10/10 because it deserves it. It is a movie i would make.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to say.. I was not excited about this movie. I thought the first one was a little entertaining, but was to long and just rubbed me the wrong way. I was confident this movie would not be good but I was mistaken. This has to be one of the best sequels ever. When I talk about great sequels I mean Godfather 2, Empire Strikes Back... This definitely compares to that by giving amazing fight scenes and having a great plot. The movie might seem to have a dialogue of a 2nd grade level once in a while but you have to remember that this movie was targeted to children. X-Men started last couple of years of Comic Films but Spiderman definitely remains on top for the best out there. I must say, this could be the movie of the summer!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, I am one of those geeks who loves all the campy Evil Dead movies... and that is what makes the triumph of this film franchise so much sweeter... to see Sam Raimi be able to retain his edge in film-making with a big Hollywood budget is truly an amazing feet. This movie packs more visual punch than the first and spends time developing the intricacies of Peter's duality.The only thing I wonder is if this movie will be too intense for younger audiences. The operating room scene with Dr. Octavius was a true Raimi masterpiece of manic camera movements and dramatic editing, but I wondered for a moment if it was too violent for some of the younger kids...I would say that this movie has definitely taken the summer blockbuster title thus far...This movie is equal parts stunning, hilarious and brilliant!

		<fullReview>I just returned from the theatre on opening day and joined IMDb to share my excitement. This is no sophomore slump. Director Sam Raimi cements his position amongst the great directors after his early work in horror-comedy by lifting the summer blockbuster back to respectability. If this movie doesn't enter IMDb's top 50 by years end, I'll eat my hat. The screenplay is top notch. Kirsten Dunst and Tobey MacGuire communicate more in some scenes of this feature than many actors/actresses do with entire soliloquies. Special effects enter a new level of realism. A movie to sit back and enjoy that doesn't spell out simple points or try to communicate any deep hidden meanings. A good old-fashioned, edge of your seat escape that you will probably hear so much about, you'll be sick of it by the end of the summer. See it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spiderman 2 joins the small fraternity of sequels that surpass the original.Movies such as Aliens, Superman II, X-Men 2, Toy Story 2, and The Empire Strikes Back are included in this group. Like those other sequels, they do not simply repeat the first movie (something I think Shrek 2 did) but develop the characters better. They also introduce new characters. In this movie, they introduce Dr. Octopus who is a three dimensional character. He is a man obsessed with his work to the point of madness. He will do anything to finish his work no matter what. Meanwhile, Peter Parker feels he must choose between his life as Spiderman or be with the true love of his life, Mary Jane. Of course, these two plot lines must intersect at some point. Fortunately, how they do is very satisfactory. The ending does set the stage for Spiderman 3, which I am already looking forward to. Not just a great sequel but the best movie of the year so far. 10/10</fullReview>

Its darker, edgier, more action packed (as stated before), better written, and better acted than the first film. Its is unequivocally the best superhero film to date. If it cost 200 million to make this film then I think Columbia just made the best 200 million dollar investment cause it will make it back in one weekend and maybe even more. Those reading this, stop what you are doing, get dressed, and go see it. You wont regret it and neither will all the friends you tell about it! Go spidey!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spider-Man 2ward the next Golden Age</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spider-Man 2 is a bigger, better, and faster movie than the first. The story is continued by the opening credits summing up the last movie. The cast is all growing older and even the storytelling is getting wiser, this seems to be a trend set by the new Harry Potter, LOTR movies. Long gone are the days with sequels with different actors in the main parts (like the Batman movies). The serial type feel is reminiscent of the Golden Age of Hollywood. An Age where the studios had the money and held great control over their employees. Is this all too familiar Golden Age( that fell in the 60s and 70s) reemerging? And if so, how would an independent filmmaker feel about participating in it?What has been evident in both of the Spiderman movies has been it's uncanny ability to borrow from other films. The first Spiderman movie included the infamous Matrix move in slow motion, the Superman striped shirt move to change costumes, the Mission Impossible sweat dripping off the forehead replaced by blood suspense scene, the Batman disappearing in mid conversation technique, and the many clich superhero scenes including babies in burning buildings and such. The New Spiderman Movie continues to use these well-known cinematic devices. From the stomping thunderous noise of the T-Rex in Jurassic Park, and a multi tentacle operating scene gone wrong found in Independence Day, Sam Raimi continues to use the films we all know and love in his movie. He borrows or makes reference to all the big budget films that we have already paid to see again and again... But why?The major difference between the first Spiderman and the second is Sam's constant reminder that it's just a comic book movie we are watching. These constant reminders are expressed through exaggerated characters and a sort of satirical tone to keep the adults laughing and the kids watching. The acting is more of a symbolic act to convey the story to an audience of all ages. These tongue in cheek scenes found in the first movie are not as prominent in the second film. This was my major problem with the first movie. The movie never took itself seriously and instead of being afraid of the Green Goblin when he's going mad, like I was in Batman with the Joker, I was laughing.At the same time Sam Raimi's reminders work at making the film satirical it also (especially in Spiderman 2) works at making the film smarter and more artistic like Godard did in Breathless. Sam Raimi uses not only other Big Budget movies but his own Big Budget movie Spiderman to make references with in Spiderman 2. It?s in his juxtaposition of his first Spiderman movie to his second Spiderman movie that the film?s most interesting aspects lie. We relive moments from the first film and are able to compare and contrast are heroes progress with the second film (similar to the end of Back to the Future 2).We find ourselves in the burning building, his uncle's murder scene, and the rooftop where he made his first jump. This time Peter is facing new problems. The major problem being himself. The film conducts a very fresh and interesting study on Peter's condition. A type of soul searching goes on in the story that is more mature and interesting than anything found in the first movie. I believe the film is most interesting when placed in juxtaposition with the first movie in a way Coppola introduced with Godfather Part 2. The Superhero movies of today have become our modern monster movies. Heroes or romantic villains take on their traits of symbolic meaning. It?s not hard to believe those monster movies where also part of Hollywood 's Golden Age. And now with the many Blockbuster Summer movies aimed at are pocket books with clichs and all too familiar scenes, jokes and characters we seem to be entering another Golden Age. So how would an indie filmmaker feel about this "show BUSINESS"?Now I?m not sure if it was Raimi or the screenwriters? idea to include the film references; But if a major production company was going to entrust an indie filmmaker to make a big budget film what better a way to ensure the crowds and stick it to them with your own artistic rebellion at the same time than by showcasing the over formulized films that everyone already likes in a light that shows their plastic and artless form that has become our modern pop culture. Because this idea would give Raimi more of a reason than the screenwriters I tend to give him the credit.On an emotional appeal Spiderman 2 makes you laugh, bite your nails, and feel overly sympathetic toward our friendly neighborhood Spiderman.Overall, watch for Raimi's many film references/influences and the juxtaposition not only between Spiderman and Spiderman 2 but Peter Parker and Doc Octopus. James Franco gives an incredible performance considering the world the acting is taking place in. And watch for how quickly he can muster pain, tears and charisma. One of the greatest scenes takes place in an elevator between Spidey and one of his neighborhood friends. The scene conveys in the truest sense Raimi?s take on Spiderman. Raimi's ideas expressed here and Spielberg's expressed in the Terminal could start the first American New Wave of intellectual and highly marketable films that represent the times as well as the artist and culture.Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>SPIDERMAN 2 ROCKS!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPIDERMAN 2 ROCKS!!! The sequel was way better than the first; lots of action and cool visual effects. Well, as most people know or should know, Peter Parker's alter ego is Spiderman, the web-slinging hero who keeps the bad guys in check; in doing so, he must give up the things he wants most, MJ or Mary Jane and what he wants most: a normal life. In spider man 2 he is faced w/ challenges and difficult choices. Dr. Otto Octavius, Doc Ock, is now one of my favorite villains and by far out does Spidey's other nemesis, the Green Goblin. After a freak accident, 4 mechanical arms are welded onto Dr. Octavius's body. The arms slowly turn him into a monster, physically and mentally. The thing about Doc Ock is, u can hate him for being the bad guy, yet like the good guy you know is underneath. Overall, Spiderman 2 deals with Peter's troubles and tribulations gracefully, turning this into the best summer movie yet.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>without going too much into details, this is a great, fun-filled movie that stands on its own and is a great sequel. They really touch on a lot of things but it all meshes very well. you have peter/spiderman fighting his own insecurities combined with the threat of doc ock, plus harry osbornes hatred of his alter ego, his feelings for MJ etc. its all combined quite nicely and the story flows. the spidey vs. doc ock scenes are splendid and the train scene had me clutching my girl in disbelief. all in all and great summertime flick that i will gladly see again. 9/10 cause very few things are perfect, namely lord of the rings. if you don't like this flick, you probably are either taking it too seriously or are not really a spidey fan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The amazing spider-man movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spider-man two is not about a big struggle between Spider-man and Dr Otto Octavius but is the struggle between Spider-man and Peter Parker...the real man behind the mask.I would like to congratulate Sam Raimi and the team for pulling of not just a top- notch comic book adaptation of Spider-man in the first and Second Movie, but the way they crafted it so full and abundant in story, character, and entertainment. The actors Tobey, Kirsten and Franco draw deeper into there characters, expanding on what they accomplished in film one. So many themes were interwoven yet not one felt out of place. The cinematography and music in the film is mind-blowing...only what one can expect from Raimi's style and Elfmans musical flair. The humour was funnier than your average comedy trying its hardest to be funny, because they didn't have heart...and plus movie two is the best time to pull out the spidey-in-jokes...like the worst way spider-man can be caught going down a building!!!Spider-man 2 sees the now infamous hero two years later on and still going strong. But not for Mr Parker. Because he spends all his time fighting crime and spinning webs, he is now facing serious issues with his life, love and friendships which causes Peter to have to chose one ego from the other. Not a good time for out friendly neighbourhood spider man to be having an identity crisis when the newest villain to hit the streets, with his out of control tentacles and obsessions, will have no-one stand in the way of his project.Doctor Octopus is by far the greatest villain to hit the cinema screens...to me that is...and not only has an actor been chosen who takes on the character with great dept and talent, but aided through spectacular visual effects this dude comes alive like no one would believe. If fact here's to the effects department for creating the magnificent visuals, not too realistic, but still effective in a comic book way.I give this a 10/10 because it deserves it. It is a movie i would make.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to say.. I was not excited about this movie. I thought the first one was a little entertaining, but was to long and just rubbed me the wrong way. I was confident this movie would not be good but I was mistaken. This has to be one of the best sequels ever. When I talk about great sequels I mean Godfather 2, Empire Strikes Back... This definitely compares to that by giving amazing fight scenes and having a great plot. The movie might seem to have a dialogue of a 2nd grade level once in a while but you have to remember that this movie was targeted to children. X-Men started last couple of years of Comic Films but Spiderman definitely remains on top for the best out there. I must say, this could be the movie of the summer!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, I am one of those geeks who loves all the campy Evil Dead movies... and that is what makes the triumph of this film franchise so much sweeter... to see Sam Raimi be able to retain his edge in film-making with a big Hollywood budget is truly an amazing feet. This movie packs more visual punch than the first and spends time developing the intricacies of Peter's duality.The only thing I wonder is if this movie will be too intense for younger audiences. The operating room scene with Dr. Octavius was a true Raimi masterpiece of manic camera movements and dramatic editing, but I wondered for a moment if it was too violent for some of the younger kids...I would say that this movie has definitely taken the summer blockbuster title thus far...This movie is equal parts stunning, hilarious and brilliant!

		<fullReview>I just returned from the theatre on opening day and joined IMDb to share my excitement. This is no sophomore slump. Director Sam Raimi cements his position amongst the great directors after his early work in horror-comedy by lifting the summer blockbuster back to respectability. If this movie doesn't enter IMDb's top 50 by years end, I'll eat my hat. The screenplay is top notch. Kirsten Dunst and Tobey MacGuire communicate more in some scenes of this feature than many actors/actresses do with entire soliloquies. Special effects enter a new level of realism. A movie to sit back and enjoy that doesn't spell out simple points or try to communicate any deep hidden meanings. A good old-fashioned, edge of your seat escape that you will probably hear so much about, you'll be sick of it by the end of the summer. See it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spiderman 2 joins the small fraternity of sequels that surpass the original.Movies such as Aliens, Superman II, X-Men 2, Toy Story 2, and The Empire Strikes Back are included in this group. Like those other sequels, they do not simply repeat the first movie (something I think Shrek 2 did) but develop the characters better. They also introduce new characters. In this movie, they introduce Dr. Octopus who is a three dimensional character. He is a man obsessed with his work to the point of madness. He will do anything to finish his work no matter what. Meanwhile, Peter Parker feels he must choose between his life as Spiderman or be with the true love of his life, Mary Jane. Of course, these two plot lines must intersect at some point. Fortunately, how they do is very satisfactory. The ending does set the stage for Spiderman 3, which I am already looking forward to. Not just a great sequel but the best movie of the year so far. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spider-Man 2ward the next Golden Age</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spider-Man 2 is a bigger, better, and faster movie than the first. The story is continued by the opening credits summing up the last movie. The cast is all growing older and even the storytelling is getting wiser, this seems to be a trend set by the new Harry Potter, LOTR movies. Long gone are the days with sequels with different actors in the main parts (like the Batman movies). The serial type feel is reminiscent of the Golden Age of Hollywood. An Age where the studios had the money and held great control over their employees. Is this all too familiar Golden Age( that fell in the 60s and 70s) reemerging? And if so, how would an independent filmmaker feel about participating in it?What has been evident in both of the Spiderman movies has been it's uncanny ability to borrow from other films. The first Spiderman movie included the infamous Matrix move in slow motion, the Superman striped shirt move to change costumes, the Mission Impossible sweat dripping off the forehead replaced by blood suspense scene, the Batman disappearing in mid conversation technique, and the many clich superhero scenes including babies in burning buildings and such. The New Spiderman Movie continues to use these well-known cinematic devices. From the stomping thunderous noise of the T-Rex in Jurassic Park, and a multi tentacle operating scene gone wrong found in Independence Day, Sam Raimi continues to use the films we all know and love in his movie. He borrows or makes reference to all the big budget films that we have already paid to see again and again... But why?The major difference between the first Spiderman and the second is Sam's constant reminder that it's just a comic book movie we are watching. These constant reminders are expressed through exaggerated characters and a sort of satirical tone to keep the adults laughing and the kids watching. The acting is more of a symbolic act to convey the story to an audience of all ages. These tongue in cheek scenes found in the first movie are not as prominent in the second film. This was my major problem with the first movie. The movie never took itself seriously and instead of being afraid of the Green Goblin when he's going mad, like I was in Batman with the Joker, I was laughing.At the same time Sam Raimi's reminders work at making the film satirical it also (especially in Spiderman 2) works at making the film smarter and more artistic like Godard did in Breathless. Sam Raimi uses not only other Big Budget movies but his own Big Budget movie Spiderman to make references with in Spiderman 2. It?s in his juxtaposition of his first Spiderman movie to his second Spiderman movie that the film?s most interesting aspects lie. We relive moments from the first film and are able to compare and contrast are heroes progress with the second film (similar to the end of Back to the Future 2).We find ourselves in the burning building, his uncle's murder scene, and the rooftop where he made his first jump. This time Peter is facing new problems. The major problem being himself. The film conducts a very fresh and interesting study on Peter's condition. A type of soul searching goes on in the story that is more mature and interesting than anything found in the first movie. I believe the film is most interesting when placed in juxtaposition with the first movie in a way Coppola introduced with Godfather Part 2. The Superhero movies of today have become our modern monster movies. Heroes or romantic villains take on their traits of symbolic meaning. It?s not hard to believe those monster movies where also part of Hollywood 's Golden Age. And now with the many Blockbuster Summer movies aimed at are pocket books with clichs and all too familiar scenes, jokes and characters we seem to be entering another Golden Age. So how would an indie filmmaker feel about this "show BUSINESS"?Now I?m not sure if it was Raimi or the screenwriters? idea to include the film references; But if a major production company was going to entrust an indie filmmaker to make a big budget film what better a way to ensure the crowds and stick it to them with your own artistic rebellion at the same time than by showcasing the over formulized films that everyone already likes in a light that shows their plastic and artless form that has become our modern pop culture. Because this idea would give Raimi more of a reason than the screenwriters I tend to give him the credit.On an emotional appeal Spiderman 2 makes you laugh, bite your nails, and feel overly sympathetic toward our friendly neighborhood Spiderman.Overall, watch for Raimi's many film references/influences and the juxtaposition not only between Spiderman and Spiderman 2 but Peter Parker and Doc Octopus. James Franco gives an incredible performance considering the world the acting is taking place in. And watch for how quickly he can muster pain, tears and charisma. One of the greatest scenes takes place in an elevator between Spidey and one of his neighborhood friends. The scene conveys in the truest sense Raimi?s take on Spiderman. Raimi's ideas expressed here and Spielberg's expressed in the Terminal could start the first American New Wave of intellectual and highly marketable films that represent the times as well as the artist and culture.Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>SPIDERMAN 2 ROCKS!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPIDERMAN 2 ROCKS!!! The sequel was way better than the first; lots of action and cool visual effects. Well, as most people know or should know, Peter Parker's alter ego is Spiderman, the web-slinging hero who keeps the bad guys in check; in doing so, he must give up the things he wants most, MJ or Mary Jane and what he wants most: a normal life. In spider man 2 he is faced w/ challenges and difficult choices. Dr. Otto Octavius, Doc Ock, is now one of my favorite villains and by far out does Spidey's other nemesis, the Green Goblin. After a freak accident, 4 mechanical arms are welded onto Dr. Octavius's body. The arms slowly turn him into a monster, physically and mentally. The thing about Doc Ock is, u can hate him for being the bad guy, yet like the good guy you know is underneath. Overall, Spiderman 2 deals with Peter's troubles and tribulations gracefully, turning this into the best summer movie yet.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>without going too much into details, this is a great, fun-filled movie that stands on its own and is a great sequel. They really touch on a lot of things but it all meshes very well. you have peter/spiderman fighting his own insecurities combined with the threat of doc ock, plus harry osbornes hatred of his alter ego, his feelings for MJ etc. its all combined quite nicely and the story flows. the spidey vs. doc ock scenes are splendid and the train scene had me clutching my girl in disbelief. all in all and great summertime flick that i will gladly see again. 9/10 cause very few things are perfect, namely lord of the rings. if you don't like this flick, you probably are either taking it too seriously or are not really a spidey fan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The amazing spider-man movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spider-man two is not about a big struggle between Spider-man and Dr Otto Octavius but is the struggle between Spider-man and Peter Parker...the real man behind the mask.I would like to congratulate Sam Raimi and the team for pulling of not just a top- notch comic book adaptation of Spider-man in the first and Second Movie, but the way they crafted it so full and abundant in story, character, and entertainment. The actors Tobey, Kirsten and Franco draw deeper into there characters, expanding on what they accomplished in film one. So many themes were interwoven yet not one felt out of place. The cinematography and music in the film is mind-blowing...only what one can expect from Raimi's style and Elfmans musical flair. The humour was funnier than your average comedy trying its hardest to be funny, because they didn't have heart...and plus movie two is the best time to pull out the spidey-in-jokes...like the worst way spider-man can be caught going down a building!!!Spider-man 2 sees the now infamous hero two years later on and still going strong. But not for Mr Parker. Because he spends all his time fighting crime and spinning webs, he is now facing serious issues with his life, love and friendships which causes Peter to have to chose one ego from the other. Not a good time for out friendly neighbourhood spider man to be having an identity crisis when the newest villain to hit the streets, with his out of control tentacles and obsessions, will have no-one stand in the way of his project.Doctor Octopus is by far the greatest villain to hit the cinema screens...to me that is...and not only has an actor been chosen who takes on the character with great dept and talent, but aided through spectacular visual effects this dude comes alive like no one would believe. If fact here's to the effects department for creating the magnificent visuals, not too realistic, but still effective in a comic book way.I give this a 10/10 because it deserves it. It is a movie i would make.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to say.. I was not excited about this movie. I thought the first one was a little entertaining, but was to long and just rubbed me the wrong way. I was confident this movie would not be good but I was mistaken. This has to be one of the best sequels ever. When I talk about great sequels I mean Godfather 2, Empire Strikes Back... This definitely compares to that by giving amazing fight scenes and having a great plot. The movie might seem to have a dialogue of a 2nd grade level once in a while but you have to remember that this movie was targeted to children. X-Men started last couple of years of Comic Films but Spiderman definitely remains on top for the best out there. I must say, this could be the movie of the summer!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You wont walk away disappointed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You know a film with this much hype tends to do nothing but disappoint for it never seems to completely live up to the expectations of such loyal and true fans; however Spiderman 2 is not one of those films. The ending was greeted by a standing ovation and the theatre had a sense in the air of a group of people who did not want it to end. I know I did not. Spiderman 2 delves deep into character development, along with providing breath taking action, edge of your seat suspense, and laugh out loud moments. Its darker, edgier, more action packed (as stated before), better written, and better acted than the first film. Its is unequivocally the best superhero film to date. If it cost 200 million to make this film then I think Columbia just made the best 200 million dollar investment cause it will make it back in one weekend and maybe even more. Those reading this, stop what you are doing, get dressed, and go see it. You wont regret it and neither will all the friends you tell about it! Go spidey!</fullReview>

His excellent blend of drama and humor keeps the viewer's attention from beginning to end.Other comic book adaptations have relied too heavily on special effects. This movie (like the first one) continues to rely on compelling characters and gifted actors. The special effects are great, but they are also relevant to the story. Watching spiderman swing through the city is cool, but nothing captures the imagination as much as Peter Parker and his trials and tribulations.Comics are at their heart soap operas with super powers and spiderman 2 is a perfect example of how well this formula works.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie by far can be displayed in the superhero movie world as one of the greatest. I enjoyed it thoroughly. Even though people probably already wrote spoilers, I'm not spoiling anything! I want everybody to go see the movie for themselves. It's well worth the money. It picks up where the first one left off. Peter Parker still has problems with his "normal" life, and he still rocks the streets of New York as Spider-man....until one point, but you'll see it for yourself. And the villains are back with surprises. I've been THE Spider-man fan since I was probably 5 years old, and this movie helped captivate my dreams to life. Is the Second movie better than the First? Well, I loved the first as well and the second is a continuation (a wonderful one, I might add), so I'll have to say they're tremendously equal in their own ways. I wouldn't mind at all seeing it again in the theaters, and I'll definitely buy the DVD when it comes out. Let's just hope the Third sequel is just as good, or even better, with my fave Spider-man villain Venom in it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty disappointed with the whole thing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I say anything I just want to say that I am a HUGE fan of the first movie and of spider man in general so this isn't a bashing session, just my opinion. First of all what the hell happened the the one liners that spidey had in the first movie like "your the one that's out gobby, out of your mind!" or "hey kiddo why don't you be quiet and let mom and dad talk for a while?" It seems like they tried to make the movie much more serious for some reason and in trying to do that they made it more about peter parker than about spiderman, and isn't the movie called spiderman? I think they should have called this one peter parker because that's who I saw on screen for the majority of the 120 minutes. This movie wasn't a complete waste of time though, there were some good parts that made me think about how good the first movie was and how good this one could have been. But all in all I thought the acting, direction, screenplay, and pacing were not even close to being on par with the first movie, and for having over 2 years of high expectations for this film I was just let down. For number three maybe sam raimi should hire writers who have written action adventure before not writers who have only written crappy melodrama like this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a very entertaining movie, filled with lots of action.(spoilers light included) Things I liked: elevator scene between Spiderman and a yuppie commenting on spidey's "costume", The lady with the violin plucking out the spiderman theme and singing it with a VERY heavy accent. cgi on Dr. Octavius' appendages, Toby McGuire's sweet boyish shyness, Great ending implying more to come.Things I didn't like: CGI on Spidey in the fight scenes, I felt he almost looked like a cartoon. Girls in this movie (Kirstin Dunst and Mageina Tovah mainly) looking much to thin, I thought Kirstin Dunst looked much more appealing and girl next door in the first movie. Mageina Tovah's offers Peter Parker a piece of cake and all I could think was "girlfriend you need to eat the rest of that cake" . And the whole "Raindrops keep falling on my head scene" all I can say is OY! Lack of a great soundtrack and one good them song like the first one had. All in all a pretty great movie and I'm glad I went to see it, I rarely go to movies on opening night, for this one I made an exception.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Can I get a witness? BAM! As the credits rolled on in this two-hour extravaganza, I realized that I might have just witnessed history. For one, no other movie has cost $200 million to produce. Second, aside from the two great sequels of the past two decades [Godfather Pt.II and Empire Strikes Back] no other sequel has come close to it's predecessor. Well, from my experience, the budget and sequel will reward themselves. The movie will probably beat out "Return of the King" in revenue, and SP2 is, by far, better than than the latter.Without spoiling the emotional roller-coaster of a plot, the viewer should prepare themself for unharolded special effects [nothing comes close], physics defying acrobatics, a "coming of age" Peter Parker [whom everyone can relate too], a gut-wrenching love story, and conflict after conflict after conflict. All this in one movie and there is still one more episode to wrap up the trilogy! I hope the summer blockbuster season [a shout-out to Senior Lucas] can learn from this movie for years to come this one rule: SPECIAL EFFECTS MAKE A BLOCKBUSTER THE MONEY IT NEEDS TO MAKE A Sequel, BUT, SPECIAL EFFECTS BALANCED WITH A DYNAMIC STORY THAT TUGS AT YOUR HEART CREATES A CLASSIC.With that, I give Spiderman 2 a WELL DESERVED A+Peace.I'd also like to point out cameo appearances by...unh-uh...you'll just have to keep your eyes peeled; they're not hard to spot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went into this movie with high expectations and came out satisfied. To be honest, this movie went BEYOND my expectations. The Action, acting, plot, and FX were top notch. The movie delivered on ALL levels and its definitely worth seeing multiple times in the theaters alone. The action was a lot better than the first and was extremely intense. The train scene alone will knock your socks off. I could go on about the story and what not but I think it would be better for you to check it out yourself, besides i hate it when others spoil movies for me. In short, go see. You won't be disappointed. Now the next marvel stop for me is Blade Trinity (which they happen to show a preview for right before Spider-Man 2:))</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spider-man 2 is arguably the greatest superhero movie as of now. What really impressed me is how they can continue telling a good story into the second installment of the Spidey trilogy. This is very rare because sequels of movies like these tend to fail in telling a good story. This movie has some of the greatest CGI effects I've ever seen. Very impressive choreography and Sam Raimi's wimsical camera movements make every fight scene both enthralling and convincing. I can not tell you how many times CGI lets me down in action films. If CGI is crappy in a film, it ruins the whole illusion and you don't take the film seriously. Let me just tell you right now, SM 2 does not do this. Great story and character development. Great acting by Grace and Dunst. Supperb directing by a Raimi. Spider-man 2 is sure to please almost any audience. 8/10 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Go see this movie... that is all that needs to be said. From the opening credits to the final scene, I was once again memorized. The computer graphics are 10 fold better than the first, the story is better, the villain is stronger, the character are developed more and you feel more sorry for Peter than ever.It's so hard for a sequel to top the first one. The last time I saw this was Blade 2. I can't wait for the third movie to come out. Look like we'll have to wait another 3 years for that to happen.Personally I think Spider-man 3 should be 2 and half hours of him web slinging from building to building. I am just amazed. I saw the first one 5 times in the theater and I'm sure I will see this one at least 6 times before it is out.Predicted boxes office take for opening weekend: $210 mil.

		<shortDescription>Great sequel, possibly one of the best ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been thinking all day about this movie. I keep coming back across scenes and images that I thought were brilliant, and the more I think about it, the more I like this movie.If you liked the first movie, you will LOVE this movie. Easily.If you didn't like the first movie you MAY like this one. Many people who didn't like #1, have liked this movie. I won't say you will, but give it a chance.Tobey MCGuire is more polished in this movie, and does a great job of playing up the angst and difficulty of balancing his super life from his private one.James Franco proves with this movie why he is one of the best young actors today. His build as Harry from 1 to 2 is phenomenal.JK Simmons has far too much fun playing JJJ, and once again steals every scene he is in as Jameson.The real star of this movie is not Tobey, but Alfred Molina as Otto Octavius. He gives the role a depth and seriousness all the bowl cuts and bad euro accents the original comic book villain could never have. EVERY scene Molina is in is gold, and his villainous turn, while with a heavy dose of deus ex machina, even moreso than in the comic, is brilliant.The fight scenes are FAR better than the original, and blew me away at every turn.The first, to me, was more FUN. But Spiderman 2 is an out and out better film over all. I came out completely blown away, even with my high expectations.Go see it. Now. You more than likely will not regret it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spiderman 2 casts a strong web</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My spider senses are tingling over the next installment of Spiderman, number 2 to be exact. If only all sequels were half as good. Not only does it rock, but it also has oodles of heart and feeling to make this the best comic book adaptation to date. Yes, that's saying a lot but it just shows a healthy appreciation of the effort and results of doing a superior sequel to one of the most successful super hero films ever. Spiderman set box office opening records and garnered solid reviews. Just as X Men 2 improved on its original film, Spiderman 2 does an even better job with some significant enhancements to storyline and plot. In this story, Peter Parker, AKA Spiderman, is experiencing self-doubts about his purpose in life. His heroics are mocked and capitalized by the local newspaper editor J. Jonah Jameson (J. K. Simmons is a hoot) while his personal life takes a heavy toll. His love for Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) must take a back seat to his heroics lest she be in harm's way. Eventually he goes through what might be called super hero depression and starts to lose his powers. Meanwhile his best friend, Harry (James Franco), still vengeful about Spiderman supposedly murdering his dad in the previous film, is now head of the same technology firm and readying a new fusion power device with a scientist Dr. Octavius (played with gusto and depth by Alfred Molina). Naturally the experiment goes bad and Dr. Octavius is now part man and part machine dubbed Doc Octopus. Seeking more power, he trades the safe delivery of Spiderman to Franco in exchange for more nuclear elements to power a bigger fusion reaction. Add to this the kidnapping of Mary Jane in the clutches of Doc Oc and, well you get the picture, except it is done so well.Virtually the entire cast reappears from the original film whether in dream sequences or cameos, and they are refreshing to see again in the context of this film. Stan Lee makes his obligatory cameo as well as Ted Raimi (director Raimi's brother) as assistant to Jameson. Bruce Campbell (a long time Raimi crony) has an amusing cameo as a theater usher. Director John Landis is almost unrecognizable as Peter's doctor. (Trivia- Landis and director Raimi had cameos in the television adaptation of Stephen King's The Stand.) The villain, Doc Oc, is well played by Alfred Molina. James Franco's character does move forward is his character's arc, and there is a nice setup to the next film (which is certain). Rosemary Murphy as Peter's Aunt May has a significant presence in this film-her speech to Peter Parker midway through the story is truly a highlight as it marks the basic theme. Kirsten Dunst is adorable as ever. Tobey Maguire IS Spiderman?who else can engender the right mix of pathos and super heroics?The first half of the film is identical to the first film but it is in the second half where it takes the initial themes developed in first half and develops them to an emotional punch. And boy what a second half! Not only suspenseful and dramatic, Spiderman 2 is also wildly funny in places. There are some poignant moments of revelation and the story keeps upping the ante in really satisfying fashion. After all, Marvel Comics, the source for Spiderman, was unique when it imbued its heroes with emotions and problems. The spirit of Marvel lives on in this film's structure. Credit goes to a battery of writers especially Oscar-winning writer Alvin Sargent (Julia) who really delivers a first class script. The film doesn't feel the need to constantly bombard the viewer with nonstop explosions and chases. What's nice is that it takes its deliberate time to flesh out the storyline and characters without skimping on the appropriate action scenes. There is a tremendous set piece on an above ground New York subway train, which climaxes in a rousing and touching finish. Just that scene would have saved any movie. In this, it is one of several.As a treat for fans, references abound throughout the film to previous Spiderman incarnations such as the musical theme from the 60's animated show, the main title credits include key scenes from the first film, and, in particular, the memorable rain soaked kiss in the first film figures heavily here. Production values are good but the special effects are exceedingly impressive (better than before) especially the Doc Octopus sequences. Sam Raimi has made the perfect comic book for adults. The second half reaches levels that many films let alone comic book adaptations have aspired to but rarely reach. Raimi and company have set the bar extremely high for the next sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I loved it!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie by far can be displayed in the superhero movie world as one of the greatest. I enjoyed it thoroughly. Even though people probably already wrote spoilers, I'm not spoiling anything! I want everybody to go see the movie for themselves. It's well worth the money. It picks up where the first one left off. Peter Parker still has problems with his "normal" life, and he still rocks the streets of New York as Spider-man....until one point, but you'll see it for yourself. And the villains are back with surprises. I've been THE Spider-man fan since I was probably 5 years old, and this movie helped captivate my dreams to life. Is the Second movie better than the First? Well, I loved the first as well and the second is a continuation (a wonderful one, I might add), so I'll have to say they're tremendously equal in their own ways. I wouldn't mind at all seeing it again in the theaters, and I'll definitely buy the DVD when it comes out. Let's just hope the Third sequel is just as good, or even better, with my fave Spider-man villain Venom in it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before I say anything I just want to say that I am a HUGE fan of the first movie and of spider man in general so this isn't a bashing session, just my opinion. First of all what the hell happened the the one liners that spidey had in the first movie like "your the one that's out gobby, out of your mind!" or "hey kiddo why don't you be quiet and let mom and dad talk for a while?" It seems like they tried to make the movie much more serious for some reason and in trying to do that they made it more about peter parker than about spiderman, and isn't the movie called spiderman? I think they should have called this one peter parker because that's who I saw on screen for the majority of the 120 minutes. This movie wasn't a complete waste of time though, there were some good parts that made me think about how good the first movie was and how good this one could have been. But all in all I thought the acting, direction, screenplay, and pacing were not even close to being on par with the first movie, and for having over 2 years of high expectations for this film I was just let down. For number three maybe sam raimi should hire writers who have written action adventure before not writers who have only written crappy melodrama like this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a very entertaining movie, filled with lots of action.(spoilers light included) Things I liked: elevator scene between Spiderman and a yuppie commenting on spidey's "costume", The lady with the violin plucking out the spiderman theme and singing it with a VERY heavy accent. cgi on Dr. Octavius' appendages, Toby McGuire's sweet boyish shyness, Great ending implying more to come.Things I didn't like: CGI on Spidey in the fight scenes, I felt he almost looked like a cartoon. Girls in this movie (Kirstin Dunst and Mageina Tovah mainly) looking much to thin, I thought Kirstin Dunst looked much more appealing and girl next door in the first movie. Mageina Tovah's offers Peter Parker a piece of cake and all I could think was "girlfriend you need to eat the rest of that cake" . And the whole "Raindrops keep falling on my head scene" all I can say is OY! Lack of a great soundtrack and one good them song like the first one had. All in all a pretty great movie and I'm glad I went to see it, I rarely go to movies on opening night, for this one I made an exception.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Sequel - A definite must see for the summer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just returned from seeing Spider Man 2. This is an excellent adaptation of the classic comic book series. The sequel builds off the success and introduces the new villain of "Doc Ock". Each of the characters in the movie have grown and become more 3 dimensional in the second movie. Peter's struggle to come to terms with what he is has been well handled by Toby Maguire. Kirsten Dunst and James Franco both put in great performances. Dunst character has evolved to be more of an adult, while Franco's obsession with finding out who Spider Man, builds to a climatic end that I will not spoil for the readers of these comments. Spiderman had a balance of comedy, action and seriousness that made the 2 hours, plus of a movie go by well. I totally recommend anyone to see this film. Please note that this movie does have an elevated amount of violence that may scare younger children. Fans of the comicbook will be happily pleased with the overall results and Director Raimi's vision of staying true to the characters. Doctor Octopus is wonderfully played and the special effects are better this time around than in the first. One small "spoiler", look for the cameos in the film.Please go and see this film. You will not be disappointed at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Can I get a witness? BAM! As the credits rolled on in this two-hour extravaganza, I realized that I might have just witnessed history. For one, no other movie has cost $200 million to produce. Second, aside from the two great sequels of the past two decades [Godfather Pt.II and Empire Strikes Back] no other sequel has come close to it's predecessor. Well, from my experience, the budget and sequel will reward themselves. The movie will probably beat out "Return of the King" in revenue, and SP2 is, by far, better than than the latter.Without spoiling the emotional roller-coaster of a plot, the viewer should prepare themself for unharolded special effects [nothing comes close], physics defying acrobatics, a "coming of age" Peter Parker [whom everyone can relate too], a gut-wrenching love story, and conflict after conflict after conflict. All this in one movie and there is still one more episode to wrap up the trilogy! I hope the summer blockbuster season [a shout-out to Senior Lucas] can learn from this movie for years to come this one rule: SPECIAL EFFECTS MAKE A BLOCKBUSTER THE MONEY IT NEEDS TO MAKE A Sequel, BUT, SPECIAL EFFECTS BALANCED WITH A DYNAMIC STORY THAT TUGS AT YOUR HEART CREATES A CLASSIC.With that, I give Spiderman 2 a WELL DESERVED A+Peace.I'd also like to point out cameo appearances by...unh-uh...you'll just have to keep your eyes peeled; they're not hard to spot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spider-man 2 is arguably the greatest superhero movie as of now. What really impressed me is how they can continue telling a good story into the second installment of the Spidey trilogy. This is very rare because sequels of movies like these tend to fail in telling a good story. This movie has some of the greatest CGI effects I've ever seen. Very impressive choreography and Sam Raimi's wimsical camera movements make every fight scene both enthralling and convincing. I can not tell you how many times CGI lets me down in action films. If CGI is crappy in a film, it ruins the whole illusion and you don't take the film seriously. Let me just tell you right now, SM 2 does not do this. Great story and character development. Great acting by Grace and Dunst. Supperb directing by a Raimi. Spider-man 2 is sure to please almost any audience. 8/10 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spider-man 2 is arguably the greatest superhero movie as of now. What really impressed me is how they can continue telling a good story into the second installment of the Spidey trilogy. This is very rare because sequels of movies like these tend to fail in telling a good story. This movie has some of the greatest CGI effects I've ever seen. Very impressive choreography and Sam Raimi's wimsical camera movements make every fight scene both enthralling and convincing. I can not tell you how many times CGI lets me down in action films. If CGI is crappy in a film, it ruins the whole illusion and you don't take the film seriously. Let me just tell you right now, SM 2 does not do this. Great story and character development. Great acting by Grace and Dunst. Supperb directing by a Raimi. Spider-man 2 is sure to please almost any audience. 8/10 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Go see this movie... that is all that needs to be said. From the opening credits to the final scene, I was once again memorized. The computer graphics are 10 fold better than the first, the story is better, the villain is stronger, the character are developed more and you feel more sorry for Peter than ever.It's so hard for a sequel to top the first one. The last time I saw this was Blade 2. I can't wait for the third movie to come out. Look like we'll have to wait another 3 years for that to happen.Personally I think Spider-man 3 should be 2 and half hours of him web slinging from building to building. I am just amazed. I saw the first one 5 times in the theater and I'm sure I will see this one at least 6 times before it is out.Predicted boxes office take for opening weekend: $210 mil. Mark my words.RIP OUT</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have been thinking all day about this movie. I keep coming back across scenes and images that I thought were brilliant, and the more I think about it, the more I like this movie.If you liked the first movie, you will LOVE this movie. Easily.If you didn't like the first movie you MAY like this one. Many people who didn't like #1, have liked this movie. I won't say you will, but give it a chance.Tobey MCGuire is more polished in this movie, and does a great job of playing up the angst and difficulty of balancing his super life from his private one.James Franco proves with this movie why he is one of the best young actors today. His build as Harry from 1 to 2 is phenomenal.JK Simmons has far too much fun playing JJJ, and once again steals every scene he is in as Jameson.The real star of this movie is not Tobey, but Alfred Molina as Otto Octavius. He gives the role a depth and seriousness all the bowl cuts and bad euro accents the original comic book villain could never have. EVERY scene Molina is in is gold, and his villainous turn, while with a heavy dose of deus ex machina, even moreso than in the comic, is brilliant.The fight scenes are FAR better than the original, and blew me away at every turn.The first, to me, was more FUN. But Spiderman 2 is an out and out better film over all. I came out completely blown away, even with my high expectations.Go see it. Now. You more than likely will not regret it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My spider senses are tingling over the next installment of Spiderman, number 2 to be exact. If only all sequels were half as good. Not only does it rock, but it also has oodles of heart and feeling to make this the best comic book adaptation to date. Yes, that's saying a lot but it just shows a healthy appreciation of the effort and results of doing a superior sequel to one of the most successful super hero films ever. Spiderman set box office opening records and garnered solid reviews. Just as X Men 2 improved on its original film, Spiderman 2 does an even better job with some significant enhancements to storyline and plot. In this story, Peter Parker, AKA Spiderman, is experiencing self-doubts about his purpose in life. His heroics are mocked and capitalized by the local newspaper editor J. Jonah Jameson (J. K. Simmons is a hoot) while his personal life takes a heavy toll. His love for Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) must take a back seat to his heroics lest she be in harm's way. Eventually he goes through what might be called super hero depression and starts to lose his powers. Meanwhile his best friend, Harry (James Franco), still vengeful about Spiderman supposedly murdering his dad in the previous film, is now head of the same technology firm and readying a new fusion power device with a scientist Dr. Octavius (played with gusto and depth by Alfred Molina). Naturally the experiment goes bad and Dr. Octavius is now part man and part machine dubbed Doc Octopus. Seeking more power, he trades the safe delivery of Spiderman to Franco in exchange for more nuclear elements to power a bigger fusion reaction. Add to this the kidnapping of Mary Jane in the clutches of Doc Oc and, well you get the picture, except it is done so well.Virtually the entire cast reappears from the original film whether in dream sequences or cameos, and they are refreshing to see again in the context of this film. Stan Lee makes his obligatory cameo as well as Ted Raimi (director Raimi's brother) as assistant to Jameson. Bruce Campbell (a long time Raimi crony) has an amusing cameo as a theater usher. Director John Landis is almost unrecognizable as Peter's doctor. (Trivia- Landis and director Raimi had cameos in the television adaptation of Stephen King's The Stand.) The villain, Doc Oc, is well played by Alfred Molina. James Franco's character does move forward is his character's arc, and there is a nice setup to the next film (which is certain). Rosemary Murphy as Peter's Aunt May has a significant presence in this film-her speech to Peter Parker midway through the story is truly a highlight as it marks the basic theme. Kirsten Dunst is adorable as ever. Tobey Maguire IS Spiderman?who else can engender the right mix of pathos and super heroics?The first half of the film is identical to the first film but it is in the second half where it takes the initial themes developed in first half and develops them to an emotional punch. And boy what a second half! Not only suspenseful and dramatic, Spiderman 2 is also wildly funny in places. There are some poignant moments of revelation and the story keeps upping the ante in really satisfying fashion. After all, Marvel Comics, the source for Spiderman, was unique when it imbued its heroes with emotions and problems. The spirit of Marvel lives on in this film's structure. Credit goes to a battery of writers especially Oscar-winning writer Alvin Sargent (Julia) who really delivers a first class script. The film doesn't feel the need to constantly bombard the viewer with nonstop explosions and chases. What's nice is that it takes its deliberate time to flesh out the storyline and characters without skimping on the appropriate action scenes. There is a tremendous set piece on an above ground New York subway train, which climaxes in a rousing and touching finish. Just that scene would have saved any movie. In this, it is one of several.As a treat for fans, references abound throughout the film to previous Spiderman incarnations such as the musical theme from the 60's animated show, the main title credits include key scenes from the first film, and, in particular, the memorable rain soaked kiss in the first film figures heavily here. Production values are good but the special effects are exceedingly impressive (better than before) especially the Doc Octopus sequences. Sam Raimi has made the perfect comic book for adults. The second half reaches levels that many films let alone comic book adaptations have aspired to but rarely reach. Raimi and company have set the bar extremely high for the next sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought it would be hard to top the first movie. Sam Raimi didn't disappoint. Just from an entertainment standpoint, this movie was a 10 out of 10. It delivered on the points of writing, acting, action, and special effects almost flawlessly. I am beginning to see some potential in Kirsten Dunst as well. Tobey Maquire was great, the rest of the cast was beneficial to the whole of the movie as well. I especially liked the cameo of Bruce Campbell at the theater where Mary Jane performs. From the Evil Dead trilogy to spider-man, kick ass! Doc Ock was a great villain as well(I have never doubted Alfred Molina's acting ability). In recent years, when you put Sam Raimi and Danny Elfman together, you will witness a movie that is both visually and audibly superb. I haven't read the comic book so there are more than likely some issues as to the story's precision, but for the general populous this matters not. One of the best film's of the year(if not the best so far). I highly recommend seeing this one. As the critic of the St Louis post dispatch said, "Don't dismiss this film just because of it's basis being from a comic book."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spidey Really IS Amazing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw a sneak preview last night. OMG! Awesome! Great story, great writing. Someone was paying attention when they wrote this. If you're a comic book fan, you'll be amazed at the closely followed storyline(s) from the Spiderman comic. Not lots of action in the beginning, but it's interesting all the same. When the action starts, it doesn't stop. I was so stressed out by the end of this movie, but in a good way. There's always at least one problem with even a 10 rated movie - after all that action it goes to credits playing an incredibly lame song. It's just, it just doesn't fit. I know that seems petty but a pounding beat would have suited far better than the slow song that they chose.Tobey acts his butt off. His character is in a constant state of upset through the entire movie and you just feel for him. Alfred Molina is GREAT! Perfect casting. Everyone else is good too but they're not the focus of the story. A few surprises, especially at the end. Very cool. Gotta see it again. It's definitely worth paying full price for - you'll be glad that you did, Tiger.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just came back from a premier of Spider-man 2 and let me say that it is one of the best Superhero movies ever. Scratch that, it is one of the best MOVIES ever. Maybe i'm just riding the high of coming back from it but I don't know, I really don't think I'll change my mind anytime soon. I don't want to spoil anything so I won't but you gotta trust me on this and just go see it. I enjoyed every minute of it and wasn't bored for one second. I thought it handled the continuity of the previous movie well and it incorporated other elements from the Spider-man universes that really added to the franchise(movie). I was surprised how well they were to pull this off. This movie is far superior to Spider-man 1. Not that the first one wasn't good, I liked it a lot but this one just blows it out of the water IMO. Also being a big fan of Sam Raimi I was glad to see more "Raimi-isms" in the film. It seems like they gave several nods to the Evil Dead/Army of Darkness movies. Which was super cool the way the did it and didn't interfere with the movie at all. I was kinda of giddy when I was watching those scenes. Anyway, go watch it. It's a great movie. As I said, I think it's one of the best Superhero movies ever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Spiderman 2" is that rare case of an almost perfect film.It's funny, emotional, romantic and exciting, in that order. It'sMarvel-ously entertaining for young and old alike (we grew up withthis stuff, after all). And it's got the little touches that make anentertainment-movie worth watching twice ? at least?But above all, it's a film that's solidly grounded on its characters,and the actors behind them. Unlike action-revue-flicks like"Batman' or, more recently, "Van Helsing', "Spiderman 2' does notrely on the CGI-stuff alone to thrill its viewers. Instead, the tricksand gimmicks actually serve to enhance the story and underlinethe character-development. This, of course, revolves aroundSpidey's identity issue, about his coming to terms with his destinyof being a super-hero in spite of the havoc thereby wreaked on hisprivate life. He's a comic-book super-hero, and at the same time"he's just a kid' ? that's the formula that makes this movie work.FROM HERE ON THERE BE MINOR SPOILERS: A perfect examplecomes in one of the first scenes, when Peter Parker, who workspart-time in a Pizza-delivery-service, is late and has to resort to hisspidery powers in order to try and make the delivery deadline. It isquite significant and sets the tone of the film that in spite of hiseffort, Peter fails to arrive in time, thus losing his employee thepayment for the pizza and himself the job. The fact that he hasnetted a few more criminals on the way does not quite make up forthat defeat?This film being a true sequel and not just another installment ofthe same story, the plot of course picks up where the first film leftoff ? after an amazing, colorfully animated title-sequence thatrecapitulates what has happened before. Peter Parker aliasSpiderman (Tobey Maguire, who in "The Ice-Storm' wasn't castedas Elijah Woods brother for nothing: they're both able to portraythat blue-eyed mix of vulnerability and hidden strength) hasdecided to sacrifice his private life because "with great powercomes great responsibility'. He has abandoned the love-of-his-lifeMary Jane Watson (played once more beautifully by Kirsten Dunst),telling her that he feels nothing for her (he will do so several moretimes in this movie). His studies go from bad to worse and his richbuddy Harry (James Franco) keeps questioning him increasinglyroughly about Spiderman, whom he holds responsible for hisfathers death. Peter bears all this and more patiently ? until hispowers start to fail him? This is the perfect moment for the villainto enter the scene, the classical brilliant scientist overpowered byhis powerful invention, played adequately by Alfred Molina. (I knowothers were more impressed by Molinas performance, but hey,what can you expect of a guy who had to do most of his acting forthe role suspended in front of a blue-screen, supposedly beingcarried around by virtual tentacles... though I'll admit the heads ofthe tentacles are nice enough ? snakelike, "Matrix'-like livingmachines.) Talking about "Matrix': Later on in the film, Spiderman falls off abuilding in a jumping-scene that is once more strangelyreminiscent of "The Matrix'. Still later, when he has passed out, heis being carried overhead by several people, stretched out in acrucified position, just like the one adapted by Laurence Olivierand Kenneth Branagh in their "Hamlet'-films. Coincidence? I thinknot. Or is it really just another chance that we are given a ghosturging his son to take revenge? But then, what has "Hamlet' got todo with "Spiderman'? Go see the film and puzzle it out foryourselves!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK. So you've got to followup on one of the biggest blockbusters of the last few years. Your working with one of the most highly regarded Super Heros in comics. Can you possibly do it better?Like they say, it will make you laugh and it will make you cry. I guess you could say it follows the nature of the genre. It also carefully delivers the angst of Peter Parker. In another era we would speak of Zeitgeist. Today it's probably enough to say that it delivers it's emotional punches very well.There are a few moments that one might quibble about, were one in the mood, but I think that would essentially be sour grapes. There's one punch I knew was coming and I still jumped in my seat.I guess I can't wait for the next one, currently in production.Small spoiler follows *** The only time I had to laugh 'outside' the movie was the moment Peter enters the theater and the name over the door is Lyric. I'll say no more. End spoiler ***</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than the first one !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sam Raimi's 'Spiderman' was my all-time favorite superhero movie, so I have waiting this sequel so eagerly. Thankfully, Spiderman 2 is better than I was expecting. Most impressive thing is the action sequence between Spiderman and Doc Ock. It's really well scripted and pure adrenalin pumping experience. Special effects was pretty good and Alfred Molina and Tobey Maguire gave huge energy into CGI Character. Sometimes melodrama between MJ and Peter Parker was pointless and repetitive, but most of drama part was fairly good in this type of film. I think Alfred Molina (Doc Ock) is the best villain ever in comic book adaptation (except Willem Dafoe) and rest of casting was great. Unlike the first movie it has a little scary moments - it's Sam Raimi's gift- and Danny Elfman's music changed the mood very effectively. Overall "Spiderman 2" is a great film in all directions and I think 'Spiderman 2' is gonna be the best box-office this year. If you enjoyed the first film, go to multiplex it's worth your time and money.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am one of the lucky few to win a pair of premiere viewing tickets for this movie!!! First of all, this sequel is way better than the first! More comedy, more action, and of course more spider-man. Good plot twists! Surprising cameos! The action scenes gave me an adrenaline rush. A couple of slow parts but only to give the plot life. The characters were well played. Like most of us, we all go through bad times and also good. In one scene you'll feel bad and in another you'll feel good. Most likely, the hardcore fans will be pleased. Doc Ock is one evil dude. Overall, the movie was pure entertainment which will leave you wondering, WOW! What's next?? I know some people will find some kind of minor flaw in this movie, but do not be convinced by those pessimistics!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's all in the pacing...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Probably the best comic-book movie ever.. and certainly a blockbuster which is added to the "much better than the first" sequels list. Spider-Man 2 has its high melodrama. Some of the scenes, like those with Rosemary Harris, are heartfelt but they feel as if they belong in family films. Perhaps that combined with the romance plot could drive off the cheers of some comic book fans and teenage or middle-aged males looking for action. Really, this movie should appeal to the kids, girls (especially teen girls), moms, and grandparents who watch it too because the softer side does do the trick, even if a little forcefully. Personally though, the movie had some nonstop action scenes. Doctor Octopus, whose very concept could seem hilarious to some people, is done VERY well. Alfred Molina is possibly the best acted comic-book villain ever, save for maybe Sir Ian Mckellen's Magneto. He brings a horror film villain feel to the role, and does extremely well interacting with those robotic tentacles. Personally I think that the combination of the tentacles and Molina steal the show at certain points. The physics are maybe absurd here (the cg "fusion" experiment, the train, some of the web tricks, the climactic battle's solution, (how are the tentacles powered, anyone?), and much more) but you can blame that on the comic book. Ah, and then the self-confidence plot, the true drive behind the film. I myself identified with Peter Parker's woes. I've been through many of them - being late to a deadend job, exhaustion, studying troubles, problems dedicating to the girl due to worrying for her, a mean boss, guilt with the family, and many more. The film starts out with these issues and has some unique ways to keep your interest in Spidey's fate as Parker. The romance too is very classic. I felt as heartbroken as Toby Maguire's Spidey during moments like when he had to take photos at a snobby high society gathering - of his love Mary Jane with... well I'll let the film surprise you with that one. Sam Raimi's pacing is perfect. It felt like a collection of comic books, like a nice long storyarc. There were highs and lows, as well as suspense that tops even Evil Dead 2's manically frantic chills and thrills. Definitely on par with X2, if not better. And certainly a greater film with the general audience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK. So you've got to followup on one of the biggest blockbusters of the last few years. Your working with one of the most highly regarded Super Heros in comics. Can you possibly do it better?Like they say, it will make you laugh and it will make you cry. I guess you could say it follows the nature of the genre. It also carefully delivers the angst of Peter Parker. In another era we would speak of Zeitgeist. Today it's probably enough to say that it delivers it's emotional punches very well.There are a few moments that one might quibble about, were one in the mood, but I think that would essentially be sour grapes. There's one punch I knew was coming and I still jumped in my seat.I guess I can't wait for the next one, currently in production.Small spoiler follows *** The only time I had to laugh 'outside' the movie was the moment Peter enters the theater and the name over the door is Lyric. I'll say no more. End spoiler ***</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than the first one !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sam Raimi's 'Spiderman' was my all-time favorite superhero movie, so I have waiting this sequel so eagerly. Thankfully, Spiderman 2 is better than I was expecting. Most impressive thing is the action sequence between Spiderman and Doc Ock. It's really well scripted and pure adrenalin pumping experience. Special effects was pretty good and Alfred Molina and Tobey Maguire gave huge energy into CGI Character. Sometimes melodrama between MJ and Peter Parker was pointless and repetitive, but most of drama part was fairly good in this type of film. I think Alfred Molina (Doc Ock) is the best villain ever in comic book adaptation (except Willem Dafoe) and rest of casting was great. Unlike the first movie it has a little scary moments - it's Sam Raimi's gift- and Danny Elfman's music changed the mood very effectively. Overall "Spiderman 2" is a great film in all directions and I think 'Spiderman 2' is gonna be the best box-office this year. If you enjoyed the first film, go to multiplex it's worth your time and money.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie at a prescreening party the other night and I am so glad I went. This movie is what happens when the right people are put together at the right time to make exemplary work. Spider-man 2 has it all-drama, comedy, romance, intrigue, and jawdropping action. It can simply be a fun summer blockbuster eyecandy flick, or if you decide to invest in the deeper emotional scenarios you can dig as deep as you would like.Tobey Maguire once again (led by Sam Raimi and his writing team) nails the spirit of Spider-man; to do the right thing no matter what the cost is in the short run. Accept your responsibility to others around you, even at great cost to yourself. This is what made Spidey my favorite character as a kid in the 70's and it's still so important today. Sacrifice is a foreign concept to so many these days unfortunately, and it's pleasantly refreshing to see such a powerful and vivid reminder of it at the multiplex. Go treat yourself and a loved one to this on the big screen, this is modern film-making at its best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, this movie was, simply put, amazing. It was everything I hoped for, Action (of course its a superhero flick), love, revenge, but most of all, much like love, real human emotions. The greatest thing that makes us all love Spider-man is that he lives in all of us. Maybe we can't all sling cool web around New York, but we have that hero that lies within us. Whether it is shown through good or evil it is there. However, we can't let it take us over. And I believe that is what happens to Peter/Spider-man. It becomes too much, but a balance and an understanding of the idea of with great power comes great responsibility runs throughout this film especially in the second half. The performances were all around well done, Doc Ock was particularly good, the returning cast memebers have all really grown into their characters. That was a pleasant, but none-to-unexpected surprise. GO SEE THIS MOVIE! Take your kids, it shows real human emotions, the balances we all go through in life. This is the Amazing Spider-man... SPIDER-MAN 2... I can't wait for Spider-man 3!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's the best American movie so far this year and the best comic book adaptation ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'I'll peel the skin off your face!' Spidey nemesis Doc Ock informs one of his victims how he feels. Here's how I feel about director Sam Raimi's ('Spider-Man,' 'A Simple Plan') 'Spider-Man 2': It's the best American movie so far this year and the best comic book adaptation ever filmed.Not hard to figure because the writers are a Pulitzer winner Michael Chabon ('The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier &amp; Clay') and Oscar winner Alvin Sargent ('Ordinary People'). This is the kind of movie American filmmakers excel at with outrageous action, weepy relationships, and glorious endings, all spiced with unparalleled special effects and actors such as Tobey Maguire destined to play their roles. Peter Parker (Maguire) is still rejecting Mary Jane because of the danger his Spider-Man persona would bring her if people knew who he was. The interesting twist in this second installment is that Spidey loses his powers in conjunction with several other losses in his life, love and job included.That maxim, 'With great power comes great responsibility,' still eludes him because he disavows heroic responsibility and hurls himself into an existential funk questioning his purpose in life. Doc Ock (Alfred Molina) makes it difficult for Parker to quit the web-based business because Ock's experiments with fusion threaten all of New York City (a popular target this year: Do you remember it frozen in 'Day After Tomorrow'?), and Spidey is the only one who can defeat him. Molina's octopus-like tentacles almost achieve character-status themselves; his climbing Manhattan buildings with various female victims in his grasps evokes the great King Kong. Like Kong, Ock has a soft side that makes him less a monster and more a human. Among several themes is the importance of responsibility, a lesson for all the major characters, including slimy newspaper editor J. Jonah Jamison (J.K Simmons), who almost steals the picture with his over-the-top selfishness and brief moment of remorse. Stan Lee, who created the complex hero for Marvel comics in 1962, has a cameo, but his understanding of human frailty pervades the film. He achieved that heroic ambivalence only hinted at in the Superman series.Tobey Maguire ('Cider House Rules,' 'Seabiscuit') has the youthful idealism and stunned-by-reality look to make the complicated change of life he will try later on credible. He reminds me of another struggling, lonely and poor hero, Thomas Hardy's Tess, who likened herself to a lonely spider, 'which had been mistakenly placed in a corner where no flies ever came, and shivered in the slight draft through the casement.'Maguire's gift as an actor is to relay the American dream and the American drama of self-discovery in his eyes. No other actor can better demand our respect for his journey from innocence to experience. He is America.So George Bush and the neocons should love the responsibility theme of this film considering the sacrifices the War in Iraq has asked of Americans. The other themes of sacrificing for love and discovering one's self may be too subtle for anyone but Kerry supporters. Either way, this is a movie to draw you firmly and forever into its warm web, even more than the original did.Stay put because Spidey 3 is spinning another web.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having just seen spider man 2 at a sneak preview, I am amazed. The special effects were so amazing that it was hard to tell that there were any. The fight scene between Doc Occ and spider man was truly fantastic, probably the best special power fight scene in a movie so far. Above the action, and above the special effects was the story of how Peter Parker tries to live his life and Spidermans, the introduction of Dr. Octavious, Mary Janes career, and Harry Osborns obsession with killing spider man. Based 2 years after the first movie, Peter Parker is truly struggling being spider man, having to sacrifice everything. MJ has become a star. Harry has taken over Oscorp and is funding Dr. Octavious' (who Peter Parker idolizes) research in the hopes of making Oscorp larger than ever. If you liked the first one at all, you will love the second, and probably even if you didn't like the first one, it is that good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Everything a comic-book movie should be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw this film at an exhibitor's screening, and it was everything a comic-book movie should be. I had low expectations, since I thought the first film was decent, but left a lot of great opportunities on the table. But not part 2. Raimi has really stepped up to the plate with this film, and created something that will be loved by both the mainstream viewer, as well as the film geeks and comic geeks. He took time with the characters, and gave Peter, M.J., Harry, and Aunt May some quality character development. We even get more of J. Jonah Jameson, which is great for the comic relief (even if I can't stop calling him 'Schillinger'). The CGI is much better this time around, and Spidey no longer looks rubbery.It is much more believable, and doesn't take you out of the moment at any point. Also, we're given a much better bad guy. Doc Ock is a fantastic villain, and much of this credit goes to Molina. He doesn't cheese it up at any point, and since Raimi gave us some time with him and his wife before the experiment goes wrong, we see that he's a kind man who wants to make the world a better place. Honestly, the film is dripping with pathos, and yet it doesn't feel like it's trying too hard to do so. And when we get to see how vulnerable Peter Parker is (wait until you see the subway car scene), we actually feel for the poor guy. This is the first comic-book film that got me to feel for the lead character, and I'm grateful for that.I'm a big fan of the X-Men movies, but this film has a lot more heart than either of those. Thinking back, I can't remember a better comic-book film. Spider-Man 2 gave me everything I wanted, and more. Kudos to Raimi for finally hitting one out of the park. I almost can't believe it, but this one is a 10/10, and I cannot wait to see it again on 6/29.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really do feel embarrassed sometimes (for other people) when I not only see beyond laughable, worryingly clueless statements such as "Spider-Man 2 is the best movie in the Spider-Man series", but what REALLY makes me laugh my metaphorical ass right off is when I see completely inept, utter morons, who have clearly never read an actual Spider-Man comic/watched an episode of a Spider-Man animated series in their lives, attempt to proclaim THIS movie as ............"the best.........superhero movie......of all......time."????Seriously, clueless fanboys. Seek help, and fast X )This MAY have been the best superhero movie up to that point.....for about a whole 11 or 12 months,. Then a little flick called Batman Begins jumped in the mix and not only did it actually do its main character in movie form TO PERFECTION, but it also became, easily, the best superhero movie of all time. And even today it's still, worst case, in the top 3.And for gods sake, this is just by 2005! we haven't even gotten to all the other "Done To Perfection" classics such as The Dark Knight, Iron Man, Thor, The Avengers, Captain America: The Winter Solider, The Amazing Spider-Man, Guardians of the Galaxy, etc.Conclusion: Spider-Man 2 is a very good movie overall, but some people have to stop being so beyond ignorant by heralding it as some picture perfect version of the title character when we didn't get anything remotely resembling actual Spider-Man/Peter Parker in a live action film until the incredible 2012 reboot which hit the nail on the head across the board in every single area.You're welcome ; )</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Superhero Movie Of All Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remember my "Spider-Man" review? Where I said that I was an enormous fan of the character but that the film wasn't exactly a "great" superhero flick? While I said "Spider-Man" was a really good but not quite great superhero movie, "Spider-Man 2" I think is easily, without a doubt, the best superhero movie ever made. Yes, even after all the MCU movies and "The Dark Knight" Trilogy, I STILL believe this is the best superhero movie of all time. Its style, its pacing, its action, its emotion, its intelligence, its effects, its characters, its fight scenes. I could watch this movie a million times and not get tired of it. It's everything the first "Spider-Man" film should have been and for my money the gold standard for the superhero movie genre.I love the idea of a superhero film examining just how hard it is to be a superhero; taking a look at the toll it takes on your life and just how much you have to sacrifice. "Spider-Man 2" demonstrates that perfectly. Peter Parker sacrifices any chance at true happiness he has and puts nearly everything at risk simply to protect the city and it's people. Even after he momentarily stops being Spider-Man, he still sacrifices one of the few things he still has, his trust with Aunt May, in one of the most emotional scenes ever in a comic book movie. In fact, all of these characters seem to go through some harsh hardships throughout the movie; Mary Jane is getting married despite conflicting feelings about Peter, Harry Osborne is dealing with insecurities about not living up to his father as well as having to weigh his relationship with his father with his friendship with Peter, even Otto Octavius spends the entire movie chasing an impossible dream, largely in compensation for his wife's death. All of these characters arcs are told wonderfully and I found all of them compelling and incredibly investing.Remember how I said the romance in "Spider-Man" completely failed and almost sunk the entire movie? Not at all the case here. We see much more of Peter and Mary Jane as friends, we see them really interact beyond just being lovers and really examine and reexamine the roles they have in each others lives, we see them truly support each other in very hard times and put each other before themselves. These were things we never saw in the original "Spider-Man", but we see them here. On top of that, Kristen Dunst actually does an excellent job here now that she's given an actual CHARACTER to play, and we're rooting for her to find happiness and stability in her life just as much as we are Peter.Speaking of Peter, Tobey Maguire completely dominates in this film. He truly manages to make Peter Parker a sympathetic and likable character here, and there are multiple scenes where he just oozes emotion. He has the awkward and dorky charm of the original, but he adds far more emotional weight and tragedy to his performance here than in the first movie. Speaking of improved performances, James Franco does phenomenal work here. Like Peter and Mary Jane, he struggles and he often makes the wrong decisions, but you can tell this is more out of confusion and indecisiveness than any ill intent. Like Maguire, he brings far more emotional weight to his role in this movie than it's predecessor, and it's a better film for it.Alfred Molina as Dr. Octopus may be the best villain I have ever seen in a comic book movie, he's in the top 3 no doubt. I've always been a fan of Dr. Octopus as a character since reading the comics, but I gotta say, Raimi's Dr. Octopus may be better than anything I have read in any of the "Spider-Man" comics. Molina together with a phenomenal script by Alvin Sargent turns Otto Octavius into one of the most sympathetic villains I've ever seen. The loss of his wife, his reputation and essentially any hope of a normal life leave Doc Ock to grasp desperately to the only thing that still matters to him anymore; finishing his fusion reactor. He is as much driven by regret and hopelessness as he is by passion, and Molina is great at depicting the good Doctor's sorrow, fear and brokenness. Also, kudos to the effects team on Dr Octopus's arms. The mix of CGI and animatronics on them were detailed, realistic and scary as Hell.The style of the movie is perfect. Sam Raimi made a name for himself as a Horror movie director, and with a villain like Dr. Octopus, that style works surprisingly well. One of my favorite scenes in the movie involves Octavius's mechanical arms killing multiple doctors trying to saw them off while he is unconscious, and it truly feels like something straight out of one of his "Evil Dead" movies. It's intentional homage and it works perfectly. With that being said, the lighthearted and funny moments work just as well, what with J.J Jameson putting on Spider-Man's abandoned costume and masquerading in it around his cubicle or even charming little moments like Spider-Man shouting puns at Dr. Octopus during a bank robbery. The blend of both the dark and light aspects of Spider-Man make the film truly feel like the ultimate Spider-Man cinematic experience.The train fight scene is easily the best fight I've seen in a superhero flick, and it's doubtful it will ever be beat. The choreography and just the unique style of the fight fit Spider-Man and Dr. Octopus perfectly and it's just oozing with excitement. I could go on about this movie forever. It's just so GREAT. It had great heart, it had great style, it had a great story, it had great characters, it had great action, it had great effects...It's the best damn superhero movie ever. Period.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to be honest and state I'm not a fan of the super-hero type of movie but I did enjoy reading the Spiderman comics as a kid and if I had to state " favourite super-hero ?" Spiderman would get my vote . You know what to expect with this type of cinema adaptation , lots of set pieces , noise and special FX but Sam Raimi is a very talented director and his A SIMPLE PLAN is one of the most underrated thrillers ever made so in theory he should be able to make an entertaining big budget movie Is SPIDERMAN 2 entertaining ? Certainly yes . It's a film trying to mix budget FX work with quieter human moments . In truth the director isn't entirely successful by mixing the two elements . When the story concentrates on Peter Parker you're often reminded of Clark Kent losing his super powers in SUPERMAN 2 as heroic super dooper hero becomes a sappy wimpy mere mortal . These attempts at human elements are somewhat insipid and boring you wish you're seeing more of Doctor Octopus And this is where the film works tremendously . Alfred Molina as Dr Otto Octavuis / Doc Ock sets the screen alight . He's more than just a comic book villain he does strive to make his super-villain more than just a comic book baddie and the scenes where he realises the tentacles are controlling the man rather than the other way round are both touching and haunting . Some die hard fans will complain that Molina doesn't have the physique to be playing this type of bad guy or isn't wearing a wearing a green suit but such anorakish complaints don't deserve to heard . Not even Danny Elfman's intrusive score can spoil Molina's screen time as Doctor Octopus</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The hotly anticipated "Spider-Man 2" arrived in theatres in June of 2004 and soon proved to be nearly as big of a box office success as its predecessor. The film even managed to garner better reviews than the original, which is something of a rarity for sequels.The story picks up a couple of years after the first movie and finds Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) struggling to cope with the sacrifices inherent in being Spider-Man. As a result, he seriously contemplates giving up crime-fighting. Meanwhile, the demented Doc Ock (Alfred Molina) will stop at nothing to continue his fusion research, though the results could be disastrous.The cast of the previous film returns here and they perform their roles capably once again. New addition Alfred Molina makes a memorable villain and the film features another entertaining cameo from Bruce Campbell.However, I find that the acting talent is somewhat squandered on a less than stellar script. Despite the involvement of Pulitzer Prize winner Michael Chabon and two-time Oscar winner Alvin Sargent the screenplay comes off as a dumbed down effort (no doubt as a result of catering to a young audience). That being said, the conclusions of the film's individual story lines are so satisfying that I can almost overlook the script's lesser moments.Sam Raimi returns as director and the film's visuals are on par with the first film. The special effects landed the film its sole Oscar and are responsible for some memorable moments. Danny Elfman once again provides a fitting score while good use is also made of B.J. Thomas's "Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head".In the end, "Spider-Man 2" is an enjoyable popcorn movie but nothing more. While I may be in the minority here, I find the first film more rewarding than the followup. The third film, meanwhile, is especially disappointing considering the promise of this film's ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My dreams came true, but partially</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched almost all the episodes of classical Spider-Man animated series and I am familiar with the comic book, even if I did not read it, just a few of them. Like The original The Batman animated series, Spider Man animated series is a masterpiece, on all counts, characters, story, story editing, script, direction (or should I say drawings) etc. As for the adaptations, I have never thought that Sam Raimi is the right guy for this project. Yes, sometimes, there might be exceptions, an unexpected director gets an unexpected success, but I believe that someone who has a grasp of the field should take the project. However, as said, there might be some exceptions, positively or negatively, for example, Bryan Singer's X-Men movies were great and he seemed a perfect choice for Superman Returns, but it was a huge disappointment. Sam Raimi did a good job, but particularly. Spider Man 2 surpassed the first movie by far, but I had been almost sure for that, especially technically, so did not surprise. As for expectations (dreams) the movie meets some. Tobey Maguire makes us believe that he is Peter Parker /Spider Man and I have no complaint about that, but pretty different from the original character, not only in terms of appearance, but also in terms of personality. The original Peter Parker character is beefy, this Peter Parker is so thin, he is a bit glitzy boy and not a loser exactly like Tobey Maguire's Peter Parker. There is one enemy, Dr. Octopus in the movie, in the comic book and the animated series I love, as you know, Spider Man fights more than one enemy at the same time and it causes amazing moments. Sadly, some people complained about this in Spider Man 3, so the filmmakers have sworn not to make room for more than one enemy. However, to me, absolutely, the problem is not this formula does not work, it is the fault of the directors. In Spider Man 3, it did not work because of Raimi and script, especially you know Venom stuff. However, Tim Burton did, didn't he? (Batman Returns, The Catwoman and Penguin) Some details are also missed in Raimi's Spider Man movies. These details might be not important for some people, but they are a part of dreams (expectations) For example. Spider Man is a chatterbox, so he talks with himself while flying or fighting his enemies. Sometimes, he makes jokes about the situation he is in and those lines are very humorous. In the movies, we have none. Sam Raimi creates his own world, makes his own humor, the tone of the movie, the atmosphere are not based on the comic book or the animated series, it is far different. Spider Man movies, the first, 2 and even 3 are great fun, also feel yourself good movies at times, but every time I am upset because of those. Raimi cannot adapt the mood, the atmosphere and the humor. Visually, yellow tones are dominant, in the comic book and the animation, visually, it is great. How is called? Use of city. Raimi cannot use of city well. Now, let's about the content of the movie. There are some brainwave moments in the movie like the stained clothes in the launderette. The first short action scene shows the improvement of the movie, so technically perfect, it is a very stylish scene also. The platonic love between Parker and Mary Jane is realistic, I mean one sided love. Thankfully, Raimi makes Spider cruise in the air, those images are dazzling, he does not miss this detail as he did some other ones. However, personally, it was not enough for me, because I just love that, so it could have been longer, it should have been longer. However, there are some too unrealistic moments in the movie, for example, he tries to jump from a roof to another, but falls down. All your bones are broken and you die! Or he is not shocked when he pulls out the plugs. The positive hype of the hospital part is true, in this part, even if you don't know who is the director, you understand it is Sam Raimi. J. Jonah Jameson is cartoonish unfortunately, he imitates him, does not interpret him. The first big action sequence is one of the best sequences of the movie, to me second best. It is very very smart, especially the choreography and editing, very brilliant. And perfection in visual effects. In terms of action, yes Raimi's movie meets all the expectations and dreams come true. Action is a bit less, but satisfying and the movie was not boring. The second Spider Octopus fight is the best action sequence of the movie and my personal favorite. Again very brilliant choreography and very brilliant editing. Real amazing. However, Raimi uses some showy tricks like the forward traveling to the end of the rail (Batman Begins used it too) And another illogical, unrealistic stuff. Your leg is real seriously broken, if you do that! even further injury may be. He is not Superman. A problem of the movie is that Peter Parker is a very thin and the most important feeble boy, but when he wears Spider Man costume and becomes Spider Man, he becomes very powerful as if he is the son of Superman!! This really flaws. Then, some real touching (and humorous) moments. There is something in it. Returning to the relationship between Parker and Jane, realism is ruined and fantasy takes the place of it. Remember, ''tiger'' People at theater laughed, I remember.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sorry guys, but I'm one to find Spiderman 2 the weakest in the series. The first one was excellent, a sufficient plot, no over-loading on violence, and villains, a perfect action movie. Spiderman 2, all it felt like was hardly no in-depth plot, loads of violence and a unrealistic (CGI wise) villain. It didn't have that feel. I'm totally despised seeing that Spiderman 2 out-rates Spiderman on IMDb. There is just way too much explosions and action from my likening. Spiderman had a bit of everything, Spiderman 2 had way too much typical comic book elements. A disappoint, expected much more, but it turned out to be another comic book movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watchable sequel with better Special Effects, but weaker then the first film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am one of those in the minority who liked Spiderman (2002) better than its sequel. The Special Effects have indeed improved with Dr Octavious (a good but sadly underutilized Alfred Molina) being a worthy match for Spiderman. However, the pacing is weak and the mid-section gets bogged down as it rehashes Peter and MJ's romance from the first film. Also, too many bad things happen to poor Peter, so much so that suspension of disbelief becomes impossible. On the plus side, JK Simmons is as hilarious as ever as Peter's boss J Jonah Jameson. There's also an exciting train rescue. Definitely still worth a watch.Overall 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first "Spider-Man" made my childhood dream a reality, but I never imagined that the sequel would be even better! Let me just say that I saw the first movie maybe 3-4 times on its theatrical release and "Spider-Man 2" probably 1 or 2 times more! In all honesty, "Spider-Man 2" could be said to be the greatest comic book movie ever made! Not since the original "Superman" (1978) and "Batman" (1989) has there been a superhero movie that brought its source material to life, straight from the pages of the comics like "Spider-Man 2" did. In this movie, every single element that made the first film magical was bigger and better! The Spidey suit, the CGI, the action sequences, the storytelling! Everything! Once again Tobey Maguire proved without a shadow of a doubt that he was destined to play Peter Parker/Spider-Man. Like "The Matrix Reloaded", this film surpasses its original, and shows effectively just what makes Spider-Man the quintessential hero that we all know and love. Alfred Molina also was the perfect choice for Spidey's next villain Doc Ock, after a superb performance by Willem Dafoe as The Green Goblin.Sure, there will be films to come with maybe better action and special effects, but "Spider-Man 2" will always trump them because it delivers what the teeming masses have been longing for: A comic book film that stays true to its origins and takes its hero's epic tale to even greater heights.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best Superhero movie ever made!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Actually, today I repeated seeing Spider-Man 2, after making a Top 55 film list, to see if I made the right choice in including it, and I have to say, I did...First off, Sider-Man 2 is the best superhero film ever made, I think. There are a lot, but none come to the development that this film had. It is an achievement, not only in creating another good Spider-Man film after the original, but in succeeding in making it even better than the first. First off, it is so well made. It starts off strong, and it keeps going and going. It moves at a very well pace. It is not too fast, but it gives time to scenes that make the audience emotionally react to the characters. That is what makes it so strong. The characters are given depth and time in creating, and they do not come off as cheesy or unrealistic Marvel characters. Peter Parker is treated as a real human being, and that is the main lesson this film gives. Throughout the film, Peter Parker is trying to learn who he really is. It is a film about self discovery, and I think it gives off very strong points. There are very well-written speeches, yes, they seem a bit clichd, but that is because this film is reinforcing themes that usual superheroes need to give, and in that way it succeeds. Actually, I had never seen this film and thought 'wow, that was great writing' but this time I did. I don't just mean in the dialogue, but in the writing itself. The film gives a lot of very memorable little comedic moments. For instance, when Peter Parker falls down trying to use his powers, and then he touches a car and it starts beeping. This scene is so well put, so well done, that we can't help but laughing even though it seems 'cheesy'. Never before had I seen a movie and thought that the cheesiness of it made it so good. But this film, the cheesy parts are so well-intended, I couldn't help but laugh. This film succeeds in making the humor side work. The other side of it that is really strong is the acting. This time in my viewing, I found the acting to stand-out. First off, James Franco gives a very memorable supporting performance of a young man in search of a little revenge, and lost inside. The scene when he slaps Peter in the party is so well acted, by Tobey Maguire too. Another scene that I thought I found myself thinking 'This looks like an Oscar-worthy acting moment' was when Peter Parker confesses to Aunt May what happened the night Uncle Ben died. The acting from both Tobey Maguire, and the horror in Rosemary Harris' face was so strong, just wow. Kirsten Dunst did not annoy me in this film like she did in the first and third. It seems like in this film, she really conveys the emotions her character is going though very well. Of course, this is a blockbuster, and in the action scenes it does not disappoint. There are not many, but each one is very well done. The special effects are also top-notch. It's Oscar Win for the effects was very well deserved. I view this film as an action Blockbuster with brains. It is not for the people who want non-stop action, and that is a VERY good thing. It is a very solid and strong film, and it is top-notch in every aspect. That is why this is Marvel's best film to date, and why it is the best superhero film I have ever seen. Not just that, but it is one of the best action Blockbuster films ever, if not the best... 9/10</fullReview>

As a long time fan of Spider-Man Spider-Man 2 was perfect.Director Sam Raimi hits it right on the head with Spidey 2. The fight scenes are amazing with the best special effects I have seen in a very long time the way Spider-Man and Doc Ock move are amazing. The characters all go the right way. Tobey Maguire,Kirstin Dunset, James Franco, Alfred Melina all do the roles perfectly. What also makes Spider-Man 2 a great film is it is very different from other superhero films the focus is the problems of Peter Parker and that is why he is very interesting. Doc Ock is an amazing villain but he is not really that mean villain but a great scientist. In short Spider-Man 2 is a fans dream come true and a comic book come to life. For me thats a perfect movie.Story 10/10Scenes 10/10Special Effects 10/10Fight Scenes 10/10Character Development 10/10Brilliance 10/10Directing 10/10Acting 10/10Overall: 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Argubly the one of (if not) the best superhero movies ever made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off and foremost, i would like to say this is one of the best superhero movies I've ever seen. There has been a lot of turmoil about which superhero is the best during the new millennium, which are Spiderman 2 and Batman Begins.Batman Begins also got a 10 from me, but this isn't about Batman Begins. Spiderman 2 has the best quality and understanding of what a superhero movie could and SHOULD be. There are so many outstanding aspects that stand out in this movie that it completely embraces the Spiderman franchise into a new standard.One thing that caught my attention, and the thing that makes Spiderman 2 and A grade movie, is the way it tells the struggle of Peter Parker and his ability to hold a life of his own and be a hero at the same time. This certain aspect is what (I believe) sets Spiderman 2 from 1 and 3.Even though 1 and 3 focused on beginnings and action, they don't quite come together more than 2. There are also things in 2 that I believe 1 and 3 wouldn't be able to handle. Multiple story lines, unique characters, and a story that focuses on an ordinary man becoming more than just ordinary.Action is still heavily present in Spiderman 2. With its visual effects and carefully crafted stylized action, it makes for some pretty stunning fights, including the train sequence which is still my favorite fight scene in the movie, especially on the 2.1 version.The acting is something of legend in Spiderman 2. The dialog is AMAZING. In my honest opinion, I don't think there is a single cheesy moment during the acting. The acting is especially good during the Ball scene, and the whenever Aunt May is on-scene.The ONLY problem I had with Spiderman 2 was, in the 2.1 version, during the extended train fight scene. When Doc Ock is shoving Spiderman on the rails and is hit by the train, and right when everything is all bad, Spiderman all of a sudden comes back to kick more ass. Now i know he has super strength and can withstand a train, but there was just something about that particular part of the scene that put a bad after taste in my mouth.I still can't decide which movie is better (Spiderman 2 or Batman Begins), but no matter what, this one certainly stands out from all the rest, past and present, and should be considered a landmark for all superhero movies, period.10/10</fullReview>

The really good thing about this movie is that it does not forget what made the 1st one good and did not insult the first one. This time the story is about how Peter Parkers social life goes down and is forced to give up being Spiderman as he starts to lose his powers. The movie is good for so many reasons one being that it has way cool action maybe better then the first it has lots of storyline again like the first and it is absolutely bearable and does not lose interest half way through like so many movies do now days. Overall I rate this movie 82% for being a good sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the ultimate super hero movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here is an example of a film where a movie can be ranked "great" or "spectacular", and it's sequel being "even better" and "flawless". The "great, spectacular" film is the first Spider-Man film by Sam Raimi and the "even better, flawless" film being Spider-Man 2, also directed by Raimi."Spider-Man 2" succeeds over the first film in all aspects. The parts of the first film that were weak, are improved. The spectacular parts of the first film are now on an even more epic level. In "Spider-Man", I had always felt that the development for the origins of our "heroes" and "villains" were rushed through just to make way for the action and main story lines, which isn't necessarily a bad idea. But in this action-packed sequel, it can deliver MORE action and have BETTER story lines and origins for the characters. The origin for our new villain, Doc Ock, was more understandable, realistic, and developed on the screen and through research than the origins of Spider-Man's first screen villain the Green Goblin. What's more, "Spider-Man 2" delivers us more character development so we can treat these characters like real people with real problems. Peter Parker's struggle is now to live two lives at once. Both of them with heavy responsibility. And of course to deal with the new villain in town.Another thing I liked about "Spider-Man 2" is that the villains also seem two-sided like real people. There's nothing wrong with a villain who is just pure mean, nasty, and murderous. But Doc Ock is showed as also having a good side to himself as well as a bad side. Human frailties are equally effectively shown in him as in our title character Spider-Man. Both of these characters have aspects of them that need to be shown through computer graphics, and sometimes, they are entirely in CGI. Like the first film, these effects are flawless and now the winner of the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects.Overall, "Spider-Man 2" is an improvement over "Spider-Man" and the third installment "Spider-Man 3". It is the best of this epic super hero trilogy, featuring the best storyline, drama, special effects, action, and development. A great achievement for Sam Raimi.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spiderman 2 is an exception to almost every rule in the book. It's a sequel, it's a superhero film, and it follows another very good film. The stage is therefore set for an awful movie. However, Spiderman 3 is anything but awful. First, we have the special effects. Unlike the first Spiderman film, the action is no longer cartoonish. Instead of looking like a cheap video game, everything looks real. The acting is also satisfactory or above across the board. Maguire and Frnaco are much less awkward, Dunst is more believable, and Alfred Molina is fantastic as Dock Ock. In Spiderman 1, the Green Goblin is corny and not-at-all intimidating. Dock Ock, however, is a terrific villain. Though Molina is not always frightening, the "tentacles" are amazingly threatening and cool to watch. The action isn't glamorized like it was in the first film. The whole story comes to life in an action-packed and great overall film.</fullReview>

Fantastic completely understandable villain with a goal in life other than to destroy Spider-man just because. The plot really focuses well on the personal difficulty of being a superhero, and not that this is so important but I was quite amused by the prospect of Spider-man delivering pizza for a living. I have seen some have a go critics moaning about tha fact that Spiderman 2 has tried to be too funny and too romantic and failed, but these people have entirely missed the point of spiderman, this is a comic book adaptation, its an action film you can turn your brain off in this film and feel like a boy again. And if it throws in a couple of only slightly amusing jokes and a little romance? Thats fine, its Hollywood nice to have a bit of that in there and not take itself too seriously all the time. I am going to be topically boyish and say "if you didn't like this film your probably not worth knowing"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After the miscast baddie in the first Spider-Man movie I was nervy about this. Glad to see I was wrong. Alfred Molina was perfect as Otto Octavius. The story of the experiment gone wrong and Otto going bad was exactly like the original story. Tobey has grown up a lot as Peter and puts on a much better performance in this one. The jury's still out on Kirsten Dunst, but in honesty, was much better in this. The story was far superior to the first and was a lot more a comic book, cartoon type adventure for Spidey. The fight scene on the train is unmatched and action sequences were brilliant all the way. I hope that they can keep these fantastic types of movies coming for Spidey, as it is one of the most perfectly put together films of all Marvel creations! Watch for the cameo of director John Landis as Peter's doctor early in the film.</fullReview>

Pre-90/95 efforts may have been quite good but the current 21st century efforts at making flashy versions of the classics have almost always been failures even though they had a few good things going for them. Not so in Spiderman's case. While the first movie itself was quite good, this sequel is almost flawless in terms of story, acting, action and special effects. The direction and screenplay are also very good and the cinematography is just unbelievable. There's little more to be said. Just go watch this movie if you have'nt done so already.

		<shortDescription>A superb improvement on the first film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie excels both as a comic book movie, and a sequel. It's definitely one of the best comic book movies of all time (although I don't think anything will be able to beat X2 and the first two Batman movies). Not only is it an excellent sequel (which isn't that common to begin with), it's also one of those rare sequels that is actually better than the first film (other examples are Aliens, Terminator 2 and X2).Almost everything in this film is better than in the original Spider-Man. I'll start with the most significant example: the characters. The character development in this movie is absolutely fantastic, easily comparable to the X-Men movies. It's never been easier to identify with Peter Parker. I've always wondered how super-heroes managed to balance their real lives and their super-hero lives like it seems that they do. Spider-Man 2 shows us that it's not as simple as Bruce Wayne/Batman and Clark Kent/Superman make it seem. In fact, Peter Parker struggles so hard to maintain both his real life and his crime fighting life, eventually he gives in and realizes that he has to choose one path or the other (he realizes this with the help of a wonderful speech from Aunt May (Rosemary Harris)). Mary Jane's character is also much deeper than it was in the first film. While it may seem that she's given up on Peter and found love somewhere else, the truth is far from that. Not only is she not sure if she still loves Peter or not, it's also apparent that she still hasn't forgotten that one kiss she shared with Spider-Man in the first film. Alfred Molina's character, Doctor Octavius (or Doc Ock), is one of the most believable villains in any movie. His character is completely three-dimensional, something relatively rare for an on-screen villain. We can see exactly where he's coming from, why he does the things he does. He's not the usual two-dimensional villain, who is just there to oppose the hero. The only other villain as three-dimensional as Doctor Octopus, off the top of my head, is Bill in Kill Bill (although there are no doubt many others like this).The action and CGI has improved tremendously since the first film. While the CGI in the original Spider-Man was always a bit iffy in my eyes, they've clearly done a much better job. The combination of real footage and CGI is almost unnoticeable, and it's virtually impossible to tell the difference between the CGI Spider-Man and the real Spider-Man costume (except that the CGI Spider-Man does things that Tobey Maguire would never be able to do). Doc Ock's tentacles definitely stand out as an amazing CGI achievement in this film. They look excellent. The action is stunning. While, for an action film, the action is relatively scarce, when it kicks in, it does it magnificently. Spider-Man's fight with Doctor Octopus on the train is one of the most exciting and amazingly executed action scenes I've seen (not comparable to the action in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon or in The Matrix Reloaded, but it's close).Sam Raimi, director, does an absolutely brilliant job. His intentionally corny approach is what really stands out in this film ? it never really takes itself too seriously. He also uses some low budget b-movie trademarks, such as quick zooms and corny one-liners. While some people don't like this approach, I thought it was brilliant. Raimi returns to his roots (in a way) with his directing style. His style of shooting is very reminiscent to his earlier films in the Evil Dead series. One of the most significant examples of this is the scene with Dr. Octopus in the hospital room, which was absolutely brilliant. The camera angles, and some of the elements (such as the nurse scraping the floor with her fingernails), are pure Evil Dead.There were all sorts of little bits and details, really tiny ones, that made the particular scene they were in worthwhile. For instance, the lady playing the violin in the street is singing the theme song to the original Spider-Man cartoon from the '60s. Another great reference was in the hospital room scene. While the entire sequence is reminiscent of The Evil Dead, the shot of the hand on the floor still holding the chainsaw is an obvious reference to an identical shot in The Evil Dead II. Brilliant.To sum it all up, this movie is a superb improvement on the first film (which was excellent, don't get me wrong). Sam Raimi clearly focused more on the story and the characters this time, which was wonderful. Unfortunately, some things could have still been worked on. For instance, the general structure of the film is very reminiscent of the sequels to other comic book movies, namely Superman II and Batman Returns (the whole 'abandoning the hero role' thing). And still, while it's also an extremely entertaining flick, Spider-Man 2 has much more behind it than just crowd-pleasing. It's definitely one of the best movies of the year so far, but we have yet to see what the second half of 2004 has in store for us. Recommended for anyone, even people who aren't into the whole comic book movie scene.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being a superhero was never easy. I suppose Sam Raimi liked melancholy movies, ever since he made A Simple Plan. Melancholy, or sadness, was the main point of the movie. "It's the superhero movie for people who don't go to superhero movies," Roger Ebert says.There is a bit of a melancholy element behind the sequel to the Spider-man. Peter Parker faces numerous personal problems, which bring down his self-esteem and bring in a whole lot of dialogue. (Which I didn't think was corny!) First of all, there is Harry. If you can re-call the first movie, Harry is still upset about the death of daddy. He knows Spider-man is connected to it, but doesn't know that Peter is Spider-man. Now, he wishes to take revenge on Peter Parker a.k.a Spider-man. So much for being a best friend! Next in line, is Mary Jane. Apparently being a superhero isn't all it's cracked up to be. There seems to be so much trouble, Peter can never arrive in time for his appointments. Sadly, one of them is Mary's play, which Peter has promised to see, but can never make it! And to think that Peter and Mary Jane almost had a relationship. Too bad she's getting married to somebody else.Every superhero needs a villain, and Doctor Octopus is the one for Peter. After his experiment goes wrong, he accidentally fuses four metal tentacles onto his back. Now, crazed to finish his failed experiment, he puts the city in danger. Poor Peter. Only superheroes can stop the super villains. Now he must defeat Doc Ock. Add that to the "to do" list.What more can we pile on?!?! Sadly, Peter there's much more. His grandma doesn't trust him, his grades are dropping, he can't even pay the rent and his stress even results in drastic consequences. Wow, after saving the lives of all those innocent people, so much bad happens to him! I wonder if karma does actually exist. Well, at least not in movies.Spider-man 2 is a definite improvement on the first. Sam combines drama with action sequences to help the those with short attention spans.I hope Raimi has a lot more in store for us, because this is solid proof that sequels can live up to, or even surpass the originals. I just wish the film wasn't so darn predictable!8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than the first</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spiderman came more to life in this movie than the first. This movie is based on Spiderman #3, #50 and #55-#59 where Doc Ock nearly did away with Spiderman (and almost killed May Parker). Once again director Sam Raimy ( or Miller and Gough ) chose one of the best stories of the earlier Spiderman series. The movement of Spiderman is really what we expect from John Romita Sr. days of Spiderman, and it was exciting to see this version of Spiderman come to life (I still believe he was the best Spiderman artist).Asides from Doc Ock, many characters were introduced in this movie that could be future Spiderman's nemesis like J Jonah Jameson's son John Jameson who would become a superhero himself one day, and Dr. Connors who everyone knows is the infamous Lizard. If they keep building up this franchise this way, I think we're in for a treat.JK Simmons is spot on as J Jonah Jameson. I couldn't get enough of him doing J Jonah Jameson, and hope he'll continue in future installments of this movie. They made a good movie better the second time around.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Peter Parker can't seem to catch a break. Being Spiderman has brought him nothing but problems as far as his personal life is concerned. Not only that, Mary Jane is engaged to astronaut John Jameson, and Peter may lose her forever. Things are so bad for him he decides that he doesn't want to be Spiderman anymore. Then a freak accident transforms Dr. Otto Octavius into Dr. Octopus. Peter realizes that only Spiderman can stop him, but of course, problems arise. Mary Jane gets caught in the middle, and Harry Osborn, who still blames Spiderman for the death of his father, wants him dead.Sam Raimi being the Spider-Man fan that he is, finally is able to treat the audience with a superhero movie to be remembered. Spider Man 2 goes down in history as one of those sequels that is able to out due it's predecessor.The sequel improves on so many things that were wrong in the original, here the actors are finally comfortable in their roles, like Kristen, I didn't believe her in the first one, but this one I did. She was able to showcase her emotions more and the chemistry was there. Franco's character and performance was over-the-top. But Franco uses this to his advantage and pulls it of. Alfred Molina stole the show in this film, he was Doc Ock, perfect villain and perfect for the role. McGuire is now Spider-Man, whereas in the original, we only saw him as the nerdy Peter Parker, it took him two tries, but he finally nailed it.I loved how it went all Evil Dead in the doctor scene, with the people screaming, then out of nowhere BOOM, chainsaw, classic Sam Raimi and a great homage to his best film to date. But who can forget the Bruce Campbel cameo, and Hal sparks of course. Was there too much comedy??? well, I'm 50/50 on that, the one scene that everyone seemed to hate, but I loved would be the "Rain drops keep falling on my head"The little freeze at the end had my laughing, because it's Sam Raimi, he knows how to handle comedy for perfect situations. Although there was too much comedy from Peter and not enough from Spidey...I only recall one comedic thing said from Spidey, to Doc Ock in the bank...something along the lines of "Here's your change", then throws money at him. Where is the friendly neighborhood Spidey we all grew up with and love.The train fight is one of the best action sequences I've ever seen. I was waiting for him arms to rip out of their sockets when he was trying to stop the train from crashing over the edge. The CGI is a big improvement here, it's not all goofy comic book looking, here we see a man swing from building to building, anybody notice the costume looks darker in the CGI moments, maybe it was just me but it does.One gripe with the villain...not enough screen time. I wanted to see more of him, but whenever he's on the screen, you know it's good. It's clear that Molina is the scene stealer here.The film though was a little lengthy, they could of taken out a "swinging moment" here and there, those were all over the place. Raimi ends the movie perfectly, setting up the third installment, with the look of "Am I doing the right thing?" on MJ's face. Nice homage to The Graduate. Raimi flushes this film full of classic homages, whether it's from his own, or just classic films like King Kong, they always add a nice touch of coolness to the film.This is one of the better superhero movies out there, the fans of Spider-Man will enjoy and the movie goer will be entertained, this is a winner in my books</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent sequel to the first with a well thought out plot.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>''Spiderman'' 2002 was fantastic but for me only gained 8/10 on a whole. Spiderman 2 is one of those rare films which outclasses its prequel in many respects such as the part where peter parker has to decide who he is and whether being spiderman is the right path to take. Everything from the first sequence with Joes 29 minute guarantee rush to the twist of harry Osbourne finding his fathers green goblin equipment at the end keeps the mind of the viewer well and truly interested at every stop.My personal favourite moment is the train sequence with doc oc and spidey. When first viewing this part of the film the exhilaration is eminent and frequent and overall truly fantastic. I also loved the way it seemed that the doctor (not doc oc or Connors the one peter goes to see about his problems) and aunt may at some point in the film seemed to know peter was spiderman but does not really let on to the audience.Overall a great sequel with good fights, good plot, romance and great music!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Comic Book Adaptation Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spiderman 2 is one of the greatest movie ever.Comic book movies aren't so good.Well not all but some of them wasn't really that good.Just effects.Nobody tries to do something more that an immortal character who has very strange abilities and effects.Spiderman was the first one that did this.It showed Peter Parker as a person.We don't imagine Spiderman like a character who can't be killed anymore.And now the sequel surprised me in positive way.A wonderful movie.Just great.It even entered my all time Top 20.Now Peter works as a pizza deliver for the first 10 minutes of the movie.He had to be Spiderman till delivering a pizza in the other part of the town.He saved a lot of people but of course he didn't deliver the pizza in time and he was fired.It was sad when we understood that he had a birthday.Now he live with his aunt and they have a financial problems.His problems continues.Marry Jane marries other guy.Reason is that Peter was wait for her theater show.He had to save people again and when he arrived they didn't let him.The villain is Doc.OK.My all time favorite Spiederman bad guy.He is played by Alfred Molina.This is the plot and the movie is more than great.It is a drama and action together.Spiderman 2-Toby MacGuire,Kirsten Dunst,Alfred Molina,James Franco.I gave it 9.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this movie so much when I went to see it. When I went to see it with my little cousin I wasn't expecting much, but this movie was totally awesome! I had to buy this as soon as it was out and went to see it in the cinema at least three times. Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst were perfect for the parts of Peter Parker and Mary-Jane Watson. The story follows on from the first Spider-man movie released in 2002 about a man who wakes up to discover he has miraculously received a spiders powers over night due to his trip to a spider museum (I don't know what they're called) and got bitten by one which had managed to escape.I suggest that you HAVE to go see this movie if you haven't yet seen it already! In my opinion one of the greatest movies of all time! Yay! Go get 'em Spidey! Woo-hoo!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The sequel to the hit blockbuster "Spider-man" is here with style. Sam Raimi does a fantastic job of creating the world of the marvel comic character Spider-man. It's not often you get a sequel that matches the quality of the original.Two years have passed and Peter Parker has lost his job and J.Jonah.Jameson keeps firing him and unfiring him. So his future is uncertain, but one thing that is certain is that he will always be Spider-man. His friendships are deteriorating with Mary Jane and Harry. Peter Parker feels that everything is against him. And to make matters worse there is a new villain in town, Doc Ock. The sequel matches the quality of the first film and the third film hits cinemas May 4 2007.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my Favorite Heroes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have never doubted of this movie, since I saw the first commercials I knew that this movie was going to be great, and when I say great I mean that I wouldn't regret to see this movie.If I loved the first movie of Spiderman, obviously this one I was going to love it too. This is a different kind of movie, it isn't of those movies where the super heroe gets powers and then he start to use them to save all humanity, because those movies suck, those movies doesn't show important details. That's what makes this movie special, that it shows how Spider-man lives, as a poor guy, but still, it shows how a heroe lives, and that is entertaining.I could compare this movie with many other super-hero movies, and of course this movie will win. Of course, I can't compare this movie with the first one, both movies are very good, and I can't decide which one is better (probably in this page the second is better, but honestly, both are very similar).At the beginning (like three years ago) I didn't liked Spider-man, but after I watched Spider-man movie, my mind changed a lot, and I begin to like this hero, it's more... real.VERY RECOMMENDABLE MOVIE: 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spider Man 2: So much more than a tale of a Stellar Superhero</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>spoiler included in this review. When i first saw this movie, i thought it was good, nothing really special to this movie. But i decided to watch it again and be a real movie critic and look into why so many people loved this movie. I went back and happened to find a wonderful love story, fully developed characters, great acting, and quotes i could take with me out into the real world. For example "sometimes we have to be steady and give up the things we want the most, sometimes even our dreams". A beautiful truth to the world and it was in a summer blockbuster in a superhero comic book movie, the character development of peter parker was absolutely brilliant. You could see the pain within his soul over the heartbreak of Mary Jane and how he grew up in the movie, and realized he is spider man, and peter parker is just the disguise he puts on for everybody. And at the end Mary Jane and Peter come together and its just a beautiful scene of two people in love. This movie was not only a great comic movie but it had characters that seemed all too real to myself and that i rooted for and that i cried with and it was such a good movie all around one of the best in 2004. Alfred Molina does a spectacular job of being a villain and a good guy at the same time, and at the end comes back with the quote "Peter Parker......Brilliant but lazy". How i had a chuckle at that, and it shows Octavius as a good guy and it warms your heart, it did mine. A great performance by everyone, director Sam raimi is so underrated and a great movie overall, one of the best you will ever see. You've got to love it how Aunt May talks about heroes and how they are needed in todays world and she's right we all have heroes inside of us we've just got to find them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Spectacular Sacrifices of Peter Parker</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The writers and filmmakers of this sequel to Spider-Man(2002) are to be commended for at least one thing: they actually advanced the story of Peter Parker and his acquaintances. The characters progress forward, a novel concept these days, and so this is not just a rehash of the first Spider-Man movie. I believe the writers, perhaps with director Raimi's input, consciously made this decision, so that we have that sense of actual changes happening to the hero and his supporting cast. It's staggering to think they spent $200 million on this but I guess that's what you need to perfect the computer FX - Spider-Man now looks realistic in every shot, not just 75% of 'em.It really is two years later from the end of the 1st picture: Parker (Maguire) juggles college, part-time jobs, and super-heroing - all not very well. With only 24 hours in a day, why should this be a surprise? Something's got to give, and it turns out to be super-heroics. The central theme continues from the first film, that Parker sacrifices pretty much everything to continue in his role as mankind's helper - until, that is, psychological blocks in his mind cause his powers to peter (no pun intended) out. The story is based a lot on the key issue, #50, of the comic books, from the sixties, as well as Annual#1, in which he seems to lose his powers. The introduction of villain Dr.Octopus in issue #3 is also pivotal. Doc Ock (Molina) is another revelation here - they gave him a wife here, contrary to the books - but this turns him into a sympathetic figure, despite his raw power and the havoc he causes. As Stan Lee himself would say way back when, the most interesting villains are the tragic ones. Molina's final scene is truly haunting, as a result, and trademark Raimi.Also continuing from the previous film is the unrequited love for Mary Jane (Dunst). But, this thread definitely advances leaps &amp; bounds by the end. I hope they continue in this vein in the 3rd film. I hope there's a marriage by the end of that 3rd pic and things don't just stagnate. I hope Harry's (Franco) story evolves and maybe concludes. This could be the makings of a really great trilogy. The writers also pulled a daring stunt in having Spider-Man's identity revealed to so many people throughout the film, but it all works in underlining the enormous sacrifice required by Parker on a daily basis. Above all, it helps if you don't have just a faceless super-hero.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Movie of All</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have always been a great fan of Spider-Man, even before the first movie in 2002. But now I have to say that I am the proudest member of the Spider-Man Fan Club. That's all thanks to this movie. This is the best movie ever. YES!!! BEST MOVIE EVER!!!! Well, the plot of this movie is simple but very intriguing. It's all about how Peter Parker has been living two lives since he became Spider-Man after being bit by a genetically enhanced spider. His responsibility was to use his powers for the good of man kind. After being lectured by his uncle Ben saying "With great power comes great responsibility, he went off and disobeyed him. The consequence of his action haunted him for a while since it was the cause of his uncle's death. He learned from his mistake and made a promise to him that he'll make him proud.Now, after 2 years, life has never been harder. Trying to keep up with his studies at New York University, protecting the city from chaos, keeping that promise, and holding on to the love of his life, Mary Jane, he begins to give up. Saying that he is "Spider-Man, No More," he decides to take only the life of Peter Parker and tries to win back MJ before she gets married.Unfortunately, the hero of Manhattan is needed after a mad scientist, Doc Ock, tries to recreated a devastating machine that can destroy at least half the city. Now, with Mary Jane captured, and his friend Harry turning his back on him and exploding himself to the fact that Spider-Man is indeed his best friend and he was responsible for his father's death, Spider-Man returns to wear the mask and still manages to keep all his priorities straight. At least that's what we know until Spider-Man 3, where he will be faced with even more challenges.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a great film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spider-Man left us all with a great heartwarming sense of victory, and after 2 years, everyone was ready for a sequel. The photography, which I felt had what I call a "70's" feel to it, had been erased and everything seemed more up-to-date. Anyway, the film is like a magnet. The story pulls you in and you are drenched in the sorrow of Peter Parker's sad life. Then things change; a new villain rises up.Doc Ock interrupts Peter's difficult life, and Spidey swings back into action, fighting this ferocious fiend alongside a building. There is a long distance between the next fight and everything in that distance is great. Harry and Peter's friendship begins to take an ugly turn, and MJ finally turns the other cheek when she realizes she can't trust Peter. All of this leads to Peter deciding to give up his life as Spider-Man.A new, more confident Peter Parker emerges; things seem to become a little brighter, although Harry is falling apart. Doc Ock then requires a chemical and he agrees to bring Spidey to Harry.Things again go sour for Peter, and he feels he has come to a dead end. Then he goes to help Aunt May and everything changes. Peter decides to return as Spidey. The movie from this point on, has no flaws whatsoever.Peter goes to meet MJ at a diner, when Doc Ock suddenly comes back (in a very dramatic and cool way) to find Spider-Man. He takes MJ away, and Spider-Man goes and tracks him down. The begin a fight atop a clocktower, and the fight takes them to a train below. This fight is the second best in the series, only the Queensboro Bridge in its predecessor winning. Eventually, Spider-Man loses, and is taken to Harry. I won't spoil what happens next, but Spider-Man fights Doc Ock and he changes again and becomes a normal person, saving MJ and Peter.The film ends on a cliffhanger (sort of). Where the first film failed (such as random, forgettable scenes) this film surpasses, each minute getting better and better. And now Spider-Man 3 is on the way, and Spdier-Man 2 is the right film to follow-up. Watch the film and enjoy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well wow what a great movie even better then the first movie!! As we saw in the first movie we saw spidey fight against the sinister Green Goblin and now in spider-man 2 we see spidey face against one of spider-mans most famous enemies........Doc Ock, who is played by Alfred Molina.Well to start off it was great to see that all the original cast from the first movie were back for this movie, as well as some new cast as well.The special effects were amazing to look at and the story was brilliant!!! and also this movie had some of the best fight scenes i have ever seen including the clock tower fight, the train fight and the fight in the bank and on the side of a building!!!! In this amazing sequel to the summer smash spider-man(2002) the story starts from were the first movie finished. Peter parker had faced against The Green Goblin and harry has a strong hatred for spider-man due to his fathers death, Peters love life is terrible due to him ditching mary jane ( even though he loves her) but we learnt he cant have her because she would be in danger if anyone knew who he was. Now in this movie peters still in love with her and mary jane don't feel the same until later on in the movie. Harry still has the hatred for spidey. Spidey in this film must now fight against the sinister doc ock played by Alfred Molina. Doc Ock was created by his fusion test going terribly wrong and his " Tentacles" are welded to him due to the experiment and then the " Tentacles" start to control him. Anyway i wont tell you the end but I can tell you that this film is a sure film to see if you are a spider-fan or if you liked the first movie or if you want to see a film with loads of great action!!!! I'm looking forward to spider-man 3!!! So i give Spider-man 2 10 out of 10 ( Its my fave movie of all time)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spider-Man set the bar the first time it came out a few years ago. I knew how the films sequel had to be made to be better then the first film and that's hard to do when the first film rocked. But when I saw Spider-Man Part 2, I was blown away! Peter Parker is having a hard time. He just got fired from his pizza delivery job, he is struggling in school, he barely see's his friends, and he worries about his Aunt May. His girlfriend Mary Jane is an actress and Harry is head of Oscorp, making it the company his father Norman always wanted it to be. Osborne has just signed Dr. Otto Octavious to show a new experiment reveling the power of the sun in a persons hand. On the big show day, the experiment goes wrong and it kills Miss. Octavious and welds mechanical arms to the back of Otto Octavious. Now as a monster Octavious sets out to a life of crime so he can rebuild his machine and start the experiment all over again, this time that can destroy all of New York! It's up to Peter to stop Dr. Octopuss. But Peter soon realizes he is turning normal and his powers are vanishing. Can he stop the evil villain before all the people he know and loves are all doomed!? First off, great cast! I loved the characters from the beat Peter Parker all the way to the mean and one liner Daily Buelgel boss J. Jonah Jamenson. The plot is fantastic and the villain is 100 times better then Norman Osbornes Green Goblin. The special affects are better than the original and are much cleaner. I'm glad to see that Toby returned to play Spider-Man, without him the film would be dead. Also the funny line about his bad back after he falls off a building would be gone, ha!Thank you Sam for directing this wonderful film. This is what blockbusters are supposed to be like!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Let's not mince words- This film kicked proverbial ass</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the perfect summer blockbuster.Generally I tend not to be a fan of these dubious blockbuster movies that've been in vogue in Hollywood summers for a few years now. They're all well and good to go see with a gang of friends after the BBQ or before the beach party- but as a rule, and though it's a clichd sentiment, they just lack heart.This, though, is something different. Spider-man, the original movie, was something that I wasn't awaiting with my tongue hanging out in hungry anticipation. I ambled along to the cinema a week or so after opening night, practically by accident, expecting an entertaining romp on a summer evening with my BF- but expecting nothing more. What can i say- I came out in love with the movie. Although i'll be the first to admit that in the past I've ranted in unison with the most stuck-up of critics on the damage and evils of CGI and the blockbuster breed of movies in general, I simply turned around when i saw this movie- luscious effects, excellent cinematography, downright nasty villain, great direction and scripting. Add in the ever so slightly angsty performances of the ever wonderful Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst plus ace cast set against an achingly beautiful NY backdrop, and this was just one of the best films of the year.And now, the sequel. Wow. This movie is really really better. where the first stood alone as a melancholic tale of the loneliness that must be endured by a good man, the second film deepens and expands upon the real themes that were found in the first. "Sequel" is a word with bad connotations- and one almost feels the term is unjust for such a wonderful movie. This is a movie which is rich, romantic, funny, poignant, and just exciting as hell.Whether you're marvelling at the swooping, poetic magnificence of Spiderman's sky- scraper acrobatics, becoming emotionally entangled in Peter's raw deal in life, biting nails in the jaw-dropper actions scenes or shedding a surreptitious tear for the lovers of this entrancing tragi-comedy, i just advise you to watch out. You might end up loving this movie a little more than is socially advisable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More Human than Spider. Troubled Peter Parker languishes through Spider Man II</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the second installment of the adaption of the Marvel comic book hero's saga. Peter Parker ( Tobey Maguire ) is exhausted and disillusioned at the prospect of continuing his double life as his alter ego Spider Man. Beset with financial troubles and lovesick for his childhood sweetheart Mary Jane Watson, Portrayed modestly by beauty Kirsten Dunst. Fearing he can never be with Mary Jane and protect her from Spider Man's mortal enemies at the same time, He sets out to try and erase Spider Man from his consciousness. But there are plenty of pitfalls along the way. And the more Parker tries to keep things calm, the more catastrophes flare up. Most of them just aching for the return of the wall crawler. And when yet another mad scientist is hideously altered by a benign experiment gone awry, there is never any real doubt that Spidey will return. Otto Octavious or Doc Ock, one of Spider Man's main nemesis in the best selling comic book, is portrayed with maniacal intellect by Alfred Molina. A fine actor who has had excellent rolls in lots of top notch films including 'Boogie Nights' and 'Magnolia' but will probably always be remembered as 'Moody' in the docudrama 'Not without my daughter.' If I did have a problem with this film it would be with Mcquire. If you're going to remain true to the gist of the comic book, which I think this movie otherwise does an excellent job of. You'd have to also remain true to the Peter Parker character. Peter Parker was not a nerd. He was a shy young man who blossomed through the lessons he learned as the incredibly powerful Spider Man. Mcquire looks to me like a real nerd, and therefore he has no room or way to blossom. I think they could have fit someone hunkier with a set of horn rimmed glasses at the beginning and convinced me that they had bulked up through web slinging and grown up through crime fighting while still looking like a movie star. In Mcquire's defense, playing a super hero can be difficult, because it is so outrageous to think that someone could ever posses superpowers, left alone make anyone believe a real human being would choose these reactions to the world in their situation. And he is credible inside this theory. I'm not saying Tobey Mcquire is an incompetent actor, I'm saying he is wrong for this roll. He is simply too milk toast for my tastes. Especially when he's attempting to court the beautiful Dunst. Who's elegance leaves no doubt as to why Spidey would prefer to be human. There are lots of pluses though. Molina is a strong and convincing villain. And the special effects are an absolute wonder. The entire effects crew received an Academy Award for their efforts and it's easy to see why. The deadly artificial limbs sported by Doc Ock, are as convincing as they are terrifying. Whether he's walking down the street, climbing a wall or battling the wall crawler toe to toe, it is a breathtaking spectacle. I have never seen a film, including the amazing 'Star Wars' sequels, which could boast effects as realistic and stunning as these. For fans of this genre there is no drop off from Spider Man to Spider Man II. It is much more like another issue than it is a sequel and this is a credit to the brain trust behind this engine whether or not they meant to present it this way. They tease you with the human struggle, then knock your noggin off with thrilling action. This is a blockbuster worth every penny. Don't miss it. 8 out of a possible 10 T.H.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Everything a sequel should be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After I saw Spiderman in 2002, I was blown away at what I had been missing. Being a teenage girl, superheroes were never really my thing...Until I saw Spiderman. Immediately, it became my obsession...Spiderman was one cool person! Now, After seeing this sequel, I have regained this love for Spidey, excited by all the action, tearjerkers, and just a tiny hint of humor. Doc Oc is a very interesting villain...Just like The Green Goblin, he seems to be insane, talking to his four mechanical arms. "A voice...in my head..." That lone quote sent shivers down my spine.The only thing about Spiderman 2 that I did not care for was the extremely violent hospital scene where Doc Oc's arms began to slaughter the doctors. That was almost too much for me and my friends to bear. I covered my eyes most of the time.Other than that one scene, I was very engrossed in the movie...And so was my five-year-old sister, who loves Spiderman as much as I do. (And in case you were wondering, no, she did not see the hospital scene.)And by the way...Is Trinium real? I have been wondering this ever since I saw the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Officially the greatest movie I have ever seen (spoilers included)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>6/20/2005Warning! This review contains major spoilers! If you haven't seen the film yet, then please don't read the review!...Still with me? Good.After seeing "Spider-Man" in 2002, I honestly thought I'd never see a better movie. It had action and adventure, yes, but "Spider-Man" also had a clever story, good humor, wonderful performances and, above all, heart. I thought the sequel wouldn't match the first.I was wrong - "Spider-Man 2" does what I never thought it would: surpass the original."Spider-Man 2" is one of the few movies I can watch over and over and never get tired of seeing. That, my friends, is a rare honor for any movie. Each time I watch it, it's still as fun and action-packed, and the humor still makes me laugh out loud each time. It also bases itself close to the comics, by expanding the story into a new, more realistic direction than the first film.You see, Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire, perfectly portraying the dual roles of Parker and his wall-crawling alter-ego) has problems since becoming Spider-Man just a little over two years ago. Peter gave up his true love, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst, in a somewhat smaller role than in the first film, but gives a wonderful performance) to spare her of the dangers of dating a superhero, only to have her become engaged to astronaut John Jameson (Daniel Gillies). His Aunt May (Rosemary Harris, who is wonderful in her bigger role) has financial problems with her home. Peter has financial problems by leaving his apartment he shared with his friend, Harry Osborn (James Franco, who starts to slip to the dark side), and now lives in a small apartment.Harry, who now lives in his late father's home and runs his company of OsCorp, has Peter meet his idol - Doctor Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina, who perfectly plays the role as Spidey's best foe yet - and one of the best movie villains ever!) - and the two later watch Octavius give a demonstration on fusion with his four, artificial-intelligence programmed tentacles. The experiment goes awry, bonding the tentacles to Octavius' body permanently and becomes known as Doctor Octopus, or Doc Ock.Peter, meanwhile, is so bummed out over losing Mary Jane that his powers start to fade and act psychologically - when he's happy, he swings fine, but if he's down, his web-shooters clog up. Unaware it's an identity crisis, Peter even dumps his costume and gives up life as Spider-Man. But when Octavius kidnaps Mary Jane and almost destroys New York when his new, enlarged fusion machine is built, you know Peter's retirement won't last.The only flaw of the movie, though, is the number of people who find Spider-Man without his mask off (I don't wanna spoil it, but thankfully at the end, Spidey's identity is in safe hands - with the exception for one person). But so what? The movie works perfectly, you can ignore and/or forgive the flaws!Peter and Mary Jane's relationship is even better the second time around, Doc Ock is a much better and complex villain than Norman Osborn/Green Goblin (who cameos in the film - but how you'll have to see), and the fight scenes will leave you breathless. The train sequence alone is a major highlight of the film, from the Doc Ock/Spider-Man fight to Spidey saving the passengers (and later thanked by them). Everything about this film works wonderfully, from the cinematography and acting to action and music. The music by Danny Elfman is even better this time around, especially the entire train sequence and Spidey's talk to Mary Jane in a web near the end. The acting mixed with the music by Elfman will bring you close to tears.The humor also works well, particularly by J. Jonah Jameson (J.K. Simmons), Spidey's boss and John's father.Returning director Sam Raimi and writer Alvin Sargent outdo themselves with a smarter, more exciting, more moving sequel. And the ending screams "Sequel!" in exciting, better new ways than the first film.As the headline of the Daily Bugle reads about Spider-Man at one point, "He's back!" And audiences I'm sure are glad to see Spidey's return in this incredible sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Every bit as good as the first</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It every bit as good as the first only lacking the freshness the original had when we first saw Spider-man kicking butt. It picks up the first film's story a couple of years later and things haven't been going Peter Parker's (Tobey Maguire) way. He is becoming increasingly estranged from his best friend Harry Osborn (James Franco) over the hatred Harry feels towards Spider-Man and is slowly but surely letting the girl of his dreams, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), slip away for fear his alter ego will eventually cause her undue harm. Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) is losing the home she shared with Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson) since she has not been able to keep up the mortgage and Peter himself is close to losing his rundown apartment for similar reasons. His grades in college are dropping since he is off saving the day instead of attending class or doing his homework, and to top it all off his super powers are inexplicably failing on him at the most inopportune of times. It's not easy being a young, angst riddled super hero in this day and age, even if you happen to be the friendly neighborhood Spider-Man.During this turbulent time Peter conducts an interview for a college term paper in an attempt to salvage his failing grades and becomes fast friends with Dr. Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina), who has been doing research involving fusion energy and is close to unveiling his work to the world. His new reactor could create a cheap and efficient energy source for all the peoples of the world, but the slightest miscalculation during the process could leave half of New York City a wasteland. When the inevitable accident does occur and only Spider-Man's heroics save the entire city, Octavius' laboratory, reputation and life are decimated and his is left with only the robotic tentacles he utilized for his complex scientific work?only now they are fused to his spine and are free to live a life of their own. Soon the artificial intelligence of the tentacles take over Octavius' higher brain functions and in his lowest moments of desperation are able to convince the good doctor that the work on his fusion reactor must continue, whatever the cost.Many of Spider-Man 2's plot elements are very similar to 1980's Superman 2, and I am willing to let the film slide on that since the theme of the hero abandoning his powers and duty for personal happiness was originally explored in Spider-Man lore years ago. But the two films also share another common link, one that can only be appreciated when held in comparison to other super hero action films made in the past twenty five years; both films draw their protagonist's dual identities as fully developed characters. In this film as in Superman 2, the super hero is secondary to the individual underneath the tights facing more day-to-day trials and tribulations.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great story with an even greater movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Blockbuster summer movies always carry with them a "harder they fall" risk. Fortunately, this movie avoids that trap, and is one of the most visually compelling action movies of all time. That it has a plot which could survive without the special effects only makes it that much more compelling.The movie begins a few years after the last one ends, with Peter Parker, ever-troubled super-hero, unsuccessfully attempts to juggle his studies, some throwaway jobs, and his duties as a superhero. Spidey may be a superhero, but he's also human (one major appeal of Spiderman in general is the scientific basis for how the heroes and villains got their powers), and never is this more apparent as in the beginning of the movie, when his life comes apart at the wheels. Something has to give, so Peter decides to sell Spidey's costume to J. Jonah Jameson (the Spidey-hating, uber-thrifty editor of the Bugle)for some walkaround money. The custome becomes a trophy for Jameson, who gloats over running Spidey out of NYC in his paper. J.K. Simmons turns in the best performance of the movie if one considers just how well he brought the one-dimensional Jonah to life.After Spidey (Toby MacGuire) quits, of course, a supervillain arrives on the scene to drag him out of retirement. "Doc Ock," as he is called, winds up with four metallic tentacles (arms) attached to his body that do his evil bidding after his experiment for "perpetual fusion" (read: cheap electricity) goes wrong and begins sucking the world into its reactor (the way the sun would). With no more funding from Harry Osborne to get the "Tridium" (what makes the reactor run), the Doc decides to do whatever it takes to continue his work: that means getting more Tridium from Harry, but to do this, Harry makes a deal that he will only trade it for Spiderman.Spiderman presents himself for the battle, but his powers have been on the fritz, and begin letting him down in some painful ways (such as in midair, when his webbing no longer works). Peter Parker (Spidey's alter ego) even consults a doctor and frames the problem as a dream, and is told that Spidey's problem is more likely stress and exhaustion. This is underscored by his powers still partially working, and it is established that Spidey just needs to find his groove again. With Doc Ock wreaking havoc, and with MJ (Kirsten Dunst) moving on with her life, and with his financial difficulties, this is not going to be easy.Peter tries to adjust to life as a normal civilian, but every time he witnesses a crime, he hears duty calling, and he can't break from the past. Compounding his difficulty is that while he was "on break" from being Spidey, Peter misled MJ into thinking he had changed, which only furthers the rift between the two (MJ is set to marry Jonah's hunky astronaut son). Needless to say, we get a climax, a native's-eye view of New Yorkers (including one very ungrateful man on a runaway subway car who derides Peter's attempt to stop it), and some very touching scenes involving Aunt Mae, who shows that when called upon, even she can fight the bad guys effectively.This movie excels in the same way as the entire Spiderman series: Peter Parker is so much like most of us that we actually could see ourselves doing what he does, and he also shows that having Superpowers, while not entirely a curse, definitely do not solve one's life problems. In fact, the only time Parker is decisive and without doubt is when he is in costume, and the only uncertainty he feels about that is part of the larger issue of whether or not he is harming himself by saving the world. The moral dilemma is common among activists in that they routinely have to sacrifice personal gains for the greater good, leaving them with the feeling that when they were invited to life's party by God, they were handed a broom and told to clean up the mess created by everyone's fun.Normally it would be a negative to say that the actors portrayed their characters as if they were from the comics, but since this movie is based on the comics, that is yet another plus. Dunst is particularly adept at bringing MJ to life in this way: she really acts as if she were hurtled into this universe from the pages of a cartoon. One would have to have lived in NYC for a long time to appreciate the subtlety with which the city is brought to life. New Yorkers are portrayed in the movie as selfish and into themselves, but also able to rise to the occasion when required to, showing a level of humanity and compassion that can only be understood by natives. On the train, Peter loses his mask in the course of saving everyone, and it is clearly understood that despite the large size of the crowd who has now seen Spidey, that no one will ever breach his confidence. This is New York at its best. I also love the way the movie didn't rename New York, and instead embraced the city rather than alluding to it. Without this characteristic, the movie would have been far less entertaining. One minor part of the film served a double purpose, as it showcased a NYC street musician who happened to be playing the old Spidey theme from the TV cartoons on her violin.Not only is this movie a "must see," but it is a must-see even in a group of a dozen other "must see" films. If there is anyone out there who doesn't like this movie, I'd be interested in hearing why. I can't think of a single reason why anyone would finish watching this movie and feel like the time and money spent were not worth it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the best comic movie ever...arguably</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been a reader of Spider-Man since I was a child. While the first movie exceeded my expectations, the second reached a new level. I believe Spider-Man is (thus far) the greatest comic book movie series created and that Spider-Man 2 is the best individual comic movie. The only competition i would concede it is batman. while that movie was very stylized and re-envisioned Batman and comic book movies, if you watch it today, I believe you will see that it has not aged too well. In particular, the Joker's boom box toting hench-men are a little dated. Spider-Man walks the line of putting its fantastic characters into the real world without making them campy or unrealistic. Of course there is the sci-fi fantasy element, but who couldn't imagine a character just like Peter in their college class? In my opinion, his cinematic development has in two movies dwarfed the development of Bruce Wayne or the Clark Kent (who I felt were kind of one dimensional on screen). Also, Spider-Man has managed to convey some dark scenes and strained relationships (as in the books) without slipping into a completely dark and depressing atmosphere.I think Spider-Man 2 works so well because of the attention to character development. While some long time readers will complain that "this" or "that" didn't happen in the comic books as it did in the movie, its clearly an unfair analysis. How could you expect 40 years worth of story to be converted into a trilogy of movies, as Spider-Man was originally slated to be (im aware that since there has been rumor of as many as six spider-man movies on deck)? Besides that, as much as i love the comics, especially the older origin stories, and Spidey's classic battles with the likes of the Green Goblin, Kraven, Sandman, and the Vulture, just to name a few, I have to admit that many of those origins would be difficult to translate in to a fantastic reality on screen, and i do believe Raimi has tried (and succeeded) to make these characters as realistic as possible. When this movie was coming out, I wasn't too excited to see Doc Ock. He's never really been one of my favorite villains (that was Green Goblin). However, even though this movie didn't feature one of my favorite enemies, I still love it for the human element and the character relationships. Even though the characters and stories may differ some from the original comics, the SPIRIT of the characters is dead on. Raimi has, in my opinion, beautifully captured the heart of the characters and their interaction with one another. I couldn't imagine anyone putting Peter Parker on screen any better than he has, and I think Tobey Maguire has been phenomenal in his subdued portrayal of the luckless hero. As a Spider-Man fan, I couldn't have asked for a better director than Mr. Raimi, who himself is a lifelong spider-fan. He has translated a character that I grew up on onto the big screen, and i wouldn't have any of what hes done changed if i could. Spider-Man 2 transcended the big summer blockbuster with great dialogue, character development, and romance. He combined a great, smart story with jaw dropping action. I couldn't have asked for anything more of this movie, and if one and two are any indication, all spider-man fans should be anxiously awaiting Spider-Man 3.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great responsibility is overrated. (But this movie isn't.)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*note: the spoilers below may likely apply to the original movie as well, FYI* I'm often skeptical when it comes to superhero movies, and there have been very few made that I've actually liked. (The first Burton "Batman" movie, the two "X-Men" movies, and the two "Spider-Man" movies are about it. Oh, and the first two "Superman" movies.) So I was glad to be able to enjoy Sam Raimi's take on the Spiderman saga thus far.The first movie I thought was amazing, in both presentation and style. It quickly indoctrinated the uninitiated into the Spiderman storyline.As for the second movie, it was able to crank up the angst a bit, which for me kept it from being a total 10 (which is what I gave the first one.) Yes, some may argue that part 2 is a better movie, but it felt more like a soap opera than an action hero flick to me, which is really what I wanted.What saved it for me is the fact that the film didn't get totally bogged down in the love triangle (not to mention the hate-by-association of Harry Osborn for Peter Parker, which will obviously only intensify once he learns the truth about who killed Norman.) Doc Ock was another example of an increasingly disturbing (to me) trend of sympathetic villains. "It's not my fault, I swear! The evil genius robot arms made me do it!" I miss the days when one could root against a super-villain without having to identify with the plight that lead to their allegedly nefarious path.But other than those minor quibbles, I loved the movie. I even liked that Aunt May became a stronger character overall. I hope that actress will be available when the expected sequels come out. (Available to act, that is. I'm not looking for a mature date or anything.) The ending's implications left me a little nervous, as I can't help but see Harry as being potentially a bit Anakin-like as a villain, but that's a spoiler for another movie...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Granted, I'm only sixteen, and haven't seen many movies before about 1975. But I've read many, many Spiderman comics, and this film captures the essence almost completely.Spider-Man 2 surpasses the first in every way. Better story, much better villain, although there is nothing wrong with Willem Dafoe. He did the best with the character he was given. But Molina conveys an actual sense of emotion to the audience. It actually made me care about him. Plus, the fight scenes were 10 times better.Peter and MJ's strained relationship actually makes you care about what happens to them. You actually hope it turns out great for them in the end. Maguire and Dunst are the perfect cast.Franco is a superb Harry, and is just how I'd imagine him to be. Ruthless, but caring and friendly. Harris is as loving and caring as Aunt May would be expected to be.I have one problem though, and that is that Spidey is not as witty as he should be. He has barely any snappy one-liners that we've come to expect from the wall crawler.But apart from that, this is a cinematic masterpiece, mixing comedy, drama, action and romance.Roll on Spider-Man 3.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is probably the best superhero movie, and much better than the first one, but not in terms of action. The action was OK, but what really shines about this movie is the duologue and drama. The villain battles are pretty good, but they usually don't last very long but boy are they great. The ending is very unpredictable, but most of the plot "twists" are. My friend and I went, and he hated it because it didn't have a lot of action, Although I loved it. I like the amount of drama used, and the plot twists are pretty predictable, but still used well. Recommended to everyone who likes drama and liked the first one, but don't try to go with an action fan, because they will be disappointed.</fullReview>

Tobey did a great job as Spiderman and I hope he keeps playing the role in future sequels. Kirsten did a better acting job in this movie than the first, but she should seriously take some acting lessons. Alfred Molina was great as the new villain, and gave William Dafoe a run for superior villain. The movie sets up a series of trailers for events that could possibly happen in the third movie, like Harry becoming the new Goblin.

		<fullReview>Luckily for me, I first saw this movie at the cinemas where basically everything you see there is a better experience than at home on the sofa. The picture is clearer, sound perfect, and lighting is great. It was particularly so in this picture because of the great action sequences made with the special effects. The scenes that mostly gave me tingles were the ones where Spidey and Doc Oc fought one on one, especially the train ride scene.Moving on to the story, I thought the plot was excellent, sticking to the very well known comic book created by Stan Lee. The acting was well done by lead Richard Maguire, who to me was the perfect choice for Spidey. Kirsten Dunst is fine as Mary Jane Watson, Alfred Molina as well with his performance as Doc Oc. Franco's performance is quite good too as the tortured Harry, as J.K. Simmons is always funny as J. Jonah Jameson.All in all, the story is great, acting excellent and special effects wonderful. This is sure one of the best movie's I've seen all year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The first time a sequel has been better than the original film...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spiderman 2 blew me away. It wasn't all about the special effects, it was about mood and acting, a few things sequels never consider.I am in awe of Sam Raimi directing this. Again, Maguire and Dunst have great chemistry and put their all into their acting. The same with Franco, Molina and all the rest of the players, even to the small cameo role Campbell had. It was casted perfect like the last one.On top of this, the whole Spiderman franchise hasn't fallen into constant branding and trying to cash in on trends, like the Batman one did. (Yes, I know there is a 3rd one, but I have high hopes it isn't going to become horrible.) This series has a certain integrity to it. Maybe it is Sam Raimi's background, but it plays out like a dream and I can see, like in the scene where Doc Ock comes to live and grabs people that Raimi hasn't lost the in-your-face horror mets comedy of such films like Army of Darkness and The Evil Dead. The whole movie makes you want to laugh, then cry. It is just perfect.I love the complexity of the plot and characters too. Great work! :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sequel entertains fans of the series and characters..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When the original Spiderman hit the big screen in 2002, it helped to reinvigorate the comic book movie franchise. While the sequel has its corny moments, Spiderman 2 stays true to the first film both visually and in the spirit of the characters. The film builds on the story from the first movie, where Peter Parker first learns of his unique, spider-like abilities.If you're watching a sequel, chances are you've seen the first movie. Therefore, this go-around is geared towards developing the characters and their relationships. Peter, a.k.a. Spiderman, is having trouble dealing with his double life, balancing a job and classes with his duties as a masked crime-fighter. His love interest, Mary Jane Watson, has grown tired of waiting for him and is engaged to a wealthy space cadet. Parker's best friend, Harry Osborn, is still dealing with the death of his father, for which he blames Spiderman. Throw a new villain into the mix, Dr. Otto Octavius, and there you have it.Director Sam Raimi uses the same style he did in the first movie, but makes significant advances in special effects. The moving tentacles of "Doc Ock," in particular, helped earn Spiderman 2 an Academy Award nomination for best visual effects.As expected, Tobey Maguire delivers as Peter Parker. His shy, gawky demeanor is perfect for the role and fans of the series can only hope he stays on for the duration of the franchise. He was rumored to have been replaced by Jake Gyllenhaal for this film due to a back injury, but stuck with the project. His status for Spiderman 3 is up in the air.Alongside Maguire, Kirsten Dunst's performance as M.J. is so comic book-like that you can almost envision a box over her head containing her lines. While not the best actress in some situations, she is definitely the perfect choice for this role, a part that requires a certain amount of overplaying at times.Then, there are the character actors, most notably J.K. Simmons as Jonah Jameson and Alfred Molina as "Doc Ock." Both do a fine job and add something special to their scenes. Molina has a presence about him that oozes complexity. You can feel the internal conflict between "Doc Ock" and Otto Octavius, especially towards the end of the film when Octavius tries to pry himself away from the prosthetic tentacles that bind him.Several potential villains are introduced subtly throughout the film as well, although I won't spoil the surprises for fans of the original comic book. Hopefully, those fans will get to see these new villains in many future installments of the franchise. As long as the core of Raimi, Maguire and Dunst stays in tact, moviegoers can always expect a treat from their friendly neighborhood Spiderman.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a vast improvement over the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As children, most of us grow up wishing we could become gravity-defying super heroes, flying around the world, battling villains, rescuing the innocent, and fighting for truth, justice and the American way. But what if the burden of such a calling turned out to be too much for us? What if saving the world became a 24-hour-a-day/seven-days-a-week occupation that prevented us from leading a normal life and finding happiness with our one true love? That is the dilemma Peter Parker faces in "Spiderman 2," a deeper, richer, more psychologically nuanced follow-up to the rather innocuous "Spiderman" from 2002. Most of the major players from the original have returned, including director Sam Raimi and stars Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst. What's different this time around is that the filmmakers have chosen to emphasize the inner conflict Parker is undergoing between needing to fulfill the awesome responsibilities that go along with being a crime fighting super hero and wanting to chuck it all in order to win the heart of the literal girl-next-door. Parker finds that being Spiderman keeps him from fulfilling the mundane, run-of-the-mill, day-to-day commitments one needs to in order to have successful relationships with other people - most especially the girl he loves. When the conflict becomes too much for him, Peter has to decide whether or not he is going to continue to lead this double existence or return to the simplicity of life as a mere mortal. It is this added intellectual dimension that gives "Spiderman 2" the thematic heft that "Spiderman 1" lacked.The plot, involving a brilliant scientist who inadvertently becomes a killing machine when one of his experiments goes awry, is reasonably entertaining and interesting, though it pales in comparison to the love story and the complex internal conflict taking place in our superhero's overtaxed psyche. The special effects seem vastly improved over the original, with Spiderman's movements through the air appearing considerably more graceful and natural than they did the first time around. A spectacular scene involving Spiderman attempting to arrest a runaway train racing uncontrollably through Manhattan is the action highlight of the film.As Parker, Toby Maguire provides the emotional gravity the story needs to be effective. His shy, self-effacing demeanor draws us to the character and makes him a believable, sympathetic figure whom the audience can relate to and root for all the way through. The sweet, vulnerable, yet eternally self-assured Kirsten Dunst makes for the perfect romantic counterpart to this young man who's all thumbs and who seems perpetually tongue-tied when he isn't donning his webbed designer jumpsuit.I wasn't a big fan of the first "Spiderman" movie, but "Spiderman 2" has an intelligence and charm that make this particular installment awfully hard to resist. Raimi may have struck out the first time around, but he has managed to hit a homer - or at least a solid triple with the bases loaded - this time at bat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a maniacal scientist (Alfred Molina) plots destruction against the city, Harry (James Franco) continues his obsession with the superhero he believes is responsible for his father's death, Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) tries to get on with her life after being rejected by her true love and Peter (Tobey Maguire) begins to question whether or not he has what it takes to be a superhero.Director Sam Raimi has thrown out traditional sequel conventions and made a thoughtful follow-up. While this makes for a slower film, it is a better one. He has succeeded in making a comic book into a truly excellent film, something I did not think was possible after the failed attempt with "Hulk." The special effects, settings and story are all top-notch?particularly the effects. In this day and age, computer effects are mostly overrated and poor. While they are obviously fake in some parts, they are better than in most movies. All returning actors have stepped back into the characters as though they have never left. However, J.K. Simmons (as Peter's boss), as good as he is, seems to belong in a different movie; he's too over-the-top compared with the rest. But, the few missteps are easily forgotten. This is a truly wonderful movie and a testament to what a wonderful filmmaker can do.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After the hype surrounding the average Spiderman, I was looking forward to this because it introduced Doc Oc, one of my favourite comic book bad guys, but I wasn't expecting it to be vastly better than the first. I was proved wrong, this improves over part 1 in every way, the performances are stronger, the effects are better, it is far more exciting and there is a less teeny feel about it. Not quite as good as the X-men movies, but better than most other recent comic book movies.Peter Parker has been masquerading as Spiderman for some time, helping the city from crime, but he still has his critics. More importantly though he is trying to get on with a normal life, earning money and thinking about MJ. However, after the events of the first film, the three people Peter cares for most are becoming distant from him in different ways. MJ has fallen for someone else, the astronaut son of Jameson and Peter keeps letting her down. Also, his best friend Harry, whose father (Green Goblin) was killed by Spiderman is closing in on his discovery and is becoming increasingly hate filled and paranoid. Aunt May is also getting older and becomes estranged from her nephew when she realises what Peter did in the first film. As well as this, Peter seems to be losing his powers. He decides that he must give up Spiderman. After meeting Doctor Octavius, an experiment goes wrong simultaneously destroying the Osbourne company and turning the Doc into Doc Oc. Doc Oc goes on a crime spree, and begins to put New York in danger, particularly Peter's closest friends. He must be stopped at all costs, so Spiderman is reborn.Firstly the writers and Raimi deal with the many intertwining plot lines brilliantly, squeezing everything into the two hours, and leaving space for tonnes of action. Fans of the comic will enjoy seeing the appearance of later important characters such as John Jameson and Doc Connors. Each storyline is followed carefully and we feel sympathy towards Parker whose gift is becoming a curse. However, as this is primarily marketed as a summer blockbuster it is the stunts, action and effects which will matter to the masses. And they are excellent. The fights between Spiderman and Doc Oc are some of the most impressive action sequences to date, especially when the pair are flying through the city at break-neck speeds. Once the action starts, the excitement rarely fades, juxtaposed by the impending threat of peter being uncovered, and Harry finding out the truth. The film also sets itself wonderfully for sequels and spin-offs, as fans will know about the appearance of Venom, Doc Connors and the Hobgoblin. Maguire performs much better here than in the first, and his character's depth certainly increases. Dunst is also much better, possibly her best performance since Interview with a Vampire, and Molina is perfect as Doc Oc. Franco as Harry also admirably shows range as he struggles between sanity and madness, and although he seems to be losing he still is capable of getting sympathy from us. Overall an excellent comic conversion, and more like what the first should have been-great, clever entertainment.8 out of 10</fullReview>

Peter parker (Tobey Maguire) is a regular college student in New York but hides a secret he has had for a while. he is secretly Spiderman, the Web Slinger and savior of the city. but Peter is having trouble with his life for the two identities are conflicting to much. He gives up the life of the Spidey. But soon a new villain is on the move, a doctor driven mad by his own work, Dr. Octavius (Alfred Molina) is seeking to finish his work with the extra pair of arms attached to his back. Now Parker must decide whether he is to be Spidey and save the day or sit back and watch the city destroyed. The story is better than the first. The idea of Spiderman actually experiencing human emotion is a lot more believable. Maguire is his usual self playing a strong hero and Kristen Dunst as his secret love. In my opinion, this may be the best superhero movie ever made. Alfred Molina I liked more as a villain than Willem Dafoe.Spider-Man 2. Starring: Tobey Maguire, Kristen Dunst, Alfred Molina, James Franco, and Rosemary Harris. 4 1/2 out of 5 Stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like most of the world, I enjoyed this movie. It had a very good story line for a super hero movie, and the special effects were awesome. That out of the way, I know move on to the acting. Tobey Macguire was convincing, but every time Kirsten Dunst came on I lost that feeling. James Franco was a little un-entertaining, but still was appropriate for his role. Bruce Campbell was hilarious in his cameo as a snotty theater person. However, Alfred Molina and Rosemary Harris were excellent and superb; bringing air and life to all of their scenes. Well, mostly Molina brought death, but hey! However, my favorite performance was one of the more brief ones. Willem Dafoe's brief return near the end of the film. Most people thought he was horrible in the first movie, but I thought he was wonderful. He gave just the right amount of leverage to his brief appearance and creeps the living daylights out of me. I have a week spot for those creepy performances. All and All, well worth watching</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Raimi Weaves a Great Web!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This sequel to the first Spiderman, a film I thought was imaginative and wonderful, is at the very least that film's equal and in all probability a better film. The story picks up with Peter Parker resuming his career as the webbed crusader while going to school and trying to make ends meet as a pizza delivery guy. He also pines for Mary Jane, must hear the relentless diatribes of his friend Harry on what he will do if he catches Spiderman, and stand idly by as his Aunt loses her home. Well, Peter must realize who he is and what he wants in life - of course, while he does this a well-meaning scientist turns into a four mechanical armed menace and threat to the city of New York. Dr. Octopus becomes Spidey's number one nemesis and director Sam Raimi once again dazzles with his flair as a director in creating suspenseful action scenes, poignant, touching scenes, and some scenes with real humour. This again is not Citizen Kane but is a fine film with a great story, solid characterizations, exciting action-packed tension, some great CGI effects, and some good ole' fashioned fun. All of the performers return for a second bow and do equally well again. I particularly thought Rosemary Harris's performance and McGuire's were the most well-rounded. Alfred Molina is Doc Oc, and he is excellent. I wish he had had more time as the sane doctor, because he was very credible. As a villain, he was able to throw off one-liners very nicely as well. Look for Bruce Campbell in a great cameo as a snooty usher. The end leaves door open for an obvious sequel concerning a Green Goblin. He made me laugh sooo hard! One great roller coaster of a film ride!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>raimi's big budget classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>this sequel to a film where only one major flaw stood out was always going to be difficult, but Sam Raimi proves it can be done. gone is the annoying and over rated performance by William Daefoe in the first one, gone is the weak presence of green goblin, instead of the comic book adaption the first one was(however good it was), this is a proper movie. the first obvious difference is the more complex relationships between the characters, secondly the bad guy has presence, humour and a truly evil character, enforced by the amazing performance by Alfred Molina and finally Sam Raimi's touch, which is shown more then ever in this film.the story itself is very basic. its being two years since peter Parker(played by Toby Maguire, who seems to empathise well with Peter's character) defeated the green goblin, but his problems are not over. struggling with his friend Harry Osbourne(with another good performance from James Franco); who blames Spiderman for the death of his father(green goblin)and obsesses about finding and killing him, peter also struggles with keeping his two jobs(one of which he is fired from early in the film), he cant pay the rent, and his love for Mary-Jane(played by Kirsten dunst), but inability to be with her causes a rift between the two. his school work also suffers and also brings him to meet doctor Otto Octavius, who plans to create power from stable fusion reactions, using his handy smart arms. however his experiment goes wrong leaving the smart arms grafted to his skin and in control of his actions and thoughts. convinced by the arms Otto(now doc ock) uses his new powers to gain the equipment needed. however spidey and doc ock only have one fight before, with all his problems peter loses faith in the path he choose and therefore begins to reject his powers. he gives up the life of a superhero and lives a normal live. however its not long before hes sporting the fetching tights again and kicking ock's ass! this time he even gets the girl.this film has everything, action, comedy, it pulls on the heart strings and even has a horror element. the scene where Pete tells aunt may what really happened the night uncle Ben died is heart-breaking while some scenes will have you chuckling on the sofa. the hospital scene with doc ock is almost definitely Sam raimi's fond memories of the evil dead shining through and is probably one of the scariest scenes to make it onto a PG. the CGI is amazing and not over done considering the amount that was needed. all the performances are excellent (bar William daefoe's cameo) and everything about this film is professional and well done.a must see!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is proof that Spiderman is all human. It really answers the question that if we were super heroes in real life what it will do to our life. It is two years later, and Peter Parker popularity as Spiderman keeps growing, but his social life as been lost, he can't keep a job, has trouble keeping up with Harry Osborne and Mary Jane Watson, and his grades in college continue to slip. One day the pressure of it all catches up with him, and then he decides to quit being Spiderman. Just when his normal life gets back on track, a new villain who has four mechanical arms attached to him called Dr. Octupus, begins causing mayhem in the city. Will Peter come back to being Spiderman again to stop him. Watch the movie to find out. I really enjoyed watching this movie because it had great special effects, and it showed the reality of what it would be like being a superhero.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sam Raimi has never made a bad movie. Even as a fan of the "cheap" Dark Man. I must say Spider-Man 2 and its story disappoints me. It's a predictable story for all that it's worth. Maybe that is the nature of a superhero movie, but it doesn't show me the bits that make me swirl in the corner of my home cinema. Even though, there are things in Spider-Man 2 that are good. The actors are excellent, the music of Elfman are as always soothing for a dark mind, and the way the camera flies in this move just makes you grasp. I hope Raimi picks a more exiting and UN-predictable story for his next sequel.. Both Spider-Man and Raimi's "worth" more than this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extremely good sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rarely do sequels live up to the original, but this one certainly does. There is an excellent attempt at Character Development, Peter Parker's personal life is in turmoil because he is Spider-man. If I can criticize anything about this movie is that too much effort was made to show how much of a loser he is in real life as a result of his heroic escapades. He misses the last hors d'oeuvre just one time too many, he falls from the sky perhaps once too often, and there are simply too many bad things happening to him at once. A few less would not have taken anything away from the film. And he has many many opportunities to tell MJ who he is but takes the wimpy way out instead. But as a whole, it is rare to see such emphasis put on Character Development in what is otherwise an action movie.The fight sequences are extremely well choreographed, especially when Spidey and Doc Ock are fighting against the side of a building. Also, Alfred Molina is a terrific villain, his facial expressions suit the role perfectly. Some of the CGI work is brilliant, when Peter and MJ are sitting in a caf and Doc Ock throws a car at them, I had to re-watch that scene over and over on DVD. All in all, a very enjoyable film and easily one I can recommend to anyone who is interested in the superhero genre.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spiderman 2 is the definition of a superhero movie, and Sam Raimi shows he hasn't lost a bit of his directorial vitality since Evil Dead. He throws the camera in every direction during this film, its like the Citizen Kane of summer blockbuster Marvel movie sequels. I mean this is daring stuff, its like throwing stale old Hollywood into a blender and throwing in a touch of 70s cinematic flair.Maguire hits the spot for the second time round, adding a significant amount of emotional backbone. The setting is used well, the New York solidarity touchingly corny. Doc Ock is f*ckin A, and beats the Green Goblin with that old "My uncontrollable robotic arms are my own worst enemy" schtick. Finally, need I remind the hot blooded males and sexy ass lesbian readers of this site how fine Mary Jane is. I could make a pun about web fluid but I'm just going to say it out loud to myself and laugh instead.I've spent way too much time writing this review, because I could have just reminded my fellow IMDb readers that the movie has a chainsaw in it, instantly demolishing any other negative reviews. We may have been a little drunk before we even set foot inside the theater, but we were downright high after that chainsaw scene. Even the female companions we brought along admitted the movie was super fly TNT, and totally rocked HARD. 10/10Spiderman 2 Quote J. Jonah Jameson: "Guy named Otto Octavius with 8 limbs.

		<fullReview>Since "Superman" (1978) became the first "A" picture based on comic book characters, numerous comic book superheroes has appeared on the big screen, most notably "Batman," "XMen," "Hellboy" and "Spiderman." However, until now, the comic book franchises have always suffered slightly from the melodramatic limitations of their origins. As one who did not like the original "Spiderman" film, I was pleasantly surprised to find "Spiderman 2" is not only superior to the first movie, "Spiderman 2" transcends the genre. Well written and acted, with Oscar-caliber special effects, in a less competitive year "Spiderman 2" would have been a Best Picture nominee. My only quibble is the lack of clarity for the plot references to the first movie. This quibble aside, "Spiderman 2" is an exciting, poignant, romantic movie with fully realized characters and satisfying ending. I give "Spiderman 2" a "9."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I procrastinated on watching this, because I wanted to see it at home. It was only fair, since I saw the first one at home. I'm used to hating sequels, but this one surprised me. It was one of those movies that I *think* the sequel was even better than the original. I'm going to buy copies of both DVD's and one day watch them both back to back.Toby McGuire is adorable as usual, and this movie gave a much deeper look into his character and what drives him. He was a bit more bold and more focused, but a little slow to react to what his heart told him to do, which kept me on the edge of my seat. I found it easier to follow than the first one, though I didn't have a problem with that in the first one. This one was just more explanatory.I would not actually call this movie a love story. I think it was more an action/drama with a little humor thrown in, and some lingering angst from the first one. All performances were brilliant, I thought. I look forward to sequel number three.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very impressive Superhero Film that is superior to the first. Most entertaining film of 2004</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed Spiderman a lot and was very pleased a sequel was coming out. This sequel is funnier and darker than the first and spends more time at looking at the character as well as Spiderman. The first was basically all Peter Parker and then ALL Spiderman however this movie has a balance of the two. The characters were much more intriguing for example Harry Osborn is really having problems in the fact that Spiderman murdered his father and that Peter takes his pictures and he suspects that Peter is hiding something plus Oscorp is having trouble after "Doc Ock" Doctor Octavious, his new feature, had and accident resulting in his robotic arms controlling him. He soon becomes the villain of the story because of this. Peter is really torn in too because he knows being Peter Parker his school work is great and he is able to spend time with MJ but as Spiderman she is getting married and his work is poor. This is a very exciting film with great effects and a good message as well as Great acting from a lot of characters especially Rosemary Harris (Aunt May).The Most entertaining film of 2004. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spiderman 2 is an excellent sequel to the first Spiderman movie.The story pick up were Spiderman left of, but now Peter Parker (Maguire) has problems with making his job, his school work and the whole saving New York thing go together. He loses his job and lacks behind his school work and when his superpowers have stopped working, well, then he's had enough. There's of course a new villain in town, Doc Ock (Molina) that wants to redo a failed experiment and thus must steal stuff from all over New York and Parker is soon forced to climb into his Spidey outfitThe film is very good and the characters get more fleshed out, especially Peter Parker and Harry Osborne (Franco). We also follow Osborn in his hunt on Spiderman to avenge his fathers death.All of this is mixed up in a humorous and exciting sequel. Parker may seem sometimes a bit too clumsy and you wonder how he can be a superhero, but I guess it was necesarry to give him a more human side. You feel sometimes that it's too much talk and too little action, but the action sequances are very good and breathtaking, especially the one on the monorail.I highly recommend this movie. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A solid sequel to my favorite superhero movie. While I have been unimpressed with most of the recent superhero movies (The Punisher, Hulk), the Spider-Man movies have continued to remain a step or two ahead of the pack. While not staying 100% true to the original comics, they don't stray too far. The production is top-notch and give us a visual treat with out going too far beyond believability. Despite some initial reservations, Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst have proved to be quality choices for the roles of Spider-Man and Mary Jane. Along with a solid supporting cast and good direction by Sam Raimi, the Spider-Man movie franchise has set the bar for superhero movies in the 2000s. I'm looking forward to the next installment. Unfortunately Spider-Man 3 isn't coming until 2007. Meanwhile, I remain hopeful for other quality additions to the genre.*** (out of 4)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know that in the first one they had to get the characters into place, (which to me they took forever to do) making it so dry in areas that I found myself dozing off and on through it. But, in Spiderman 2 they got right down to business while putting Doctor Octopus's character into place. To me, the action was so packed that I had no chance of dozing off. Casting Molina was a good chose for Dr. Octopus, and he's not that bad of an actor. McGuire and Dunst still need a little work though, but they are getting better in their acting as they get older. To me this one was much more entertaining then the first movie. And the two things I liked most about this movie was: 1. they didn't go from scene to scene in a comic book style and 2. The computer graphics were wonderfully done. The one thing I didn't like though, was the last five minutes, when they decide to turn it into a chick flick. That, I could have done without. (I know, it was like that in the comic and they are trying to stay true to it). But still, I could have done without the mushiness.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was an excellent film and even better than the first film. In this we see how the character of Peter Parker and Spiderman are developed and his relationships with those around him, and with a great ending. Special effects brilliant, although some of the fight scenes and other complicated scenes, although done well, were still noticeably computer generated rather than acted and filmed for real, such as the fight on the train, on the roof and the sides of it.Spoiler: Well written and well acted, and I loved that at last Mary Jane knows who Spiderman is and they become a couple at the end. Of course we also see near the end the green goblin suit and the son, Harry, being tempted by the Dark Side/Satan, who masquerades as his dead father in the mirror. In the first film we saw Satan take over Norman Osborne, and the third film will undoubtedly see Harry being taken over too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No it's not Jason, I mean Spidey, or Spider Man! And he's for real. WARNING Several Spoilers ahead, read at thy risk if ye has not yet seen. This shows two years after the original, it shows what Peter Parker does after the first, how he's adjusting to being a normal person and super hero at the same time, but he has problems, it's hard to do both at the same time. He gets late for class, he doesn't see Mary Jane often, and he hasn't made much money from his previous jobs, and couldn't meet deadlines. He's in some sort of dilemma, he seems to be losing his powers little by little, and his friend is losing it after the death of his father, and vows vengeance, and he's losing Mary Jane as well. It seems that Pete has a lot of responsibility after all with the power he's got. And now he has to stop Doc Ock/ Dr. Octopus from trying to continue his plans. This has got to be a great and most promising sequels to be seen, especially from a Marvel movie. It's great. This ain't no disappointment and the ending is cool, and after stopping Doc Ock, it's not the end of troubles. It has room for another sequel, can't wait for that! That makes it another success for Marvel, next to X-Men, X-Men 2 and Blade and Blade II. Oh, and be sure to spot Stan Lee, he's somewhere in this film. And don't forget the unforgettable soundtrack by Michael Buble, and I agree, it is worthy of an Oscar. Watch it, you know you wanna.</fullReview>

A new villain is in town, one of the most famous Spider-man villains, the famous Doc Ock. His monster tentacles have turned him into a horrible monster and he stops at nothing to get his experiment that killed his wife to work again. Spider-man must stop him before he destroys New York, his powers keep failing as he loses faith, he struggles as he chooses between a normal life and the life of the hero. Peter Parkers love Mary Jane slips away from him. Thats enough description for now. Please people you have to watch this, it is better then the first and the first was really good.

You could just feel the turmoil that he felt when he realized that he couldn't have a life with Mary Jane. Kirsten &amp; Tobey have amazing chemistry, it was a pleasure to watch them interact. I'm not one for action movies, but I really liked this movie, I liked the fact that the love story was a major part of the film.

		<shortDescription>Majestic movie making in every respect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1981, Sam Raimi unleashed himself (and Bruce Campbell) onto the film world with his first masterpiece; The Evil Dead. Since then, Raimi has gone on to make many films, and hasn't disappointed with a single one. And that more than includes this one.It has become a common opinion among certain people that movies which are heavy on action are brainless and therefore can't be intelligent or have an emotional impact on the audience. The first Spider-Man, and the X-Men films have already disproved this theory; but Spiderman 2 puts it beyond a shadow of a doubt. Many movies that try to blend together several elements end up falling down somewhere, but Spiderman 2 manages to blend more than a few, and blend them into one coherent masterpiece. Within the plot are elements of romance, sci-fi, action, comedy, drama, fantasy, and even a little bit of horror, Many films that have tried to blend several elements have failed, but here they all blend together nicely. All the elements of the plot come together, and all are definitely needed for the movie to flow; it is obvious that all these things weren't put in the movie just so the film could profess that it has lots of different elements; there is nothing in the plot of this movie that could be taken out without making the rest of the movie fall apart; in that way, the movie is efficient and yet expansive and ambitious at the same time.The movie starts as it means to go on; with a very exciting pizza delivery sequence. Yes, even pizza delivery is exciting in Spiderman 2. After that the movie is a roller coaster ride; when it's not dazzling you with adrenaline fuelled action sequences, it's pulling at your heart strings with emotionally rich exchanges. Some action films let up when they aren't giving the audience an action sequence; but this one doesn't. It's exciting all the way though. Some of the exchanges, particularly the ones between Aunt May and Peter Parker are genuinely heart felt, and because the characters are so well thought-out and appear on screen as rounded human beings; these exchanges are allowed licence to make you care for the characters. The characters in the movie are a mixed bag, with each one being made up of a number of desires and insecurities, which translate onto the screen both effectively and believably, even in spite of some of them having super powers.Technically, this movie is majestic. The action sequences are truly breathtaking and seeing Spider-Man battle Doctor Octopus around a number of different locations is an unforgettable experience. The acting is also something of note, as the movie is brought to life by a brilliant ensemble. I don't like Tobey Maguire much, but he was made for the role of Peter Parker, and he really does excel with it. The role wouldn't have been believable if it was filled by someone butch, and so Maguire makes for a believable Spider-Man. Kirsten Dunst doesn't have as much to do here as she did last time, but what she does do is just fine. The great Alfred Molina fills the role of Doctor Octopus, and like Tobey Maguire was made for the part. Simply put, he's immense in this role; he's intelligent looking enough to be believable as the scientist and nasty looking enough to be believable as the super-villain; thus capturing the essence of his character in both respects. J.K. Simmons steals the show as J.J. Jameson, the head of the newspaper in downtown Manhattan. Every scene with him is a delight and much of his dialogue is absolutely hilarious, which gives the film that all-important third dimension.As previously mentioned, Sam Raimi started life as the director of the fantastic cult hit; The Evil Dead. Despite this film being completely different and on a much bigger scale than the aforementioned; it is evident that Sam hasn't lost his roots. Obviously giving Bruce Campbell a cameo shows this (although I'd have preferred more Bruce, myself), and Sam also reminds us of The Evil Dead with several tributes including a lovely chainsaw sequence, and a workout for the 'Raimi-cam' on the train scenario. The Evil Dead was notable for, amongst other things, the fact that it was extremely well directed. Sam Raimi is an extremely underrated talent and really should be mentioned along with the directors that hog all the praise more often. His direction is extremely assured, and he manages to make everything about the film thrilling and as interesting as it possibly could be.Spider-Man 2 is a film that further disproves the theory that movies based on comic books are brainless and stands out as one of the very best films this decade, not to mention it being a member of the exclusive 'sequels better than the first' club. If you haven't already; see this movie pronto.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I saw this movie in the theater I wasn't impressed at all. I thought the romantic scenes were too much and a bit unbelievable.I still think that some romantic scenes are unbelievable. For example near the end when Peter rescues MJ from a falling wall they almost have a one hour conversation. However when I saw the movie for the 2nd time on DVD I realized that it is a true interpretation from the comic book in where Spidey and Peter struggle with all facets of life. Therefor I think this second movie is even better than the first because of the romantic struggle. I think in the end, when the third movie will be done, this second movie will really be an in betweener. Just like, for example, Back to the future II.I am going to give this one 8 out of ten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Love Story meets Matrix</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am 42 years old and just loved this movie. I think about it in terms of "Love Story meets Matrix". The movie is 70% plot, and 30% action, which is a perfect balance. After watching the DVD, I had to review the action scenes at least 5 times each. The camera work in this film is absolutely fabulous. There are plenty of 180 degree stop-action pans worthy of any jujitsu master. In the classic Spiderman comics, Spidey could overcome any super hero but his conquest of teenage women were actually his greatest challenge, and Toby McGuire drives home this point with an understated elegance and all the awkwardness of a 16-year old's demeanor.If you are a 12 year old boy looking for spider man to bust some heads, for 135 nonstop minutes, this is probably not your movie. If you are 13 and above, and if you've seen Spiderman I (and even if you haven't), you should enjoy this movie immensely.If i had to criticize something about this movie, i'd say that the villain (Doc Oct) is written (in this film) in kind of a goofy way. I think the best improvement to this movie would have been, to change the villain's character to be more believable. Alfred Molina does a great job with the material his was given, as Doc Oct, but his behavior and glib demeanor seem incongruous with an evil villain of a spiderman movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Raimi's follow up to his 2002 blockbuster Spiderman, is nothing short of 'amazing'. If you don't already know the plot, you're probably living under a rock, and wouldn't be reading this anyway. If you haven't seen the original, do yourself a favor and get acquainted with this series, it's worth it. Spiderman 2 does what very few sequels do, and that is build on the original and top it, with more story, more drama, more action, more suspense, more character, more emotion, and just more. We don't feel like we're a million miles away from the universe created in part one, yet it all feels new and fresh. I'm glad they did not do anything drastic to Spiderman's suit. There are subtle changes, but you really don't notice, yet on multiple viewings you will.I give this film a 10 out of 10, large feat for a sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Action Movie of 2004, maybe of All Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spider-Man 2 blew away Spider-Man 1 by a landslide! This movie had it all: ACTION, romance, comedy, heart, great acting, great writing, and everything good that you can think of. This movie should be nominated for an Oscar for Best Picture, because it is not your typical superhero movie, since it focused more on the characters. I agree with Roger Ebert that this is the best superhero movie ever (Superman II is now 2nd best). For people who do not like this movie, they have a right to their own opinions, but I am quite sure they like those boorrrrinnnngggg movies that no one cares about.

		<fullReview>Artistically, the first SpiderMan was a failure. It was everything wrong with big budget Hollywood flicks--horrible, soap opera acting with ignorant, mind-numbing scripts that have so many loop holes in their logic as to make any fanboy pray for an aneurism. This movie, amazingly, was far better than its predecessor.In terms of where it started, Spiderman2 is easily the best sequel of all time! I say that simply because, while Godfather 2 was excellent, so was The Godfather. Spiderman 2 is excellent, but SpiderMan was crap. The level of improvement from original to sequel is astonishing.I'm not sure I believe Raimi directed this film, though. He's never done anything to prove (IMHO)he had any talent for non-camp material, but somehow he pulled this one off. Anyhow, most fanboys were thankful for the greatest improvement of all: less Willem Dafoe.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is sure to entertain all. As a Spiderman reader since the early 60s I am thrilled to see another episode of Spiderman on the big screen. They have picked the correct villain and the right actor to ortray him. Alfred Molena is brilliant as Doc Oc. I can't wait to see the next installment. They should use the Vulture or the Sandman as the next villain. It seems by the way they left the ending that there will be two villains in the next film,the Green Goblin as taken up by his son and whoever the next villain is.That's the way they origionaly wrote the series. Stan Lee is sure to be proud of the films and the cast. They are all perfect castings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The unbearable misery of being Spider-Man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nope. This one didn't do it for me either. I found the first Spider-Man to be pretty bad, and the sequel fails to improve.Fans of Spider-Man comics are sure to get their kicks from seeing their hero swing across the screen, but for the rest of us there's only the film itself. What's lacking in both films is the sense of any real danger. There's simply no antagonist for Spidey to fight. The first film had the Green Goblin who basically was blowing up business partners (naughty of course, but hardly very exciting), and in the second film there's Doc Ock ("possessed" by his robotic arms - how stupid is that by the way?) who's demonic plan consist of... finishing his failed experiment (which could blow up half of New York, but that's not why he does it). I'm not saying that you need some Bond criminal who wants to take over the world, but someone a bit more menacing would have been nice.Since Doc Ock stays in his laboratory for most of the film, Spider-Man has to spend his time doing something else. Namely fighting his inner feelings whether or not to continue being Spider-Man. To illustrate this conflict, we get 90 minutes of Peter Parker/Spider-Man going through hell. He's broke, he hasn't got a girlfriend, Mary Jane is marrying some astronaut, his aunt is poor and has to move, his best friend slaps him, he falls off building, falls in the street, gets pushed around etc. This isn't fun for him, and it's not much fun to watch either. There are times and places for existential drama, but I'm not sure this movie is one of them. Realising this, Raimi lets loose a final 30 minutes of action scenes making everything that happened before seem completely redundant.Overall, the script leaves a lot to be desired. It's mostly filled with silly teenage angst, but there are also some pretty gaping plot holes and stupid dialogue. Nothing is implied or subtle, everything is clearly pointed out and explained (except those plot holes of course). Every scene with aunt May made me cringe, and they've copied the vomit inducing scene on the bridge from the first film, only placed it on board a train and made it about ten times worse.I can't complain about the actors, they do what they can with what they're given. Generally though, these characters leaves me pretty cold. I simply don't care about whiny Parker and his girl trouble.The effects are better this time around, especially Doc Ock's mechanical arms, but at times it still feels very much like cartoons. The action scenes are nothing new or special (a CGI character fighting another CGI character in a CGI environment has been to death by now - how about some real people for once?). Also, I don't get Spider-Man's powers. He can get cut with a knife and bleed, but he can fall of tall buildings without getting a scratch on him? On the whole Spider-Man 2 is equal to its predecessor. A bit better looking, but exceedingly long and tedious. And more than once you get the feeling that it only functions as an introduction to the inevitable Spider-Man 3... [3/10]</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blockbuster of the year?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Going into Spider-man 2 I was somewhat dubious about the hype surrounding it. I was a tad unimpressed by the first film, it never surpassed X-Men IMO, at times it felt a bit artificial and the time elapsing device seemed to miss out a lot of key events and just assumed we'd guess what happened since they left college. The action was pretty special at points, but somewhat marred by the CGI, which I was never convinced by.Spidey Mk 2, welds the story far more convincingly together, managing to deal with all the various plot strands, character development and adding some very humorous moments (I'm still guffawing at the lift scene, the busker was a most amusing bit of in jokery, and Bruce Campbell would get an Oscar if there was one for hilarious cameos), all the whilst delivering awesome action. The attack on the bank and the train sequence are big screen action to the max. I was literally gasping at points there. Best of all is probably the operating theatre, as Doc Ock's tentacles kick in to life, with devastating effect.Sam Raimi's roving camera adds to the experience, the camera zooming in to detail the key action.There are some smartly directed little moments to, like Peter running across the rooftops trying to recover his powers (a wonderful flipside to his "discovery" in the first film) which are filmed with real pizazz. There were a few other moments where the camera pans round in such a way as to be in itself exciting. Kudos to Bill Pope for helping bring the cinematography to such an exciting level. I'll need to see it again just to remember all my favourite bits.I guess the sheer scale and scope of the movie will diminish on the small screen. What makes both movies so great is the way you are sucked into this take on New York, the world of Spidey. Something all great movies do and it's best represented on a mega mutha of a screen.This is one of the best blockbusters in recent years, up there with Mr Jackson's masterpiece. It delivers everything a film should laughs, emotion and excitement, a genuine hero. There are some thought provoking messages too, the idea that in everyone there's a hero, it's inspirational stuff. I think people will still be warming to Spider-Man 2 for years to come. Nine out of ten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Comic Book Movie. Ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not that Spider Man 2 has much competition for the above title, but rest assured that it will remain at the top of that list for a very, very long time. The film certainly does not represent Raimi's or Maguire's (or Dunst's even) finest moments, but they put together such a terrific package that it's impossible to dislike.Spider Man 2 represents a great amalgamation of special effects, story, character, and feeling. It is everything the first Spider Man was not, namely exciting, thought-provoking, and moving.Spider Man was a noticeably weak film, as most origin stories are, with an unbelievably weak villain (it's hard to believe that Willem Defoe as the Green Goblin could be so...dull). The movie was nicely diverting for the two hours you spend at the theaters but, when you left, you left without any residual effects. Spider Man left your mind as soon as you got outside the multiplex.Spider Man 2 is different. Aside from its lackluster name (why wasn't its AKA Amazing Spider Man used?), there's nothing wrong with the film. The effects are fantastic and, unlike in the original, do not draw attention to themselves. The performances in Spider Man were adequate and here the central roles are solid. Maguire and Dunst do not "act better" necessarily, but they are required to show more depth and intricacy than in the original film. Alvin Sargent is a very capable screenwriter and brings to this screenplay a craftmanship missing from David Koepp's. Sargent has more experience writing emotional nuance; for Spider Man's character, emotional nuance is key. Capturing Peter Parker's torture and ambivalence is no easy task; it requires a deft pen and Sargent came through. I'm also sure Michael Chabon's involvement did not hurt.What also separates Spider Man 2 from its predecessor is its humor. Spider Man lacked Raimi's typical gallows humor; the sequel, though certainly dark in tone, has moments of great slapstick humor. Raimi seems more in control of this picture, more assured in his ability to create a big-budget extravaganza.This confidence, I think, made the movie better. Raimi, more willing to take chances, swung for the fences and made it.Spider Man 2 is the best summer, popcorn movie I've seen since AI. It's also one of the few times a movie deserves its immense success. Though you should have seen this on the big screen (twice), I hope it will translate well to TV where everyone can enjoy it over and over.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I liked the first one, but this one's better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First "X-Men," then "The Lord of the Rings" trilogy, and now this. It seems we are seeing the dawn of a new trend amongst Hollywood blockbusters: that sequels should be more substantive and emotionally resonant than the original movie. While the first "Spider-Man" was worthwhile merely for being fun popcorn action-movie escapism, the sequel deals with weighty moral issues and closely examines inter-personal relationships without either dumbing things down (think "Superman II") or dampening the super-hero excitement (think "The Hulk").The first movie was all about Spider-Man and his powers. This movie concentrates more on Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire). His moral code may just be ruining his life, not only in terms of his relationships--he cannot tell Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) that he loves her, and his friendship with Harry (James Franco) is strained--but his grades are slipping and he can't hold down a steady job. And it's all because he feels that Spider-Man has a responsibility to combat evil.I won't take up too much space with Doctor Octopus (Alfred Molina), because even though most of the action is centered around him, he's really beside the point. I will just say that although Molina is a gifted actor, he has not quite mastered an American accent. And the convoluted new back-story for Doc Ock regarding nuclear fusion and artificial intelligence is probably the weakest part of the movie. One misses the simplicity--however childish or dated--of the original comic, where a nuclear explosion gives Ock telepathic control of the mechanical arms.Sam Raimi's action sequences are as impressive as ever. But unlike the first "Spider-Man", they are not the real core of the movie. Instead, it is small, quiet scenes that stick in your mind. My favorite part of the entire 127 minutes is the part where Peter tells Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) exactly how Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson) died. All the shots are static, the set is no different than it would be for a small, independent drama, and the only effects we see are the actors' thespian skills. Raimi fans will know he has also used similar techniques to wonderful effect in "A Simple Plan" and "The Gift".I don't want to spoil the end for anyone, except to say that it does a superb job of setting up "Spider-Man 3" by taking the Peter-Mary Jane relationship to a different level, and with a creepily effective surprise cameo.All in all, this is hands-down, the single greatest super-hero movie of all time, and this is coming from someone who thrilled to Christopher Reeve as a little kid and Michael Keaton as a teenager. Although there will probably be no Oscar consideration beyond some technical awards, this movie strongly deserves 9 out of 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has got to be the best movie I've seen in a very long time. You wouldn't normally expect much from an action movie and a sequel, but this film is incredible. Not only does it deliver intense action sequences and amazing special effects, but it has depth in both its plot and characters.I've never seen such an all-around great movie. It's exciting and intense, but gives the audience a chance to actually care about the outcome, and doesn't constantly bombard them with cheap thrills.It has romance as the comics require between Peter Parker and Mary Jane, but it doesn't let things get bogged down with mush. Instead it goes for a realistic depiction of romance, and remembers that it is only a sub-plot.It has humor, and some of the jokes are done better than most comedy films. But it has perfect timing for each, not ruining the drama but complementing it by making it more human. And almost above all it's got drama. Sam Raimi completely outdoes himself and captures the appeal of Spiderman perfectly. Spiderman is revealed as a human being, mortal, vulnerable, and having his own wants and needs that conflict with crime-fighting. Woven into this is a concept of what it really means to be a hero in real life, and the personal sacrifice involved.This is a one-of-a-kind film that has redefined the genre, and has captured something unique and amazing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spider-Man 2 isn't just a great superhero movie; it is a great film in its own right.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spider-Man 2, never in my years as a film-viewer have I seen such a great superhero movie. Spider-Man 2 isn't just a great superhero movie; it is a great film in its own right. The film is the definition of what can happen when you expand on a story correctly, not just the action and special effects.In the year 2002 Spider-Man opened to high critical acclaim and an even higher gross profit. Nobody then would have even dreamt that Spider-Man 2 (or The Amazing Spider-Man which was its working title) was going to be better in many levels. First of all is the human story behind the superhero one; the story of Peter Parker, a down-on-his-luck photographer who works part time as a pizza delivery man (SPOILER-not for much longer however) and still have to study for his high-powered science course. But that's not it; he is also Spider-Man, a super-powered vigilante who listens for police sirens so he can take out bad guys and save the good people of New York City (with spectacular results). But the bigger problems lay on top of Peter Parker, the man behind the mask. He has an obsessive best friend, Harry Osborne, son of Norman Osborn, AKA The Green Goblin. Spider-Man killed Norman Osborne and Harry is after Spider-Man, so you could see the problems that face Peter. Not only that but Peter has a longing for Mary Jane Watson, the girl of his dreams, who decides that she could not wait any longer for Peter to show his love for her so she finds another man in her life, J. Jonah Jameson's son, John Jameson. So with his best friend after him and the girl he loves slipping away, not to mention his Aunts financial troubles, things get worst and worst for out hero in distress. His distress cause him to lose his power, I think he loses it because he has no motivation to become Spider-Man.The newest and one of the most interesting inclusions of Spider-Man 2, is the villain Doctor Otto Octavius (or Dock Ock as The Daily Bugle calls him). Otto Octavius is a good-natured and good-humoured scientist with good intentions, but his obsession with his 'Life's work' push him to insanity after a horrible accident involving fusion destroy his lab and kill his wife, Rosalie. After his metal arms fused into his spine destroy a device disallowing him to be controlled by the 'Monstrous things', he is alas at their control, robbing banks, kidnapping aunt may. This leads Peter Parker to quit Spider-Man and say good-bye to his costume (which is shown fantastically by Sam Raimi who The greatest thing about Dock Ock is the man who plays him (the great Alfred Molina). The character is played by such ease and OTT in a not-so-hammy sort of way. This brings me to the rest of the cast. Tobey Maguire is in great form to play Peter Parker, I said it before and I'll say it again, that guy is perfect for the role, every one of his expressions tells a different story. Mary Jane is played well by Kirsten Dunst, James Franco also giving a good performance as the nearly maniacal Harry Osborne. The comical relief is given (by great timing comical) from J.K. Simmons.Peter Parkers hero-hiatus gives him a great opportunity to be a different person, girls are interested in him, and even Mary Jane sees the difference. He learns how to ignore police sirens and leaves it to the cops of New York to sort out the bad-guys. He is also doing better on his science course thanks to much free time. All this however changes when the menacing and deranged Dock Ock kidnaps MJ. This inspires Peter to don the costume and save the one he loves. Aided by his powers, which he regains thanks to some motivation. This leads to the greatest action scene ever to be filmed. The exciting train sequence. Every shot is a gem, as the movement between Spidey and Dock Ock get even more rampant. SPOILER- Watching Spider-Man catch innocent passenger with his web as they are hurled up into the air by Octavius gave me chills. I especially liked the part when Spider-Man is trying to stop a train from going through a dead-end and crushing those underneath. He webs up the buildings on the side to slow down the train, Peter Parkers face really made me believe that he had a hard time. SPOILER- after he saves the people from certain death, Spider-Man is held up by then because he is exhausted, this also gave me chills.The train sequence leads to one of the greatest climaxes I have ever seen, 'sometimes, to do the right thing, you have to give up your own dreams', this showed how both Peter Parker and Spider-Man could work together.All in all, Spider-Man 2 is an amazing movie that I would describe in one simple word: AMAZING. The work Sam Raimi on this film really goes without saying; it is also amazing how he came from directing the classic Evil Dead films to directing the best Superhero series ever. He really is a great man, but very underrated. I urge you to see this marvel of a movie; you will be missing a lot if you don't. 10/10Halim BoudjeltiaEveryone's a Critic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Spider-Man 2" improves upon nearly every inconsistency, flippancy, and futility which might have compromised its predecessor, in ascending to a sensational entertainment far, far better than any other film this year. This is smart, conventional, touching, and edge-of-your seat entertainment, where we find ourselves constantly gripped by the story, the relationships, and most especially, the action sequences. The characters are believable: Peter Parker's struggle to balance his supreme duties as a superhero with his personal duties as a student and worker and his desired relationship with Mary Jane Watson can be entirely understood by anyone who consistently feels overburdened and unwieldy. This "side-story to the action" provides us with a compelling reason to root for Parker in his quests to "save the day" and recover from his own problems. I became so engaged with nearly every character, including the "villain", Otto Octavius, because the story provided me a reason for involvement, in nearly everything these characters experience. I was compelled by every action sequence, from Spider-Man's signature web-slinging adventures, to the "experiment-gone horribly wrong", to the breathtaking, adrenaline-rushing showdown between Spidey and Doc Ock. This is probably the best single "blockbuster" I have ever experienced, practically free of any significant flaws. Funny, touching, compelling, and exhilarating... And I had merely expected to be entertained by the action! Can't wait for Spider-Man 3! **** out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deeper film than just action</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warning: Spoilers ahead!I honestly think this is one of the best movies made. Included in that is a single important scene, which the whole movie boils down to: The subway scene.Starting from the beginning, Peter is torn on how he wants his life to turn out. And who can blame him? He is only 20 years old! He's brilliant, yet as Spider-man has no time to pursue academics. He's deeply in love with MJ, yet as Spider-man he feels the need to protect her. It was his fault Uncle Ben died, and the guilt is crushing him. It's also his fault his best friend, Harry, has no father. Yet, as Spider-man, he cannot reveal to Harry that his father was indeed the Green Goblin.As the movie progresses, you can see the turmoil Peter goes through. If you ever need an example of inner conflict, this movie is great for that!All this conflict exhausts Peter, at which point, he just gives up being Spider-man. He just can't handle the pressure anymore. By doing that, and then seeing the consequences, Peter is ready to make an educated and fair choice: To be Spider-man and a hero, or to be himself?He does not know the city of New York is behind him, and that is the downfall. Without support, he is stuck. That is why the subway scene is so important. He uses ever bit of energy he can surrender, ever bit of himself without killing himself. This is why he collapses as the train stops. The conductor and passengers reaching out to catch him is the most important event in the film. By doing this act of kindness and appreciation, the people on the train are swearing allegiance Spider-man's side. Peter's identity is revealed to them, but as a the boy says "We won't tell no one", Peter knows that he can do it. He can be Spider-man.Although raved as a summer action flick, I hope that people can see deeper than that. This movie is about finding what you were meant to do -- and the consequences of your actions.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is how sequels should be. Sam Raimi has remembered the most important thing that made the first film great, the story. The action almost blends into the background as you get caught up in the turmoil that Peter Parker is experiencing. You find yourself (or at least I did) routing for him as a person and cheering as he defeats his own inner enemies. His (non)romance with Mary-Jane in this film is heartbreaking but ultimately leads to an amazing climax that had me jumping up and down in my seat.The special effects were a treat as well. They have ironed out the cartoon look to Spider-man himself with his web spinning acrobatics looking less comical this time around. Doctor Octopus looked fantastic (if the reason behind his arms was pretty lame).This is the best superhero film yet but I feel that Sam Raimi still has more to give.

		<fullReview>The story: Very good and clever. Keeps a very good sense of continuity within the comic book and uses a few juicy story lines from the book as well. At first, rumors had it that Peter Parker simply loses his powers, but the writers made something very interesting out of that twist rather than him simply "losing" his powers. I won't say anything more than that on that subject. Peter has relationship problems with M.J. and Harry as he is being tortured through the life of being Peter Parker and Spider-Man. On the side, he battles Doctor Octopus, personally I thought he was a fantastic villain and amazingly menacing.Spider-Man 2 is without a doubt the greatest superhero film of all-time. It captures a very unique style of action that makes it memorable from beginning to end. The acting was pretty good. James Franco did an amazing job as he had the most dramatic scenes and Molina is one heck of a villain in the movie. This movie has fairly an even blend of love story and action movie, it will leave you wanting more. Sam Raimi pulls it off perfectly.9.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"A powerful, moving, brilliant cinematic masterpiece. Sam Raimi is one of the greats."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What more could you expect in a movie, really?Spider-Man 2 tells the continuing legacy of Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire), shy, brooding young adult who wants to only be loved and take care of those HE loves.But when a genetically-enhanced spider injects its DNA-altering venom into his bloodstream, Peter must not only tackle a job, school, his love-life, his friends, and the well-being of his beloved Aunt May (Rosemary Harris), but he must also come to terms with the guilt of inadvertently causing his Uncle Ben's (Cliff Robertson) death, and protect the world as the legendary hero: Spider-Man.In this continuation, Peter is overworked, underpayed, and lives a lonely, heartbroken existence. Knowing as Spider-Man he will always have enemies, he regretfully turns down the confession of utter passion delivered to him by the only girl he's ever loved (Mary Jane Watson -Kirsten Dunst-) in a self-sacrificial attempt to keep her from harm's way.Harry Osborn (James Franco), his best friend, hates Spider-Man, under the assumption that he is his father's (Norman Osborn -The Green Goblin-; Willem Dafoe) murderer. But little does he know, that his best friend and his enemy are one in the same.As he tries to reestablish some connection with MJ, loses one of his two meager jobs, and learns of his Aunt May's financial troubles, Peter becomes distracted, unfocused, and his powers begin to wither away.And the timing couldn't be worse. After a noble, but foolhardy science expirement gone horribly wrong, Oscorp. engineer and employee of Harry Osborn, Doctor Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina) is cursed with having for artificially-intelligent robotic arms grafted to his skin. Now controlling the good doctor, the arms command the aptly-named Doctor Octopus, or, "Doc Ock" to steal money to rebuild his expirement, which may accidentally cause the death of every person in New York City!With his best friend against him, the only woman he loves ripping at his heart, and a man he not only knows, but respects admirably, looking to kill him, Peter Parker must don the costume of Spider-Man once again to carry out the promise he made on his uncle's grave.This movie is absolutely beautiful. Not only is the CGI and fight choreograophy fantastic, but the emotional centerpiece of the film is what really shines through. The almost-Shakespearean drama revolving around each and every character is mesmerizing, and each actor in their own way gives a stellar performance.Not to mention, this is the most faithful comic-to-movie adaptation ever made. If you're a longtime fan (like me), then you really know just how much of Stan Lee, Steve Ditko, and John Romita's work is up there.It'll pull you to the edge of your seat, it'll move you to tears, it is the genesis that is Spider-Man."With great power, comes great responsibility. Remember that, Pete."All too true. 10/10, merely because I can't go higher than ten. Kudos to the entire cast and crew, especially Sam Raimi, who I can even now see going down as one of the greatest, most visionary directors ever to live.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow, what a perfect performance! I wonder if there is any way youcan not like this movie. You can maybe not like the story, becauseyou find it ridiculous, but everybody will have to admit that thismovie is entertaining. It's funny, it's exciting, it's original ? I thinkit's even better that the first part, which was already an excellentmovie. The best thing about "Spiderman" is that you can just lay back andenjoy it. The story is easy to understand, you'll be perfectlyentertained. The characters are interesting and the actors arecredible and well chosen by the casting staff (except Mary Jane'sboyfriend, he's very boring, but perhaps he's supposed to be). Iespecially liked the contrast between the friends Peter Parker andHarry Osbourne, who are in the same age, but so different: Peter,the shy student, and Harry, the professional businessman. AndPeter's boss at the newspaper is absolutely wonderful, althoughhe is one of the negative characters. The "bad guy" Doc Octopuswas also shown from his humane side, which I liked very much,and these tentacles that had taken control over him were reallyscary, they reminded me of snakes and seemed to be alive. Full rating for this movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Does whatever a spider can and then some!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Peter Parker returns again on this excellent sequel to last year's Spider-Man. The characters are more defined, the story more complicated, and the action even more satisfying. One may say of the previous movie that it was more a character-driven film than an action movie and this one equally follows suit, thankfully. For those who are familiar with the comic (I myself am a fan) will notice that much of Peter's life is filled with angst and you get see a substantial portion of that here as he juggles his social life and his superhero life. Tobey Maguire adds more depth to his acting muscles as he alternates from poignantly sad scenes to hilarious mishaps. Kirsten Dunst has a more well-defined and well-written role here as Peter's long-suffering love interest. J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson is nearly flawless and has some of the best lines ever. As for the action scenes... I've seen this movie twice now, the second time recently on IMAX. The action scenes are still pretty spectacular (it was even more apparent seeing it in an even bigger screen) and doesn't spend too much time on already-noticeable details for "maximum effect." In fact, some parts zoom by so quickly it can be tough just trying to keep up with the furious action. Sam Raimi knows how to frame it just right so the swinging among the buildings by Spider-Man looks breathtaking. What is really cool about a movie such as this is that it doesn't rely on the tried-and-true easy way of entertainment (eg. action). Every action set piece in this film feels well-earned as it is placed on a foundation of strong characterization and story. 10/10. One of the rare great sequels that outshine the original, right up there among the greats as "Toy Story 2" and "Empire Strikes Back."</fullReview>

I think they did a good job with the special effects, for being a bit of someones fantasy it is not overdone in a way that you can not think of it as a small piece of reality. The story line is cool, and some in some of the scenes the special effects are breathtaking!Basically, if the movie was a hotel it would be a five star one!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It surprises that movies like Spider-Man 2 often gets such glowing reviews from the critics but movies like Bad Boys II gets critically blasted by everyone. This has to be one of the worse movies that has been released theatrically this year. Even though I seen this movie a month ago, I felt like it was time to re-comment on this film. The main reason for this film's disappointment is because the tired old formula that is being used in superhero movies and action movies these days, which happens to be love. I'm so tired of producers wanting to throw love in every action movie that comes out. Don't they know that love messes up the whole movie!!!!!!! Geez, I understand if this movie or any other movies in this genre or any action movies period have love in it but it was too sappy from the beginning. Even some of the dialogue was cheesy. Peter Parker saying corny stuff like "Punch me, I bleed!" What kind of young person our age says stuff like that? This movie had more love then a Jenna Jameson film! This was another potentially good action film that was ruined by the theme of love. Like I said it still amazes me how movies like these get critcal praise but if Jean Claude Van Damme releases a movie it have to be deemed as "the worse movie of all time or "the worse movie of his career." It surprises me that many people said that this movie was really good because this is a sequel to one of the biggest movies of all time and many individuals agree that sequels aren't better then the original(at least that's not my opinion). I mean when you go into a theater expecting an action movie, you'll get this movie-a two hour love triangle about a superhero who doesn't know whether if he should continue being spider-man or fall in love with that no good Mary Jane. I assure you this, If I would've liked this movie, no one else would've liked it. Skip this one when it comes out on t.v. and DVD.</fullReview>

The action is superb and all the actors give great character performances, which make the film so entertaining you recommend it to everyone you know.Sadly Hollywood is still not realising it's highest grossing films, X-men, LotR, Matrix, Harry Potter, Spider-man are not just action set pieces but have believable characters, perfect casting and a story created by those who care about story, not just interested in linking one big blast with the next stylish MTV visual effect.

		<shortDescription>Too much hokey soap opera--too little amazing Spidey action</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spider-man was my favorite comics character. I did not care for the first movie--which missed many opportunities by not staying more faithful to the spirit of the comics from the early 60s, instead trying to meld with the post-Mary Jane marriage era comics from the late 80s--and adding a soap opera 'forever love" aspect that was far hokier than anything I had ever read in the comics. Unfortunately, Spider-man 2 continues to display the same problems.Maguire and Dunst are still ill-suited for their roles. It was more obvious this time around. Parker should not be so whiney--and Spider-man should be more witty--taunting villains at every turn. Where's the fun? Yes, Parker has a bad personal life--but that should at least have been balanced by the joy he has being Spider-man, swinging through the city and catching bad guys. All this is still absent in chapter 2. Maybe if Maguire had better dialogue to work with--but I am not so sure. He has this buggy eyed look that makes it difficult to buy into his plight. I fear its a charisma issue--and he--but especially Dunst, don't have it--especially for this type of story.Perhaps the filmmakers were concerned that they needed to make the film appeal to every demographic--every generation of spider-fan, but focusing so much on Mary Jane--her career, her love life, was, I thought, a great misuse of time. Perhaps they should have called the movie Mary-Jane. And for the middle section of the movie he wasn't Spider-man at all--and when he dons the costume again--he keeps taking his mask off(this was a particularly bad decision during the train sequence). Mild spoiler***The idea of him having second thoughts about being Spider-man wasn't bad--I could even tolerate the "Raindrops" song though I had to keep from thinking I was watching a 1970s coming of age movie--but it was sloppily handled. A similar thing occurred in the early comics--where Parker, out of illness, frustration and worry loses his powers--but when he comes back--the excitment and energy is palpable. In a movie--it should have been even more so. Alas no.**end of spoilerMolina's Doc Ock. Never a favorite Spider-man villain for me. I imagined a European-accented voice, menacing and stern. The scene where he advises Parker to use poetry to woo...Mary Jane--really dulled the edge. The whole energy weapon subplot was lost amid the soap opera, and rather boring to begin with. X-men 2 was a far better sequel and blending of drama and action within a comic book framework.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best comic book adaptation ever. The second best film of 2004.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are too many reviews for this film so I figured I'd do something different...Sacrifice, Destiny, Choice. It's all there. Spider-Man 2 was the best movie of the year from June 30 to August 6. Then after August 6, something so extraordinary came along and made this film the second...I loved this movie. Probably one of the best sequels I've ever seen. Probably the best comic book movie I've ever seen. Probably the best movie of the summer right, right, right? Well when I saw this film on July the 3rd, I was astounded by how great this movie was. Way better than the first. Well come August 6, I went to see a movie that I'd had been waiting for about 5 months. The movie that beat Spider-Man 2 for Summer Tops... Collateral. But I'm not here to talk about Collateral, I'm hear to talk about how Spidey came in second to Vincent the contract killer, Cruise's character.Spider-Man 2 was a great film like I said, however having said it's a movie with comic book status and the fact that it's not the last film of it's series, it's not one of those phenomenal films at the Oscars. However, Collateral is.Spider-Man 2 had great acting, great direction, great action sequences, great drama. Collateral doubled on that and than added thrills. Tom Cruise proves he can take summer tops. He was absolutely spectacular as Vincent, can that be said about Maguire? No. Don't get me wrong, Tobey is a swell actor, however half the time he's in a suit or Spidey is shown in CGI. Got you there, comic book nerds.Spider-Man 2 was an amazing sequel and will probably get an even better 2nd sequel for Spidey 3. Collateral doesn't need that. It's not a money-maker compared to Spidey however, it doesn't need a sequel, a prequel, a spin-off or whatever. The film stands alone great.I could go on forever with my comparisons showing Spidey is 2nd to Collateral but if you've seen both movies, you'll know what I'm talking about. I say, wait until the end of the Spidey franchise before handing it Oscars and awards. However, this year, Collateral's a great Oscar pick. See it and I hope you understand the comparisons I gave now.Having said all of this, I can't possibly wade out those 3 years we have to wait for Spidey 3.My Ratings:Spider-Man 2- 10/10Collateral- 10/10Eliason A.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Get this guy some Prozac!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THERE MAY BE SPOILERS IN HERE!!!! I must confess to an irrational affection for Toby McGuire at the outset, because that's the only way I can really explain actually enjoying this movie at all. What started out with some promise, quickly declined into a exploration of Peter Parker's relentless depression and his depressing life as a poorly paid freelance photographer and sometime university student. By the film's midpoint, I wanted to shout out "Get some therapy Peter!" -- or at least some good medication. I mean, this guy is so depressed the webs stop shooting out of his palms, his super strength begins to fade, his resolve to be a good guy shrivels until all we're left with is, well, Peter Parker. His Spiderman alter-ego has lost what ever ego it had and Parker slinks around, whining about his lot in life, irresolute and faced with irreconcilable differences with his lady love, Mary Jane Elliott. Meanwhile, he's ignoring the evil mechanical octopus -- Doc Ock -- who wants, for no explained reason, to blow up the city. In his spare time, Peter's irrationally confessing that he's responsible for his uncle's murder and trying in vain to hang onto a fading friendship with his vain best friend. (Also irrational and unexplained: Peter Parker pays rent on a New York City apartment while his aunt is having her house foreclosed on. You mean this guy couldn't move home and give old auntie the rent money for all those years of good meals and motherly advice?) All this doesn't make a whole lot of sense, but it is increasingly sad and depressing. The action picks up toward the end when Peter manages to talk the silly octopus into self destructing and becomes resolute once more in his determination to save the world and deny himself the pleasures of his despairing life. Of course, Mary Jane is on hand to cheer him on with probably the silliest walk off line in movie history to date: "Go get 'em tiger." How much did they have to pay Kirsten Dunst to utter that lame line? I'm sure it's much more than you'll save by being one of the 9 people in America who hasn't paid to see this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too little</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All superheroes are tortured souls, torn between their yearning to fully join the human race and their overarching commitment to duty (kind of like the British Royal Family). Superman, Batman, the Hulk-all of them modern Shakesperean tragic heroes. Spidey's no different. You know, though, I didn't care too much for this movie, and I'll tell you why-at least half the reason you go to these flicks is to examine the villian. Most of the time, they're much more interesting (although not much different) than the hero. Driven by personal pain (see: Penguin, Joker, Darth Vader), they become an image what our hero could have become. Here, we actually have very little insight into the character of the villian, Doc Ock-who is actually being controlled by some mechanical arms. Yes, he lost his wife in the melee, but there's no character development, no real personalization of the war between he and Spiderman. It's just flat. And I don't really care about the relationship between Spiderman and MJ-part of the superhero's appeal is that he's always on the outside looking in, and there's usually a beautiful woman, i.e., Lois Lane, who symbolizes that. I'm more interested in the relationship between Spidey and Harry, or Spidey and the world. Go back to the roots of superhero lore and the next installment should be much more entertaining.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Once Spidey takes a hiatus, the crime in NY shoots up 75%? What good are the cops if they need Spidey to do 75% of the work? What was the crime rate before Peter Parker got bitten by that mutant spider?And what is the deal with Peter Parker's "promise" to Norman Osborn (a promise he never actually made) not to tell Harry that he was the Goblin? This "promise" compromises Peter's ability to clear Harry's misconception that Spider-Man killed his father. But why can't Peter simply tell Harry that the Goblin killed his father? It wouldn't be anything but the truth, would it?Lastly, why the heck don't Doc Ock's tentacles feel the pull of that energy nexus thingie?But, seriously, I don't want to pick this movie apart too much. In fact, part of the appeal of the movie is the fact that these sort of outrageous situations are depicted almost believably on the screen. Of course Spider-Man needs to be important to the crime-fighting effort. Otherwise there'd be no real reason for him to exist. And Harry Osborn needs a reason to hate Spider-Man; otherwise he'd never end up as the next Green Goblin (oops! Hope I didn't spoil anything.) And Doc Ock would look pretty silly if he didn't "magnet-proof" his tentacles (this may have been explained during the movie; could be my attention lapsed at the moment)The movie is basically a comic book, faithfully and believably adapted to screen and that, apart from the human interest story, is its main strength.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A disappointing follow-up. [CONTAINS SPOILERS!]</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Did anybody else find as many holes in this movie as I did? I was skeptical to say the least about the first Spider-Man film, but eventually I saw it anyway and was very surprised. The film had a strong plot, well-rounded and human characters, and unlike many comic book adapted films, it took itself with a grain of salt. I cannot say the same about the sequel, the highly applauded "Spider-Man 2."The movie starts out with promise picking up where the first one left off. Peter Parker is a very busy college student trying to juggle his school work, commitments to family and friends, and his duties as Spider-Man. The film tries very hard to convey his internal struggles, in fact, it tries way too hard. The first 45 minutes deals with nothing but that. So many things happen that eventually it becomes repetitive and pushes itself to the point of insulting the audience. Then, finally, we get to the introduction of the villain, Doctor Octavius who eventually becomes Doctor Octopus (Ock.) Of course, just like the first one, he becomes Doctor Ock by way of mechanical mishap from an invention of his. And after that, we only see Ock periodically. He isn't really much of a villain. His whole plan involves getting money to repair and improve his invention. He wouldn't be a villain if people didn't get in his way. He doesn't want to hurt anyone which makes him rather dull. Then he and Spider-Man have a couple of typical encounters involving millions of dollars of damage to the city. During a latter encounter, Spider-Man loses his mask on an elevated train car so that everyone in the car can see his face. Then a kid hands him his mask back and says "Don't worry, we won't tell anyone." Now come on. Are you telling me that in New York City, ten million people, there is not one person in that train car without a camera taking his picture and/or finding some way to make a buck off of what they had just seen? That is very, very thin and bothers me beyond words. Then, at the end of the film, Mary Jane finds out who he is and they decide to stay together. So what does that mean for the third one? They're going to be Ozzy and Harriet? Ward and June Cleaver? That really bothers me, too. Now, Harry Osbourne, Peter Parker's former best friend, finds out Spider-Man's real identity and stumbles upon all of his dad's Green Goblin stuff in a secret room which implies that he will become Green Goblin in the third one. I like how Harry discovers Parker's secret identity, but I really think that he should become a different Spider-Man villain. Carnage or Venom perhaps? I just think that it's kind of lame to have the Green Goblin come back. Just like in "Return of the Jedi" when George Lucas began to run out of ideas and brought back the Death Star.I think most of these holes with the film could have just been edited out. The movies was just over two hours but seemed like a whole lot more. I would have been perfectly happy with a solid hour and a half Spider-Man sequel, but that wasn't the case. A better screenwriter would have helped, too. They should have gotten David Keopp (writer of the first one) to write this one. The story was good, but a better writer was much need. So please, stop kidding yourself and just admit that the movies wasn't that great. Pretty please?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had a hard time with this movie. I will concede that the action was pretty good, but overall I found the plot weak and not terribly compelling. Most movies don't bother me, but I had a hard time suspending my disbelief on this one which prevented me from really getting into it. So Dr. Oc has come up with an ingenious fusion device. Ok, no sweat. What I found hard to buy was that for the sheer convenience of his work he just sat down and came up with a set of 4 nearly indestructible metal arms that he wired into his spine, which, by the way, were equipped with super intelligence capable of taking over his brain. This makes absolutely no sense. First of all, the development of such a thing would be equal to that of any fusion device. Secondly, there is absolutely no reason such a device would have to be equipped with super AI. And finally, when he is using it at first it really does not look like he really needs to have these extra intelligent arms. It would have been nice had they done a little more work to introduce the evil arms in a more plausible manner.The other thing that got me was that Dr. Oc was perfectly willing to do Harry's bidding and bring him spiderman to get some tritium. Ok, come on. You are an evil villian with 4 powerful indestructable arms capable of crushing someone's skull and you are on a crazy rampage to rebuild your fusion reactor with no desire to stop and consider anything else. Would you: A) agree to hunt down spiderman and bring him back to get your tritium or B) start pulling off his fingers one by one until he hands it over. Hmmmmm. This part of the plot (which was quite a major part) made no sense to me at all. The Dr. doesn't care about spiderman, he cares about his fusion, why would he waste time chasing spiderman around?Finally, the science here was a bit sketchy. Tritium, of which it was critical to have for use in the fusion reactor (this part is true), is supposedly very rare and only 25 lbs of it exist on earth. Ok... Tritium is not rare and occurs natrually or can be produced in a nuclear reactor. Do you have a glow in the dark watch? Hey, that probably has tritium in it. See any exit signs that glow? Those have tritium in them too. I know, it's just a movie, but still... They could have at least made up something he needed to make it a bit more believable.Finally, the acting in this movie was a bit sub par. James Franco as Harry is not the least bit believable, come on who buys him as a powerful intelligent leader of a major research company? The Dr. himself seemed a bit over the top. Toby did ok, however some of the dialogue he was fed was dripping with cheese and there is only so much you can do with that. Overall, it was ok if you can easily suspend your belief. Personally I would have rather waited until it came out on video and saved some money.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(slight spoilers) Spiderman 2 ***This movie was a TOTAL letdown. Man, this film got so hyped up to be the 'movie of the decade'. Pfh!I wouldn't even class it as movie of the week!The opening credits were quite impressive, with drawings and photos from spiderman interweaved with pictures from the actual comics- then going straight into a very funny scene involving pizza delivery. I thought "this movie is gonna be great". How I was wrong!It was sssslllllllooooooowwwww. Parts of it were like watching paint dry. The whole film moved at the pace of a snail, with no point whatsoever. Even the special effects didn't seem so 'special' anymore. The film really picked up about half an hour from the end, with one tense moment, and a very nice suprise to see Willem Dafoe back on the scene!So what were the good points of this film. Why did it even deserve 3 stars from me? Well, it knew how to build tension in places, and as usual the characters were played in style, showing true human emotion sometimes, and there were also some comical moments, spiderman in the lift with the dog walker ("nice spidey suit"), or the time when Spiderman washes his suit and turns his whites red and blue! So the film wasn't all bad.Dr Ock (Alfred Molina- Identity/Chocolat) was played with the most skill and style and made the audience really sympathise with him. In a way this was a bit of a downside because there was really no baddy to hate in this movie.Overall, entertaining, but too over hyped, so therefore a let down.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to admit, I'm not a huge comics fan. But I really liked the first Spider-Man movie. This one was just so boring! There were hardly any good action scenes, most of the movie was people standing around talking about the same things over and over. The back and forth "I love you, no I don't, yes I do." between Peter and Mary Jane is so excruciatingly boring after the first scene with them that I wanted to get up and leave. I really don't understand why so many people like this movie more than the first one. There were just so many things that made no sense about the characters and the plot. It was way too long, and had many unnecessary and completely puzzling scenes. It seemed like the director was trying to turn a comic book movie into some kind of artistic statement, and to me it just didn't work.The first movie had a lot of funny lighthearted moments, this movie just didn't have the same kind of sense of humor, and I really missed that.Kirsten Dunst and Tobey Maquire's faces are so emotionless in some scenes. Its like they're so tired of having to do the same scenes over and over again, just in different outfits and locations, that the lines have become meaningless to them. James Franco has such a small range as an actor, he's just awful in the scenes that are supposed to be emotionally intense. I think he would be better suited to acting in soap operas. And god help us, if there is another one, he'll be the bad guy. Because his father just conveniently hid all his Green Goblin stuff in a secret room that they never showed in the first movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but where are Spidermans poses and cocky attitude?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, let me say that Spiderman 2 is far better than the first. However, I consider the first to be very overrated, so that doesn't say much. Again with SM2, I feel I'm battling overratedness.. so excuse me if I get a little rough on it. &gt;:)The movie contains several gems; action-gems, emotional gems, humour-gems.. Peter Parker vs the two kids (you'll know it when you see it, brilliant), and there were a lot of heart-rushing action scenes. The movie has nerve all along, and you ALMOST don't get bored during the whole film. So why am I so ambivalent about it?First of all: The CG is bad. Sorry folks. The CG is not near the quality of LOTR or whatever. Check out Spidey himself. Like many CG objects, he always seems a tad too light or plastic-y, he doesn't seem to jump or fall with normal gravity. Or Doc Ock's arms, although indeed nice looking, I never really got the feeling his arms were really stuck in his back. So, CG needs improvement.The movie has a lot of emotional nerve, which is a good thing, and an important part of the Spiderman universe. This movie is about 80-90% drama (!), believe it or not. Only problem with that, it's carried by too many "hollywood-style motivation/emotion speeches". Yawn! One of Auntie May's went something like: Always follow your dreams, believe in yourself, there are true heroes, don't run with scissors, never abandon your hopes, bla bla bla. Hollywood filler chatter! MJ had similar lines; OBVIOUSLY artificial. Direction also needs improvement.And Mary Jane, she's not ugly here, BUT - she's just not pretty. Her character's made up to be this model-style beauty, which she's not. She was in the cartoon, but she's not a beauty here. Now don't get me wrong, I love the concept of "normal looking people" in movies, but I hate people obviously miscast. Why chase a marriage-hungry dull girl like that, Spiderman? PS: MJs "ironed" 2000-style haircut never looked good on anyone, boy or girl. SO: Casting needs impr.... well, too late for that. (I realize you're married, Raimi, but DON'T miscast Felicia Hardy too)The main problem I have with this movie, however, is where it slips most from the cartoon concept. We've seen CG and wire-battles so many times now, it's been done so good before, so why should we remember Spideys battles when we walk home from the cinema? Well. Spiderman's battles in the cartoon was all about poses, Spideys cocky attitude and brilliant lines when he was fighting the bad guys. It was original, it was fun. Where is it here?! The battles themselves thus become a little anticlimactic ("seen that before"), so they just crush a lot of stuff and make Spidey "almost die" all the time in stead. Comic adaption needs improvement..Phew. Well, as I said; it's not a bad movie, but it's not quite up there as a top 250 movie either. That said, this movie does contain several gems, if you have a "girlish" girlfriend she won't be bored to tears by it - it IS highly watchable. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spiderman? More like Superman half the time..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As sequels go this one isn't bad. It's entertaining, the characters get more development, the CGI is more intense, the perceived "threat" is more deadly etc. etc.But somehow , despite a reasonable first half, I felt let down by the second half. The warning signs were there all along, thinking about it, but I ignored them because, up until the half-way mark, the film was pretty good and I was enjoying it. But once the movie crossed into the nonsense-filled second half, all those "ignored sillinesses" of the first half flashed back to haunt me. As a result, the pleased expression on my face darkened into a scowl and the movie lost me by the three-quarter mark. I was just glad when it finished.Spiderman, the CGI creation doesn't look any more real than he did the first time out to me. Additionally, it grated on my nerves that he was apparently able to defy the gravitational constant and swing around the city like he had a jet-pack strapped to his arse. It was like Van Helsing all over again.And since when was Spiderman indestructible? Or able to stop buildings from falling? Maybe I missed those comics as a kid but I don't remember him having those kinds of powers. Agility, yes. Spiderlike wall-climbing ability, yes. Super strong webs, yes. Regeneration, yes. But not being immune to damage or able to resist tons of pressure.Then there's my perennial favourite gripe - physics. If you put a comic-book character into a supposedly "real world" situation, then you better stick to physics at all times or your movie ends up looking dumb. My example here is dumping what amounted to a small star in the Hudson River. Not only do we not get the steam-flash explosion that would probably have been as devastating as the star going up itself, but we don't even get a hint of warm water. Not even a tiny hot-spring effect. Just the star and Doc Ock serenely sinking to the bottom of the river. Bah!Other items which surprised me were the face pulling exploits of Tobey Maguire when he was stuck on the front of the train. Talk about ugly! I haven't seen a face that contorted since the decompression effects in Total Recall! And they say he can't act!Speaking of faces. What's with Kirsten Dunst? Her face when acting out any kind of emotional scene (other than terror) was, as my partner put it, "a face like a half-p***ed cat!" Not pretty!So, the movie loses it after the halfway mark. If you can put up with the nonsense then it's a pretty good film, livened up by Bruce Campbell and Ted Raimi cameos and some nice gags and one-liners. But don't expect anything but silliness from the second half.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let's see. First of all, I'd like to say that this film was enjoyable and funny. I felt that the actors/actresses did a great job. I liked J.K. Simmons, James Franco, Alfred Molina, Rosemary Harris, and Tobey MaGuire. I felt that these actors/actresses were, for the most part, great at portraying the emotions of the characters. HOWEVER, I was SLIGHTLY disappointed by this film. I felt that they spent too much time on Peter Parker's life and did not have enough action. It does have a stronger emotional, human feel to it, but you can't forget that this is also an ACTION film, and it just didn't live up to that title.Additionally, I felt that the script was not so great. The writers did not spend enough time on Dr. Octopus. (Molina, with the little screen time that he had, did act very well.) There were way too many corny moments too, like the "Raindrops Keep Falling on my Head." Although it was a funny scene, it was very corny.I am a HUGE Spiderman fan, btw. I collect EVERYTHING Spiderman related-heck, I even collect the FRY bags that BK sells! However, I just felt that this flick did not live up to all the reviews nor did I feel that it was as great as the original-which is AMAZING btw. (That one really had everything.)Overall, despite the gripes I have about this film, I will give it about an 8/10 b/c it did focus more on the inner turmoil that Peter was facing, and I feel that portraying human emotions is very difficult, and the acting cast did it pretty well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Most of the time when a film is hugely popular, I end up agreeing with the majority, especially when it's an action/scifi flick. With both "Spiderman" movies, I've disagreed. Perhaps I'm simply too much of a nerd to appreciate the very human spin Spiderman has been given by Maguire, though I should venture to say I've never collected comic books, and my familiarity with this particular series is limited to the old Fox Saturday morning cartoons (remember the days when those were something to look forward to?). I'm sorry, but I don't sympathize with the saintlike, penniless genius who's going through a major crisis and responds in a manner that suggests he's quite in touch with his feminine side. Not to imply anything about his sexuality, of course, but I'm an adherent to old-school macho stoicism, and Peter Parker does not display it, despite pursuing a "great power brings great responsibility" lifestyle. How about the responsibility not to become an emotional wreck? I guess being a superhero is hard on the wallet, but I'm sure there's a way he could make things work without breaking any laws. I don't recall his financial situation being quite so dire in the cartoon, and if it is indeed an affectation of this particular rendering, it is an unnecessary one.Maguire's attempts were somehow more acceptable in Spiderman (1) when he was a full-scale high school geek. Now that he's a superhero, I have trouble forgiving the unterminable stupid look on his face. Additionally, Kirsten Dunst doesn't make me think of MJ Watson, or a community heartthrob.The comic book story of the movie takes up half its total showing time at most, and is fairly simple and formulaic. Scientist loses sight of his original philanthropic intentions and commits dire offenses in the name of progress. The film fails to explain why Octavian's AI tentacles have so much stock in the success of his project. I realize they think, but why should they *care*?The quality of the film, ignoring the genre it's in, is certainly less than most give it. Iffy CGI, an inability to decide exactly what sort of movie it is, comedy/romance/action/drama? leads to unbalanced distribution of time for its scenes. It has a poor ending, as well, suffering from the more forgivable LOTR 3's multiple fades as all the loose ends are tied up. Still, let me be positive for a moment, after all, I rated it a 6. The acting is good, the action well-choreographed, and the drama occasionally moving, and it scores on most of its comic notes, even if Spiderman hits the bottom of an alley a few too many times.</fullReview>

I wasn't a big fan of the first film, and this film had flashes of greatness but really fell flat for the most part.The action sequences were excellent, though some were intensely (and unnecessarily) violent. The CGI looks much better than the first film's, and makes this one worth seeing.The biggest flaw in the film is the fact that it includes long, drawn-out (and frankly boring) sequences of exposition that detract from the action. I'm tired of seeing the inner struggle of Peter Parker. Where the heck is Spider-Man?I hope in Spider-Man 3 that there will be less Aunt May, and more butt kicking.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, I know it's a comic book, but some of the plot details don't make much sense. If Dr. Octavius could invent artificial limbs that connected to his nervous system that would be a major scientific accomplishment in its own right and would make him and Oscorp billions by helping the paralyzed. Here's it's presented as an afterthought. And why he has to wear the artificial limbs to perform the experiment instead of using some kind of robot defies explanation. And then that everyone would stand around in a room where a highly dangerous experiment was taking place! But okay, it's only a movie, only a comic book.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Uh I just saw spiderman 2 as a team outing. It's not that good.I mean it's OK. But there are times where I thought I was watching a B rated horror movie (in terms of the style of cinematography and cheesy dialog, I was thinking Army Of Darkness, which the main character of that movie happened to play the usher). That aside, I think they were going for a comic book feel on that. So then, 80% of the movie is slow ass crap. Which is either the love story situation, or the whole 'those who have a gift must use it for good' melodrama. There were times were I was borderline about to just walk out and finish it later when it comes out on DVD.Though it woulda been hilarious if when Harry, who was whining about his dad the entire movie, at one point when he see spiderman is Peter and goes "You killed my father! (for the 500th time)" instead of Peter going "there are bigger things going on than you and me..." but rather said "Dude, get over it already."They also coulda delved a bit more into why Peter was losing his powers. I was guessing that it was related to being totally stressed out. But the powers mysteriously come back at peak stress. Oh wait, lemme guess it's because "he believed in himself." (yawn)Spiderman 2 was dumbed down for kids. I don't think action movie goers care for the 2hr chick flick that this movie was, nor do kids. Love stories are always introduced for one primary purpose: it's inexpensive. Not that this movie was low budget, but if you chopped out 30 mins of the "filler", you would have had a better impact.Ah well... All in all 6.5/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I guess I expected more. This is a film for kids, I guess. Given all the destruction and violence they encounter on TV and in video games, CGIs are just part of kid culture. They expect it and tolerate it. The bringing of comics to screen is hardly new and began back in the 30s and 40s. Back then, the limits were imagination of the goofy directors who were able to patchwork props together to suggest the special effects. Then, there were the old superman films with George Reeves which combined both...and they were pretty cheesey. But, underlying all of this was the comic book heroes themselves. Comic books were the epitome of the mythic journey where clear lines stood between the bad guys and the good guys. You always knew who the villains were, just like in the cowboy movies. They were invariably decked out in some symbolic feature like a tight-fitting costume, with the genitalia tastefully tucked away, which displayed the sleek, muscle-rippled bodies, all of which spelled out H-E-R-O.So, why does this film fall so flat? It's got all the gimmicks, costumes, tension, unfairness, bad-guys who are basically good but taken over by some force they could not anticipate. The brilliant scientist turned evil by his lack of foresight...the underlying message being, there are some secrets of nature, thou shalt not mess with. Alas, the message is an anti-intellectual one and one that detracts from the power of the mythic struggle between good and evil. It seemed to work well in the first film but the message in this is worn thin in this rehash. There is a lack of continuity and the struggle of Peter Parker, which should be the struggle of every one, becomes a parody. He gets knocked down, he gets stepped on, he gets slapped, he begins to lose his powers and descends into hell and is reborn. Those are powerful metaphors but they come across like a tune played on an old coffee can. All we're left with is Peter Parker's confusion, growing self-doubts and final commitment, undermined by the girl he loves. The sacrifice is made by the villain, Al Molina who refuses to "die a monster." We're left with the feeling there's still some good in the worst of us misguided souls.So, what's the lesson here? Is Peter Parker willing to make that supreme sacrifice of love, career and normalcy, only to have it undermined by a now-understanding, woman who comes to him in the wedding dress she was wearing for another man, whom she ungenerously left at the altar?Stay tuned, as the James Dean-lookalike is waiting in the wings to don his father's garb for the next big money maker...while the suits like up to sell lots and oodles of Spidey goodies, games and treats.Could be, but maybe I'll pass the next one...I get the feeling I've seen it all before.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has got to be the most overrated movie of the summer. Not that it's a bad movie, but the critics just seem to be hailing it as the best comic book movie of all time, and quite frankly, it isn't.This movie is like the LA Lakers, and the Shaq and Kobe are Doc Ock and his Arms. The third major force, Phil Jackson, is like J. Jonah Jameson. Without these three, this would be a terrible movie. It brings nothing new to the table, with the exception of Doc Ock. I kept trying to remember awesome scenes from it that DON'T involve Doc Ock, and there aren't any. There isn't enough of him, though. The rest of the movie is a rehash of all the themes touched on in the first one. A movie about the tough decisions of Peter Parker: whether he can exist as both Peter and Spiderman, the pitfalls of being a hero the world underappreciates, and the bitter truth that he can never have Mary Jane, lest his foes harm her. I liked this movie better the first time I saw it, when it was called Spiderman 1. Roger Ebert slammed Shrek 2 for "saying nothing original." Apparently by the time he wrote his 4 star review for Spidey, he lost interest in the importance of novelty.How many times do we have to watch Tobey Maguire gazing into a mirror as if yet another Uncle has died? How many times do we have to watch MJ react to petty accidents as if her life has been destroyed? How many times must we hear the same old sappy Heroes and Virtue monologue from the old woman? I put up with it the first time, but it got too old. With Doc Ock the movie is good. Not great. Not even as good as the first. But you have to have meat, and without Ock, this movie is the most boring rehash comic book movie I've ever seen. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When i came out of the movie theater, I felt empty... not spiritually, but financially! my wallet was $10.25 lighter. I am not saying this was a horrible movie, it just didn't feel that great! why didn't it feel that great? here are the following reasons...1.) Character development. Many movies have problems with their character development i.e. very little character development, but this movie's case was quite the contrary, it has Waaay too much character development. You see, that's what they made the first movie for to build the character and the second one can actually have a BOLD story. I understand they tried to make Peter Parker vulnerable and for us to show him pity (which by the way, was very well done by Toby McGuire) but they did too much of it! We know who Peter Parker is!! We understand how vulnerable his character is!2.) Too many unnecessary scenes. I still don't understand why they had that landlord's daughter and her nervous high school crush towards him. what was all that about? For a second I thought he was gonna ditch Mary Jane and go for the landlord's daughter. Not only I found this scene useless and pointless but also a big bore!3.) Again, this movie dragged on a LOT. All that boring melodramatic sequences was actually somewhat compensated by the last 35 mins or so. The action sequence on the moving train was great! One of the best action sequences I have seen in a while.4.) The ending. Was it me? or did anyone else find that a lot of people knew Spidey's secret identity? Mary-Jane Watson, okay that makes a sense, this was done so she can make a decision over Peter Parker rather than John Jameson. Harry Osbourne, so that he can constantly ponder and go mad over killing Spiderman or loving his best friend to finally reaching to an arbitrary solution, putting on that suit to become Green/Hob goblin. Doc Oc finds out who Spiderman is, but then again he dies in the end, or does he? But what about all those people in the train cart? "don't worry Spiderman, we won't tell anyone" can they be trusted? they are after all New Yorkers...! okay that last bit was a lame joke, please don't be offended.In conclusion, I wouldn't say this movie was great. Although I did find the second one better than the first one, I'd still have to say this movie was okay, in fact if it weren't for that last couple of minutes, I'd have to say this movie would've been really horrible! If anyone out there have opposing view points to what I've said, please post them, I wish someone can change my view on this movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**spoilers**There obviously must be something wrong with me since everyone is saying this is the best comic book movie ever but I just didn't like it. It started off well but then it went all wrong for me. I don't think this Doc Ock guy was interesting enough as a villain. Spidey giving up his spideyness has been done before and better in Superman II when he gave up his powers for Lois. And there were a lot of similarities to the Superman movies that made this seem like I'd already been through it. I also don't understand how the writers thought it was okay for so many people to know who Spider-Man's alter ego is. Oh yeah, they won't tell, I forgot. Sheesh. I started to get aggravated with this movie because of the constant reminders of how difficult Peter's life is, especially the scenes with Aunt May. Was he late all the time and penniless? I'm not too sure. They only pointed that out a million times. Where it completely lost me was after Peter and Ock left the cafe. But the actors were okay for the most part and there was one very good scene in an elevator. I was expecting the best comic book movie of all time because of the hype, but it turned out to be worse than the first one, which I didn't think was that great either. It's too bad because I usually enjoy comic book movies. It gets a 4/10 from me. I'll stick with the X-men.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Roger Ebert be damned he lies.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My only conclusion is that Roger Ebert has sold out and really doesn't Judge movies. First and foremost the movie I am talking about is Spider-Man two, A movie that has been advertised as the greatest super hero movie ever by one of the "Reputable" critics in the land Roger Ebert. I will Not make the mistake and judge the movie by the comic books it is a mistake often done and I don't agree. What I will say is check out Spider-man since it is one of those critic proof movies and it won't matter what I say. When you see the movie though look for these things NO SPOILERS AHEAD. One see if the beginning does,t do a great job of setting up a premise advertised on every poster and commercial shown "CHOICE" after that see if half way the movie just forgets the beginning and adds just foolishness, some comical scenes that take up time instead of tieing together the movie. Second, check out the production value and see if certain this are left out to make spider man more plain or vulnerable Power wise, rather than adding actual plot twist to combat it. Third towards the end watch as the plot and the characters just become flung towards the ends of the universe, as point and main objectives of the movie aren't met or questioned. Last check for very predictable and boring points making spider man a two bit B film with bad effects to boot, they shoot many seens shadowy just cause when day light hits the scene looks power. Spider Man is a poor attempt to show what an everyday super hero would be. Instead much like the director who did Harry Potter Prisoner of Azkaban it only shows the limitations of the people directing and producing these movies. It is obvious their imaginations or budget did not match what these stories truly needed. On top of that the wholes created in the plot just to move it along for a sequel is disgusting and pathetic, part of that comes from me reading the comic, Guess Micheal morbius, Mysterio and others will not be there Bye Bye KRaven, but away from the comic it just makes the movie feel awkward and rushed. Spider man 2 was more like a montage of swings and short fight scenes than actual movie scenes and footage. I am sure people will like it no matter what but it you go in there and watch it with an open mind you will see that it is very poorly done and Sam Rami is out of his element. STICK WITH HERCULES AND XENA!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie, no more, no less</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I walked out of Spider-Man 2, I thought to myself "well that was pretty good. It dragged a little in the middle but it all came together in the end." A few weeks later, I heard people saying it's the greatest superhero movie ever, and Roger Ebert said it deserves a best picture nomination. I thought "did I see the same movie?" I've visited Spider-Man 2 a few times since its DVD release and I've never really been floored by it. That doesn't mean it's a bad movie, but I just don't get what makes it so good to most people.The main advantage Spider-Man 2 has over Spider-Man is its more focused story. Spider-Man was rushed in the beginning and it kind of ran out of steam at the end. In Spider-Man 2, all the drama slowly builds up to the final showdown with Doctor Octopus, whereas the final confrontation in Spider-Man sort of came out of nowhere. Spider-Man 2 picks up where Spider-Man left off, with Harry out on a quest to kill Spider-Man and Peter intentionally distancing himself from MJ, because he fears he could only put her in harm's way. Parker really has some bad luck in this movie. In addition to keeping him away from Mary Jane, his superhero work keeps him from doing his homework and ultimately gets him fired. All this built-up stress gives him some sort of psychosomatic illness that makes him lose his powers. He gives up the Spider-Man mantle in a scene similar to Superman giving up his powers in Superman II. Of course, a confrontation with Dr. Octopus and some really preachy conversations with Aunt May inspire Peter Parker to become Spider-Man again in a scene that still manages to be inspiring, even though I couldn't help but think "Finally!".An accident in Doctor Otto Octavius' lab fuses his robotic arms to his back, and they control his mind to a certain extent. In a sense, Dr. Octopus really isn't a villain, the arms are. I used to think I didn't like the take on the character because he wasn't utilized well enough, but after watching it again I realized the problem was much simpler: I just don't like the character. A lot of people find this more sympathetic take on the character to be more complex, but I don't think a villain whose mind is being controlled is very original or interesting. His quick conversion to the good side at the end is not particularly convincing either. I like conflicted villains but usually when its due to some psychosis, like Two-Face. I have nothing against Alfred Molina, he did the best with what he was given. In defense of the writers, there was nothing much they could have done with Dr. Octopus, since he's just a generic mad scientist in the comics. The arms do make for some fantastic action scenes, and a creepy horror film sequence in a hospital. But Doc Ock's story never really feels like it's part of the same movie as Peter and MJ's story; it sort of intersects with the rest of the movie once in a while.The other main problem I have with Spider-Man 2 is the style. Raimi does not understand the meaning of the word subtlety. He hammers you over the head with the "Peter's life sucks" theme, to the point where Peter can't even get a drink at a party. I lost count of how many times the camera slowly zoomed in on Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst's sad faces. Peter's indecisiveness is understandable but it gets really frustrating by the end of the movie. At first he doesn't want to be with MJ, then he changes his mind and asks her not to marry her fiance, and ten minutes later he takes it back, saying "I don't love you." The last time I saw the movie I yelled "You're a moron! Make a decision and stick with it!" It's a good thing Dr. Octopus threw a car through the Cafe window, or else I would have turned it off. The melodrama is just too heavy handed for me. I can watch the same stuff on Dawson's Creek. Spider-Man 2 also has the same theme as the first, "with great power comes great responsibility," which gives it a deja vu feel. I know that it's Spider-Man's central theme, but the least they could have done was make it a little different. In both movies, Peter Parker has great power, shuns his responsibility, screws up a bit, realizes his mistake, and basically says "I have to listen to Uncle Ben's advice and be more responsible."Other pet peeves: This has been mentioned a lot, but Spider-Man takes off his mask too much. For a man who is so paranoid about containing his secret identity for the safety of his loved ones, it seems out of character. Also, the scene where he stopped the train was terrible. Everything up to it was fantastic, but Spider-Man is simply not that strong. If he could do that, he should have been able to knock out Doctor Octopus in one punch.So despite a middle section that's a little too heavy on the melodrama, Spider-Man 2 is still an uplifting movie. Since the ending of Spider-Man was such a downer they had to give us the ending we all wanted to see (I won't give it away, but I bet you can guess). It also features an excellent Willem Dafoe cameo at the end, and a good cliffhanger ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A Sequel to the crappy Spider Man film of 2002.This time Spider Man is in more Sh*t. With a new Villain Doctor Octopus, his girlfriend loosing faith on him, and having trouble with jobs.All this just makes him look like a worthless Nerd who has too many problems to handle in life.This is a tiny bit more decent than the first BUT NO CIGAR! Still need s better directing, and too many parts that need changing in my option.Again, I'm glad I didn't see this in theaters. And those who are crazy about Spider Man can see this if you actually enjoyed the first one. Those who hate Spider Man won't enjoy this one either.Rent it first don't buy it before renting or borrowing it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spider Man 2 better then Spider-Man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To tell the truth, all three of the main characters (Doc Ock, Peter, and Harry) performed exquisitely. Their performance puts the special effects to shame. Alfred Molina, who played Doc Ock, especially really absorbed me into the movie with his amazing acting. Personnaly, I'd like to congratulate each actor and actress personally by letter, but all these dumb websites want you to pay 10 bucks or more just for a stupid address!! GAHD! People will do anything for money, which is really just sad. Well, this movie is at least 10 times better that its predecessor, which I was already blown away by! The web swinging is far more realistic, and the cast really knows what its doing now. Also, I believe I know the next villain for SM3. I think it'll be a twofer, with Dr Conners drinking the serum and turning into the Lizard, and Harry resurrecting the Green Goblin. But this is just speculation.</fullReview>

It's all there. Spider-Man 2 was the best movie of the year from June 30 to August 6. Then after August 6, something so extraordinary came along and made this film the second...I loved this movie. Probably one of the best sequels I've ever seen. Probably the best comic book movie I've ever seen. Probably the best movie of the summer right, right, right? Well when I saw this film on July the 3rd, I was astounded by how great this movie was. Way better than the first. Well come August 6, I went to see a movie that I'd had been waiting for about 5 months. The movie that beat Spider-Man 2 for Summer Tops... Collateral. But I'm not here to talk about Collateral, I'm hear to talk about how Spidey came in second to Vincent the contract killer, Cruise's character.Spider-Man 2 was a great film like I said, however having said it's a movie with comic book status and the fact that it's not the last film of it's series, it's not one of those phenomenal films at the Oscars. However, Collateral is.Spider-Man 2 had great acting, great direction, great action sequences, great drama. Collateral doubled on that and than added thrills. Tom Cruise proves he can take summer tops. He was absolutely spectacular as Vincent, can that be said about Maguire? No. Don't get me wrong, Tobey is a swell actor, however half the time he's in a suit or Spidey is shown in CGI. Got you there, comic book nerds.Spider-Man 2 was an amazing sequel and will probably get an even better 2nd sequel for Spidey 3. Collateral doesn't need that. It's not a money-maker compared to Spidey however, it doesn't need a sequel, a prequel, a spin-off or whatever. The film stands alone great.I could go on forever with my comparisons showing Spidey is 2nd to Collateral but if you've seen both movies, you'll know what I'm talking about. I say, wait until the end of the Spidey franchise before handing it Oscars and awards. However, this year, Collateral's a great Oscar pick. See it and I hope you understand the comparisons I gave now.Having said all of this, I can't possibly wade out those 3 years we have to wait for Spidey 3.My Ratings: Spider-Man 2 - 9.5/10 Objectively - 9.5/10 Subjectively - 10/10 Collateral - 10/10 Eliason A.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow... Where do I start?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well... Spider-Man 2... I'll start off by saying that this is a very fun film, but it is taken WAY too seriously... WAAAAY too seriously. Obviously this movie is on the top 250 here on IMDb, but it doesn't deserve to be. This movie is full of so many inconsistencies, and impossible action sequences, it's not even funny... For example, the runaway train sequence... while very fun and action packed scene, is absolutely impossible, even for Spider-Man. Sorry, you won't fool me into believing that he can hold back, or even try to hold back a speeding train with his arms, and I had my head buried in my hands when he tried to stop it with his feet, and was ripping up rail-road ties, and he simply jumps up and acts like he did nothing more than stub his toe. Spider-Man 2 is full of this... like, I found it interesting how Doc Oc's mechanical arms grew about 15 feet from when he first put them on to when he is in the hospital... I also liked how Spider-Man is able to hold up a 2 ton brick wall, not only hold it up, but catch it in midair... every action sequence was seriously over done to the limit... and Peter Parker must have been practicing his webbing tactics between part 1 and 2, because this movie doesn't hold back on that... how about when he gets his suit back, and leaves a note? (if you've seen the movie, you will know what I mean)... This movie is ridiculously unrealistic.Now, onto the good, this is a very good romantic comedy, though I will say that for some reason, Peter Parker is about 10 times the loser he was in the first one. But, everything is acted very well, and the movie kept me interested. I do think that Sam Raimi is given much too much credit for these movies, seriously, he doesn't give us anything that couldn't be done better, and I honestly think that his directing in this movie was very weak, I won't explain them cause, I really can't, something in the movie just felt missing to me... But it doesn't change the fact that this was a very good way to spend... however long it was... cause at the end, which was a pretty good one I might add, I really, really wanted to see another one. This movie is about as good as a comic book adaptation goes, with the exception of X-Men, in my honest opinion, but, it shouldn't be taken so seriously, because it is not a masterpiece, it is not one of the best movies of all time, but despite all it's wrongs, it's all-right. 6/10 P.S. I'm not a huge fan of Bruce Campbell, but his cameo was hella-funny!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very few sequels ever surpass the original film. Spiderman 2 is one of this select club of films that is actually better than the first one.Tobey Maguire continues to impress as an actor, putting to shame the initial critics when he was chosen for the role. He gives Spiderman depth, vulnerability and a certain boyish charm. Kirsten Dunst, while not one of my favourite actresses, turns in a decent performance.Sure, Doctor Octopus is a ridiculous villain. But this movie is about more than just the plot. The film-making has matured here. There is more subtlety to the execution of the scenes and the story.Spiderman 2 is a great action/adventure movie that's a lot of fun to watch. It probably ranks up there as one my favourite superhero movies of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just can't help it. I'm a sucker for romance and I am touched so deeply to see the romance between Peter Parker and Mary Jane. I think it is one of the reasons why I seem to like the second Spiderman movie a bit more than the first. I actually believe that the second movie is a necessary continuation of the first one since the first one leaves the viewer hanging. Throughout the second movie, Peter Parker struggles to learn his destiny and how to create a balance in life, which is essential since the first movie ends without him being able to do this. The acting is also excellent. Sometimes sequels aren't as successful as the first, but I can honestly say that this one was just as praiseworthy as the first. Now that I have heard that a third one is in the making, I have become very excited to see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was awesome. Some people with clear mental deficiencies might say things like, "We rented Spiderman 2 because we hated the first one so much and hated it even more," but don't let such an obvious breech of intelligence detract from the greatness of this little film. It's better than the first, and that says a lot. I went into this film not expecting very much, as sequels tend to disappoint (see: Blade 2, X-Men 2) but dammit, this movie was just the perfect sequel. The story progressed naturally, with Parker's inner struggle between being a normal young man and being a super-hero who does good but ultimately hurts those around him. Al Molina was an excellent choice to play Doc Oc. He made perhaps one of the crappiest comic book villains into a character of awesomeness.</fullReview>

Mary Jane has to decide if she wants a life of danger or one that is quiet that doesn't involve Peter or Spiderman. We know she ends up with Peter in the end but if you see at the end of the movie, we see her head against the window door with a sad face. She knows that her choice will or could claim her life. Seconds thoughts are everything right now. She is going to die if she stays.Harry Osborn now knows who Peter really is and as the movie goes on, he begins to realize that Peter shares his loyalty to Spiderman and not him and he becomes increasingly more mad.

		<fullReview>* Minor Spoilers *I don't even know where to begin with this movie except to say that it is grossly overrated.It makes no attempt to even create suspension of disbelief. Miniature man-made suns float in midair and are labeled 'nuclear fusion power'. Doc Ock's physics-defying mechanical arms are kept in check by a magical green chip that predictably gets destroyed and makes him turn evil. Peter Parker falls 10 stories onto concrete and gets up and brushes himself off like he's Wiley Coyote. Mary Jane writes off Peter Parker's friendship simply because he missed her play.The plot is trite and predictable. Peter Parker loses his powers and questions his role as Spiderman. Mary Jane questions her feelings for Peter Parker and vice versa. Doc Ock tries to kill Spiderman and Mary Jane.I couldn't help but think, after the end credits began rolling, how much this movie reminded me of the latter Batman movies, which were resoundingly criticized as terrible, yet somehow this movie is praised as fantastic. It makes no sense. 'The best comic book movie of all time' it is not.Is anyone here really going to tell me with a straight face that Alfred Molina as Doc Ock was a better villain than Jack Nicholson as The Joker in 1989's Batman? Or that either of the Spider Man movies even come close to the same level of suspension of disbelief or convincing atmosphere as that movie? I don't think so.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a huge disappointment from the first, but a gigantic disappointment from the hype!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had low expectations when this movie came out, as I was very disappointed by the first film. I don't enjoy Tobey Maguire as a rule, and he overplayed the nerd without any hint of the cocky brashness that defines Spidey in the comics (when in costume). Spidey's swinging through Manhattan looked awful, the Green Goblin looked like a Power Ranger, and Dafoe chewed scenery with gleeful abandon. Just not a good movie.So I didn't bother with part 2 in the theater, even though the reviews were uniformly excellent. I figured I would wait for the DVD, and did so. Part 2 is almost an exact rehash of part 1 for me. Peter's got powers, but is horribly put upon to use them for good. Peter loves Mary Jane, but can't tell her, and she runs into the arms of another. Peter befriends a rich scientist who experiments on himself, his invention goes wrong, giving him special powers and driving him insane. In a tough situation, the people of New York stand up for their hero. It's the same $%#&amp;^ story!!I thought the attempts at humor were contrived (although I did enjoy Raimi regular Bruce Campbell's turn as the usher, and the landlord was pretty funny as well), and the broom closet scene lasted about three times as long as it needed to. The love story is ridiculous. First of all, in what I thought was an impossible feat, the cinematographer made Kirsten Dunst positively unattractive. For that matter, Maguire looked awful too. I know he's supposed to be a geeky teenager, but would a little pancake makeup have been too much to ask? Dunst has never been much of an actress, and nothing changed here. She and Maguire both have their eyes half-lidded the entire movie, making me want to fall asleep along with them.The villain was once again overacted to high heaven. The exposition as he realizes the arms are controlling him made me laugh out loud. Let's not even deal with the absurdity of controlling a fusion reaction in the open air, or why he suddenly felt the need to use the robotic arms for EVERYTHING, including taking off his glasses. I was actually relieved to see Dafoe pop back up - that's how bad Molina was.Now for the special effects. This is what saved it from being a complete disaster. The Spidey-swings were MUCH better, and there were some nice sequences where they transitioned from CGI to live pretty seamlessly. And Doc Ock's arms were very well done. They did seem to have a mind of their own. I'd give it an 8 for effects (well below the LOTR trilogy, about on a par with the X-Men movies), but a 3 for everything else. Let's call it a 5 overall.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Or maybe it was the build up-hype from everyone who had seen the movie before me. I would recommend you watch the movie but with the fast forward button at the ready. The movie is overly long. The special effects are excellent. But the story line is a bit long and a bit ragged in my opinion. But then again we are talking about a million dollar cartoon/comic hero here. I have been reading Spiderman comics since was I able to read (more years then I am putting down here) and the movie does a much better job bringing you that world (as did Spiderman I) then the HULK. But I do think the movie could have been edited down almost 30 minutes and you would not have lost any of the main points of the story. Spiderman is the peoples hero because he is a lot more like us then the Supderdude or many other heros are. Nice touch of setting up Spidey III towards the end but was this movie really better then Spiderman I? I also find it very interesting that as of to date most of the Marvel movies have made a point of staying away from the "supernatural" occult side of the comic stories. Not that this would bring that much more to the movie. My two cents watch the movie if you have not but do not be surprised that you feel like there was something missing when you finish the viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It looked like they were desperately trying to write the superhero somewhere in their adolescent drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For me, it was a hard work to sit this film through, after this slow and long opening and all. I know I'm probably just being a smartass or whatever, but I struggled to find something to be interested in.I mean, there's no much action in it (I hoped to relax and watch a sfx flick - duh! Nowhere near it!), and there's this (IMHO) overwritten personal story that doesn't state much, either (it probably does for what it is: an adolescent movie; but it lacked freshness and therefore was plain DULL).At last - I found one interesting thing: at about the half of the movie, it suddenly occurred to me that the script writers didn't seemed to LIKE the whole superhero thing at all! Like "oh, well, yeah, I forgot- he's a superhero... OK, let's put an action scene here, what's it that the producer wanted there? The train chase? OK, here you are, now let's get back to the REAL people!" Or something to that extent.I mean, it looked like they were desperately trying to write the superhero somewhere in their adolescent drama, and I saw this bizarre picture of the whole writers crew jumping on the film roll trying to fit the bloating here and there superhero in, like people do with the traveling bag when there's too much stuff in it.At the end, I could clearly see two separate movies that mixed about as good as lemon juice and an 85W motor oil. So my conclusion was: they didn't manage to marry the two stories, maybe because they got so far in the realistic part of the first one that the second one looked like it didn't belong. I understand that it's probably the most difficult part of writing a superhero script, but as difficult as it is - it should be done. I could barely watch the "main theme" of the film, although it struck me that there were some pretty bold secondary characters (say, the landlord's daughter - what a pearl!), and there wasn't much of the action movie, so I got bored.It probably is a good movie, but if puts me out of the 3 sigmas of the Gaussian distribution of its target category. I enjoyed some parts of it, and I'd give it a solid 4, or not so solid 5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why is it that most action sequels are not good? Tomb Raider 2, Chronicles of Riddick, 2 Fast 2 Furious, Agent Cody Banks 2, and Matrix Reloaded, they all suck! Well, there's some good parts but the bottom line is that their not good enough. Spider Man 2 has many stupid parts! The reason why the movie is two hours and seven minutes long is because most of the scenes are dramatic parts between Peter and everyone. There are like six ten to fifteen minute pointless conversations between Peter and Mary Jane, two ten minute conversations of Peter and his Aunt, and a ten minute conversation of Peter and his dead uncle (flashback). They were so boring that I walked out of the auditorium and played games on my cell phone in the entering hallway of the auditorium. When I heard the conversations end, I walked back inside and took my seat. The only bad-ass thing that I like about the film was the battle scenes and battle scene special effects. The acting was performed bad by Toby Maguire and Kirsten Dunst. As for Alfred Molina, James France, Rosemary Harris, and J.K. Simmons, their performances were alright. The ending was pathetic. I mean, really pathetic! Not the last fight scene but the very ending. Anyways, heres my results. ACTING: 5/10 SPECIAL EFFECTS: 9/10 FIGHT SCENES: 9/10 STORY: 6/10 BEGINNING: 6/10 MIDDLE: 8/10 (because of the fight scenes) END: 5/10TOTAL: 48/70But that's my opinion. My suggestion is... rent it, download it, or pay-per-view it. Don't waste $6.00 to see it. You not missing anything.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seems everybody LOVES this movie. Even those I know who have good taste in movies say the LOVE it.Me? I LIKED it. I certainly didn't LOVE it.Naturally, the effects and much of the acting were outstanding. This was to be expected in a movie with this budget and which had the impressive start which it did.Where it fell short was the STORY. "WHAT", you say? You thought the story was great? Well, I will give it the fact that the story THEMES were in place. The overall elements and directions of the story were worthwhile. However I felt when this story went from outline to a draft, it lost something.Everything, especially the characters, was 2-D. Flat. Unbelievable. There were a number of points where it LOOKED like high drama; where one WISHED one could empathize with the characters. However I could not, because these characters never came to life for me any more than wooden automatons. It's as if the characters were thought of in terms of the coarse, archetypal way in which they would behave as opposed to with the refinement for the realism of human thought and behaviour.True, most movies are like this. But this movie took some of these elements and overdramatized them. They went over the top and thus out of the realm of believability. Also part of why I noticed it so much in this movie is the POTENTIAL it had for being better. Many of the actors, especially Tobey, were quite strong and capable of more. Their own strengths made it more evident how shallowly the characters were developed.Peter Parker was entirely to "sappy" in this movie. Not because of Tobey's portrayal, but because much of the movie focused upon him as a sympathetic character. The problem here is that a few "hard knocks" can make for a sympathetic character. Too many becomes surrealistic and downright comedic. Yet this movie was not meant to be padodic!What happend with Spidey's powers in this movie was nonsensical. 'Nuff said.Still, this movie had the visual effects and good action you would expect. It would be worth seeing just for the action scenes between Spidey and Doc Oc. There were some funny moments (in fact, I wish there were MORE of them; this movie would have been more effective with a more comedic feel and less serious drama).All in all, I'm looking forward to the next installment of Spidey. I only hope the writers can treat their characters more as living beings and less as 2-D archetypes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sam Raimi in his second installment about the comics hero, Spiderman, outdoes himself. The film is not only pleasant to the eye, but it's fun to watch. The technical details are incredible. The movie will keep the viewer entertained with all the high acrobatics and daredevil tricks.The only thing that bothered me, is that this Spiderman is bicoastal, or maybe bicitizen. I'll explain: During the elevated train scene we are given a view of Second City, Chicago, as those trains only circulate in that city, but not in New York, and that's been so for many years. It's incredible that we're watching something taking place in Gotham and suddenly we're in the Loop with danger to fall into Lake Michigan if Spiderman doesn't stop that train. Maybe it was only me, but since I couldn't stay to check the credits, I've no idea if it's indicated in them.Toby Maguire does a tremendous job as the hero who spins webs all over the city. Kirsten Dunst is also appealing as M.J., the woman that Peter Parker adores. Alfredo Molina is excellent, as always, as the bad scientist who is a monster. Rosemary Harris as the aunt is perfect and James Franco is also good.A fun time at the movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another proof that hype compensates for quality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm neither a die-hard fan of Spiderman comic strips, nor of comic strips at large. If you belong to this 2% of the audience, you might actually enjoy the movie. If you don't, chances are that you will experience a poor story, with poor special effects, and a boring love story. No surprises, nothing original, lots of superfluous stuff to fill the 120 minutes. It's not even remarkably bad.The high rating proves once more that virtually any movie can make it into the Top#250, provided its marketing budget is big enough (see also: LOTR series).Conclusions:1- don't rely on IMDB ratings for heavily hyped movies.2- don't watch this movie. Go for X-Men II instead.3- 4/10 points, for watching the movie was just a waste of time, but it didn't hurt too much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>We get it....he's a flawed superhero.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my opinion Spiderman 2 is a very average movie. Parts of it I liked very much. Other aspects I couldn't stand. The main reason people seem to be praising this movie so much is that it focuses more on Peter Parker than Spiderman and creates a real human character going through the same day to day troubles we all have. I feel that the movie goes too far with this concept. By the time Peter is failing in school, unlucky in love, living in a bad apartment and unlucky with his laundry, I was just tired of it. We understand already!!!The main plot point there is that Peter is unlucky in love. First of all, he has a model/actress madly in love with him. I would hate to have that problem. Second of all, the daughter of his landlord seemed very interested in Peter also. Show me a superhero who still can't get girls. Then I'll be interested.Another problem I had with this movie is the supposedly superior CGI work. My only response to this is that there are shots in the movie that downright look like screenshots from a video game. The third problem that I have is a combination of the dialogue and Kirsten Dunst's acting. I don't really know who to blame for this, so I'll combine the two. People joke about Christopher Reeve's ability to make you believe his "truth, justice, and American way" comment from the original Superman. All I can say is that I didn't get that same feeling from "go get 'em, Tiger."Where this movie succeeds is with Spiderman himself. Spiderman swinging through the streets of Manhattan is one of my favorite things to ever appear on a movie screen. It's exhilirating to watch. I also enjoyed the lighter moments such as the elevator scene, and I liked the fact that other people saw Peter with the suit on, but no mask.The fights with Doc Ock are satisfactory, but I would expect more if this is "the best superhero movie of all time." Overall, this an average superhero movie. Not as good as the first Spiderman, not as good as the first two Supermans, but better than any Batman.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The wife and I went to catch this flick after many friends had recommended it. Some even said it was better than the original, which was cheesy, but fun.Both of us found the movie to be entertaining and fun, but I personally was almost annoyed with just how corny many of the scenes were.I found the special effects to be very obvious. There were a few scenes involving Dr. Octopus that looked borderline realistic, but far too many Spiderman swinging through the streets scenes that looked like an old video game.Overall, the best aspect of the movies is the acting of Tobey and the sometimes very funny comic relief injected into the film.If you spend your money on Spiderman 2 you wont feel you've wasted it. You will be entertained, but in all honesty, I can't say it was a great film by any means. Too much cheese, inconsistency, plot holes, etc. to add up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just another ultra standard mainstream blockbuster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found Spiderman 1 a pretty bad flick, because of uninvolving characters, but this sequel manages to be somewhat better. Yet it manages to still be an average mainstream blockbuster which lacks imagination. The plot is simple, the love story is geared towards teenagers, and most characters borderline caricatural.Near the middle of the film, my friends and I were starting to get bored actually, although it's quite fun to chase all the incoherences in the realization. There are numerous of them. For example, the car on which Peter Parker falls from the top of a building is left intact. Or the suit that he throws in the middle of the street is miraculously clean and ironed 5 minutes after. But that's the privilege of super heroes I guess. The kitchen "fusion", though, looks pretty ridiculous and unrealistic (if a spherical plasma was stable, why would the physicists bother to make them toric ? not mentioning its magical magnetic properties).Anyway, these are still minor details in such a movie even though such details can make a difference. The most annoying thing, though, is the lack of originality in just about everything, from the script to dialogues (the little aunt who delivers another over-the-top speech on how the world needs super heroes) to situations (the passengers of the train carrying the body of Spiderman is pretty ridiculous, the whole train scene actually looks ridiculous and hardly believable) to film-making itself.Nothing really bad, but nothing outstanding either. Just another blockbuster that fits in the long series of average Marvel Comics adaptations we've had so far : Batman &amp; Robin, Xmen, Daredevil, Captain America, and coming Catwoman, Fantastic Four and Silver Surfer. But certainly not the masterpiece that is hailed by IMDb users.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Major disappointment...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>... and probably this year's most overrated movie. I was really looking forward to the sequel of the truly brilliant 'Spiderman 1'... and boy couldn't I believe what I saw.Acting:Almost non-existent. Never seen Tobey Maguire act so poorly (he can do -and has done- much better than that), Alfred Molina was ?apart from a few good scenes- highly disappointing (he, too, can do -and has done- much better than that), and don't get me even started on Kirsten Dunst (who probably couldn't do better than that but probably even gave her very best, sad as it may sound). I was actually surprised by James Franco who IMO wasn't bad at all. Well, maybe he wasn't exactly great, but I was told he couldn't act, and he was almost the only one who didn't make me cringe constantly.Action:The newspaper's headline should be: 'SPIDERMAN CGI'ED TO DEATH!'. Apparently, I'm not ready yet for this kind of CGI, because I was annoyed how artificial Spiderman looked in most of the movie. I don't remember them using that much CGI in the first movie, thus making it more real. Granted- Spiderman moves more fluently in this sequel, and maybe more spider-like, but does this justify the sacrifice of this 'Hey, that guy looks like he could actually be real!' bonus the first movie had? I'd say not. Apart from the CGI, we've pretty much seen all these action scenes before. The only one that really was great was the train scene- but did they really have to do this with the people carrying Spiderman around like that? Just when the movie looks like getting better it's sinking in kitsch again. Doc Ock's animations were great, though, I'll give them that; he was a greater villain than the Green Goblin.Plot:It's such a shame, really- this plot could have been SO good! 'Superhero can't cope with all his responsibilities and decides to lead a normal life again'... great stuff IMO, but they managed to mess it all up- WAY too many schmaltzy scenes- how could anyone stand them?! All I could do was trying not to scream with frustration when Peter's aunt delivers a 5-minute-long monologue on how the little neighbor's boy used to look up at Spiderman and how sad he is to see his hero gone (*nudge* *nudge* *wink* *wink*)... or when Peter sees his uncle again in times of doubt... or when Peter tells Mary-Jane (sorry, MJ, not that old-fashioned) he loves her... or when MJ tells Peter she loves him... or when Peter tells MJ he didn't love her at all 'Oops, sorry- my bad...')... Basically it was the old 'with great power comes great responsibility' thing rolled out to the max plus a see-through love story. Now, this wouldn't have been THAT bad if the acting hadn't been as bad as it was- the way Maguire and Dunst delivered this was just implausible, and I wasn't the only one to snigger at those scenes. Between them was about as much chemistry as in a glass of water (plain, no bubbles).Also, there are more plot holes and inconsistencies than you could shake a stick at.And one last thing- who told Raimi to put as many American flags as possible in EVERY shot? No matter where you look- the aunt's house (and the neighbor's as well), the New York skyscrapers, even the GRAVEYARD- everything's plastered with Stars and Stripes. I'm not, I repeat, NOT Anti-American- but this really is way too much for my European eyes.The only good thing I can say is this: there's hope for Spiderman 3. I can't think of any more schmaltzy scenes they could possibly come up with as they've used up pretty much everything already, and the plot is very promising. I sincerely hope SM3 is going to be more like SM1 again.All in all: I was probably expecting too much (the movie of the year), and all I got was an extremely expensive and elaborate action blockbuster, but barely above average. Which just goes to show that a monster budget and as much CGI as possible don't necessarily make a good movie. I'd rather watch Spiderman 1 over and over again. 5 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as the first Spiderman. Spoilers incl.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Overall I was very disappointed in this movie. The first film had set the bar high, but certainly not out of reach. Maybe it was the hype, or the box office record-breaking first few days that it enjoyed, but I was expecting Spiderman 2 to be a lot more than it was.WARNING: SPOILERS AHEADGood Points:- Intro sequence. I'm not normally one to go for the artsy-type intros. I prefer the James Bond style 10 minutes of pure action, followed by a mediocre credit roll, then right into the film. That being said, this non-action, 'painted stills' intro sequence was well-done, and a good wrap up of the first film, to remind us where we're at. A nice nod to the comics as well, since the art was somewhere between Stan Lee and Monet with markers. - Pizza delivery as Spidey. The movie had such promise at this point. Action, humour, great CGI. - Doc Ock. Almost every scene involving him was pure gold, especially both combat sequences (Bank and subway) - Parker's identity battle with himself. Should he be Peter Parker and lead a normal life, or should he be Spiderman and fulfill his destiny? Not since Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV version) have I seen a superhero wrestle with their identity in such a meaningfull way.Bad Points:- Overall length of the film. This whole story could have been told well in 1 hour. We could have used much more of Doc Ock and any type of combat / flight / webslinging sequences and far less of 'Talking Heads' and other time-wasters mentioned below. - Mary-Jane. In an interesting mirror to Doc Ock, every scene involving Mary Jane was total trash. Dunst has lost all my respect as an actress, although to her credit, this was such a poorly written role that she didn't have much to work with. I was reminded of the 'screaming ninnies' of B-rated horror flicks. Is there a single scene where she doesn't scream ad nauseum? Remove most of the scenes with her in them, and we're starting to have a decent film. Obviously this would be impossible due to the setup from the first film and the comic book story, but you get my drift. - Ending. For the love of all things Marvel, why did the film not end on the brilliantly conceived scene of Harry discovering his father's workshop and setting himself up for the next film as Green Goblin (Jr.)? That might have *almost* saved the film. Instead, we go back to a mind-numbing filler that is only there because Mary-Jane's character is so badly written that we have to tie up the loose end of her marriage. - CGI in certain sequences. When Doc Ock throws the car through the coffee-shop window, real-world physics is obviously in the bathroom. The car doesn't move or break up the way it should, coming through a glass-fill wall. The wall and other obstacles in the shop often jump out of the way before the car makes contact with them. (Does it create a shockwave?) The car itself looks fake, especially when we see it get close to PP and MJ. The other major CGI problems occur in the swingline sequence near the end of the film. The helicopters that Spidey flies around look like they're made out of Lego. The firetrucks could be out of a video game made 5 years ago. If the whole movie was CGI like Shrek or Toy Story, I might not have noticed these, but against a live backdrop (or well-done CGI) in other areas, these issues are sadly noticeable.Two small notes that are fun to pick on, but I don't really have a problem with them:a) I'm a brilliant mad-scientist who's just created a proto-SUN and it's now out of control. I know (and hopefully the audience does too) that fusion of this type and magnitude, once started, cannot be stopped. Oh wait, I forgot that somehow tossing this giant ball of proto-freaking-SUN into our little river will somehow 'douse the fires' it creates. In the words of Dr. Evil: 'How 'bout *no* Scott?' I'm the first one to jump onto the Star Trek ? esque bandwagon of making cool science-fiction for the sake of plot advancement, but come on! That was way too easy to get out of. I did not doc points (no pun intended) for this though, because we are talking about a superhero world? Or are we? (see next point) b) The comics and even both movies point out that this is New York City. Not necessarily 2004 NYC or block-for-block realistic NYC, but not Gotham or some other made up city anyway. We know that normal-looking currency exists because we see the $20 that Aunt May gives Peter for his birthday. Looks fairly American. Jump to Doc Ock robbing the bank. He's removing bag after bag of? coins? And not just coins, they look like doubloons! &lt;in pirate voice&gt; Yar! Me hearties and I just arrived in port with our booty and deposited 200 bags of Spanish doubloons in this here bank! What bank anywhere, let alone NYC, has nothing but coins in its vault? I think we might have seen 1 bag of paper money, but the 8-9 bags that Doc and Spidey throw at each other are all coins! We get a really nice look at the doubloon when Banker Boy picks one up and Aunt May strikes it from his hand. Definitely not US currency.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just as hackneyed as the first Spider-Man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was not that great. The screenplay sounded as if it was written by two different people with very different views of how the movie should be. Some parts of the script are so hackneyed that I thought I would vomit, (i.e. when Aunt May gives her three minute monologue on how "there's a hero in all of us." That scene alone seemed to last for an hour.)The performances from Maguire and Franco were mediocre and not close to their potential as actors, (see Maguire in the Ice Storm, or Wonder Boys). Dunst does an OK job as Mary Jane, but the part doesn't seem to hard. The only saving graces were the superb special effects, and the great performance of Molina as Doc Ock. But just like the first movie, this one ends with a sequel in mind, so I guess I'll go see that one too, and hope that the Spider-Man franchise lives up to its potential.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really? Anyone LIKED that movie?? Why?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my personal opinion, and I respect other opinions of course.I really hated the first movie, an I thought they would produce a better second part. But I was very disappointed.- Tobey Maguire is not a good Spidey. I'm still thinking of who I would like to see in that costume. Suggestions?- Alfred Molina is a big laugh as a bad guy. Is he, let's say, demonic? Were we afraid of him? And if not, did we feel sympathy for him? No. Look how he looks in his "costume", bare-naked, just one big laugh. Willem Dafoe in his 2-minute appearance looked far more scary!- I'm sure that now everyone in New York (in the Movie) knows Spideys true identity. I couldn't stop laughing when he showed his face to the passengers in the Subway Train without a reason (Why did he pull of his mask there? No one knows). Count the minutes when Spidey wears a maski in Part 2. 5 Minutes?- Every two minutes the film shows us what a loser Peter parker is. On and on and on ... we knew that after 10 Minutes, so stop those bullshit of letting him fall down, lose his job, getting nothing to drink at the Party (3 times!) ... The method of repeating something is used too much in here.- He is a coward. Tobey/Spidey is shown as a coward with no balls. Look at Spidey in the Comics, always talking fancy and fighting bravely against the bad. Here he is shown as a wimp.- Cliffhanger, we love you! Part 3 - Return of the Green Goblin ... Wow! What a story... Never heard before... I'm interested to see how that comes to nothing.The only funny character was Jonah Jameson and the Guy from "Evil Dead" in the theatre.But if you all liked it, thats OK for me. I mourned for my money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>eh...the original is better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm sensing a new trend here. A few years ago, everybody agreed that sequels pretty much reek. But now, studios are "pumping up" their sequels with more money and more hype, and suddenly, it's cool to say that installment number two is better than its predecessor. Directors have jumped on the bandwagon - they'll happily admit that their earlier efforts pale in comparison to their latest blockbusters - and critics are following suit. "X2" was judged better than "X-Men," when it wasn't, and now "Spider-Man 2" is being universally hailed as better than its predecessor...which it isn't.Trouble is, the only thing that's really better about this movie is - come on, you can guess it - the special effects. The CGI Spidey looks better. He moves well. The fights are beautifully choreographed. But you know what? He's still CGI. And a good special effect is still nothing more than a momentary diversion. It's the script that counts.And this script is old news. At one point, it was rumored that the movie was to be subtitled "Spider-Man No More." They should've just called it "More of Spider-Man," because it's a rehash of the original. We get more of Spidey being a loser (a lot more...like an hour), more of Spidey mooning over Mary Jane, more heroism in a burning building, and more evil scientists with a serious case of hubris who decide to tamper with forces that are best left alone. It's a virtual remake, only without the cool origin story and the iconic scene on the bridge. Even Uncle Ben makes a return appearance, but in a form so cheesy and strange it must be seen to be disbelieved.I must admit that Alfred Molina's Doc Ock makes a great villain; he's both a sympathetic character and a kickass opponent for Spidey. The scene when he awakens after his "accident" is truly horrifying, effective stuff. But I couldn't understand his plan, or care a whit about his giant gizmo. So many important plot points are glossed over, particularly the exact nature of his tentacles (What do they actually want? To steal an exasperated actor's catchphrase, what's their motivation?) Many of the things that happen to Spider-Man are inexplicable, too. He's supposed to be making some big life choices in this movie, but his decisions seem to be dictated more by unexplained physical changes that he's experiencing, and not his own judgment. One thing that the script does make clear, however, is the moral of the story, which is pounded into Spidey's head every time he asks for some gaseous advice from a friend or loved one.Right, griping done. Certainly an entertaining movie, and the train segment is fabulous. But the first was better, make no mistake. Refined CGI is not the key to a superior film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film depicts how a jerk became a hero after his accidental bite by a strange spider.Yet he is still a jerk after-all, whenever he is not in his spider uniform.Instead of devoting his precious time in doing good to the world, this jerk chooses to deliver pizzas!And he is a total loser everywhere,not being able to get a decent living , or to support his aunt, or even to get a crump of cake from a party. It's difficult for the viewers to find these amusing!If you can manage to tolerate the first 20 minutes of the film, you will be able to meet the real villain, nothing more but a machine-possessed professor moving around clumsily with his heavy octopus claws, rather comical and not at all scaring. Not even the police has bothered to hunt him down, as if they knew even the jerk could do the job anyway.Surely, people can still try to defend Peter, admiring his love towards Mary Jane which had explained his under-performance in life . Afterall, "love" had been so wrongly depicted and over-valued in so many films before.But the truth in life is: being able to do good to the world is much more important than the love between any couple, although the two are not actually totally exclusive of one another, as the jerk has finally discovered at the end of the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Problems with the film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While wonderfully produced, I thought there were some possibly unbelievable plot problems.First, with so many people now knowing Peter is Spidey, can we really expect no one to reveal it. I mean his best-friend-turned-arch-enemy knows...he could destroy him by revealing his secret identity.His girlfriend knows.And a whole subway train full of people knows. Can we really believe one of THEM, down on his or her luck (or just greedy) wouldn't exploit it???? Two, it was never explained why Peter lost his spider powers in the first place--nor how he got them back. Seemed like a wasted plot point.Three, Peter makes this big confession to his grandmother about how he's responsible for his grandpa's death, Grandma leaves, heavy with emotion, unable to even reply to Peter's admission. Then, when it comes time for a second confrontation, Grandma say,s essentially, "Oh, it's no big deal. Let's forget about it." It could have been a major emotional scene, even if it was just a scene of true reconciliation and forgiveness. But it was trivialize.In addition to these criticisms, I thought that actress, Donna Murphy, was entirely wasted as Doc Oct's wife. She deserved much better.It'll be interesting to see if, in the third film, they address these (to me) glaring complications, especially the one concerning Peter's secret identity known to so many, or if they just gloss over it, don't even mention it, and hope we have forgotten it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just finished watching this movie on DVD, (6 bucks, "previously viewed" but probably liberated from someplace) after hearing Roger Ebert describe it as 'the best superhero movie ever' on his childish and slightly overblown, "best of" show. Uh okay...... First off, it must be the stress of being shown up by his younger co-host, or perhaps its the subliminal messaging in the paramount mountain, or the effeminate moon-boy on the dream works logo that did it, maybe its a work related injury.. damage to the cerebrum from a job that forces him to watch every movie ever made for too many years to think about without going cuckoo even the carrot top movie that no one saw because it makes people jump out windows and force their dogs to drink ink. Wait, could it be that film critics/eunuch-ed movie geeks, are paid off by studios to say this stuff? I mean their are certain movie websites, not unlike this one which purely exist as a medium for jerks to promote their own films (or fawn over someone Else's, don't know which is worse...)Could it be that a misguided culture desperate to objectify and make money off anything has elevated these losers to celebrity stature, and they don't take their jobs seriously anymore? I mean how serious could you be, when you host a television show? Critics once evoked images of Dorothy parker et.AL literati, evaluating aesthetics, creativity, talent, these days they just suck up to powerful studios between Shampoo ads. Hmmmm. Buddha say meditate on this. I watched an interview with Todd Macfarlane who had plenty to say about comic books and corporate culture. He posed the question: why can't spider-man be black under his mask? Interesting. Film reflecting relevant social issues, note: someone please crucify him or at least deport him to Europe with the other 'weirdos'. Well, let's see why do black folks only get one superhero, and of course he comes from hell (spawn). Why do the ethnic superhero's have to avenge ghetto murders, why are their girlfriends dead or non existent? (ibid., the crow)? In short Mr. Macfarlane asks: why can't Superman eat watermelon for a change, Mr. Spielberg? Money &amp; Politics, Todd. Whatever has the broadest appeal to the demographic is what's reflected on film, and to some extent it also serves as a way of perpetuating values of yesteryear with roots in racism, sexism, and sensational violence. These cookie cutter creations are supposed to be forgiven because they are admittedly somewhat entertaining, and of course they're, "y'know a summer blockbuster". This qualifier seems to mean that we're supposed to overlook how stupid the movie is, and just enjoy it, that is like a brain lesion triggering the aroma of burning toast, movie-houses awaken one's 5 year old inner child and ask us to abandon our standards and reason. I've been 5 years old before, and I think I'm ready for Hollywood to make some more 'mature' movies for a change, that don't require that I get drunk prior to viewing, in order to prevent throwing something at the screen. What ticked me off was the special features section on the DVD. It was illustrated to me how expensive this movie was and the neurotic attention to detail that went into making it. It seemed utterly absurd to me that these clearly educated and talented people (Laura Ziskin, and com-pats; minus the educated but including cute for some of the younger cast)could make such a predictable stupid movie. In fact why does Hollywood make such bad movies? Could it be that because as an audience we are to quick to say "y'know its a summer blockbuster", should we instead wake up and DEMAND more from these people? Sure we'll give you our dough, but how about hiring writers, and telling us a story we don't know? How about reflecting the world as it is, why not see people like, wow, us? Nope, instead studios have sold out a potentially artistic medium in order to stuff their pockets and ensure a spot at "Promises" and the DNC fund-raiser, in that order. I've officially stopped going to see movies I think cost too much, its immoral. Moreover, I won't pay a dime to watch the studio's chicken feed to the anesthetized masses, with their chalky and vapid stars, and insipid stories. I'm willing to bet that Ziskin and troupe, probably don't even watch their own movies. They're far too rich and Au currant to watch this junk, they're at the art-house cinemas, or their home cinemas? So who watches this stuff? Kids whose parents have to work late, and this stuff is like cyanide for the brain. Hollywood is corrupt, stop giving into their laziness and greed. Sure its entertaining, but don't kid yourself that something is really wrong with the fact that the only stuff that makes money is the fantastical escapism fare. I had read that the movie industry is at its peak during times of economic desperation, as was the case in the depression, there was a need to escape. Something is wrong when thats all a society's people want to do, i.e. television. Sure its okay to indulge in some eye candy as you slowly wean yourself off, like switching to menthol's to make your withdrawal easier. I'm just saying, demand more from the artistic community, and if they won't budge, at least wait for video or TV. Hope I'm not the only one out there! And oh yeah, its not the best superhero movie, its not even the best 'y'know summer blockbuster'. It didn't suck, its just stupid. ANd its sad that with all the resources they don't even try to do more, because its notnecessary that they do, little Timmy is in for merchandising and the price of admission, before the release date. Shame.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than the first- Sam Raimi proves his cool knack for balancing elements of action, drama and comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spider-man 2, at least, accomplishes one thing above all else- this time, when the Spidey flings himself through the air, it doesn't look as fake as it did in the first film. If anything, this time I did feel the exhilaration that the filmmakers intended. They, being the team at Edge FX, have taken the huge lot of profit from the first film, which became the smash of smashes in the comic-book movie genre, and on that end the film is a success. But even on the human front with characterization the film is a bit of an improvement, which is always tricky for a sequel to do. Two major action sequences involving Spider-man (Tobey Maguire) and his nemesis, Doctor Octopus (Alfred Molina, in a compelling turn), are shot and edited to a wonderful, creative impact. And, in an interesting bit when Doc Ock escapes a hospital, echoes of Raimi's Evil Dead comes through with subtle, if grin-inducing touches. The work done on the villain as well as the hero shows, and it helps that Ock is a sleeker, more threatening presence with his mechanical arms than the weird madman in Willem Dafoe's performance. There are also other factors that give Spider-Man 2 it's worth of entertainment, even as if follows story turns that we as the audience have seen in plenty of other movies (comic-book or otherwise) from Hollywood. There's a nice dosage of humor to tip the scale on the romantic/non-romantic drama, courtesy of J.K. Simmons' added time as the over the top newspaper editor, and as well to a few bits of business in dealing with the problems of being a guy in a costume (plus, there are a couple of fun cameos from some Raimi regulars). The performances aren't bad by the leads, but they haven't improved too well, and with the script that they're given some of the lines don't work as well as they should. Some are appropriate in their corny quality, some aren't. One of the key performances that comes through is Rosemary Harris' Aunt May, who's the most effective of the dramatic parts to the story. So, is Spider-man 2 as great as everyone's saying, that it's one of the great sequels and comic-book films of all time? To me, almost- it actually gets even more engrossing and interesting in its comic-book atmosphere on repeat viewings. It has a fresh appeal as a mainstream, thoughtful action film and, like Raimi's Evil Dead trilogy in the horror genre, it will live on when other superhero movies bite the dust in the video market.

		<fullReview>Dear Readers, Spider-Man 2 was seen by me and my Dad in theaters. Again, loved the action sequences, but that was all I loved. Sam Raimi focuses on how crappy a life Peter Parker has and how many times he keeps breaking MJ's heart. Plus, Peter quitting Spider-Man? What the heck is up with that?! I hated this movie down to my soul.The only redeemable sequences was the climatic battle between Spider-man and Doc Ock battle, the MJ Wedding scene, Harry discovering his father's secret, and the ending. Other than that, this film sucks big time. Take my advice, watch X-Men or V for Vendetta if you want real action and adventure. Avoid this trash at all costs!

		<shortDescription>A comic book movie for adults? No way!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In "Spider-Man" we got the introduction, and now we get the story -- a darker, deeper, more poignant tale that defies the boundaries of comic book movies and dares to venture into the territory of motion picture excellence.The first "Spider-Man" was a very good movie, and one of my favorite films from 2002. It contained a sort of underlying complexity, surrounded by a simple cover that made it worthy of recommendation. The setup of Peter Parker's superhero powers was the most entertaining aspect of the movie, and its fight scenes were explosive in more ways than just one.Now, in "Spider-Man 2," the complexity becomes even more elaborate. The film takes on a dark edge that deals with the hero behind the mask -- Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire), the human being, not Spider-Man, the invincible superhero alter ego. The action is reduced to secondary importance; the characters take first place. It studies them, their motivations; what makes them tick. The first film didn't only introduce Spider-Man, but also his friends -- now, we sit back and watch their progression unfold on screen.The film picks up two years after the original. Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) continues his academic pursuits, whilst parading about as Spider-Man when he finds the time. However, with his grades falling, his part-time jobs failing, his love life crashing and his social life burning, Peter decides to abandon his alter ego persona and develop a social life. Then "Dr. Octopus" (Alfred Molina) -- an eight-limbed fusion of human form and robotics -- begins to terrorize the city, in the hopes of resurrecting a science project that turned him into the "mechanical monster" he is. The four extra limbs have altered the Doctor's personality, and he is no longer a friendly scientist but a deadly villain. With crime rate up 75%, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) marrying a famous astronaut, Harry Osborn (James Franco) planning revenge on Spider-Man, and Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) losing trust in her nephew, Peter must choose between his friends and his duties -- be Spider-Man, or Peter Parker? His final decision is predictable, but the film deals with his course of actions leading up to his final decision, and adds a strong sense of humanity and realistic struggle to a rather unrealistic story.Doc Ock was always my favorite villain from the Spider-Man franchise (closely followed, or equaled, by Venom, who is rumored to show up in the next installment), and Alfred Molina does a commendable job of portraying him. He isn't exactly how I had imagined him, but far more believable given the circumstances of his transformation. Maguire once again proves that he can handle this role and Dunst is given a larger part in the film, whereas Franco is thankfully given less screen time (although the implications of his final appearance in the movie are breathtaking).Some action enthusiasts might be disappointed in the lack of constant fighting in "Spider-Man 2," and the majority of the film is indeed spent focusing on the characters. I liked this. "Spider-Man 2" returns to the roots of comic books, in which the characters are the focus -- not the action. I am not a comic book fan, but one thing I have gathered over the years is that comic books do present an extraordinary medium for character study -- comics allow people across the world to share the trials and tribulations of the story's protagonist(s). "X-Men" was successful because it utilized this structure of storytelling, placing unbelievable characters in a believable world; "Spider-Man 2" is even better, one of the most thrilling rides in years. It creates a surge of joy that I haven't experienced since the first "Spider-Man" came out.All in all I think most praise should be given to director Sam Raimi ("The Evil Dead," "Army of Darkness," "A Simple Plan"), who handles the material with respect for the fans, while simultaneously managing to entice non-fans into Spidey's web. And the movie manages to have a lot of fun despite its serious nature -- look for a cameo by Bruce "Ash" Campbell from the "Evil Dead" franchise as a so-called snooty usher, and even a brief appearance by Willem Dafoe as the Green Goblin (yes, he's still dead, but his spirit lives on).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw the movie and thought it will have here a rating somewhere near 5.And then i see a TOP250 rating!!!Did you (who voted this so high) see the same movie as I?!Let me list just some stupid things about this "masterpiece":MJ (how can someone in serious movies even call someone like this!!??) Mary Jane Watson (LOL) and her love story is one of the most stupid things filmed.She doesn't even know in whom she is in love with.She nearly marries someone;but she is far away from loving him.And then all this "surprising twists" in this love story.That was really too cheap. And shall i write something about the famous scene (where she leaves the church, the sun is shining, the music is playing...)?! Better I don't.Or what about about Peters Aunt. And the scene where she hangs on an umbrella.That was more stupid than words can say.Or the great special effects? Some praise them. Hm; saw the same in the first part. Saw much better in X2 (which is a REAL movie with a REAL story).But OK, these are just stupid pieces of the whole movie. My most important point,and i can't understand the others didn't notice that. It is the completely stupid mixture what this movie is. We have some really stupid scenes (mentioned above).Then we have some scenes which try to show us the big emotions from movies for grown people (when Peter tells his aunt he could have saved his uncle).And then she walks slowly and quiet away (it tries to be great emotional cinema; but IMO this reaction was completely unrealistic; especially when they meat the next time!).Or when we see she hasn't enough money and mas to move to another apartment. But on the other side there are such stupid moments in here(umbrella...) That doesn't work out; it doesn't fit; it is wrong. At least it felt so to me. I made me go "oh oh" !And there is even more of this "mixing". There is even more comedy (the newspaper scenes), but there are also some horror elements (doc oc - LOL, another stupid name in this movie).At all: this was much more a comic as it was a movie. If it would focus on a more serious or on a more funny story...both would have be OK. But this?! No, that was anything else but OK. As the first part was!My rating: 4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was very surprised by my lack of response to this movie considering the glowing reviews. But I found it to be pretty lame, repetitive, dull, and shapeless. My wife absolutely hated it, and the audience I was with was bored and unresponsive. The focus on character is nice, but the material just wears you out after a while, and there is no real driving force to the plot. Cutting about thirty minutes would help. Giving Doc Ock a real plotline would have helped. Cutting out some of the repetitive scenes would have helped. Excising that ill-conceived I'm-losing-my-powers stuff would have helped. All in all, everyone clearly gave this their all, but it's not very good. Better than the first one? Sure, Willem Dafoe in a plastic suit killed that one. But this one is hardly the "perfect" film the critics have bizarrely claimed it to be. It's really just another 2-1/2 star film with a lot of good will toward Spidey.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was very under-whelmed by the first Spider-Man movie, a tepid affair with a poorly constructed story and some ridiculous script inconsistencies. So my expectations for the sequel were pretty low. But this is really a pretty good movie. The script writing is still sloppy, but it doesn't have any of the glaring problems that plagued the original.The movie varies, but is notable for some truly shining moments. The best parts of the film are those that focus not on the action but on the humanity; there is a wonderful scene at the end of the subway sequence and a very affecting ending.The movie has a good pace and more convincingly combines action and human elements. It is by no means a great movie, but it is a good one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too Much Teen Romance Drags Film Down</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me say I have generally enjoyed watching both Spider-Man films. They're fun to view, but as someone older who doesn't necessarily get thrilled watching teen romances, they aren't DVDs I would purchase. The action scenes, with Spider-Man flying around from skyscraper- to-skyscraper, are fantastic. I also loved the villain in here, the octopus-like "Dr. Octavius," played just great by Alfred Molina.However, there is just too much Kirsten Dunst "Mary Jane Watson") in here and the romance angles between her and "Peter Parker" (Tobey Maguire) are just annoying....too sappy, and they take away from the story too much. A little of it is fine, but that aspect of the story takes up too high a percentage of screen time.I've read the comics and those concentrate mainly on Spider Man vs. various villains. I wish the movies would have done the same.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lack of action, lack of good story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many comments on IMDb (as well as a movie rating) say that this sequel is better than first Spider-Man movie. Personally, I don't think so. First of all the second movie was very slow, too slow for action movie and comic book adaptation. It is well-known that Spider-Man 2 had around 200 millions budget but I watched it very carefully and I simply haven't any idea for what they could spend so much money. Overall, the computer-generated visuals weren't bad but the central computer-generated character Dr. Octopus was a really bad thing. Bad character development and acting, ridiculous tentacles - all that made Dr. Octopus such a strong candidate for the worst villain of the year. Willem Dafoe as the Green Goblin in the first Spider-Man movie was simply brilliant compared to this guy. And in addition to that we got a colossal amount of dull and silly dialogs what supposed to carry some moral messages, but in fact they could carry only boredom. I don't know is it a true adaptation of the comic book or not, but anyway the story was lame, as well as the ending was ridiculous. I don't want to discuss here all possible plot holes because that would take too much time. But only one mention of a idea of drowning a fusion generator in a river should be enough for understanding a real stupidity of the script. So I warn you. The Spider-Man 2 can be a watchable movie but only if you don't expect much and turn your brains off before watching it.My grade - 5.5 (I rated the first Spider-Man movie 7.5).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, so I wasn't one of the people that flocked to see this movie right away, but I saw the hype it received on here so I thought I'd check it out.Let me just say, I really don't understand the big deal surrounding this movie. Maybe for some comic book fans, or people who are into the whole superhero genre, this may be your thing, but to me, this movie was better than average, but nothing amazing.This movie did have a few clever moments, some of the scenes and laughs were cheesy funny, but reading some comments on the message board about this movie being hilarious, I really didn't think so. The fight scenes were OK, the train scene was probably the best scene in the movie, and the interaction with the people on the train was more of a classic movie moment than the scenes with MJ and the Aunt.SM 2 also seemed slow at times. I understand that character development is a major part in this movie, so that this can be at least a trilogy, but the first movie was a little more fun throughout. There were numerous times myself along with people i noticed around me, yawning and looking around in a few spots in the movie.I just don't see how this movie can't be ranked so high on the IMDb board.... Especially above Oscar winning classics like Gladiator, among countless others.Lets be real, I know this genre has a lot of supporters just like the LOTR series, but a good movie is a good movie, and frankly.... this isn't one.......not really close</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing you haven't seen before</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In all fairness, Spider-man 2 is not that bad. Mostly it's just dumb and overplayed, just like its much ballyhooed predecessor, which people also liked more than it deserved. I don't have anything against Sam Raimi (except Darkman) or Spider-man the character, but folks, these films just aren't that good. Spider-man 2 has moments where it takes off and is exhilarating, but only moments; most of the movie is like your overweight uncle who talks too much at the holidays. You don't really mind him but you wish he'd shut up and leave.After roping in the heart of every fanboy by starting off the movie with copious artwork by their anointed Michaelangelo, Alex Ross (who is admittedly talented but does the same thing over and over), or someone paid to imitate his work, they recap the first tepid adventure of Spidey and then proceed to make mostly the same mistakes they did the first time. We get all the histrionics of a relationship between Peter (Tobey Maguire) and Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst), but none of the build-up; these two have spent four minutes together on screen and they talk like they were lovers for years. Then we're saddled with Harry Osborn (James Franco), who really should have completed, or started, his acting lessons. The first half hour of the film is one painful scene after another in a pointless attempt to establish Peter Parker as Charlie Brown. Ziggy isn't as much of a loser as this guy. It gets old, really fast, and I was checking my watch after the thirty-five minute mark.Thankfully Alfred Molina comes in as Doc Ock to give a little oomph to the proceedings. Long one of the lamest characters in comics, Ock here is a pretty decent guy who just wants to make things better. Molina's pretty good until of course he has to go on the necessary rampage, which is inspired by the death of a loved one and some splashy special effects, and then finally we get a chance for the film to get good. Spidey and Doc Ock's first fight is really terrific ? it zings, it soars, it wakes you up from the wincing half-slumber you'd fallen into. Sadly, Spider-man then takes off his costume again, so we get a bunch of Dawson's Creek reject scenes with him and Mary Jane, who has obviously fallen in love with him even though she's only exchanged seventeen words of dialogue with him (and she has a hunky new beau played by Daniel Gillies). When Spidey and Ock go at it again, the movie once more comes to life, and follows that pattern; Spidey okay, Peter dull.Trouble is, they have a pretty strong ending that is only slightly overdone (subtle by this movie's standards) and gives the audience exactly what they want. So those few who are going to spot the film's many and obvious flaws are going to forget them in the admittedly wonderful ending. Aside from a juvenile throw-away scene promising the next villain will be as retarded and uninspired as the first, the last twenty minutes of the film are by far the strongest of the piece. If only that inspiration could have spread to more of the film.Okay, here's the real problem with Spider-man 2. Though the New York Times, and others, bill it as 'the greatest superhero movie ever,' it is in fact not only not the greatest superhero film ever (which would still be 1978's Superman), it's one you've already seen before. In no significant way is this film any different from 1981's Superman II. All of the plot elements are the same, you have two villains, it all revolves around the hero's secret identity, etc. I could go on (and on) with this argument but will cut it short to avoid spoiling Spider-man 2 for you in case you haven't seen it.And I'll go you one better. Not only is this film Superman II, it's also Smallville, the Movie (it should be, it was written by the same guys). Osborn is nothing more than Lex Luthor, the head of a wealthy corporation bankrolling villains. Peter and Mary Jane mouth the same sentiments as Clark and Lana, down to some of the very same lines that those two characters have said. If this is the 'greatest super hero movie ever,' you could have seen it for free by watching Smallville every week.I was harsher to this movie than it deserves; it really isn't that bad, and it doesn't make me angry, like that turd Stepford Wives did. But I'm annoyed that I'm going to have to hear everyone else crow about a mediocre film that's a rehashed remake/rewrite like it's the best thing since the Bard. If this is all that moviegoers in this country really want, then they get exactly the cinema they deserve. There's really no harm in going to see this film; the only harm is in thinking it's especially good or original.</fullReview>

Still, it's worth the investment in time and money. Toby is good as Spiderman, but the standout performance is Alfred Molina, who should get a Best Support Actor nomination, although that's a pipe dream. Hopefully, Spiderman 3 will be more action-based, now that his moral conundrum and romance buildup resolved.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Poor Peter Parker (McGuire) has a crappy life and can't ever catch a break. Then he gets powers and takes up the mantle of spider-man, but that only causes him more grief. One of his scientist mentors then undergoes a dangerous experiment that gives him powers but warps his mind, who then goes out of his way to attack May Parker (Harris) and Mary Jane (Dunst). I know what you're thinking "Laserwolf65, I thought this is a review for Spider-man 2, not Spider-man." Well my inquisitive friend, you have already found the major flaw in this sequel, it's the exact same movie as the first one, with only a few new cast members, and subtle sub plot changes.The movie starts off with peter parker getting laid off from his second job as a pizza delivery boy. We then find out that he can't pay his rent, his aunt is about to lose her house, he's losing his friendship to Harry (Franco), Mary Jane and Peter still have a love-hate relationship, his report on doctor Otto Octavius (Molina) is late, and to top it all off, his powers are no longer working correctly.As the movie progresses Peter tries to remedy all of these problems, slowing down the main plot and lengthening the movie to over two hours. Spider-man doesn't even make an appearance (besides a brief sequence of him delivering a pizza with the suit on) until about forty minutes into it. The movie might as well be called: Peter Parker.After over an hour the villain finally makes his appearance. Doctor Otto Octavius has created a machine that will produce a small sun-like reaction, which will produce cheap, renewable electrical energy using a fuel source called tritium, an element so rare that only twenty-five pounds of it exists (because we all know that cheap energy uses a non-renewable extremely rare element). So if that bit of science nonsense didn't faze you, how about this: In order to control it the good doctor created a harness with four long arms to handle the reaction. He also gave them each artificial intelligence (for apparently no reason), but don't worry, he built an extremely small and flimsy inhibitor chip that will stop them from taking over his mind. A few minutes into the experiment, the chip is busted, and Otto goes rogue terrorizing the city.The problems with this movie are rampant. First, almost every important scene in the first Spider-man movie is repeated in Spidey 2. The scene where Goblin talks in the mirror is changed to Otto talking to his arms. The scene on the bridge where the citizens tell their love of spider is changed to patrons on a train telling their love of spidey. The list goes on and on. Secondly, while Molina does an all right job as Octavius, he's hardly in the movie at all. Instead, his screen time is taken away to focus on the completely moronic and unbelievable love triangle between Peter, Mary Jane, and her fianc John. Also, Raimi tries to infuse comedy into the movie where it doesn't belong. This includes an Asian lady singing the old spider-man TV show theme and Spider-man telling children to eat their green vegetables. None of these events are funny, and almost all of them are groan inducing. Indeed the only thing that is funny is J. Jonah Jameson, but sadly he's not too important a character and his scenes are few and far between. Finally there's the moronic explanation for why his powers aren't working ("maybe I'm not supposed to be spider-man" he thinks to himself.), and the painfully obvious setup for the next movie involving Harry Osborn.This movie really only has two redeeming qualities; it's special effects (which are much better than the last movie's), and the Jameson scenes. Other than that it is simply a badly made remake of the first one. That said it's still better than the first movie (although that's not too hard a feat to achieve). **1/2/*****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Does Whatever a Spider Can</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After Spider-Man's success there were naturally high hopes for its sequel. Raimi showed with the Evil Dead trilogy that he knows how to tweak and develop a continuation within his films. That turns out to be one of the films strongest suits, it continues to grow and build onto the themes established in the first film whilst adding new layers of material. By this second outing Raimi and his cast are so comfortable in their roles that it does become a genuinely enjoyable film. The film is often claimed to be the best of the trilogy and that is something I'd have to agree with. It's far from perfect and shares some of its predecessor's flaws, but when it hits the right notes it is great entertainment.Story: Peter's struggle to balance his two lives hits breaking point when his powers appear to be fading and Mary Jane becomes engaged to someone else. Elsewhere a failed fusion experiment leaves scientist Otto Octavius psychologically damaged and with four mechanical arms, which he uses in an attempt to recreate the experiment. I was really impressed by how well the film balanced out both of these stories, giving them appropriate time and space to breathe. I certainly think Peter's emotional journey is one of the films highlights and there is a great deal of emotion to those scenes. It's also nice that Doctor Octopus isn't simply a mad man, but a very intelligent and conflicted person with his instability causing his actions.Hero: Tobey Maguire is excellent as Peter here. He sells every emotion with subtlety and makes some shaky dialogue sound very natural. There is an honesty and warmth in his performance which makes the Peter so endearing. His Spider-Man suffers in comparison as he does lack wit and confidence, but I still think he does okay in the suit and it still manages to fit the character.Villain: Alfred Molina is a standout as Octavius because he balances both sides of the character to perfection. At first he's very thoughtful and charming, but after the accident there is a ruthlessness and cunning that he manages to get across with his expressions alone. By giving the character so many dimensions it makes it easier to be invested in his struggle.Support: Kirsten Dunst is good as Mary Jane and brings charm to the role, yet the character is frustrating. Her anger at Peter's apparent lack of support is understandable, but she once again becomes a plot device for Peter to rescue. It's annoying by this point. James Franco is fine as a more vengeful Harry Osborn, even if he does overplay the part at times. Rosemary Harris is a great Aunt May and her elegant delivery gives the dialogue a real zest. J. K. Simmons is simply wonderful as Jameson, his comic timing is perfect and he delivers constant laughs whenever on screen.Action: The action sequences are much improved over the first film. We again get plenty of shots of Spider-Man swinging through the city and intervening in police chases, with the refined CGI adding intensity to those pieces. Both the climax and the fight at the bank were well constructed. The highlight however is certainly the train sequence. It's a fight that is both wildly creative and appropriately hard-hitting with a great deal at stake for our hero.Music: Danny Elfman's score is more of the same. It lacks any new sounds, but it definitely fits the films tone and always provides the correct amount of bombast or calmness.Production: Sam Raimi directs the film with a flair and imagination that surpasses his work on the original film. He captures the vastness of the city well and gives an identity to a lot of the places we end up visiting. Visually the film is very impressive too, with a great number of scenes resembling images you would expect to find on the comic book page (Peter discarding his suit being just one of them). The writing and tone is where the film really splits for me. Much of the material involving Peter's struggles with Mary Jane and the guilt he feels over Uncle Ben's death is excellent, both in its acting and the grace with which it is pulled off. The scenes that Peter and Aunt May share are always so naturalistic. However, the film has too many ill-fitting or goofy moments that clash with the more honest tone. Peter has to deliver some really bad lines, his interactions with Harry get more clichd throughout and even the Mary Jane dilemma feels weak by the end. The also extras have to be mentioned as I have no idea what's going on with them. It feels like way too many get unnecessary screen time and they all seem to act in a stilted, robotic way that is extremely unnatural.Conclusion: Spider-Man 2 is an example of a film that improves upon the previous film and adds onto what that film was trying to get across, but it doesn't quite reach the heights that it could have reached. My issues with the film are nearly all down to writing and tone. The film does have a playfulness and sense of fun that frequently works well with its more sober moments, yet it pushes itself into silliness a few times too many and that dilutes some of the more serious material. I certainly think Raimi's direction is as stimulating as ever, whilst the action is better and the acting (especially from Molina and Maguire) is impressive all round. It's by no means flawless, but I do think it's a very entertaining entry and one that is easy to get wrapped up in.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spider-Man 2 is a good result from the first film , even me finding less than its predecessor, the special effects have improved, and the villain is nothing to the first, Alfred Molina makes an excellent performance , Tobey Maguire and James Franco back and well , Maguire is not Spider-Man the comic , Sam Raimi back in charge of direction, and as the first is good, there are moments that I did not like in the movie , even James Franco is well , your character is unbearable and whiner , Mary Jane also only serves to hinder , the final moments I found unnecessary, and JK Simmons as well as in the first film incorporates Jonah Jameson , the soundtrack is excellent, Spider-Man 2 is lower than the first movie , plus has great time and a good direction .

		<shortDescription>Spider-Man's Finest Hour or Two</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For some this review will appear contradictory as almost a year ago I stated that 'The Amazing Spider-Man 2' was the greatest Spidey flick. Consider that statement promptly withdrawn. 'Spider-Man 2' tops it in every conceivable way. It is in my mind a better film than 'The Dark Knight'. 'Spider-Man 2' grips from the get go and its webbing does not loosen its hold until the end credits crawl up the screen. Even the opening titles are imaginative, clips are not shown of 2002's 'Spider-Man' and its events but comic book panels. They dazzle your eyes and keep you waiting and wondering as to how the events will unfold. Peter Parker played by a Tobey Maguire whom embodies nerdiness, has now taken up the mantel of Spider-Man and this takes precedence in his life over his college work, job and wannabe girlfriend Mary Jane Watson played by the marvellous Kirsten Dunst.Parker even struggles to stay friends with Harry Osborne played by a scene stealing James Franco, who vows that Spider-Man will pay after the events of the first film where Harry saw Spider-Man return his father's dead body to him. Parker is leading the double life but as a new villain emerges to terrorise the city of New York will he be able to protect the ones he cares about? 'Spider-Man 2' raises the bar to staggering heights, heights which even Spidey would fail to climb. What makes this sequel better than its fantastic original is not merely awesome special effects and an increase in budget. 'Spider-Man 2' is more entertaining, romantic, energetic, visually dazzling and boasts one of the best villains of Cinema since the birth of Darth Vader. Alfred Molina as Doctor Octopus or as J Jonah Jameson Editor of the Daily Bugle says Doc Ock for short. Molina gives an all-round better performance than dare I say it Heath Ledger as the Joker. Molina lends Doctor Otto Octavius much heart, emotion and gravitas which contribute to a more engaging character and a better developed one. As Octavius accepts his destiny, he falls into a world of crime which he cannot escape from. He is not a villain by choice, but by consequence. Once his science experiment goes out of control his world does too. Losing his wife does not help matters and he so strongly believes in science and his life's work that he is willing to cause the death of millions or even his own.The action scenes work so well because we actually get the sense that Spider-Man is a person in between all of this destruction. These scenes which involve a flurry of CGI wizardry see Spider-Man fling himself towards his opponent, but most importantly they look real. Even the emotional aspect is ramped up. Parker loses his job, comes ever so close to failing his college course and finds out that Mary Jane has a new lover. All of which contribute to Peter Parker losing his powers as Spider-Man in the majority of the second act. But it all makes sense. Parker is not invincible as a Super-hero; he is a real person, with real issues and real problems. All of the other Spider-Man films failed to capture this deep level of emotion and make it have an impact on Parker's life as a whole. We get a deeper knowledge of Peter's infatuation with Mary Jane. He loves her, but by the same token, knows that she will never be safe because of his crime fighting life. It is this struggle that makes this tale of heroism so much more than your average film about good versus evil and far more emotionally complex and involving as a whole.The comedy lends a light hearted feel and tone for the film, it never becomes too serious or too dark, and this is about as far as you can get from 'The Dark Knight Rises' as possible. Furthermore, it relies more on visuals and not the all too obvious humour present in the new Marc Webb films. The score itself is perfection, everything that a Superhero's theme should be and more. Danny Elfman firmly cements himself as a grand composer alongside the likes of John Williams and Howard Shore. In all honesty I could talk about this film for 127 minutes, the runtime of 'Spider-Man 2'. Do you need any more reasons to purchase this film right away? Well let me sum it all up.'Spider-Man 2' is compelling evidence that the best films don't have to be Biopics or Dramas. But films that offer character development, humour, wit, romance, action and pull on your heartstrings. 'Spider- Man 2' is the greatest Spidey flick hands down, by the longest thread of web that Spider-Man can conjure. If 'Spider- Man' is to undergo another reboot then perhaps it is time to reconsider Sam Raimi as the Director and for Tobey Maguire to don the outfit for one last spin.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Spider-Man truly is amazing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When this was commonly hailed as the best comic book movie of all-time back in '04 there was certainly a lot less competition than there is today. But I'm pleased to say that time has been kind to this second entry. It's superior to the first film--itself quite good--in almost every way. In particular it really takes the action to the next level. Both of Spidey's face-offs with Doc Ock are exhilarating and trump anything from Spidey vs. Goblin, which I found to be rather weak. The battle on the El-Train is particularly well done. It also ups the emotional stakes, with the full weight of the "great responsibility" on Peter's shoulders. It's a strong one-two punch that delivers a film that's both fun and substantive. A rare feat no matter what the genre. -</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Peter Parker AKA Spiderman is still struggling with guilt over the death of his Uncle Ben, so much so that it is beginning to affect his super spidey powers (he suffers from what you might call Arachtile Dysfunction). Meanwhile, nuclear fusion scientist Otto Octavius is causing trouble for the City of New York after one of his experiments goes a little wrong, leaving him with his powerful, mechanical, artificially intelligent arms in control of both his brain and body.The second film in Sam Raimi's blockbuster Spiderman trilogy is another hugely entertaining superhero flick, with Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst reprising their roles as Peter Parker/Spiderman and Mary Jane Watson, and director Raimi once again conducting proceedings with bags of style, delivering spectacular action set-pieces and touching emotional drama aplenty.Alfred Molina also makes a great impression as villain Dr. Otto Octavius AKA Doctor Octopus, with Hollywood's best CGI effects wizards lending a hand (or four) in making such a memorable character. Ironically, the only thing that prevents this from being even better than the first film is Raimi's over-reliance on CGI effects, the director repeatedly pushing the action a little too far beyond the realms of believability, even for a superhero film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sequel that matches the original.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPIDER-MAN 2This is the sequel to the successful Sam Raimi movie.The film continues 2 years after the original movie with Peter Parker now living in a flat on his own still protecting the city from the bad guys. His nemesis this time around is Doctor Octopus.It is very rare for a film to be better than the original movie or even be close, but this is easily as good as the original in my opinion. The story is really good and even though Spider-Man has an enemy in Doctor Octopus, this film concentrates a lot on the emotions he is going through and not just about the action. Peter is going through a lot of stress with life as Spider-Man. He is in love with a woman he can't be with, he can't hold a job down, he is failing his studies, his best friend is badgering him to find out who Spider-Man is because he wants revenge for his father and he is riddled with guilt because of the death of his uncle. I like the story in this as it shows that he is human and has emotions and you start to feel actually quite sorry for him as you see that even though being Spider-Man is cool, he is sacrificing a lot for the people.The action and effects are really good and it stays entertaining all the way through the film. There are some comedy moments which breaks up the emotion and it is well timed.The stars of the original movie returned for this. Tobey Maguire was Spider-Man, Kirsten Dunst played MJ and James Franco plays Harry Osbourne. Alfred Molina played Doctor Octopus. Toney did a good job playing a guy who was running out of emotional energy. He really did look like he was struggling with everything. James again did a brilliant job. He looked angry and played the part well. Alfred did a great job as Doctor Octopus. Even though he was the bad guy in the movie, he was also the victim. I felt sorry for his character. The cameos again were great in this? Stan Lee and Bruce Campbell made appearances.There was one scene that I thought was rubbish. During once sequence Spider-Man was seen by a lot of people without his mask. They all tell him that they won't say anything and his identity was kept a secret? I straight away thought this was rubbish. Someone would have spilt the beans for the right price? and let's face it. The Bugle would have paid cash for that story. I enjoyed this a lot and thought it was a great sequel to the original.I will give this film 7 out of 10."I'm back? I'm back! WOOOOOHOOOOOOAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHH!!!! My back! Ouch, my back!"For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl</fullReview>

While Toby maguire was good Spiderman just didn't seem as cool this time round James Franco gave a good performance here as Harry Osbourne Kirsten dunst just didn't click to me.

He also faces a mad scientist, Otto Octavious (Molina) who becomes tentacled maniac, Doc Ock after a failed experiment. Peter's Aunt May (Harris) learns the truth about what happened the night of her husband, Ben's death, Mary Jane Watson (Dunst) is engaged to an astronaut, but still has feelings for Peter and Peter's friend, Harry Osborn (Franco) discovers the truth about him and his father, Norman (Willem Dafoe) who makes an appearance. Simmons also returns and is great as Daily Bugle boss, J. Jonah Jameson. This is a great sequel that's as good as the original and I recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Smashingly good action movie with very good special effects!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My vote: 7.5/10. This film is smashingly good with incredible good special effects. It isn't boring at all. It is a success. The only thing that I found boring is the middle of the film where we don't see spider- man for quite a long time. This is the only trouble but the rest was good! It was pleasant with a lot of BOUM, CRAC, SMASH, BAM that were very strong. The special effects are excellent!!! The casting, very good too! They play very well! It is the best of all the spider-man movies I've seen (the trilogy, I mean). Spider-man is really amazing with his super-power that I like very much. His power is so COOL! I like the way he moves from one building to another with his spider web fingers and the way he uses them for anything possible. This is a great pleasure to see in a super-hero film. The villain, I really like him and he is the best! I love his terrible, disgusting octopus arms and his nasty project!!! My favorite scene was the scene where spider-man fights the villain on the roof of a train. It was so cool and very smash, smash, smash if you know what I mean by there! The super-hero has good qualities and a good thinking about his life. I will add 1 Oscar for best action movements and 1 Oscar for best super-hero costume and another one for best special effects and best power!!! I really enjoyed it! Hope my review interested you because I really love films and writing about them! I am a great fan!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best of the three</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spider-Man 2 beats both its predecessor and its successor, for a number of reasons: One, it doesn't have to deal with origin and set up - Spidey is Spidey right from the start; Two, all the continuity elements work in positive directions. In particular, Peter's relationship with Mary Jane goes from fractured to complete.Three, Alfred Molina's Otto Octavius is the best of the villains featured in the three Sam Raimi movies.So this movie is pretty good. Even so it isn't perfect. Spidey is a little too given towards taking his mask off. One understands that Tobey Maguire needs screen time but, by the time the movie is over, half of New York knows what Spidey's face looks like. And, as in all three films, Spidey doesn't wisecrack. I want Spidey to wisecrack! Please take note, reboot!</fullReview>

It also benefits from a scene-chewing performance from Alfred Molina, as this installment's villain, Doc Oc.However, no improvements were made in the casting of the leads, with dough-faced Tobey Maguire returning as the web slinger and Kirsten Dunst as his vapid muse.This one won the Academy Award for Visual Effects and also found itself nominated for Sound Mixing and Sound Editing.Grade: A-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Spider-man film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an extremely rare instance in a comic book film where everything, and I mean everything is done right! The characters are developed perfectly, the villain is perfect, the story is perfect, etc.Tobey Maguire continues to amaze me with his Peter Parker. We feel so much sympathy for him because of him struggling to be Spider-man on top of holding down 2 jobs, college courses, and keeping in touch with his friends, not to mention his love for Mary Jane, which he has to hide for her protection. The villain is Otto Octavius, who soon becomes Doc Oc after an accident involving sustained fusion, causing four mechanical arms to stick themselves as part of his body.The film manages to keep the conflicts at a settled pace, showing details of all the people in his life, and how they're all affecting his performance as Spider-man, which starts cause him to lose his powers. Even though it feels like a whole lot, the editing makes it feel incredibly smooth so no scenes drag on. The mourning of Uncle Ben, Harry's hate for Spider-man, his relationship with Mary Jane, Aunt May's bank issues is all shown in perfect detail without being overlong or overblown. The action is still really nice, the effects are much better in this one.Honestly, I don't have any complaints, this film pretty much hit everything. The drama, the comedy, and the fantasy is all there. Not only is this the best Spider-man film, but this is my second favorite comic book film of all time. Whether or not you're a comic book fan, I highly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stan Lee's all-too-human superhero returns to the screen in this highly anticipated sequel to 2002's blockbuster hit Spider-Man.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spider-Man 2 is an excellent fusion of action, drama and romance. This is a superhero film with heart. Most importantly, this is a superhero film that can be taken seriously. Set two years after the original, the film focuses on Peter Parker struggling to manage both his personal life and his duties as Spider-Man. The main villain in this film is Dr. Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina), who turns insane following a failed experiment and the death of his wife. Using his mechanical tentacles, Octavius is dubbed "Doctor Octopus" and threatens to endanger the lives of the people of New York City.The film is an improvement over Spider-Man (2002). The first film was good, but the second is excellent. I will even say that it's the best superhero film ever (and yes, I have seen The Dark Knight). Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is going through a tough time. It's clearly shown that being a committed superhero means that he has a lot less time to spend on his other activities. He's a genius, but he isn't doing well at school. He's in love with Mary Jane but he often doesn't have time to see her. "With great power comes great responsibility" his uncle told him. Maguire, this time around, is completely believable as Peter Parker. He's a fully realized protagonist. Many people go through the same problems as him from day to day and that's why people can relate to him. In addition to that Parker shows that he can make an effort and change, thus showing that change is possible no matter who you are. Dr. Octavius also shows that he's capable of change (even though he's the villain). The fights between him and Spidey are amazing. A lot of thought went into every action sequence. The special effects are seamless. There's a good amount of humor, and the dialogue is fitting (in some parts even outstanding). The actors are good in their roles, Rosemary Harris as Aunt May is especially effective in one scene. In addition to all this, Spider-Man 2 is expertly directed by Sam Raimi, so not a single scene feels out of place. There's hardly anything wrong with the entire picture. The only downside is that the film is a fantasy (almost all superhero films are). Spider-Man 2 is a film that can capture the imagination, and unlike some superhero films (The Dark Knight, for example) it's faithful to the comic book. The film features the right photography of New York City, Spidey's web slinging, and peoples' fascination with power and science. The film shows that doing the right thing can be difficult, but that shouldn't stop anyone from doing so.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I base this upon the Special Edition. This is still too bright in the look, and I maintain that the "humor" is almost exclusively on the level of a Saturday morning cartoon, but on the whole, this is superior to the first. The plot is good, and it develops nicely throughout. Octavius is a tad similar to The Green Goblin in some ways, and not completely true to the comic version. He's a positive, however, and the mechanical arms are excellent. The action is dynamic, intense, entertaining and makes marvelous use of the title hero's powers. This is epic and dramatic. It takes away from it the way Raimi keeps trying to add "comedy", at least to those of us that don't find it funny. If you laugh when people get hurt, hey, maybe you'll enjoy it in this, too. The pacing is fairly even. This has well-done FX, if Spidey does continue to not look "real" at any point, and the efforts to make things work with practical effects is definitely a plus. Yes, CGI can solve a lot, just don't forget, using it constantly will desensitize the audience to it, sometimes less is more. The acting tends to be great, and the roles are filled by the right actors. Molina was a perfect choice. The music is well-composed. On the DVD, you will find a a feature-length documentary and several featurettes(the 2.1 release has a handful, as well, and also includes 8 minutes of extra footage that isn't half bad; on the whole, it does feel as though that one was mainly made to remind you to go watch the third one at the theatre) I'm reviewing on their entries here on the site, a couple of Webisodes, a photo gallery, a multi-angle production, a music video, trailers, and, like on the one for the first flick, additional tracks for during the film, the three being a Factoid one and two commentaries, a cast &amp; crew one, and a technical one. There is a little disturbing content in this. I recommend this to fans of the character, even if you disliked the 2002 movie. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best comic book films ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spider-man 2 was the best film of 2004. Director Sam Rami improved his sequel by many things. The first film was kind of boring, but the second film is much more exciting. THe first film didn't have that much of a plot, but this film did. The first film focused on Spider-man and that's it. You couldn't sympathize with the Green Goblin because he's a total psycho. Doc Ock you can sympathize with because he can control what he's doing. Doctor Octopus was the best Spider-man villain in the films yet. You at least got to know a little about him before he turned into a villain and he was a good guy. You also feel sorry for Spider-man. Peter(Tobey Maguire)is still in love with his best friend Mary Jane Watson(Kirsten Dunst). All she wants him to do is come see her perform and he can't because he's always busy. Because he's Spider-man. The second film is one of the best comic book films ever. It may be one of the best ever also. Spider-man 2 really outdoes it's first film, like X2. Unlike films like Batman &amp; Robin, this film is actually serious.It's not far away from being as good as Iron Man or The Dark Knight. If you want to see a fantastic comic book film, then Spider-man 2 is the film for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's two years since the events of the first film and Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is struggling to juggle his commitments to his family, friends and his job whilst trying to fight crime as the friendly neighbourhood Web Slinger.Sam Raimi, back in the directing chair, builds on the successes of the first film to produce a polished, well paced and finely crafted sequel that improves leaps and bounds on its predecessor. One of the major keys to the films success is the villain, Doctor Octopus (a brilliant turn from Alfred Molina). Whereas the Green Goblin plot line came across as under written and nonsensical in the first film, here we have a character who is fully developed, well written and wonderfully executed (no Power Ranger costumes here for Doc Ock) It's a credit to all concerned that they truly make Otto Octavius both sympathetic and frightening at the same time (Ock's "birth" scene is a wonderful homage from Raimi to his own Evil Dead movies) Now that the first movie is out of the way, you get a sense that the filmmakers have been liberated from the shackles an origin tale provides and have allowed that freedom to really let loose with the characters.The film takes its main inspiration from Amazing Spider-Man issue 50 "Spider-Man No More!" as Peter decides to quit being Spider-Man as it's getting in the way of him leading a normal life. Several plot lines are also developed, the most interesting concerning Peter's friend Harry Osborn, an excellent James Franco, whose growing resentment of Spider-Man, who he blames for his fathers death, fuels his desire for revenge.Featuring a captivating storyline, excellent Special FX and edge of the seat action scenes (all the Spidey-Doc Ock fight scenes are sensational with the standout being the subway sequence), this is one of those few sequels that is better than the first film and just gets better the more you watch it. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The action is always simple and direct : save the victims of the bad guy. The method is always the same: stop the bad guy's mechanics by throwing a few strings in its gears. The rest of it is building up a network, in that case a cobweb. But this is a film, not an electronic game and we are at the cinema not in front of a game console. So the film adds a good layer of sentimental events and feelings. The girl friend from far behind. She is afraid and fascinated. She is jealous and possessive. She is maybe adult and open-minded. That kind of stuff gives to the film some interesting dimension. In the same way, in this film in particular, the super hero loses and even chooses to lose his powers, for a while at least. This whole dimension of a normal guy, a normal boy capable of normal feelings and cowardice is exploited here to reveal the other super-hero dimension is both a choice and a responsibility, a responsible choice and a chosen responsibility. Then the film can work as a film and not a dumb computer game. Then the bad guy has a new dimension. He is the self-victimized inventor of a machine that will destroy the world. But keep in mind that the solution to sink that nuclear fusion machine in order to kill it is rather primitive in intellectual value. But it is full of emotional pulpy strength. The fear of nuclear power is also typical of the beginning of this century when the oil companies were still the masters of the energetic game. We have since then entered the final stage of that oil dominance and we have to consider other solutions, particularly that do not produce carbon dioxide. It is also a reflection of a way of thinking in these 2002-2006 years: nuclear energy was only seen from the American point of view as basically criminal either in the hands of criminal individuals (that's the case here) or in the hands of criminal states. Luckily this dimension is aging pretty fast.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines, CEGID</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Epic Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A good superhero movie is a perfect tool to speak about deep philosophy to common people. Forget about Tarkovskij, Bergman and Kieslovsky: this Spiderman2 touches all the chords of human morality and nature. It's all about choice: a normal man have to chose between a superhuman nature and a normal life. This is a perfect representation of the dual nature of Spiderman: the heroic one (imagined by the Objectivist designer Steve Ditko) and the imperfect one (imagined by the Liberal Stan Lee). The superhuman nature allow him to save humanity, but this is a full time mission imply the sacrifice of all the real joys of life: love, friendships, career and culture. The human nature allow all of that, but imply weakness before the Evil. And then the Evil comes, under the guise of a failed scientist who doesn't want to admit his mistake and that is possessed by its own science. He's a good guy? who doesn't want to accept the weakness of a normal life. Fighting the Evil, Spiderman can find a synthesis between the superhuman and the human: it's possible to make love and war in the same time. A good script makes this movie enjoyable for all audiences. It mixes all the ingredients of a very good action movie (full of new spectacular special effects) and a very good comedy. It's good both for Spiderman's fans and for people who never read a comic strip. The cast is really strong, dominated by an existential Tobey McGuire and a brave red Kirsten Dunst, a perfect image of a heroic woman. The timing was perfect: this movie was in theaters in 2004 and America was in a political crossroad. Most probably, Spiderman helped many Americans to make their choice in a period of a morally difficult war. Well done, Sam Raimi!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tobey Maguire's Back, Spinning Another Web</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The "Spider-Man 2" movie is just a shade better than the first - which, in series films, is a cause for tremendous celebration. Happily, producers were able to pay director Sam Raimi and his main cast however many millions of dollars they needed... Also, the first film's "special effects" (however well done) seemed too startlingly change from live action to animation. This is still fairly obvious, but done much more smoothly; and, the "Dr. Octopus" villain costume is a cinematic success. Like they say, "(special effects director John) Frazier is especially effective (along with over a hundred helpers)." Allowing for a comic book aficionado to be a little too critical, it does seem like an extraordinary amount of time is spent on illustrating the "downtrodden" life of "Peter Parker" (which is the main plot, I know, but it's a very large chunk of the movie). And, although Tobey Maguire (as Peter Parker) is wonderful in the role, he and Kirsten Dunst (as Mary Jane Watson) aren't going to be able to convincingly play "Peter" and "M.J." as "teenagers in love" much longer. It will be interesting to see how producers continue this relationship, which seems to be, herein, necessary for "Spider-Man" to remain fully powerful.Alfred Molina (as Otto Octavius) rises to the challenge of playing the "visual effects"-enhanced villain role. Handsome "best friend" James Franco (as Harry Osborn) returns, to hint at becoming the new "Green Goblin"; as in the first film, the actor doesn't seem to be used to his potential (although, it looks like he will get a chance to put on a costume in the next film). My "No-Prize Awards" winners include: Elyse Dinh for playing the "friendly neighborhood Spider-Man" theme song, Rosemary Harris for being "Aunt May", Hal Sparks for being so funny, and Stan Lee for believing in Super-Heroes.******** Spider-Man 2 (2004) Sam Raimi ~ Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, Alfred Molina</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Even better than the first!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spider-man 2 is one of those rare sequels that is just as good, if not better than its predecessor. The continuing story of Peter Parker is one chock full of action, comedy, romance, and drama. Just like its predecessor, what truly makes this film shine is its genuine heart. This film has a ton of heart and by the end of the film when Peter and M.J. finally kiss, you can't help but feel your heart lift. As cheesy as that sounds its true. Though, not only is Spider-man 2 a very heartfelt film, but it also has terrific action. The action sequences are scripted to perfection. The reasons for the film's success lie in many areas, first because of the acting. All actors are terrific. This is Kirsten Dunst's best performance as Mary Jane, and Tobey Maguire is still the fanboy's dream version of Peter Parker. Though the greatest element of Spider-man 2's success is its director, Sam Raimi. It is clearly obvious that Raimi has a lot of love and respect for this character, only a true fan such as this could coax out the most magnificent portions of this world and its characters.Overall Spider-man 2 is easily one of the best sequels of all-time. With an even more awesome villain than in the first in Doc Ock, and with even more heart than Spidey's previous outing, Spider-man 2 is a true winner.I give Spider-man 2 a perfect 10 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Highly entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember when this movie came out it was a second most expensive movie after Titanic (I don't know, maybe it still is). I have too say every cent was worth it. After this movie, many similar superhero movies were made, containing similar action sequences, but still, I don't think that any of them succeed to overcome this one. The whole movie was very entertaining, though there was some cheesy dialogs between Peter and Mary Jane (as I noticed, she cause more troubles than any of Spider-Man's enemies), but still it was just a break before another heart-stopping action sequence. Alfred Molina did great as Dr. Otto Octavius, he was very suitable for that role.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I gave the first one a 10 out of 10, this one is even better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It would be way too predictable for me to use an exaggeration here like, "since this is better than the first, and I gave the first one a 10 out of 10, then I'm giving part 2 a 15 out of 10!!" I won't quite say that. There's only one movie that deserves such an outrageous claim of actually scoring OUTSIDE the scale of numbers allotted for the rating, and that's Back to the Future part 1. Sorry, I got a off on a tangent, Spike Lee style. Back to Spider-Man 2.This truly outdoes the first movie in terms of scale. And I guess that's how it works, you tell the origin story, after that you're free to explore different themes in that universe you've created. I don't like to use this word to describe a lot of things, but truly only one word describes this movie: epic.There's a single driving force in this movie that instantly gets you worrying, and hoping for a good outcome: Peter Parker's tragic downfall, or to be more specific, him hitting ROCK BOTTOM with Mary Jane. He literally lost it all here at one point in this movie. I mean it doesn't get anymore serious than being told "Oh, I'm getting married.." As if that weren't enough, he couldn't even be in her life as a friend because of his constant disappointments he caused her because of his responsibilities as Spider-Man. Add to that his stressful friendship with Harry, his identity crisis, and you've got a pretty complex story, superhero action movie or not.**You feel the full spectrum of emotions in this movie. Or at the very least, you feel the maximum emotion at one part of the spectrum, sympathy. I've said it already and I'll say it again, Peter Parker's crumbling relationship with Mary Jane was executed perfectly. There's two scenes that captures this feeling of desperation perfectly:1) At that dinner party thing they were at, Peter gets hit with a 3 part combo: A) his friendship with Harry takes a further dive after being slapped by him twice, B) his friendship with Mary Jane takes a further dive after being told by her while they were outside on the balcony that she pretty much doesn't want anything to do with him anymore, in so many words, and finally, not too long after, C) gets hit with the ultimate crushing blow as he hears the announcement that Mary Jane officially agreed to marry her boyfriend. I think anyone can imagine how embarrassed, humiliated, and heartbroken Peter must've felt standing there, as his world slowed down to a dreamlike state, vaguely hearing J. Jonah Jameson shouting to him to snap a picture of none other than Mary Jane and her new fianc.2) After falling to the ground after his webs failed him again, he picks up that newspaper and sees how he's hated by the city and gets no appreciation, with the scene then cutting to him sitting on his bed, tossing that paper away in disgust. It's at this point that we're on the edge of our seats, just wondering what he's gonna do next. His life was a complete tragedy.**Amazing, lengthy action sequences.**A sympathetic villain, much better than Green Goblin.**It takes a certain expert hand to be able to have lines spoken by one character (Aunt May), then have those very same lines repeated by another character (Peter) to another character (Doc Ock), which is what finally gets that other character to see the error of his ways, all without seeming forced or convenient. There's certain elements of the plot that do seem convenient, but it's never contrived or forced. It's like a complex tapestry that all fits together and makes sense somehow.**If I had it my way, I'd change the ending. I think it would've struck a better emotional chord had they ended it with the scene of Mary Jane hugging her fianc, after being dropped off by Spider-Man, as she sadly looks up to her love that would never be, as he then shoots out a web and flys off into the night. It would've been a great place to end, the music was PERFECT right at that instant she looked up into the sky at him, with that bright light illuminating her face. This angelic, melodic tone or music, whatever that was that played. Either end it there and move the scene with Harry and his father up BEFORE this scene (because you can't skip the Harry scene no matter how you end it), OR, end right after the Harry scene, after discovering all the Green Goblin equipment. Have that whole cancelled wedding and running scene be the START of part 3 (obviously it's too late for that). I guess the argument for keeping it the way it was shot is the fact that you then wouldn't have the shot of Mary Jane in Peter's window, looking out with a look that you can't quite tell if it's happiness or fear, in regards to her new life.</fullReview>

Unfortunately, they can never outshine the scenes of their predecessor, so I shave a few points off for that.In the end, I think this movie alone can teach all of us about the lost concept of self-sacrifice and at the same time, give us all an excellent movie-watching experience.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The dread franchise film has killed off many a potentially interesting character (Superman, Batman, Ripley, Rocky) &amp; given leases of life to characters that are paper-thin (Indy Jones, Jason Voorhees, Catwoman). The latest franchise film is Spider-Man 2, directed by Sam Raimi. The 1st Spider-Man was probably the best comic book film ever made- mostly because its leads- Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker/Spider-Man, &amp; Kirsten Dunst as his love- Mary Jane Watson a) can both act (unlike, say Christopher Reeve as Superman), b) are well cast (unlike Michael Keaton in the 1st 2 Batman films). &amp; c) have chemistry (unlike Reeve &amp; Margot Kidder in the Superman films). Maguire, especially, is so good an actor that he is 1 of those rarities that can run a panoply of emotions through just his eyes. He is almost irresistible to watch on screen?. All in all, a very good film, &amp; along with the 1st film, simply the best superhero films ever made. I hope the writers from this film stick with the whole series because, next to Batman, Spidey probably has the best pantheon of villains in comic book lore. Future baddies could include Dr. Doom, Venom, Carnage, the Sandman, Rhino, the Lizard, &amp; Electro, among others. But, what makes good writing in such a film valuable are the little moments- like Peter's confession to Aunt May about how &amp; why Uncle Ben really died, a surreal moment on an elevator between Spidey &amp; a shocked citizen, references to other characters in the Marvel Comics universe, allusions &amp; parallels to Oscar Wilde's The Important Of Being Earnest, &amp; a street musician singing the old Spider-Man TV cartoon series theme song from the 1960s. Such touches are what invigorate this franchise above the others &amp; what killed off the increasingly dark &amp; directionless Batman franchise. Sam Raimi proves he is a director who knows how to milk a proved commodity without imposing his own distorted 'vision' on it- unlike Batman director Tim Burton.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best movies ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPIDER-MAN 2 is one of the best movies ever, in my opinion--lots of heart, great characters, great writing, great action, great moral to the story, great performances and special effects! So I am a little disappointed with this 2007 DVD release of the 2.1 version. This review is for the 2.1 DVD version of SPIDER-MAN 2. It is INFERIOR to the original DVD/theaterical version because the 8 minutes of new footage often REPLACES original scenes, (not just adds new footage), and the replaced footage is always best the original way! The new footage rates okay to great, as long as it does not replace any original scenes, in my opinion. So this 2.1 version of SPIDER-MAN 2 is interesting, if you really know the original version, then you can try to catch what is different. Sometimes it is just an added line of dialogue, sometimes it is a complete scene. This is all good until they start pulling out the original scenes choices and replace it with this "new" footage. The original scenes were better. I think they also monkeyed with the timing of many scenes, which now feel too rushed. The best stuff on this 2.1 DVD is the ADDED stuff (not the REPLACEMENT stuff). You get a scene with MJ talking with her friend about marrying the astronaut, and the perfect kiss from her fantasy man (as seen in SPIDER-MAN 1, and referenced again in SPIDER-MAN 3). There is a brief scene when J. Jonah Jameson puts on the found Spider-man costume and pretends in his office. There are 11 extra seconds of the Doc Ock fight with Aunt May at stake, where Spidey and Doc Ock break through a window and pound on each other while a woman watches in fear. There are also many more brief additions of minor dialogue and brief footage. My favorite is when they first show Peter Parker hanging his tired head in his dumpy apartment. In the original version the scene stops there--depressing surroundings, but in the 2.1 version, they briefly end the scene with Peter reaching to turn on his police scanner radio, to monitor for some criminal action for Spidey to get busy with! This changes the tone of the scene immensely, in that being Spider-man is saving him from the dreariness! I like the added police scanner shot, and it also appears again, more often, in SPIDER-MAN 3! Cool! A strange piece of dialogue added is when MJ and Peter are talking in Aunt May's backyard, and MJ says she is seeing someone now. In the original, Peter asks if it is like a boyfriend, but in the 2.1 version, first he asks if it is therapy, then he asks if it is a boyfriend. This is cool because you get more without losing the original, though it is a strange comment! Sometimes things seem rushed and the timing is off, or small, little things are replaced. A major scene that ANYBODY will recognize as being completely REPLACED (and not as good as the original) is the scene on the elevator, when Spider-man meets the guy walking his dog. This is a completely different conversation, more dumb than funny, and you completely lose the original conversation which actually was funny. The Director's Commentary is with producer Laura Ziskin and writer Alvin Sargent. (NOTE: Kirsten Dunst in NOT included in the Director's Commentary, though some information online says she is). This Director's Commentary is pretty interesting, with some fun trivia and insight into the writing and production, despite the absence of the actual director and any actor from the film. The bonus disk is okay. Not too long, not too short. If you like Making Of documentary stuff, then here is about an hour's worth. If you have never seen SPIDER-MAN 2, then get the original version on DVD before getting this 2.1 version! But, if you already own and love the original version, then get this 2.1 version and watch it with a friend, and have fun pointing out and finding the new stuff.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This fine piece of cinema is sandwiched between two inconsistent films, those being Spiderman, and Spiderman 3. The first lacked a truly frightening and threatening Villain. The Comics displayed a more solid vision of the Goblin. But that said the film saved itself by showing Peter's dealings with becoming Spiderman, while attempting to keep a sane life. The Third tried to be bigger than it could, and it fell flat on it's face.This Film shines strongly, Spiderman starts this film off with him being in control, an established Superhero. Peter seems to be doing just fine in life, but his powers soon slip, something is causing him to loose them. To make the problem worse Doctor Octopus is raging havoc. The Doc challenges Spidey on all fronts (moral, physical, emotional, and personal) The way a bad guy should challenge the hero. The action is great, better than most superhero films actually.All and all this movie is what Comic book movies are supposed to be. The best of the Spiderman bunch.</fullReview>

I think it did have everything that that kinda movie needs. Good actors, good story, good special effects. There were only a couple of problems with it. I thought that it didn't flow on from the first very well, because I thought that MJ had figured out that Peter was spider-man at the end of the first, because of their kiss, but then suddenly in the second she has no clue. Also I think Harry was used way to less. He's in important scenes, but his character disappears for the whole middle of the movie. Other than that I really liked this movie, it was very entertaining, but I did enjoy the first and third more.</fullReview>

Bush's mongoloid church administration - the second law being that you can't get more energy out of a system than you put into it).Of course, everything goes to hell with big explosions and "Doc Ock" natchelly ends up a supervillain - with four steel-belted, evil arms fused to his inner Manson.And Spidey must save the day.But Spiderman/Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire), perpetually mooning over Mary-Jane (Kirsten Dunst's Breasts), experiences a psychosomatic loss of powers and renounces his web-slinging in favor of the geek life. Thus - Spiderman No More.It is only when Doc Ock threatens his breasty bimbo that he realizes he must reconcile his inner freak with his outer geek.Overall, Spiderman 2 sells its product, but falls down in niggly details: Peter loses his job as a pizza delivery guy because he couldn't make good on a "29 Minute Guarantee" - but what kind of insane, coke-addled pizza parlor would make that kind of guarantee over a 42-block radius in the heart of New York City?; Doc Ock robs banks to buy the components for his evil machine - but why not grab a supervillain nut (whilst cutting out the middle man) and simply STEAL the parts? Visual clichs to grind your teeth by: Peter at a high-class soiree, having every last hors d'oeuvre picked out from under him (it worked for Peter Sellers); bride running through streets in slomo (it worked for Julia Roberts); shot of Spiderman costume hanging decoratively out of a trashcan (worked as a comicbook cover - lame as a live action); there is even a grandiose "Noooooo!" scene with Doc Ock - this movie has everything! And can we stop with the screaming? That convention of B-Movie Screaming Damsel is now officially getting on my nerves. From hospital nurses to hot chicks, from Mary-Jane to Aunt May - every woman in Spiderman 2 screams exactly the same way; whether a flat-bellied model or Peter's septuagenarian aunt, they all somehow capture that identical frequency of high-pitched, nerve-fraying, cochlear irritation. And frankly, I'm sick of it! Who screams that way in real life? If I were to become a superhero by some freakish radioactive ferret bite to the buttocks, and I had to save some supermodel damsel in distress, I'd insist she cease that confounded insensate shrieking if she valued her taut, Body-by-Jake ass.And Spiderman takes his mask off too much. Why? Because he can't emote through the fabric. When his powers fail, it is more effective to pull off the mask and look dumbfounded than let the mask tilt its head and say, "Huh?" And how much more effective to stop a train, mask-less, straining with neck-bulging effort, rather than letting his round-headed alter-ego smoothly halt it? That astounding train sequence. The thought and detail that went into that scene rivals that of any movie ever made - so many minute details all working together to create a breath-stopping experience - and plausible, in that world where these super beings live. As just one example of those thousands of details - when Spiderman smashes out through the train windows sideways, he shoots his web with both hands back at the body of the train and pulls himself back onto the side of the moving train.Unlike the Batman movies, we always see Spiderman CLEARLY - especially in the elevator (riding with Queer as Folk's Hal Sparks, a real life comics aficionado in a riotous cameo).Spiderman's theme - that horn line, which always makes me stifle a tear - is epic in its sweeping poignancy, tastefully regal, a superhero's theme. And the web-swinging tears the breath from your lungs with its breakneck daredevilry.Peter reveals his identity to Mary-Jane in the most auspicious of heroic deeds - he holds up a building that is about to topple on her. Isn't it every schoolboy's fantasy to meet a girl that way? And I love that his head is the exact, correct roundness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than the first.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spider-Man 2 is set about two years after the events of the original where Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) now lives in New York City &amp; is having all sorts of problems, he has no money, the fact he is Spider-Man is destroying his relationship with both his childhood love Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) &amp; his best friend Harry Osborn (James Franco) &amp; his schoolwork is suffering. Parker decides to leave Spider-Man behind &amp; just live his life, while researching a college project about scientist Dr. Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina) Parker is invited to a demonstration of Octavius' new fusion based energy source but the demonstration goes wrong. The four mechanical arms attached to Octavious designed to help him work malfunction &amp; take control of his mind turning him into a crazed madman intent on finishing his dangerous experiments even if means the destruction of New York, that is unless Spider-Man can stop him...Directed by Sam Raimi this was the sequel to the blockbusting live action Spider-Man (2002) that went into production before the original even opened to such impressive box-office numbers, on a personal level I actually slightly prefer Spider-Man 2 to the original. The script by Alvin Sargent based on the popular Marvel comic book character is a continuation of many plot lines from the original, Peter's relationship with Mary Jane &amp; Harry, his feelings of guilt over his uncle's death, his superpowers ruining his normal life &amp; his coming to terms with his powers. In fact almost the entire first hour &amp; a half feels like a soap opera with the film firmly focused on Peter Parker's various problems &amp; dramas, the character of Doc Ock is relegated to a minor role for the majority of the film which is my biggest gripe with Spider-Man 2 really. I mean I don't want to watch a film such as Spider-Man 2 &amp; find myself looking at a bland soap opera, I want special effects, I want spectacular action set-pieces &amp; I want cool imaginative villains. Like many recent films there are at least a couple of different versions available, the original theatrical &amp; DVD cut, the Spider-Man 2.1 extended cut &amp; maybe even another different TV version, I really hate this practise of putting multiple versions out by big studios. The standard theatrical cut runs for a little over two hours &amp; despite some truly outstanding action sequences I felt overall it was rather uneventful &amp; I just ended up sitting there during the soap opera type moments waiting for Doc Ock to show up again.Director Raimi does a fine job here &amp; there are some amazing set-piece action scenes, the fight Spider-Man &amp; Doc Ock have on the speeding train in particular is spectacular. Apparently the CGI computer effects budget was $54 million &amp; most of the CGI is outstanding &amp; as good as anything out there, from dizzy shots of Spider-Man swinging through the streets of New York to Doc Ock's tentacles who all have individual personalities &amp; another amazing scene when Spider-Man &amp; Doc Ock have a fight on the side of a building. I have to say Doc Ock is maybe my favourite Spider-Man villain, I used to watch the old 60's cartoon series, &amp; I'm a bit disappointed with him here. I not disappointed in how he looks, with a combination of CGI &amp; puppet effects the character looks amazing with some great shots of him walking &amp; climbing using his tentacles but he just wasn't evil enough for me, his whole plan was to carry on with his fusion energy source machine &amp; nothing else. He didn't want to take over the world, he didn't want any money, he didn't even want to hurt anyone &amp; his motives just seemed weak &amp; uninteresting. Also, if the tentacles took over his mind &amp; were partly controlling him what did they want? What difference to them would it have made if he had finished his fusion machine? One more thing, I understand that the tentacles were strong but surely Doctor Octavius was still a normal human being, while the tentacles could have survived falling 1000's of feet from a skyscraper onto a moving train why did Doctor Octavius as a normal human being survive? As I said I thought he was still human, there was nothing in the film to indicate he suddenly became invincible, was there? I know it's a comic book superhero film but it still needs to be based in some sort of reality for it to work.With a supposed budget of about $200,000,000 this was the most expensive film ever made at the time along with Titanic (1997), this definitely has that big budget Hollywood look &amp; feel &amp; has exceptional special effects &amp; is very well made. The original score by Danny Elfman was replaced by one from Christopher Young at the last minute who composed the music for Hellraiser (1987), if you listen the first time Doctor Octavius walks towards the fusion device during the demonstration &amp; while he is working on it the music is exactly the same as in Hellraiser! Set in New York but filmed in both New York &amp; Los Angeles. The acting is fine, J.K. Simmons as Parker's boss J. Johna Jameson puts in another funny performance while Molina is pretty good as Doc Ock &amp; Willem Defoe makes a small cameo at the end.Spider-Man 2, or the 2.1 extended cut, is a good solid comic book superhero film that wastes a great villain in Doc Ock &amp; only has some spectacular action set-piece sequences going for it. The dull drama about Peter Parker's personal life drags it down to slightly above average, good but not great. Followed by Spider-Man 3 (2007) &amp; Spider-Man 4 (2009).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow. Its not very often that a sequel betters its predecessor, much less by such a degree. Spider-Man 2 has set a new standard for superhero films on so many levels, thanks largely in part to the vision of the brilliant Sam Raimi. The story takes place two years after the first, where Peter Parker learns of his new responsibility as the web-slinging Spider-Man. However, he is struggling with just about everything, from homework to girl-problems; like any ordinary teenager would. And there's also a new adversary in Doc Ock that his alter-ego has to deal with.Raimi was certainly aware of the elements in the first movie that made it such an enjoyable ride, because they're all still here. This time, he showed an even more human side of the web-head; by having Peter giving up on his responsibilities as Spider-Man. The characters were well developed, ranging from Peter and MJ's on-off relationship to Harry Osborn's hatred for Spidey. Even Aunt May's financial problems and relationship with Peter was compelling. The fight sequences were nothing less that breathtaking. Spidey's fights with the tentacled Doc Ock, especially the ones in mid-air, were beautifully choreographed and, despite taking place so quickly, had a fair amount of clarity. Every move could be so observed in such detail and seemed to have a purpose. Take notes, Michael Bay.In the end, although being a big-budget summer blockbuster movie, Spider-Man 2 tries not to be anything but itself - a boy's journey of being a hero. And its that sincerity that makes it stand out so much. Easily the best action movie of 2004.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best superhero movie ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spider-man 2 is a practically flawless movie, and it is also the film fans of the comic book have been praying for. The franchise got off to a wonderful start with "spider-man" and made a whole load of money and was a really worth comic book adapt. But compared to this its incy-wincy spider! Peter Parker can't seem to catch any kind of break. Being Spiderman has brought him nothing but problems as far as his personal life is concerned. Not only that, Mary Jane Watson is engaged to astronaut John Jameson, and Peter may lose her forever. Things are so bad for him that he is pushed past his breaking point, so he decides that he doesn't want to be Spiderman anymore, until a freak accident transforms Dr. Otto Octavius into Dr. Octopus, a super-villain with four metal tentacles coming out of him. Peter realises that only Spiderman can stop him, but of course, problems arise. Mary Jane gets caught in the middle, and Harry Osborn, who still blames Spiderman for the death of his father, Norman Osborn, also the Green Goblin, wants him dead. Spiderman will have to push himself past his limits if he's going to survive. Dr Octopus is still the greatest marvel bad guy brought to the big screen yet and him and spidey bring some of the biggest fight scenes to the big screen (watch out for the train sequence). The actors Tobey Maguire (The Good German) and Kirsten Dunst (Marie Antoinette) give wonderful performance each of which are believable. The romance is deep and dramatic! Is there anything wrong with this movie. Its a bit long, and a lot of that is unnecessary. I guess about 20 minuets could of been lost.A fans dream but also a wonderful treat for causal viewers, its a film you will want to watch over and over again. The greatest superhero movie to date. Its a shame about Spider-man 3 mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exceptional Super-Sequel Crimefighting Superhero Adventure Love-Story Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Peter Parker is having trouble reconciling his aspirations with his alter-ego role as crime-busting superhero Spiderman. Meanwhile, an experiment in fusion-generated power by Dr Otto Octavius goes horribly wrong, warping him into the villainous eight-limbed Dr Octopus. Can Spiderman shake off his malaise and tackle this new threat ?This sequel to the smash hit Spider-Man is another tremendous adventure, which for me is arguably even better than the original. Raimi expertly balances his eye-popping action scenes with tender drama and focuses in on his hero's inner conflict. Can Peter escape his destiny ? Does he want to ? What are the consequences if he does ? By accentuating Peter's human frailties, particularly through goofy moments (a troublesome broom-closet, problems getting hors d'oeuvres at a classy party, the lovably nutty Raindrops Keep Fallin' On My Head sequence), it makes his heroism and self-sacrifice all the more exciting and admirable. And Doc Ock is a fantastic villain like no other, stomping around the city, tossing cars about, scrambling over and around buildings - there's a fight/chase scene between the two on an elevated railway which is an eye-popping highlight. If the movie has a weak point it's the Mary Jane and Harry characters, Peter's friends, whom we relate to him through, but who slow up the narrative a bit too much, particularly since the film is filled with great kooky supporting characters - Simmons (who is perfect) as the cigar-chewing editor J. Jonah Jameson, Banks and Tovah as nice girls who bat their eyes at Peter, Raimi's old pal Campbell as an amusingly officious usher, and his brother Ted as Jonah's yes-man. Danny Elfman's terrific score is crucial to the flow of the picture, racing triumphantly as Spidey glides through the streets, and subtly charming us through all the tender and tragic moments. And as with the previous picture, John Dykstra's visual effects and Neil Spisak's production design are top-notch. Perhaps this movie could use a little trimming (say, Aunt May's eviction subplot), but it's a wonderfully honest, open-hearted film - it goes for broke in making its superhero human and its drama universal, and explores its theme - our instinctive need for heroes to look up to - with wit and eloquence. A great blockbuster action adventure from a truly great director.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How could this movie suck more??</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I totally don't understand why this movie was called a click!I felt that doc oc was a lame villain in the movie, considering he had no genetic power of any sort. there was too much science in the movie that doesn't really go with the original comic book. I feel that it is a good thing that spiderman 3 came and rescued the trilogy (for me).to tell you the truth, I had very low expectations with the spiderman 3 because of the crappiness of the second one, but as it turns out, I liked the third one. they say that the third didn't have any character dev, but I think that the villain in this movie was too well dev that left me bored. the audience knew the villain too well that didn't leave us curious unlike the spiderman 3. a good example of this is venom with the bell thing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>That might not be what I/you want, that's however what you get here. And although the drama part works better here, than in the third part of Spider Man, it still feels as if it were too much, especially after repeat viewing.The drama part still works (as I wrote above) though and that is a testament to the actors. They have to convince in some partly dodgy dialogue! The action scenes are filmed well enough (nothing surprising here) and the end will leave you yearning for the third part (which is out now, in Cinemas if you didn't notice! ;o) Although who knows you might read this, after it hits the DVD shelves).The running time isn't the only thing I didn't like (the extended version feels even more long drawn-out, especially the elevator scene shouldn't have made the extended cut, it just isn't funny, but I liked the office scene with the Spider Man costume, you know which, when you see the movie). There were too many "revealing" moments, that wouldn't work like that, not only in reality, but also in the film reality we are drawn into here! If you've seen the first one, you'll see this one too, I encourage you to do that, and then you will make up your own mind, about the great themes in here, but also about other things! :o)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Emulates success of original too closely to feel authentic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Using the successful template which guided part 1 to a tee, Sam Raimi again duplicated his blockbuster hit with even more box office bite, but in the process lost something along the way. There are no obvious downgrades from the previous installment, a fun, enduring origin piece that instantly sat well with so many outside the comic book norm. All key elements which became dependable in the franchise are present and multiplied: fluid action, romantic tension, and meaningful metaphors on the man behind the mask. Even though there is clearly an intended purpose to probe Parker's dualistic struggle, sermonizing his morality to an uncomfortable measure via a few extra corny interactions does not help a plot that parallels way too much from it's predecessor in the first place. This overdone approach will lend well to all intense sequencing but does somehow trample over the unique pleasure that was the first rather then totally compliment.Essentially, Spider-Man 2 is a glorified teaser for the impending trilogy, using much of it's time to simply set up a bigger showdown that is yet to come. Whereas the original offered an exciting, fun, and fresh update to the comic book superhero in and of itself, one can definitely sense the stench of sequelitis begin crawling in this time around. The primary cast begins to settle into their respective roles, perhaps a little too comfortably, while Raimi struggled to fill the movie with an admirable foe. Alfred Molina is a fine actor who wears his four robotic arm well as rogue scientist Doc Ock, but too many similarities between Dafoe's Green Goblin render this conflict predictable. James Franco, who remains a pivotal character to the series, simply does not bring any humanity to the role of Harry Osborn either, replacing any ongoing tension the sequel wishes to set up with a sourly frown to drive his character instead.The fans ate this one up, and it is easy to see why. All the action scenes are finely tuned and exhibit a sharper eye then the original could ever attempt. Spider-Man's webbing around New York City is still the selling point, and the CGI animators do everything in their power to justify a second indulgence with some fascinating fights, particularly when filmed at high speeds against an aesthetically adventurous Doc Ock. A certain dedication to examining Peter Parker as he struggles to reconcile with his alter-ego was also another reason fans held this one on a pedestal. But honestly, as much as the script may try to diverge into psychological subtext while offering insanely choreographed action, the impact still ended up feeling like an amped-up repeat of what made the first one so engaging.</fullReview>

Spider-Man 2 was awesome in every way possible. Instead of it just being about Spider-Man you got to explore more of Peter Parker and his life. We got to see what happens to M.J and Peter if they still are friends and how close they are. M.J. finds out whom peter really is. Which is great since in most Super Hero movies the girl never finds out. I loved Doc Ock. Doc Ock Challenges Spider-Man instead of just tossing bombs at him. Although Goblin is one of my favorite villains, Doc Ock is awesome. Also the Spider-Man 2.1 is great to. This movie was perfect. The first one was great. But this one was even better.

		<fullReview>I'll admit, when I went to see Spider-man 2 I was hoping for another X-men 2, but expecting another horrible sequel. I could not have been more wrong. Spider-man 2 outdid the first movie in every way possible. Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst both played their parts better than the first movie. Alfred Molina proved to be the perfect villain as Dock Ock outdoing even Willem Defoe's brilliant performance in Spider-man. This movie even makes you think. it's not just mindless action. You end up actually caring when Dock Ock "repents" but has to die to save the city. Peter's choices are portrayed excellently. "Sometimes, in order to do what's right, we have to give up what we want the most," is one line describing Peter's grapple with being Spiderman, or simply being Peter Parker. An overall fantastic, gripping movie. Tip of the hat to Sam Raimi for making an excellent superhero movie you can see again and again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a huge Spidey fan and of course saw it the day it came out, I just signed up to have an IMDb account so now I'm commenting. But enough about me let's get to the movie review shall we! SPOILER WARNING! I really, really, really enjoyed the movie. The plot was strong, great, fun, fast pace in certain parts, and is able to be continued on to Spiderman 3 for more stories to tell. The seven big steps to making agreat movie: 1.The action is great not too short plus it's exciting,intense, and it keeps the audience on for the ride the whole time. 2. The romance was perfect; Peter sees what he thinks he can't have, Mary Jane, because of his responsibility. Even when he quits being Spiderman he realizes it's who he has to be. 3. The CGI is great though some times it seems obvious it's great and much better than the CGI in the first movie. 4. Great casting is very important and trust me this movie has it. Tobey Maguire did great and I have to say it's one of his greatest performances. Kirsten Dunst did very well as Peter's love interest and James Franco was able to pull off the alcoholic act perfectly. Rosemary Harris and J.K. Simmons fit their roles and last but certainly not least Alfred Molina played Doc Ock better than anyone else could have. 5. The script is great and fulfilling especially knowing Peter and MJ are together in the end and that Harry knows Peter's Spiderman. 6. The character of Spiderman is great. He goes way back to people's childhoods and not only is his character's feelings real but you can kind of relate to him. 7. Sam Raimi is a great director and this is definitely his best film yet! Enough of me talking. This movie should definitely be bought since it's not in theaters anymore. You should also check out the Director's cut with additional features.I give Spiderman 2 a 10 out of 10 for all Seven Steps!</fullReview>

Just like the Adam West Batman series.This movie is totally different from those cheesy, campy Hero flicks.This movie mixes a brilliant story that is fun to follow, action scenes that aren't always occurring just because their there. Fight scenes should have a good reason for starting, instead of just coming from nowhere.The characters have a deep emotional feel to them and feel like they are a main part on the story.I believe that this is the best superhero movie around and is a must-see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The First One Great, But Part 2 Was Far More Better!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the first "Spider-Man" movie opening weekend in 2002, and I thought it was great. Tobey Maguire was exceptional, Willem Dafoe was top-notch evil as the Green Goblin, Kirsten Dunst was bright as Mary Jane, and J.K. Simmons pulled off a perfect job as J.Jonah Jameson. I prayed that that "Spider-Man 2" would be even better. My prayers were answered. But the sequel, released in 2004, wasn't just better. It was far more better that I ever dreamed. Once again, Tobey Maguire was exceptional and so was the rest of the cast. But what stole the show was Alfred Molina's portrayal of Dr. Octopus. He was terrific. I loved him. He went from a kind scientist to a madman, yet still I felt there was something good still in him. The special effects were dazzling, the romance hit high notes with me. Everything about this movie from start to finish was superb. I found this a flawless piece of movie magic. It was better than any other comic book movie I have ever seen, past, present, or future. Oh, J.K. Simmons did it again as J. Jonah Jameson, only he had more character time in this sequel, and it paid off. He was so outrageously funny in "Spider-Man 2" I thought I was going to have heart failure laughing at his attitude towards Peter Parker. Believe me, this is the best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow. Well, I've been a Spidey fan since I was about three years old. I even still have photos of me in my Spidey t-shirt. Obviously I loved Spiderman 1 &amp; 2, and for the very reason that the people here who gave it low marks did. Spiderman was the first comic to really give an average joe the ability to have superpowers; just about every superhero/heroine before him were wealthy adventurers who did it for no other reason than they were bored. Yes, some had the whole truth, justice, and morality thing, and some only wanted revenge, but it wasn't anything dramatic. So that's what makes the Spiderman mythos so engaging; he has to juggle school, work, bills, taking care of his aunt, a social life, and enduring the hardships of unrequited love WHILE STILL using his amazing powers to do good in the world. And not only is his obligation to himself and the good of the world, but to honor his deceased uncle who taught him the very thing that sums up his dilemma; with great power comes great responsibility. So if you found this movie boring, over-dramatic, etc., well obviously you didn't understand the source material to begin with. Sure, it is no fault of your own, but do not criticize something that you truly do not understand. The filmmakers made concessions to keep both hardcore Spidey fans happy, but to also attract and not confuse the casual moviegoer who might not know Spidey lore, and they delivered, in the eyes of THIS TRUE fan, on both fronts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spider-Man 2... not as well as I expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The very first Spider-Man was great. Awesome CG along with a great storyline. Spider-Man 2 on the other hand was very depressing in the beginning. Actually it was depressing thru over 3/4 of the movie with Peter always failing at everything he attempted. I was almost ready just to turn off the movie until things changed near the end. Whom ever came up with the idea of him being exposed in the train scene to the public and then to his best friend and girlfriend just ruined the movie. It was a terrible last minute bring it all together in the last 10 minutes of the movie solution. The writers were not very creative in the script and could have done much better. In conclusion... I would rent this before purchasing it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, Until the End</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just saw this movie for the first time after reading all these glowing reviews. I'll agree, I like how they developed the characters a little more. After all, it's hard to write a good story if you don't know the characters, because it's hard to have a good story if you don't care about the characters. And it's hard to care about the characters if you don't know what makes them tick, what motivates them, etc. In that, they did an excellent job and it made for a good story. Because you know the characters better, you care about what happens to them, and it keeps your interest.Now, for the bad news. Towards the end of the movie, they indulged in stupid story writing and turned Spiderman into Dumbassman. Why in the name of all that is good and holy did they have him take off his mask while he was trying to stop the train? Was it because he couldn't see? If that's the case, why is he wearing the damn mask in the first place? That's right up there with the hockey game from hell in the BATMAN AND ROBIN movie as being the dumbest action scene ever written. Also, Doc Oc looked kind of weird rolling around like a bowling ball on top of the train every time Spidey hit him, but I guess that's just the nature of the material they were working with. And then, when the fight is over, this kid hands Peter the mask and says, "We won't tell anybody." Right, kid. A whole train full of people are looking down at his exposed face. How well will they be able to keep the secret? Now everybody in New York City knows who Spiderman is. As of this writing, another sequel is due out in about a month. How will he survive? Move to Chicago or something? This scene ruined what was otherwise a good movie, but not enough to make it awful. Also, both movies are disappointing in two ways: (1) I miss the wisecracks Spidey made in the comics while he's beating the crap out of the bad guys. (2) I would like to have seen the conflict between MJ and her father developed a little more and come to some kind of resolution. Otherwise, I've seen better, but I've also seen worse. 7 out of 10. (I feel generous today.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Take out the sap-fest between Peter and Mary Jane and we're good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spidey 2 was bittersweet. Spiderman had a new and incredible nemesis in Doc Oc, and at the same time he was going through an internal struggle of whether or not to remain a super hero. On the one hand there was a normal life as Peter Parker: no crime fighting, and complete with Mary Jane. On the other hand there was the life of Spiderman: never a dull moment, the weight of the world on his shoulders, and Mary Jane would be out of the picture. The story made for a great movie, and there were some fantastic scenes, but... I got sick of the Peter Parker/Mary Jane show. I'm not all that impressed with Kirsten Dunst to begin with, then she just became down right annoying as Mary Jane. I am a guy. When I sit down to watch an action film, I want lots of action, minimal dialogue, and zero sap. The sap factor was large and in charge in Spiderman 2... the only significant flaw in my eyes (well that and when he saved his Auntie from Doc Oc). The potential was there for this movie to soar above and even beyond its predecessor, but it was bogged down by PP and MJ. It was a decent movie, one worth watching again, just not great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Worst Comc Adaptations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warning: if you can't stand an unpopular opinion, don't read this.I really dislike this movie. Not to the point of hate, but close. Here's why.Spiderman 2 is the worst comic adaptation i have seen. it is no where near what Spiderman was like in the comics. i shall use three points to explain the faults.1. The "humor". This movie tries desperately to be funny, but all it does is ooze cheesy lines like "would you like some chocolate cake" and "this is heavy", both followed by awkward pauses. Let's not forget the horribly stupid "Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head" sequence! 2. The Romance. Sure, there is a romance story in the comics, but it's not so soap-operatic, and Peter Parker is no where near as love struck, love-lorn, or just plain awkward. He's not as whiny, either.3. The storyline/action. First off, Doc Oc is supposed to be a bad guy, not a mind controlled good guy. second, where were Spidey's famous in-fight sarcastic quips? Not there. Spiderman losing his powers because he somehow isn't sure he want's to be a hero. NEWS FLASH! He ain't an empath: he can't control whether or not he has powers! Also, the children's reaction in the train was pathetic. "We won't tell." YOU ARE A 10 YEAR OLD WHO KNOWS SPIDERMANS SECRET IDENTITY, OF COURSE YOU'RE GONNA BRAG! The drastic overplay of the drama and the corniness of the humor just detract so much from the film.Kirsten Dunce(yes, misspelled on purpose) has yet another horrid acting performance. Sure, the FX were great, for the 12 minutes of action that were in this daytime soap. I guess I should have just forgotten about the source material and enjoy this as a stand alone...p-UH-lease!Skip this and go watch Sin City or Hellboy, please!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spiderman 2, hopefully NOT the direction of Spiderman 3</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have spoken to many people regarding the Spiderman franchise thus far and most prefer the second film because it has better action, effects and a quicker pace. Ah yes, the magic that is Hollywood and its manipulation of the bells and whistles to distract the audience from what is truly satisfying, namely good story.That's not to say that Spidey 2 was not a good story. The problem is, was that the story of Spidey 2 was the same as Spidey 1, but on steroids. Peter has problems coping with his powers, been there. Peter has issues dealing with his love for MJ, done that. Peter has a father/son type relationship with an arch villain that wants to kill him, does this sound familiar? Spiderman 2 does not raise the stakes for Peter because we already know that Peter's action or inaction can harm those he loves most. This connection is made more specifically between Peter and MJ this time around, but was no more dangerous than being chucked off a bridge by the Goblin in the first film. I liked Spiderman 2 because I like Spiderman and Alfred Molina (who is the true shining light in this picture).Now for my fears of Spidey 3: The steps that Spidey 2 took in its presentation appear to emulate those of the Batman films. Batman 3 and 4 ultimately failed due to the inclusion of too many characters, less screen time for actors and the consequent sloppy/humorous performances by all.I truly hope this is NOT the final destination for Spidey 3, but we already have 3 villains for Peter to content with: Harry Osborne, Sandman, and Venom. Details, of course, are minimal but we can assume a starkly different alien symbiote origin story than that established in the comics (Secret Wars); most likely they will connect the arrival of the symbiote with Colonel Jameson's return from a space mission.Sandman's inclusion is puzzling despite the fact that he was the super villain Peter was fighting in Amazing Spiderman #298 and #299 which were also the first appearances of Venom. Sandman, though, has no further connection to Peter, his friends and family or Venom so I can't see Sandman as being more than villain-canon-fodder and plot distraction at this point.Topher Grace as Eddie Brock is a MIS-CAST! Topher = skinny That 70s Show boy with a quirky charisma about him. Eddie Brock = buff, pseudo-Olympic style build with a hint of insanity. I don't see the connection so the CGI for Venom better be SUPERIOR to convince us! And while I'm on this subject, I do not like how the symbiote emulates the Spidey movie costume, just in black. The comic book symbiote featured an aggressive white wrap around spider insignia on a purely black spandex suit, I know, hot! Already Spiderman 3 has taken strides to become an insane success or fan-boy flop. I just hope that the formula that conceived Spidey 2 does not drive Spidey 3 because it will result in Batman and Robin.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The epic continues masterfully</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sam Raimi's Spider-Man 2 is one of the top comic book films to date, matching up well with Sin City and its predecessor. America's hero is back with more webslinging fun and a darker story. Peter Parker (a once again excellent Tobey Maguire) has got to get his life under control. He's falling in school, losing touch with friends Harry Osborn (James Franco is even better) and Mary Jane Watson (I don't really like Kirsten Dunst, but she suffices here), his aunt (Rosemary Harris lives up to her legend with the limited screen time she has) is worried about him, and to top it all off, a new maniac is on the loose, and it's another one of Peter's mentors: Dr. Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina is perfect as Dock Ock).The ways it tops the first Spidey film is evident in the acting and special effects. The acting is much deeper, perhaps because the storyline is much more personal than the first film. I loved Alfred Molina as Spidey's nemesis, continuing the streak of excellent portrayals of comic book villains. Maguire is just as good as Spidey and Peter Parker, which we know he excels at. He gets a lot more emotional scenes in this one, particularly towards the end. James Franco's Harry Osborn is awesome, because he gives us even more mystery about his character, with a few hot flashes of anger. Harry is also portrayed as confused, which is an essential quality that Franco provides. Kirsten Dunst...well, what do you expect? She gets by well enough, but I wish she'd be as lovable as Jennifer Connelly in Hulk...but I'm comparing a B-talent actress to an Oscar winner, so that's not really fair.The special effects are off the wall amazing, definitely deserving of the Oscar it won. The train sequence between Dock Ock and Spidey is simply breathtaking. This is another area where it more than surpasses the cheesy effects of Spidey 1. The movie is not just an action flick, but a real movie that conveys how hard it would be to be a superhero, the sacrifices that are necessary. It's definitely a landmark achievement for Raimi, Molina, and Maguire, as they make the film. It's a must own for any Spidey fan or action buff, in addition to any movie lover. It's got a great story, good characters, explosive action, and a strong ending that leaves the door open for #3 to be simply awesome.10/10 --spy</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spider-Man 2, is without question, the best of Marvel's current crop of films. All of the others each had their own problems. X-Men lost the scope and personal feel that is Marvel's trademark. Hulk lost itself in plot extravagance. Fantastic Four suffered from poor casting. But where all others failed, Spider-Man 2 excels.The effects, of course, are wonderful. In particular, Spider-Man and Dr. Octopus' train battle is beautifully executed. But the true strength of Spider-Man 2 is in its characters. They are not just the hollow archetypes of X-Men (a problem admittedly remedied in THAT film's sequel). Each has a personality that is understandable, tangible, and real. That has always been Spider-Man's appeal; he's Everyman as much as Spider-Man. And as such, he shares the pathos, frustration, and occasional joy of being a realistic hero.HEY EVERYBODY GO SEE SPIDER-MAN HE SWINGS ON WEBS!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Brilliant. Beautiful. Out of all the comic book to movie cross overs, Sam Raimi has done the best with the Spider-Man films. This sequel is obviously higher budget than the first one and thus, I think, is slightly better. Also, the second film doesn't have to plod through the story of how Spider-Man got his powers so you can cut right to the action. The actors are wonderful (save for the ridiculous Kirsten Dunst) and the writers are to be commended on their ability to remain close to the Spider-Man storyline while still delivering a themed, beginning-to-end film that doesn't leave things too loose in the end. This movie knocked my socks off. The down side? I have to wait for Spider-Man 3! Argh!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spider-Man 2 is the continuing adventures of Peter Parker/Spider-Man, only now he's beginning to lose control over his life. Peter Parker is attempting to hold down two jobs, college, and some form of social life. All this while swinging around New York saving lives. Harry Osborn is bitter over his father's death, and wants Spider-Man dead. Mary Jane can't trust Peter anymore. Eventually, Peter decides to give up being Spider-Man...Until an idol of his, Doctor Otto Octavius is in a freak accident and transformed into the villainous Doctor Octopus. Now Peter has no choice but to stop Octavius before he destroys the city. This is a great sequel that holds up to the standards of the first film.Usually, sequels are lacking in quality compared to the first film. Well, not this time. Once again, Sam Raimi manages to use the perfect formula for a superhero film to create this comic book masterpiece. He is able to have realistic conflict among the characters as well as plenty of Spidey action scenes without the movie being overloaded. This movie features a lot more comic relief, which I like in an action movie, as long as it's done right, and trust me it's done right here. Raimi also is able to nail down exactly how stressful it would be to have a low paying job, school, and no social life. So, plot and style wise, this movie is top notch. As for CGI, it has vastly improved from the first film. Is it perfect, no. But it's better. The only small problem I had with the movie was some of the dialogue. There are a couple of lines here and there that make you cringe, such as Doc Ock's line, "Nothing will stand in our way. NOTHING!", and upon discovering the mechanical arms fused to his body, "NOOOOOO!", and especially Peter Parker's line to Mary Jane, "Punch me, I bleed!".The acting in this movie is a little different from the first film. Tobey Maguire I thought did better in the first movie, the same with Kirsten Dunst. They seem to have chosen a different way to portray their characters, and it's not as good. James Franco is supposed to be more greedy and bitter in this film, so his changed portrayal makes sense. Alfred Molina is very good as Doctor Octopus. He is able to be playfully evil and dead serious very convincingly.Overall, this movie is slightly better than the first film. Spider-Man 2 is a spot on sequel, and it leaves me very excited as to what Sam Raimi will do with the third film.8.5/10</fullReview>

His love problems deepin with Mary-Jane, and he finds it even harder to live two lives, balancing his crime fighting time, and his actual job. The special effects are really good, it makes you wanna play Spiderman 2 the Game, because you get this sense that you are spiderman. Some things you wanted to happen in the first one play out in this movie, such as Spidermans secret identity gets revealed to certain people. Also, some future villains are fore-shadowed.

This film had it all, incredible acting, incredible special effects and an enticing storyline. Each character played the part to perfection, and Alfred Molina was incredible as Doc Ock, who was one of my favourite villains in the comic books. Harry, Mary Jane, Aunt May and J-Jona Jameson were all fantastic in their big or small roles. And of course Tobey Mcguire was sensational as Peter Parker/Spiderman. You could feel every bit of emotion he was going through, and yet when it switched to the action, he was just as amazing.I challenge you to watch the film and not like it.

In my opinion Carnage would be a great character for the 4th film, continuing on from the alien symbiotic storyline which Venom will start. Also the spider-man 3 game on the next generation consoles i hope that the game follows tightly with the movie and to make the fighting just like the movies in particular in the first movie where spider-man fights of the thugs who try to corner MJ before the kissing scene.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While the first SPIDERMAN captured the comic's emotional angst, the effects and battles were lackluster. I also wasn't sure about Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker. In fact, while a huge Sam Raimi fan, I avoided SP2 until last week.WOW.If I were a kid, SPIDERMAN 2 would be my STAR WARS. This film surpasses the first in almost every way. Raimi is fully in charge here, and the film plays like a Hollywood spectacle with flourishes of indie subversion, like the brilliant "Raindrops Keep Fallin'" montage. On top of moving and entertaining scenes, SPIDERMAN 2 delivers the very best action superhero scenes set to celluloid. More important, the action is integral to the story and leads to further character development. Even during an epic train battle, the film swings from one of the best action set pieces since the truck chase in RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK to a heart-tugging finale where Peter Parker realizes the power of his responsibility.Raimi so clearly "gets" the source material that there is no better choice for director. Just check out the bank fight between Spidey and Doc Ock, one of the most perfect comic book action scenes ever. Even the quips work perfect. Tobey Maguire owns Peter Parker/Spiderman here and the film just wouldn't work if he wasn't able to generate such empathy, strength and confusion. Alfred Molina was inspired casting and ends up as the best super villain since General Zod in Superman 2. It takes a great actor to perfectly nail a line like "Butterfingers." This is Sam Raimi's best film, a complete summation of his kinetic film-making and generous heart (not to mention a classic Bruce Campbell moment). SPIDERMAN 2 is truly a film for all ages, minus the pious built-in studio morality. I can't think of another superhero film that brought tears to my more than once. It's the comic, stupid! And by the end of the film, after Parker has suffered the slings and arrows of misfortune, he is allowed a beautiful moment of respite and the film ends on a fantastic super high, capped by Danny Elfman's grand score (blowing away the weak first) and a wonderfully ambiguous final shot.I've been watching this film over and over the past week, and it's left me feeling giddy and hopeful, a charge I don't get too much from recent Hollywood films. But if Columbia was willing to give the director of EVIL DEAD 200 million dollars to make a superhero film...Go Spidey, go!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I saw the first Spider-man, I was 14 years old, and a Spider-man fan for almost 8. I had been reading all the Spider-man comics since I was 8, and I was dying for the film.When I saw the film opening night, I was disappointed. First, the action didn't look that cool, especially for a film that cost 132m dollars. Second, the supporting cast aside from J.J. was horrid. None of the characters came even close to playing their part right. J.J. and Tobey really saved the film from being a disaster, as everything else in the film was mediocre.So I didn't have that high of expectations for Spider-man 2. When I saw it opening night, I was delighted to see that it was an improvement, mainly because the action was top-notch(as it should have been for a 200M dollar film). Doc Ock also was also portrayed better than GG.However, it still lacked that supporting cast. And after watching Batman Begins, I realized how important the supporting cast is.While a superhero film is about the superhero, what makes the film is the people around it. If you make the film soley about the superhero, you lose the little things that make the character great.So while SM2 is a great film mainly due to the action, acting of Tobey, and the great comedy of J.J., it is still not near the level of Batman Begins, and I doubt a Spider-man film ever will be until they change the cast.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow, this movie was sooo much better than the first one, and the first one was brilliant! If this is to become a trilogy then we can definitely see some darker themes creeping in here. The first movie had Peter Parker struggling with dual identity a little bit and then forgetting about it as soon as Mary-Jane got in trouble (again). This film really fleshes the plot and characters out, showing more depth to all of them, we find out that Peter is not just struggling but REALLY struggling. We also see the darker side of Osbourne, that he has grown from a bereaved rich boy into one who would readily kill in revenge. The cast is as ever, brilliant, Alfred Molina is genius casting for Doc Ock and they were really lucky that Tobey Maguire's back injury didn't stop him from being in the film as he remains excellent. Overall this film is a good continuation of the franchise and nicely sets things up for the third movie, watch it, now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Picking up where #1 left off, Peter Parker (Maguire) still can't get a break - his jobs suck, he can't keep up with his college work, his financial situation is getting worse both for him and his sweet old Aunt May, his childhood friend Harry Osborne (Franco) is growing more and more disconnected from his humanity as well as his friendship as he becomes more and more obsessed with destroying Spider-Man for killing his father Norman (Willem DaFoe) from the first film, unaware that Norman was the Green Goblin, and of course, Peter is still longing and lusting after Mary-Jane Watson (Dunst), who is now engaged to his boss J. Jonah Jameson's astronaut son John. In fact, the stress and strife of all this unhappiness is taking such a toll on Peter that his powers as Spider-Man are beginning to go on and off like a faulty light. Though he still feels guilty about the fact that it was pretty much his fault that his dear old Uncle Ben got killed in #1 - and it was this guilt that has been his driving force in being Spider-Man - Peter is sick and tired of having to put everything and everyone else in his life on hold because the job of being Spider-Man has him fighting the forces of evil left &amp; right. When his powers apparently turn themselves off permanently, Peter decides to take his life back and throws out the Spider-Man suit, and for a time, he's happy just living like an ordinary person, catching up on his college work and what not, although that doesn't change the fact that Mary-Jane is still engaged to John Jameson and can't simply throw that away just because her favorite boy is now ready, willing and able. As if feeling guilty about the fact that he can no longer defend the innocents of New York isn't enough, into this comes Dr. Otto Octavious (Molina), once a jolly, good natured mad scientist who naturally only had the best of intentions, his big experiment, funded by Harry Osborne no less, boasting that Octavious's genius will "Put Oscorp on the map in a way my father could have never dreamed.", turns Octavious into an unhinged villain dubbed Dr. Octopus/Doc Ock, who goes on a crime spree to get the money &amp; materials he needs to finish his work. Naturally, Peter gets his powers working again and becomes Spider-Man again, but will Spider-Man be able to stop Doc Ock? Even more important - will he be able to win back Mary-Jane?Slightly over long and sometimes erring on the side of the melodramatic, and erring on the absurdity of unmasking Spider-Man not once, not twice, but three times, this is still an entertaining roller coaster with eye-popping violence and reasonably sincere characters. Here's hoping Topher Grace doesn't wreck #3.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Comic Movie ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There had been so many movies based on a comic. The whole whole movie was absolutely satisfying. Well, I'm a fan of Marvel Comics and I have to say, that Marvel had a bad start with Howard the Duck and Captain America. But things started getting better in the late 90's. (Blade in 1998 and then X-Men in 2000). Spiderman was even better. .......And then the sequel: A masterpiece. I think Dock Ock was an excellent choice for the villain. The Visual Effects were superb (Far better than in the first part) Spiderman 2 showed everyone that Comic movies can be much more than MTV-style popcorn entertainment. The score was quite good.(Raindrops keep falling on my head by BJ Thomas is great but the rest is mediocre) Acting was really good (I think Kirsten Dunst is a very talented actress) Best 2004 Movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spider-Man 2 is a great sequel to the original. When I first saw the original Spider-Man film, I didn't feel it was that great. Something was missing. Spider-Man 2 on the other hand turned out to be great. It really captured the heart of the character.. and I think Doc Ock turned out to be a much better villain then the Green Goblin.In the movie, Peter Parker decides if he should continue to fight for good... and eventually, he throws in the towel... or in this case, his costume. I thought it was a great plot to put in the movie and it really helped make Spider-Man a more real character. A lot of people do compare the plot of the movie to Superman 2... in a way I kinda agree, but they do make enough changes to make Spider-Man 2 much better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a rule, there are way too many adaptations of comics (especially the superhero kind, which I don't like) and sequels coming out of Hollywood. So if there's a sequel to a comic adaptation, that bodes ill.Not so in the case of Spiderman 2. And it's not about the action sequences, that look like they had a very big budget. If you like those, you won't be disappointed.No, Spiderman 2 invites you to think, without being pushy on the morals front. There are no meaningful speeches or metaphors that a toddler would understand. Instead, there is plenty of humour that doesn't get too tacky, and there are even tender moments, notably at the end of the subway scene. That one, I actually found touching.It's difficult to elaborate on the film without giving too much away. But if you have a chance to see it, it's well worth it. It can be mindless action if you want it, but it's much more than that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marvelous Superhero Film with Real Human Beings and Heart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an outstanding film. The story is good for the superhero-action part of the film. The villain is well acted by A. Molina. The real greatness of this film is how it incorporates a very human story involving the boy who plays spiderman and his own inner conflicts about being a superhero. The human story also involves his love for Mary Jane and her love for him. The human side plays a significant role in the film and makes it not just a great action film. Toby M. and Kirsten Dunst act brilliantly. If this were not an action film and were more politically correct, Mr. McGuire and Miss Dunst might have had a chance for an academy award nomination, which they both richly deserve. It is rather sad that great performances and great plots or sub-plots in action films are wholly and routinely ignored by critics when it comes to making their top ten lists and by awards voters--e.g. Golden Globes, Oscars, Bafta etc. Still, what matters is the quality of the film and Spiderman 2 is very high-quality from first scene to last.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Among the best comic book movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With good comic book movies being incredibly rare, one may not know what to expect when seeing one. I came into this sequel with high expectations, though, since the first one was a pretty well made film. Since the original spent enough time explaining the origin of Spider-Man and all of that nonsense, I figured that the sequel would be full of a lot more action and Spidey's web-slinging tactics since no time would be wasted on how the character got his powers.I was correct. Spider-Man 2 is absolutely fantastic, and perhaps much better than the first movie. How Dr. Octopus was incorporated into the movie's storyline was done perfectly and his fight scenes with our friendly neighborhood Spidey were amazing. The visual effects were top notch, featuring some of the best I've ever seen in a comic book movie.The acting was good, for the most part, aside from some quirks with Kirsten Dunst's performance. Anyway, Bruce Campbell's cameo was one of the best parts in the movie, as he was very hilarious as usual.The only part I didn't like was the very end, when the movie set itself up for another sequel. It was introducing a storyline that I wouldn't really care to see, since it'd be pretty much just like the first movie, but, hell. If that's what they want to do, there's nothing I can do to stop 'em. I just hope they'll wise up and introduce Venom in a 4th movie if not the 3rd. A Spider-Man movie series without Venom would just downright be a travesty.Comic book fan or not, it'd be extremely hard for one not to enjoy Spider-Man 2. It has enough comic relief that's actually hilarious to mix with some beautiful action sequences and visual effects to keep most moviegoers happy. My personal opinion is that this sequel is even better than the first movie, but I'm sure many out there will agree.</fullReview>

The difference is, the doctor is driven insane by the change and takes people hostage, pushing Spidey to the limit as Spidey tries to thwart him.

		<fullReview>Spider-man 2 is a great film, far superior to the first Spider-man (which was a good film in its own right). Again, Sam Raimi helms this Spider-man adventure, this time with a stronger script and superior dialogue. It's because he focuses on Peter Parker's humanity and the fact he has the weaknesses of any normal human being, it makes us associate closer with Spider-man and all his perils. The same couldn't be said for Batman until Batman Begins was made (since that was the first film that actually explored Bruce Wayne and why he became the way he is). Also, unlike the first Spider-man, this time the title character is given a better villain - in the form of Alfred Molina as Doc Ock/Dr. Otto Octavius. I really look forward to Spider-man 3 now! A very strong 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best sequels ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If we expect action, thrills, jumps on our seats and being in the edge of it, let's go to watch this movie. If we want heart, soul, moving moments and comedy...let's go and watch this movie too. Sam Raimi's first part of Spiderman shows the executive producers that he can make a great blockbuster and also gain a lot for strength against the academy producers. So they gave him total freedom with this sequel, and thank god they did. Sam Raimi returns to his beginnings, those beginnings into that creepy cabin, and reaches his high point during that scary surgery operation to Doc Ock (a terrific Alfred Molina) when his independent tentacles kill (without blood, yeah, but Jesus, I still shaking in fear) the whole operation team (do not lose that out-standing chainsaw moment). But this movie is not only special effects and ultra-realistic fights between a giant octopus and a spider. This movie is a heart opener experience. Peter Parker becomes that tortured hero who can't balance between his personal life and impossible love for Mary Jane, and the bless/curse of his super-hero powers. He is like everyone of us. Okay, we don't have special powers, but we have jobs, hobbies, things that take too much of our times to expend with the family. Spiderman is just like that. And with this fantastic sequel, he gets the story he deserves. An Odyssey where friends became enemies, where his identity is revealed to protect others, where the heart is challenged every time with chills and thrills and you feel the life that makes the rhythm never stop, even when the movie turns slow with only one or two moments (I don't understand why Cliff Robertson appears again, but he is the trigger for one of the most dramatic moments of the film). Conclusion: Unmissable movie, this is worth to be in the podium of best sequels ever made, between The godfather part II, and Aliens.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Simply awesome, adventurous, tickles the fans senses.Not giving away too much of the story if you haven't seen it already, this spiderman movie, as the first one prior to this one, Is simply amazing! I for one am someone who simply praises or burns down a movie if it sucked. This one gets nothing but praise from me. As a kid I knew someone who collected the spiderman-series of comics, and have read many of them. So I am pretty familiar with spidermans history, the characters, story etc.The 80's version of the spiderman-movie simply sucked, although I liked watching a lame guy in large red rainboots and big exo-webshooters slide-climbing skyscrapers and those lame fighting scenes who were much worse then the ones in the telvision series of batman in the 70'sThis movie (and it's first installment last year), simply rocked! And was beyond my expectations! Everything was in order. How many movies do you know off that have so much adrenelin packed, great visuals, stunning ILM effects, story and even romance that can move a person who dislikes girlie-romance-flics to begin with? The humor is outstanding. This is one of those films that can make a cinema audience laugh a good deal and be very quiet during the romantic scenes.Althuogh Spidermans character of Peter Parker is Displayed as a Nerdy clums in these films, and this was not something That striked me/when read the comics, It didn't really bother me a great deal. This is what Stan Lee probably intended for the Peter Parker-character as he started this concept of Spider-man in the first place. So this movie is educational as well to those die-hard spiderman fans out there. But that's my opinion..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I read the IMDb lead (cheery!) report of the 'unemployed critic' - I must respectfully disagree. My son warned me that Parker comes off as a whiny brat in this one, and that the film just drags on and on. That's what I found, too. I don't think a great trilogy is in the making -- I think I've had my fill of the follies and perils of our webbed friend.I don't blame Tobey-- I think the screenplay just asked that he gripe too much - and lose too often! I know the character is supposed to be 'complicated' and 'tragic', but why not save a little for Episode 3 and 'cut to the chase?' sooner? I could have used a lot more of the evil Doc. (by the way: if Tobey was ever 'born' to play a character, it's Bix Beiderbecke, the jazz cornetist. do 'tragic' there, Tobey and do 'action hero' in Spiderman (--: ) Now, there are some great FX's in this one, and some clever scenes. But pacing is everything. You don't need 1/2 dozen 'longish' scenes with the same conversation to establish Spiderman's troubles. We get it - OK? Add to that, the innumerable endings! ouch! ever hear of 'anti-climactic?' Maybe I'll take a beating on this one, but I feel the basic problem is editing. When you watch 'deleted' scenes on DVD's, the directors moan about great scenes they had to cut to move the story along. Those 'deleted' scenes are still in this one - and they're not great.Swing and a miss. maybe next time. (--:</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A special effects extravaganza</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It should tell you almost all you need to know that all the publicity stills from this film were CGI shots.If you're a fan of CGI, Spider-Man 2 is a real treat - an Internet Movie Database Top 250 of a film. But in other respects it is lacking, and more so than its prequel.Although Tobey Maguire is billed as the lead, he is on the screen for a relatively short amount of time because, for the most part, his character is played by 69 members of the effects crew. And talented though Maguire is, his appearances have the feel of being a filler while we wait for the next action sequence.It doesn't help that Peter Parker's superhero affliction has gone from being poor and naive to being the world's most unfairly treated individual. He is dumped by his girlfriend for turning up late to the theatre and shunned by his aunt for confessing that he played an indirect, and entirely unforeseeable, part in his uncle's death.Still, Alfred Molina's Doctor Octopus is a very fine baddie and the plot ticks along nicely, if predictably, for the full two hours. My main issue is that despite its high rating among IMDb's voters, it is not as good as Spider-Man. The hero never appears vulnerable enough to give the scenes any tension and the film begins to look like an action flick by numbers.That said, as CGI-reliant films go it is certainly better than anything by George Lucas. Let's hope that the third instalment is up to the standard set by Batman Begins.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many critics have labeled "Spiderman 2" as the best superhero film ever. The film was quite entertaining, but I think many of these critics got caught up in the spider trap. As its infamous predecessor- the film did incorporate sensational special effects, paradoxical personal dilemmas, sacrificing love intricacies, and stirring action sequences. However, to say that it was much better than the original would be an overstatement. I think these critics were "climbing off the walls" with their calenture for "Spiderman 2". Sam Raimi must be once again commended for his swashbuckling direction of "Spiderman 2". Raimi, who directed my own personal favorite superhero film "Darkman", is the premier director for this type of film genre. Tobey Maguire's performance as the web-slinging crusader was adequate but not of superheroic proportions. Alfred Molina was quite a handful or should I say handfuls as the villainous Dr. Octopus (Ock). However, the remaining supporting cast of "Spiderman 2" (James Franco, Kirsten Dunst, and Rosemary Harris) did not entrap me too much into their world wide web of acting. They were far better in the original. In spide, I mean spite of it all, "Spiderman 2" is still one worth hanging on to and checking out. **** Good</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another sequel, this time to a movie that I didn't like to begin with, so I pretty much thought that Spiderman 2 would suck. But, amazingly enough, I think this movie is much better than the first Spiderman movie. Why you might be asking? Well, let me tell you why. In this movie, you get to see more of the poor character that is Peter Parker; you realize that he is pretty much the most unlucky guy in the world, which makes him kind of an anti hero. And there is more drama this time around which I think makes it a much more interesting movie. Plus it makes the characters more realistic. Finally the villain in this movie is much cooler than the "Toys "R" Us" mask of the Green Goblin. Funniest scene after my opinion is when Peter Parker falls and hits everything in his way. If you liked the first Spiderman, chances are you will actually like this better. And if you didn't like the first one like me, you can still enjoy this one. I rate this movie 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whenever a movie has the number "2" or it's equivalent at the end of the title you immediately become suspicious. Fortunately the only thing to be suspicious about Spider-Man 2 is if number 3 can possibly live up to this movie.Picking up some time after the first movie ended, we find Peter (Tobey Maquire), Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst), Harry (James Franco) and gang getting on with their lives. But their lives cause a lot of inner conflict that each must resolve. For Peter, it is difficult trying to balance school, his day job of delivering pizza's, getting Mary Jane back and his other job of Spider-Man. Mary Jane has succeeded in the world of theater and Harry is running his father's business.It is Harry's venture with Dr. Otto Octavius (Alfred Molino) that sets up the action in the movie. After the Doctor's experiment goes horribly wrong he becomes Doc Oct, a label hung on him by the incomparable Daily Bugle editor, J. Jonah Jameson (J.K. Simmons). Doc Oct is not your normal villain. He is not out to do harm, but to prove that his energy experiments will work, despite the costs. In order to succeed he needs Harry's help. But Harry only agrees to help the good doctor only if Doc Oct brings in Spider-Man to "face justice" for killing his father.The action sequences with Spider-Man and Doc Oct are outstanding. Particularly thrilling is a long sequence involving a battle that starts on the buildings of New York and then ends with an exhilarating ride on the subway.But what makes this movie stand out is the triangle of Peter, Mary Jane and Harry. All three characters have great inner conflict on what they should be doing in their lives. Peter doesn't know if he should be Spider-Man or not. Mary Jane doesn't know if she should keep waiting for Peter. And Harry fights with himself over his friendship of Peter and Peter's friendship with Spider-Man, Harry's enemy.Sam Raimi does an admirable job in bringing the turmoil these characters are under to the surface. He uses lighting very well to highlight their conflict, often casting these leads in dark shadows conveying their sense of confusion.Mr. Raimi also does a great job in balancing the action with the slower parts of the movie. All of the actors do a great job in the slower scenes developing the turmoil their characters are under. Without the great casting and acting, these parts of the movie easily could have brought it down.Hellboy, directed by Guillermo Del Toro, succeeded for the same reasons. With good casting and excellent focus on the character's emotions, both comic book movies excel. These directors have shown that movie-makers don't have to rely on action to make a great action movie.Spider-Man 2 just may be the best comic book action hero movie to date.</fullReview>

Also, I like how MJ moving on with her dream of acting and her marrying that other guy ( I forgot his name). The CGI and special effects are outstanding and the plot although predictable, is still good. I recently got the DVD for Christmas and I've seen it about 3 times already!

		<fullReview>In 2002 since the super hero craze has begun. Because Hollywood is taking every single hero movie even old ones like "Batman" and making what the fifth one of them. But in 2002 David Koepp wrote the screen play for "Spider-man" based on the comics by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko he gave it to Sam Raimi director of "Evil Dead 1 &amp; 2 Dead by Dawn". He started to direct that and casted Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker the geeky teenager who on a Field trip is bitten by a radioactive super spider while taking pictures of Mary Jane Watson played by Kirsten Dunst, and of course who better for the villain then Willem Dafoe who of course played the Green Goblin. Then in 2004 since a sequel must be made they had Alvin Sargent do screenplay and Sam Raimi again directed it. He kept everyone the same in the second as did the first. But since The Green Goblin got killed of they casted Alfred Molina to play Dr. Otto Octavious or Doc Ock. "Spider-man 2" is more than just a typical sequel and is done to amaze the kids with their CGI and ILM it packs the fun factor. It has fun with the characters, and it really goes in depth on Peter Parker's life outside of Spider-Man.</fullReview>

I watched this film and noticed it that it was more true than the comics than the first film only a few minor miscalculations like doc ock's accent being British when it should have been German. This is a truly exhilarating masterpiece again from Sam Raimi's imaginative mind i now can't wait for the third one as it finishes in a cliffhanger with Harry being the new green goblin.

		<fullReview>This is one sequel that ran the original very close in terms of quality and audience interest. I am a huge fan of Sam Raimi &amp; this was the main reason I gave this flick a chance due to his superb Evil Dead trilogy. The effects are excellent which I thought they would be having viewed the original film. Lots of action coupled with good acting performances particularly by Toby Maguire who I think was average in the first but really gets into his role in this. Twas funny to see Bruce Campbell (Ash) &amp; Dan Hicks (Jake) both from Evil Dead 2 in bit part roles in this. "Jake, you're holdin my hand too tight....!" "Baby, I ain't holdin your hand!"Definitely gonna check out the 3rd installment in the series after this, lookin forward to it.Check this film out.Rating 7/10. Groovy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a good movie, the action scenes are brilliant, the plot is better in this film then in the original, in this one we start to understand Peter Parker pressures of being Spiderman, how being Spiderman has changed his life dramatically, he cant be their for the ones he loves, Doctor Octopus is a great villain, I found him to be more menacing then the Green Goblin, the fighting scenes between Spiderman and the Dr Octavia's are probably the finest fighting scenes in a super hero movie.There are the occasional flaws, and the most obvious one like all Super hero films, the Hero always have to save the girl, you would think it would be more logical for the villain to attack a politician then attack a girl, even when its notes MJ, its Aunt May out of all the people Dr Octavia's manages to pick up.But that's just one small pain in the but in a good film, I like Spiderman, he is a good Super hero, but lets face it, he is not as good as Batman.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I could have never expected Tobey Maguire to look so good as Spiderman. Truth is, this film excels over it's predecessor in everything-more spectacular, more talented, better story-lined. Dr Octopus-good choice for a villain. But whatever happened to good old Venom, huh? Or Carnage? When will we see one of them in a Spiderman movie? Seriously, though, Spiderman 2 is a good one. Seen it in the cinema? Still good enough to spend your money on. Action, a bit of romance, a wee bit of drama, heck, it's like real life, only able to climb walls and spin webs. The creators of the comic have nothing to worry about. Definitely advisable-watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Comic Book Adaptation Ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spiderman 2 is one of the greatest movie ever.Comic book movies aren't so good.Well not all but some of them wasn't really that good.Just effects.Nobody tries to do something more that an immortal character who has very strange abilities and effects.Spiderman was the first one that did this.It showed Peter Parker as a person.We don't imagine Spiderman like a character who can't be killed anymore.And now the sequel surprised me in positive way.A wonderful movie.Just great.It even entered my all time Top 20.Now Peter works as i pizza deliver for the first 10 minutes of the movie.He had to be Spiderman till delivering a pizza in the other part of the town.He saved a lot of people but of course he didn't deliver the pizza in time and he was fired.It was sad when we understood that he had a birthday.Now he live with his aunt and they have a financial problems.His problems continues.Marry Jane marries other guy.Reason is that Peter was wait for her theater show.He had to save people again and when he arrived they didn't let him.The villain is Doc.OK.My all time favorite Spiederman bad guy.He is played by Alfred Molina.This is the plot and the movie is more than great.It is a drama and action together.Spiderman 2-Toby MacGuire,Kirsten Dunst,Alfred Molina,James Franco.I gave it 9.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, before I started writing this I went and browsed trough the previous comments. One thing I noticed was, that at least 3/4 of the were written by different people from USA another thing I noticed was, that most of them were very positive. A bit to much if you ask me. I like spider-man. I think he is one of the coolest super heroes ever invented. I hated the first movie, mostly because it was so very - I love New York, you can't beat us. Sure it was after the 9/11 incident, but such a message has no place in a movie about a fictional hero like Spider-man. The second movie was better in some ways, I must admit the effects were awesome, but for all the people that loved the comics or even the cartoons it should have been a disappointment. Sure it is an action super hero movie and you can't really expect deep dialogs, development of characters and such, but there is no need to presume that people watching it will all have IQ-s of a 6 year old. At various points in the movie I felt like it was telling me I was a moron, who needed everything explained and repeated over and over for the message to get trough. The performances were, well.... average and some scenes were overly dramatic. Screaming evil laugh doctors talking to themselves really aren't my thing. I know there are a lot of fans out there so don't kill me, but be realistic</fullReview>

Peter is a struggling young man who can't even hold a job long enough to live in a better place than he currently is.

While peter has women trouble, A new villain is born, DOC OCK!!! And what could be worse? Harry and Peter's relationship is going down the tubes big time.A movie about finding you true self, Spider-man 2 is a mix of action and romance.

		<fullReview>I first saw this when it came out and I loved it I though it was awesome. Then I bought the DVD and watched it a few more times and I liked it less and less the more I watched it. First off the acting wasn't good, especially from Tobey, it isn't really that bad until you get to the ending and everything feels rushed, I mean that fight after Dock Ock visits harry was just too rushed, then the subway scene was corny as hell, as was the last speech made by Dock Ock and it was too rushed, then came all the speeches, its as if all of Peter's character development happened with speeches. the last speech wasn't long enough plus Aunt May wearing gloves on a clock hand with a umbrella and not slipping to her death made no sense. But despite the bad stuff there was good stuff, the CGI was better, and we got to see Dr. Connors. It still is good enough for me to not mind watching it a few more times but only if I'm forced to.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From Art-House to Hollywood Failure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The low-key opening third of the film in which Parker's character and situation is explored and revealed is quite engaging. Maguire has a soft, laid back approach that is quite appealing. This feels like a real film with real characters. The surrounding characters are a little over-blown, but seen as a film about a real person living in a comic-book fantasy, they work well, and there is a healthy, knowing tongue-in-cheek intelligence about the film that pulls me in. But at some point in the middle when the action film section really gets going I realized that I had become bored. The film had lost the art-house feel of the opening, had become yet another Hollywood No Brainer with big action sequences, no character development, no surprises, just the usual crash scenes. It was hard to stay focused, and I wondered why and where exactly the awareness of the intelligent viewer had been dropped. Certainly Molina plays the villain with wink-wink, thigh slapping gusto, and there is enough humour and drama in the ending to make most readers forget the tedium of the the middle third. But considered as a whole the film failed for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Same director, different feel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved this film. I gave it a 7/10 stars (which right now is about average). I watched this immediately after watching the first Spiderman and noted the differences as I saw them. There was more humor in this film than the first, some bad and some kind of witty.I initially didn't like the fact that Spiderman loses his powers at times when he's stressed or whatever about real-life things. I thought that they could've saved that facet of his character out until the third movie. He could've saved so many secrets until the next movie, but it had to have been done at some point, I guess. This movie answered what would happen between Mary Jane and Peter Parker, or at least, how they feel about one another after Peter reveals himself.The music was as great as the first. Danny Elfman and about 3 other composers helped on this film, which you can feel in the intense moments of the action sequences and so forth. I liked the fact that there were fewer "hits" trying to surface from bands and the like on the soundtrack of this film than the first. The marketing had done its duty for the first film, and I think the makers of this film knew that, so that died down to allow the film to become more credible, to me.I loved the Doctor Octopus design. It is more like the original character, which they might've learned from the Green Goblin "mistake" of the first movie. Bruce Campbell is in this film as well, as the "snooty usher" so that's humorous (just a bit) to see him again in this line of film's, thanks to Sam Raimi.The directing was out of this world. Great adventurous shots were provided by the crew's "Spidercam" (basically a camera on a zip-line). My favorite part in the movie has got to be the car crashing into a coffee house where Parker and Mary Jane are about to share a kiss, and they both have to dive as this car smashes through the window like nothing I'd seen before. That was a great scene and timing was great in that entire sequence.The negative stuff, I could find anyways, that could've been better are the fighting sequences and weak relationship between Parker and Mary Jane. I hated seeing CG animated characters duking it out on the side of a building and being whipped around as the camera goes haywire and trying to get a clear angle of their fight. That drove me batty a few times. And the relationship between Park and Mary Jane was very frustrating to watch. At times I'd actually catch myself thinking, "Just leave him and do something else. Move somewhere else in the world. Get a job...whatever. This life is gonna be hell with him." And it wasn't improving as the movie went on until she finally caves in to his characterand accepts a rough life as the girl of Spiderman. Whatever...so much drama going back and forth.</fullReview>

After watching the movie and being disappointed, I took notice of the age of the other children leaving the movie. I couldn't believe how many children under 6 I saw in there. I am sorry I took our son to see it and with the way they ended the movie, I'm sure there will be a third, which I won't even bother with.

		<fullReview>I was hoping this would be as good as most people seem to think it is, but it was relatively dull, to me. Spidey agonizes over the choices made at the end of the last movie -- endlessly. Mary Jane helps him agonize -- endlessly. Somewhatsuperfluously, a supervillain is created, causes mayhem, and is defeated. Entirely superflously, Harry Osborn gnashes his teeth and searches - sort of - for his father's killer.  The movie lurches around a bit, high-speed action scenes come to a screeching halt for stumbling non-dialogue scenes about Spidey's life. Some of the jokes fall flat. Sam Raimi's old-school direction is solid as always, but the script lets him down sometimes. I look forward to Spidey3, though. Hopefully a better script can be had. All the pieces are certainly there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For me, one of the best movies in this year!! It has plot, very cute good guy who looks great in Spider-Man costume, fascinating bad guy who decided to be bad after tragedy that happened to him, girl who means everything to Spider-Man and of course, saving the city. In contrary with Spider-Man, in Spider-Man 2 psychological side of characters was developed in less black-white, giving us a more three-dimension characters, especially the main character. In some other superhero movies, superhero was without any problems, especially without ordinary human problems. Here, there is little similarity with Batman, where also was pretty good psychological description of characters. Tobey Maguire is simply great as Spider-Man/Peter Parker, although there could have been paid more attention for some his relations with others (for example, Peter and Aunt May, Peter and Harry - they are also very important to him but it wasn't shown very much). Special effects - I'm speechless (scene at the tower, or on the train, definitely there's nothing to say), masterwork!! I can't wait for Spider-Man 3!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The format works</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While this is not a movie to remember for all time, and it isn't even the best super hero movie (X2, despite the tired plot is still better) this is the first comic conversion that actually fully works on screen. Every aspect of the film that matters is done well. The characters are still paper thin but I do care about them. The story is allowed to work at its own pace without being hijacked by the pixel fiddlers. The humour is not soulless one liners but small moments or fun riffs. Doc Oc using his arms to do four things at once while lighting a cigar, a terrible musical rendition of the old theme tune, and guess what colour bow tie the next green goblin wears? The action scenes are the most effective I have seen since Return of the King (which effectively defined year zero for effects based films). This is partly because they have been done properly, but also because they are done at different tempos. From Doc Ocs harrowing escape from the hospital, to bullet time reflex carnage, to silly pranks at the bank. Like Judge Dredd before it, Spidey has his mask off a little too often for comic fans - but in a film very much about identity, we know this is hollywood trying its best to entertain, and mainly succeeding.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extremely well made and poignantly written</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a rare film in that I think it's clearly better than the first film which is also very good but it's also rare that a superhero story could be so well written and even thought provoking at times! Story picks up after the first film where we see Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) struggling to keep jobs and maintain grades at college and pay the rent and its because of the fact that being Spiderman keeps him very busy. He's still madly in love with Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) who's become an actress and he's still best friends with Harry Osborn (James Franco) who blames Spiderman for the death of his father and Harry is also irked that Peter claims to be friends with his enemy. One day Peter notices his powers dwindling and after making everyone angry for always being late he decides to stop being Spiderman and concentrate on having a normal life!*****SPOILER ALERT*****Peter meets a brilliant scientist named Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina) who is working on physics and fusion and develops something with metal arms that attaches to his spine but something goes horribly wrong and Otto becomes Doc Ock where his mind changes for the worse and he wants to continue his work that may bring New York City to ruins. Peter decides to become Spiderman again and in fighting Doc Ock he learns how valuable he is as a superhero and eventually both Harry and Mary Jane learn of his true identity.This film is once again directed by the visual master Sam Raimi and while this is chock full of CGI effects the one thing that makes this sequel so special is the sensitive script and dialogue. Raimi does a wonderful job of juggling and balancing both the action and the characterizations that have become so vital to the story. Peter has become so disillusioned with being Spiderman that he finds it impossible to have a life and a relationship. I cannot tell you how many scenes there are with Peter talking to various other characters about his troubles and depression without revealing the truth behind them and these scenes for me are the strongest points in the film. Maguire brings real humanity to his role and he handles it with a lot of sensitivity that can make even the harshest of film critics identify with. The action scenes are exciting and they do help balance out the story but the thought provoking dialogue that is spoken by the actors are what's so special here. Raimi directed a film called "A Simple Plan" a few years ago and that was also well acted and written so maybe we shouldn't be surprised when he directs another effort that shares those same splendid attributes</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spider-Man is "disappointing"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't get me wrong, Spider-Man 2 itself is an incredible movie, but the overall theme of the first half of the movie seems to be disappointment. Peter Parker aka "Spider-Man", played by Tobey Maguire, is is having conflicting thoughts about being Spider-Man. First off, he is constantly late for classes, which makes his professor, Doctor Connor disappointed. Then, he never finds time to be with his best friend, Mary Jane Watson, which makes her very disappointed. By the way, Kirsten Dunst, in the spirit of Molly Ringwald, is a really hot redhead. Anyway, the first half of the movie is disappointing. SPOILERS: Peter actually quits as Spider-Man, but he changes his mind with the help of a little Asian girl and his ever-positive Aunt May, who somehow remains positive after Peter tells her that he had a hand in her husband's death. Anyway, Spider-Man 2 is an awesome movie, but does not actually get very exciting until the second half. SPOILERS: Oh yeah, and the entire population of Manhattan must be blind because Doc Ock was recreating his laboratory in the river but no one seemed to notice. The on-screen chemistry between Tobey and Kirsten is good but the end is just a half-hearted attempt at a sequel. I was disappointed when the movie ended and there were no shots of a half-naked Mary Jane wet in the rain. 4/5 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here is the challenge...Has anyone ever managed to get a refund if a movie was disappointing??I saw Spidey 2 the other night and I got bored stiff...The whole thing was a disaster...I should have known that it is very difficult to follow a big hit...The screenplay was badly structured, dialogs were appalling and worst of all was the acting. The original movie was more of a comic strip with plastic character, Sam Raimy's attempt to give them more emotions led to disaster (ie Osborne Junior)I was surprised that Molina not only badly acted, had terrible lines but accepted this role. His evil edge was as patchy as Tom Hardy's Schinzon in Star Trek: Nemesis (or the appalling role of Brian Cox's Stryker in X-Men 2)...Good Lord, where are those superb British talents gone!!True, there were was probably a single action scene worthy of the first movie, the NY Metro chase though it's outcome was pitiful. Spidey flying SFX was another disaster area, John Dykstra messed up this time.In conclusion, an extremely boring and badly sequel to what was (if not the only) an excellent Marvel Comics adaptation. I am sure ain't gonna waste my money on the 3rd one. The last time I was so depressed watching a so-called Hollywood blockbuster was the awful X-Men 2.Now don't get me wrong, I adored the first movie, it was refreshing, well structured and full of vigor and not pretentious.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If crime could be fought this way...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>These movies are rich in terms of images, action and movement thanks to computer tricks but usually poor indeed in terms of ideas and sentiments which is something computers are not yet able to create. Spider-Man 2 also abides by this rule since it has got good and original ideas but the good ones are not original and the original ones are not good. In what refers to sentiments it's not above cheap pink novels level except in the dialogues where Parker's aunt takes part which are very moving sometimes. The old story of the crazy scientist that wants to create new powerful energy sources in order to be able to become master of the world or something like that ultimately, is already worn and weary. And in this movie you never come to understand very well how and why the mechanical arms that he invents come to dominate his brains and seem to proceed by thinking for him. The story of the hero who renounces love to fight crime is also a bit worn and weary. Moreover if crime -- which has got social roots like everybody knows -- could be efficiently fought by any comic strips hero or the like, the problem would have been solved long ago. This being the case, what is left of this movie in positive terms besides the amazing cybernetic images? The rare moments of emotion in the above mentioned dialogues, a very powerful and excellent musical sound track and a few successful situation or visual gags which exploit the na?vet and awkwardness of the Pete Parker character in his normal life, i. e. out of the moments when he personifies Spider-Man. It's very little indeed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wasn't a huge fan of the 1st Sam Raimi Spidey movie but after several of my friends singing the sequels praises I caved and went to see it.Starting very well it was easy to get drawn in and it all seemed very respectful of the comic books. Enter Dr Otto Oktavius, and on come the brakes.Dr Ock should absolutely not be ever portrayed as a misunderstood, slightly ecentric scientist. Otto is by far one of, if not, Spiderman's deadliest arch enemies and is and evil meglomaniac. But okay this is forgivable as long as it's just one change and the rest is quite respectful, but noooo.Peter Parker's whole character for the past thirty odd years has been motivated by his feeling of guilt for the death of Uncle Ben, but here he confesses to Aunt May that it was all his fault and Aunt May after a while forgives him, taking away any motivation for him to be spiderman.The travesty continues when he loses his mask, or rather repeatedly takes it off. The comic books do reveal Spiderman's alter ego as being Peter Parker but when it is done it's so momentous that it takes an age for him to come to terms with. Here Peter whips off the mask when he's surrounded by people on a subway train and again in front of Doctor Octopus and Mary Jane and Harry Osbourne.It seems to me that Sam Raimi does not understand Spiderman at all. Harry Osbourne on the other hand is perfect, he couldn't have nailed him better.All in all the movie is stunning as a superhero movie to as a representation of the well established Spiderman it just plain stinks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With action sequences that drive the plot, a sense of humour and a better villain, this is a vast improvement over its undeservedly successful predecessor.I don't agree that the characters are getting any deeper - we're just seeing more of them. If Mary-Jane loves Peter so much, why's she always flouncing around with other blokes? I think we all get that with great power comes great responsiblah-blah-blah; what I want to know is: why do Spidey's webshooters keep misfiring? It seems to happen when he's suffering from self-doubt, so it must be a Freudian thing.Spidey 2 also suffers from Hollywood's latest ailment - multiple tacked-on endings (see also Minority Report, The Bourne Identity, LOTR: The Return Of The King). Directors and editors take note: we want tingling in our spider-senses, not our backsides.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great sequel with better qualities than the first</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spider-Man broke records and open the audiences eyes when it first came out in May 2002. Nothing can beat that, but this Spider-Man almost did. It's hard to out due the Green Goblin, but Alfred Molina's character as Octopus was excellent. The Green Goblin almost looked fake at times with the all green suit and the fixed helmet that wouldn't move. The story behind how Dr. Otto Octavius ended up with these extra metal arms is intriguing. This Octopus character has an intense presence and powerful force when he attacks Spider-Man. Another story goes on between Peter Parker, taking place 2 years later after the first Spider-Man. Mary-Jane Watson is still in the spotlight role for Peter Parker. It is very interesting how you see Peter Parker go through dilemmas with himself and dealing with him having a dual life of being in college and being a hero. Tobey Maguire seems made for the part. Finally, in Spider-Man 2, his identity is revealed to several important characters and that affects his decisions. Mary-Jane's love story continues with another character yet she begins to realize that her one true love was right under her nose. J.K. Simmons' character as the newspaper editor was hilarious in the first Spider-Man. His character is magnified in this film and his jokes and attitude seems a bit overdone. Overall, this was one of the best sequels I have come across. The story is just as interesting as the action, and there is a lot of eye-popping action. Spider-Man 2 is simply a hit, and there is not another way to put it.**** out of *****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good directing, bad-guy plot isn't good enough</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Went to the Odeon cinema in Swiss Cottage, London. I thought they'd play Ladykillers but when I got there I saw they replaced it with Spiderman. I decided to give it a fair chance. It turned out to be a hilarious evening, but not because of Spidy. Before running the film they had about 30 minutes of various promos. One of them caught me by surprise: the text flashing on the screen, the dramatic, familiar music? 'This Year' starts the trailer 'An epic battle is coming' 'Between the forces of light and darkness' 'A struggle between Good and Evil' 'And only one can emerge victorious'How come they promote Lord of the Rings again? I thought.And then I rolled on the floor when I discovered it's the new promo for a completely different film. If you don't like spoilers then skip the next few lines.&lt;Promo spoiler&gt;Turned out to be the promo of the world's laziest cat. &lt;End of spoiler&gt;Another LOTR gig soon followed: this time a mobile phone promotion by Orange, where Sean Austin is asked by a film board to produce the 4th part of the trilogy. The Shire is now in the distant future, and everyone is now using mobile phones. 'We'll call it ? Lord of the Ringtones', says head of the board. Great ad.Well, that was the best part of the evening. Spidy then started. I've got to say that I didn't particularly like the first installment so my expectations were set to a minimum. I'll cut to the chase: the problem is the plot. It has two interlaced stories: Spidy having an identity crisis, and the usual Spidy-fights-the-bad-guy. The first story is very good, and I'll give it 9 out of 10. Directing is excellent, Toby and Kirsten are doing a good job.I like Kirsten Dunst ? she is an excellent actor who started so young with her amazing role in Interview with a Vampire. Then she did some teen movies like Jumanji and Toy Soldiers ? and now she is really blooming. Reminds me of Jennifer Connelly's career: quite a long way since young Sarah in Labyrinth.&lt;Bit of spoiler&gt;Anyway, going back to the movie: the second part of the plot is simply stupid. The villain is a bare chest mad scientist with flailing mechanical arms. Hardly a match for a New York cop with a cheap revolver, let alone the mighty Spiderman. And the science BS about fusion, especially in the last scene where taxies are being pulled off the streets by the fusion reaction but don't worry, drop the fusion ball to the Hudson and all of the sudden the world is safe. Come on, guys, you'll have to do better in Spiderman 3. A more bullet-proof villain and a bit stronger science would have made the trick. I'll give this part 5 out of 10.&lt;End of spoiler&gt;To summarize: good directing, fair acting, but the bad-guy plot is not good enough to support the film. 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Open Letter to Sam Raimi</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dear Mr. Raimi,You may not remember this, but a few years back I wrote you another open letter here, FURIOUS at the terrible piece of filmmaking, of writing, of sheer BEING that was the original "Spider-Man." It relied too heavily on CGI, it insulted my intelligence, it had gaping holes in its own logic... and then there was that Macy Gray cameo. Yech.Mr. Raimi, props to you sir, PROPS. I didn't think you even read that thing. But you listened, and you responded. You jettisoned screenwriter David Koepp, whose screenplays were always sensational, but typically dumb as rocks. You hired Oscar-winner Alvin Sargent to write your screenplay, and hired your old cinematographer Tim Pope, from your Army of Darkness days, to shoot your movie.The special effects were subtle and you focussed on the story. Character took precedence over choking your audience on CGI. The story had five recognizable acts, and each character was given their chance to shine.Yes, you brought everyone back, and found something for them to do. Timid Tobey Maguire, Emotionally Conflicted Kirsten Dunst... you even had the courage to bring back James Franco, even though it's now apparent his career is going nowhere. A bold step, but you make it work for you. I'm talking about the ending. You know what I mean.You could've gone with a big star for Doc Ock, but instead you picked a great ACTOR, one who was right for the part-- the superb Alfred Molina. And then you let him ACT, rather than hiding him with effects the entire movie-- much like Willem Dafoe in the first film.I had low expectations for this film, but you blew me through the back wall of the theater. You CAN direct a summer blockbuster, you CAN strike an excellent balance between action and drama. You know when to restrain yourself (excellent use of silence), and you know when to just let it fly (the scene on the train almost made me cry). This is what happens when a director and writer are MORE talented than their actors. It doesn't happen a lot, but this film made me proud to be your fan. Even the opening credits were supremely clever, showing us the highlights of the first film so we didn't have to sit through that garbage ever again.Topping yourself for a "Spider-Man 3" is not going to be easy. Some filmmakers might even be tempted to take a step backward. Some might say it's never even been pulled off, ever-- witness Superman III, Batman Returns, Alien3 or The Godfather Pt. III. All were sad disappointments compared to what came before... but after seeing "Spider-Man 2," I believe. I believe, Mr. Raimi, and I know you can follow your own creative talents and create an even better, more impressive third film, given the time and people with whom to collaborate.Just don't write it. Know where your talent lies... and where people like Alvin Sargent and Bill Pope (and Michael Chabon) can help make you the best filmmaker you can possibly be.Warmest Personal Regards,10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Spider-Man 2" is even better than its predecessor. The characterization goes much deeper and the relationships get more complicated. Tobey Maguire's Peter Parker lets us know something that most superhero movies don't: being a superhero is a real time-sucker. His yearnings - for his own life, to be a better student, for Mary Jane Watson - are poignant and you find yourself agreeing that yes, he should be able to live life without the responsibility of keeping people safe and alive. But looking away is hard to do...Kirsten Dunst's Mary Jane has really grown since the last movie. She's confident, has a thriving career, and won't put up with Peter's crap even if she does still love him. By the end (and a happy ending at that!) she's proven that she's not a damsel-in-distress but someone who doesn't need to be shielded from the difficulties of life.Solid performances by all of the cast, many hints about future flicks, and all-around good fun. The only complaint I have (and it's not a very big one) is how many times Peter whips off that mask for people....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After Shrek 2 ended all comparisons to its original, Spiderman 2 is a fantastic movie that has a double dose of all the great ingredients that made the first Spiderman a great film. Everyone probably knows by now that the action scenes Are perfectly executed. I'm still trying to figure out how they shot some of them. There is a bigger, badder, and extremely more powerful villain as Dr. Octavius holds the "power of the sun in the palm of his hand." I liked the ending of the sequel much more than the first. It didn't seem to leave you hanging as much. Despite being a comic-book hero action film, the movie has its emotional/romantic scenes, which are much better than the ones in the first film. From what it seems, there's definitely going to be quite a few Spiderman flicks in the future!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is going to be brief. It's better than the first by being a sequel - we already know the character so the film is based on the struggles of Spiderman/Parker. Spiderman has issues in this second film and highlights that even superheros have limits. And Parker, of course struggles with more agony over MJ.Don't let me put you off it is not all down in the dumps kind of stuff. The comedy element of the film is superb, a refreshing change. Meanwhile, the bad guys in the form of Harry Osbourne and Doc Ock are also very complimentary to Spidey.They even managed to fit in good IL' Stan Lee in a wonderful 1 second cameo! If you liked the first then the 2nd is an absolute must. I loved it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The first time was the charm...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Somewhere along the way, the makers of SPIDER-MAN 2 couldn't decide whether they were making an all-out action flick or a soft-core soap opera with the accent on Spidey's melancholy love affair with Mary Jane. The balance between action, humor and love story has been so skewered by what seems like the intrusion of action scenes that this one doesn't work as well as the first. Apparently, the makers wanted to humanize Tobey's character as much as possible.None of the fault lies in the performances. Tobey Maguire is genuinely effective in making us see Spider-Man's humanity. In fact, he's so good that if this guy ever gets a really deep character role to play, he's going to win some big prizes (aside from financial ones). He's a very sensitive actor, as revealed in THE CIDER HOUSE RULES.Kirsten Dunst does her usual nice job as Mary Jane but there's a little too much of her long pauses between dialog to gaze intimately at Spidey. James Franco is fine as Harry Osborn who may in time become Spider-Man's next opponent if the ending of this one gives us a clue.But acting honors this time really go to Rosemary Harris, so warm and human as Aunt May, and J.K. Simmons as the harried headline-chasing editor of New York's most tabloid newspaper. Cliff Robertson does nicely as Uncle Ben Parker.Naturally, all of the special effects are mind boggling and the villain of the piece (Doc Ock) with his octopus-like mechanical arms is given plenty of action once his character is established. But personally, I preferred William Dafoe's villainy much more than Albert Molina's attempt to be Doc Ock. Not liking the villain of the piece is enough to make me give the first Spidey film a higher rating.Elfman's musical score is excellent. Most impressive stunt in the whole film is the way Spidey stops a runaway train from a disastrous fate.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A superior blockbuster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In most recent years the summer months have brought an endless stream of blockbuster drivel. I was beginning to think that the art of making movies was being lost to the insatiable thirst of the production companies desire to bank as much money as possible each season.Spiderman 2 has restored my faith. It's got everything you come to expect from a blockbuster; it's got action, thrills and spills, a romance, comedy, drama and tragedy. Fortunately it's also got what you don't expect ... It's good !!! The main reason for this is the way all the characters are fleshed out. The good guys have problems and flaws whilst the bad guys are really bad through circumstances rather than through choice. In my opinion this is much better than the original and leaves you looking forward to the next film which again is unusual.This franchise is still revving up and could be the biggest thing of the naughties. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. Everyone's complaints on the first were pretty much the same. Weak special effects and poor character development left us with a bit of a hollow feeling. This sequel is far superior on both fronts. Tobey Maguire has made Peter Parker/Spiderman HIS role. His turn as Parker is more impressive than that of the masked hero. Dr. Ock played by the surprisingly cast (always excellent)Alfred Molina is a terrific villain and this is where the special effects really shine. The only real weakness in this one was the strength of the first: Kirstin Dunst just doesn't bring her usual sparkle. As a matter of fact, she looks a tad under the weather in most scenes with her bad hair and bad make-up. I have often said she could be the next Julia Roberts, but this one is a step in the wrong direction. Of course, we have the mile wide opening for the next sequel and it will be interesting to see if all the key players re-sign. This is one not to be missed if you want to see a comic hero done right.</fullReview>

The battles between Doc Ock and Spiderman are intense and visually stunning (the multiple arms are played up terrifically).I only took one point away for a silly, pointless plot element regarding Spidey having problems with his powers.

		<fullReview>I don't have much good to say about the first half of this movie. Spider angst, no organizational skills, and no social skills threaten to make Peter Parker into one of the great losers of cinematic history. And then the director beats on that concept like a rented mule. He is almost such a shmuck you don't care whether he succeeds or not, which is probably not the target response for your hero. Huge gaps in logic as Spidey's strength comes and goes but ending in a feat of strength so impressive, you absolutely know Sam Raimi has never read one of the comic books that generated his leading man, nor has he considered how that one feat conflicts with any other physical limitation the character has ever shown. Alfred Molina is a breath of fresh air into what starts out as a pretty silly movie. He steals every scene he is in and to me is as good a supervillain as Jack Nicholson was in the original Batman(high praise, for a smaller part). The movie starts out as a video rental but pulls together so strong at the finish that I have to recommend it, although this one seems more geared to older teens than the single digit fans of the first film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First, I liked Amazing Spider-Man (aka S-M 2), but I didn't leave with the same satisfaction that I did with the first installment. The storytelling was richer in round one, not nearly as jumpy; S-M 3 lacked a lot of fluidity. Yes, the special effects were there-- and some of them blatantly so (was I watching the VG or was I at the movies?!) but the combination of a multitude of Spidey stories left the plot weak and unsubstantial (which is a shame, considering Michael Chabon worked on the screenplay). I thoroughly enjoyed the use of the image from the cover of the 1967 #50 Amazing S-M comic-- where Peter throws his Spidey outfit in the trash-- as well as the struggle that Peter has determining what is right, what is wrong, and how he fits into the context. Would I go see it again? Maybe at the $1 show. Would I buy it on DVD? Most likely, no.</fullReview>

Octopus, only referred to once by his new name, and mostly called Octavious, was awesome, and should be commended for a wonderful acting job and the computer generation people should take themselves out to dinner. But the plot seemed to revolve primarily around Spidey's psychological drama. Its almost like Spiderman: The Lifetime Special. (one out of every 10 spidermen suffer from depression.)

		<shortDescription>Incredibly dull in the middle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, if you have seen Superman II, you already know the basic plot of this film. There is nothing original about this film except the villain, who indeed is very cleverly portrayed. Everything else is a rehash of the first Spider-man or other superhero movies.Second, the middle hour of this film is incredibly dull. I don't mean a little dull. I mean downright boring. The kid next to me was fidgeting like crazy as Spidey went through the standard Superman II crisis of confidence. There were just completely inexplicable extended scenes of Tobey Maguire stumbling around town (a highly fictionalized NYC) doing absolutely nothing (for those who have seen the film, just exactly why did they have to spend 30 seconds showing, from several different angles as if this was a replay of a touchdown at the Superbowl, him falling down in the street?). My jaw practically dropped when "Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head" from "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" played (it was brilliant in Butch Cassidy, pointless here). The speeches by Spidey's aunt - heck, her entire plot line - were absolutely banal, and Maguire had absolutely no chemistry with her at all. None.Third, the screenwriting is amateurish. Minor characters are introduced - a slim girl who obviously likes Spidey and puts some awkward moves on him, for instance - and then disappear without a trace. Really terrific cameos - Bruce Campbell as a snide usher - were pretty much wasted and just show what might have been accomplished by better lead actors. Willem Dafoe shows just how great a villain he was in the first Spiderman in a brief appearance at the end of the film. There is nothing remotely as good in this film as he was as the Green Goblin.Fourth, the acting is terrible. Tobey Maguire is so dull it is difficult to describe. I don't think he had his heart in this film. If being expressionless, passive and indifferent is great acting, though, he should win the Oscar.Kirsten Dunst is a good actress but wildly miscast. She doesn't vaguely resemble the top fashion model she is supposed to be. I give her credit for injecting what few moments of emotional realism exist in this film. Unfortunately, you can see her straining to project anything authentic against the wooden Maguire.I could continue - the plot makes no sense, characters do things in ordinary circumstances that no normal person in the world would ever do, the plot of the entire first quarter of the movie that Spidey can't make a decent living appears and disappears for no reason - but I think the point is made. Don't believe the hype. This is not a good movie unless you are a die-hard Spider-man fan. People in our theater were laughing at inappropriate times, such as when the leads tried to feign liking each other. The special effects are good, but nothing else. The film could have been cut a good hour and lost nothing, it is way too long as is. For the kids, and at most only worth seeing once.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When a director of such films as the Evil Dead series wants to go into making a superhero movie you'd normally think it'd be a lesser known hero such as Darkman, which yes of course Sam Raimi did also direct. Then he has also now directed two of my favorite superhero movies to date. Both of course being Spider-man, now the first had it's good and bad points and in all honesty the end did disappoint a little but it was still entertaining enough to watch over and over. The second isn't much different (although I would probably choose to avoid the drive in and becoming a blood bank for the friendly neighborhood mosquitoes). Again a lot of the cast from the first movie is here, Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst even Bruce Campbell and Willem Defoe makes an appearance at the end to set up the third installment. One of the things that I liked straight away however was the recap from the first in the opening credits, just shots from it and not a TV show 'and here's what happened last time' moment.And so to start, Spiderman (Tobey Maguire) is a hero who's only real enemy other than criminals has to be the Daily Bugel but not even that can keep him down that is until he finally realises that what he's doing is hurting Peter Parker's life. He's losing the girl that he loves, he's always late from his job AND his school and he's falling behind on his rent too. And so what does he do? Gives up the superhero life, discards the old red and blue suit and continues his life as Peter. But when the new bad guy in town Dr. Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina), or Dr. Octapus as J. Jonah Jameson (J.K. Simmons) so affectionately calls him, kidnaps Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) then Spiderman has to come out of hiding and take on yet another enemy. Filled with great computer generated graphics and some good fighting scenes Spider-man in my opinion improves where Sam Raimi originally left off and Harry Osborne's (James Franco) descent into madness and the second Green Goblin was also quite well executed whether or not this series will improve once more with a third installment it's not so simple to see however Spiderman 2 certainly does the Marvel comics and Sam Lee credit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but... not THAT good.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really enjoyed Spiderman 2... but not as much as I expected to. Overall it didn't feel as well balanced as the first one. It seemed to spend overly long bludgeoning us (the audience) over the head with how horrible Tobey's life is and how he's so down on his luck and blah, blah, blah. It was just too much. It just got to the point that it wasn't authentic/genuine and it just came off as brutish (rather than artistic finesse). I think if they'd trimmed that stuff off a bit then it would've been much tighter and more enjoyable because the story wouldn't drag in places. Some elements of the story were obviously in the script ONLY to add depth to the characters - primarily the whole aspect of Aunt May losing her home, etc... That scenario may have been intended to somehow reflect Tobey's internal conflict, or buttress the effect his conflict on on us, but all it ended up doing for me was weighing down the story. Every time we had another "Aunt May scene" I would inwardly groan, sigh, and just hope it wouldn't be too excruciating. It's sad that they didn't come up with a more valid way of incorporating Aunt May this second time around. On the positive side of things though, the effects were tremendous (of course), and everyone did a fantastic job of acting. My favorite element of the Spiderman series of films is the villains - who are so fascinating because of their humanity and complex underlying motivations. Anyway, like I said earlier, I did enjoy it, but it just had too much of boring Aunt May scenes, and not enough substance on some of the other major plot point scenes. As good as the first Spiderman? Definitely not. In fact I'd say it's above the crappy Batman sequels (3 &amp; 4), but below the rest of the comic superhero movies in quality.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although Spider-Man is my favourite Marvel character, having grown up on the cartoons as a kid, alongside The Incredible Hulk, the first movie didn't get me up that much. This second movie, however, has me totally taken.It's rock solid stuff. The acting is top notch, the special effects, though obviously fake, is absolutely breath-taking and the drama is completely captivating. I recommend this movie highly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is even better than the first one! When he's not falling from great heights, Spidey is magnificent, graceful, explosive and just out and out a beautiful sight to see as he goes spinning his webs throughout the city! Despite all the personal problems he faces he still manages to come out a winner in this one. The first scene with Doc Ock and his invention, the snatching of Aunt May, the fight with the Doc on the train and Spidey's attempts to stop a runaway train are splendid examples of how to do a movie right. I even saw a bit of the Matrix moves intelligently spun into the action scenes. Talk about catch your breath, put you on the edge of your seat action. I recommend this film in all its respects...even at the point where there's a bit too much dialogue slowing it down in some areas, it's not enough to dampen what is essentially a visual and aural delight. Don't waste time...Go see this one!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally...a HUMAN superhero!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After leaving the movie theater, I said to my husband, "This is the best superhero movie I've ever seen," and I meant it! I could FEEL Peter Parker's anguish about leading a double life. Some scenes, I think, were pure genius in relaying the emotions of the characters involved (SPOILER ALERT).... like, when Peter told M.J. he was Superman over the disconnected telephone, or when M.J. kisses her fiancee "upside-down," and you KNOW what and who she's really thinking about. And, of course, when he decides to not be Spiderman anymore, he does so by telling his Uncle in his daydream.Then, there are the funny moments (much more prevalent than the first Spiderman)....like when Peter Parker webs the slice of pizza out of a guy's mouth, and when he can't get all the brooms back into the broom closet, and, of coarse, the GREAT scene after he decides not to be Spiderman and the Soundtrack is playing the classic song: "Raindrops keep falling on my head..." and then he trips!!! (hilarious!) I could go on and on (especially about the publisher's character fretting over the cost of his son's wedding....and the price of the caviar!!)I could go on and on and on....The very best part, of course, is the end. A movie with a good ending is always worthwhile. But, this movie, had a GREAT ending....what more could be said?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The greatest thing I have ever seen in my life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It has often been the case with me that movies and events never seem to live up to the hype that I allow myself to be drawn in to. I remember collecting everything I could find that had "Batman Forever" on it before the movie came out, reading the book, listening to the soundtrack, getting all the glasses from McDonald's, etc, making a T-shirt to wear on opening night, then burning the thing shortly after and using the glasses to serve cat food. Complete and total dissapointment was an understatement at the time. Needless to say, I have been cautious since then, trying not to expect too much from any one movie. After all, it's just a movie, right?It's safe to say that I took a very careful approach to the first Spider-man, trying not to expect too much, but knowing I had high hopes nonetheless. It's almost impossible as a dedicated Evil Dead fan to not want Sam Raimi to do well, to rise to directorial prominance among the Hollywood elite. I can't say this was done with the first movie, but it was pretty darn close; Spider-man was an excellent movie and I expected the same from #2.To my surprise, Spider-man 2 was not everything I could have imagined; it was more. I was on a roller coaster of emotion from the opening credits to the final spidey slinging sequence.Writing this, I'm having a hard time trying to think of anything bad in the entire movie. I don't think enough can be said about the action and special effects. The fight sequences were original, fast-paced, and flat-out amazing. The motion was extremely fluid and it was hard to figure out where the actors ended and the cgi began. The story was off-the-charts. Characters were developed in full and the actors executed the roles to perfection (I couldn't imagine anyone else playing any of the characters; casting was meticulous and flawless).Other reviews will talk about what happened in the movie, the Evil Dead homage paid by Sam Raimi, the crookedness of Kirsten Dunst's teeth, and whatever else they want to talk about. But I'm done, save this last comment: having cried the entire movie because of the sadness, happiness, giddiness, horror, and wonder I experienced during this work of art, I can safely say that it was the greatest movie I have ever seen in my life.And stop making references to Superman 2.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first went to see this movie,I thought:"Omg this is gonna be great",because I loved the first movie and Spiderman in general. The beginning was good,I was liking it;it showed what was going on in peter Parker's life since the last time that we saw him. And it went on,I was liking it...but by the middle(ish),It got a bit confuzing.... All the events in the movie started happening &amp; I didn't know what the hell was going on.The villain,"doc ock",decides that he should become evil for some reason...hum,yes..And then when he kidnaps Aunt May,she gets flung about 50 feet into the air and latches on to a statue on the side of a building,and still manages to hold on!I mean come on,An other woman of her age would probably have a heart attack if she got thrown in the air ,not to mention the fact that she manages to hold on to that statue throughout the hole thing,which is a bit implausible... And the love story between Peter &amp; MJ was, I think,unnecessary due to its all-round "crappiness". But the real achillies heal of this movie is the ENDING!!OMG I was literally going:"Whaaa???Why??Who wrote this??!!etc etc.." It was absolutely incomprehensible,It looked like it was put together with Random ideas(Kinda like this review lol :^). But,its not a "bad" movie,its just an average movie,but its an average movie thats gonna rake in the cash and I'm sure of that...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mild spoilers in this....Well, I was kind of disappointed. Don't get me wrong, its still a good film, but I just left feeling a little disappointed. I personally didn't think Doc Oc was as good as green goblin in terms of evil guys, and way less attention was really placed on him and his role. I still don't even get why he had to have the tentacles in the first place - was it just me or did they kind of skip over that bit too quickly? And so what if he had the power of the sun - what was he going to do with it? They didn't really address that very well.I also thought they emphasised too much on the whole spiderman/peter parker/mj relationship and there were too many slow scenes. Oh, and don't you think that out of all those people who saw him unmasked on that 'outdoor nyc subway', that one of them would have ratted him out to the press?I knew it was going to be hard to match up the the first one, especially seeing how Spiderman was 'born'. Still, I did find myself liking this film, especially the way spidey was down on his luck and turned his back on spiderman for a while. It was was also nice to see them kiss at the end and work it out, even if it was a little corny. Overall, 7/10. Kind of worried about the 3rd one thats obviously coming... maybe it should have just stopped at number 2... just look at what happened to the batman movies!</fullReview>

The first one was pretty much a teen movie with action, a real disappointment to me.Now Spiderman 2 on the other hand was a real surprise. A clever and entertaining written screenplay, which is a miracle when you see how many writers they hired, dark, witty and action packed. The teen movie status transformed into a young adult movie and it worked. Sam Raimi is more confident what he wanted this film to be. You can tell he had a lot more doing in this film than in the first one. Overall an very enjoyable and Thrilling ride you get for 8,50 but its worth it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Light , but public spoiler... This was a well done, Spiderfan pleasing film. IF you like Spiderman, you will LOVE this film. If you don't like the superhero genre, then don't waist your money, it's way over your head and you'll spend way too much time analyzing it. Raimi has done his homework on this one and gets into the psyche of all the lead characters, a whole newer and better view of Doc Oct, definitely pegged Peter Parker, a better view of Aunt Mae, JJ , Robbie and harry. Personally, I don't like his version of MJ although Kirsten is fine in and for the role. (ok Kirsten is just fine anyway you look at it) and John Jameson was just poor (acting and presence)As a plus though William Dafoes cameo as Normans ghost is wonderful as we now introduce a 3rd potential Super villains for the third film. The film does create a few wild theories in the Sci Fi world, but as in all good SciFi , it makes the rules and then Keeps to them. (Wow if Star Wars could only have done that in Episode I and II)Enough said,Enjoy the show</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than most people are saying.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen where many people have down played the movie. I saw it last night so the movie is fresh on my mind. I was a big Spiderman fan before the first movie came out. I agree with the people who say that at one point in the movie that move the "Spiderman story" along quite quickly, but for the most part the people watching that movie are not going to notice or don't know the story as well as some people. As far as acting goes. Their was one part in the movie in which the acting by McGuire is not that great, other than that one instance, I saw no reason to get my feathers ruffled like I've seen in some people.Another thing I've seen people talk about are things like how the actor seems like he's about to fall asleep during the movie. Well my friend you don't know anything about Spiderman, and the other thing is everybody thinks they are trying to turn it into a Dawson's Creek story for teenagers. The people who say this are people who think they know the story of Spiderman, but just know the villains and assume the story. Spiderman had always been torn because being a hero always made his personal life very hard and at some times impossible. Being Spiderman has (and if they do 3 right) and will always cause him much heartache and sadness.As far as the love part goes. Mary Jane Watson was his crush that he never got over because he had known her for so long. He is the only super hero that we are ever let into their mind about someone they like. Superman, we know he liked Lois and they got married. Batman, he doesn't like anyone and keeps everything inside, but Spiderman we get to see his emotions because they play a major part in his actions. The whole thing about Spiderman is always wanting something you can't have. Weither it be the job, grades, friends, or even "the girl." Thats the Spiderman story. If they did it any different, it wouldn't be right.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I honestly think that this movie was the best sequel ever made. I know that many will argue that but, this is MY take on the movie right? I believe that "Doc Ock" was a way better villain than "Green Goblin" was. Don't get me wrong, Mr. Osborn was excellent as a villain but, Dr. Octavius was better. A lot better. This movie had me on the edge of my seat way more than the first installment of it did. I think that the action sequences are better because of the technological advances since the first (No more cartoon-like Tobey's flying around in this one). The characters have grown so much in this movie and the story lines have developed more. I know that you cannot judge the greatness of a movie by the box office totals but, just look at them. Overall excellent movie!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good but over-rated sequel to the blockbuster of 2002 has the titled character (Tobey Maguire) being torn between his personal life and the life of his alter ego. Of course he is in love with childhood friend Kirsten Dunst (who has had her dreams of becoming an actress become reality in this installment), he worries constantly about his elderly aunt (Rosemary Harris) and the fact that she is about to be evicted from her home and he continues to have a strained friendship with James Franco (who is obsessed with getting revenge on Spider-Man after his father was killed at the conclusion of the original). Also Maguire struggles with fatigue, an inability to pay apartment rent, mediocre college grades and a lack of steady work. Soon he questions if giving up the things in life that are most important to him is worth being a famed crime-fighter. And of course as all this transpires a brilliant scientist (Alfred Molina) is transformed into a crazed monster that is half man and half mechanical octopus after a freak science accident (which happened to be funded by Franco and his dad's old company). Dunst's engagement to newspaper editor J.K. Simmons' astronaut son and Molina's siege upon the city further escalate Maguire's mental and emotional dilemmas. "Spider-Man 2" is a highly ambitious production (as was its predecessor), but really there may be a little too much substance here. The shared wish of a love affair between Maguire and Dunst borders on being annoying as the series threatens to become a soap opera rather an action saga. Really the screenplay (by Alvin Sargent who is best known for "Ordinary People" of all things) tries to do way too much. I thought the various aspects of the original's screenplay were more than sufficient to the overall effectiveness of the finished product. Director Sam Raimi (who can definitely direct films of this type with triumphs "Darkman" and "Spider-Man") goes wild with special effects and crazed explosions that try to hide the pretentious script. This is successful for the most part, but honestly there were few new things to make this one stand any higher than any other production of the genre. Maguire and Dunst seem to be two performers who are stuck at 16. They just do not work great as adult performers. Maguire is best when he is Spider-Man and not Peter Parker. Dunst's routine borders on being a spoiled whiner. Molina is solid and he does as Dafoe did originally: he gives substance and believability to an unbelievable character. The rest of the players are all hit and miss caricatures. Distracting cameos by Dafoe and Cliff Robertson are silly gimmicks that were not needed and the film has a real problem with pacing as it runs a bit too long. There are tons of shortcomings with "Spider-Man 2", but I expected them all along. The movie does live up to its ability to entertain and interest. In a film of this type that is enough to give a positive rating. Not quite as good as the original, but still a worthy addition to the series. 4 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spiderman 2, while not oscar worthy(I don't know why some people are saying that), is certainly one of the better movies in the past 2 years, but I don't think it surpasses the first one. I liked the first one better mainly because we get to see how Parker first learns he's got superpowers and how he learns to use them. There were many funny scenes at the beginning and the first one had more action. But, Spiderman 2 is just a hare behind, mainly because it is not as funny. I really liked the plot development. Because this is not just some action film with a bunch of explosions; the whole story revolves around Peter Parker and his crush Mary Jane. The story is going some place and along the way Parker must deal with villians who terrorize the city and put those he cares about in danger.The sequel had less action, but the quality was much better. While watching Spiderman, I would sit there and think, that's just a computer Spiderman. But, in the sequel, it is hard to tell the difference between the person and the computer Spiderman. The whole bank robbery and fight scene while climbing a building was so amazing. Some how they made Doc Ock's arms look real while climbing and punching Spiderman. Then the other big fight scene happens at the top of a clock tower and on a train. It was some really neat stunts and just incredible CGI.Some other great scenes were when Peter tells Aunt May what really happened to Uncle Ben, the party scene between Harry and Peter, at the party when MJ tells Peter her disappointment with him, Spiderman in the elevator, and I could list many more.Also, the special effects with Doc Ock's arms were more than amazing. They looked so real at times. And I liked the explanation the movie gives as to how the arms actually think for Dr. Ock.FINAL VERDICT: A must see.</fullReview>

The fact that he started losing his superpowers due to emotional stress, for example. I found it interesting that he loses his mask a few times and people discover his identity; they tried hard not to reveal his identity in the first movie, in this movie they seemed to be revealing his identity to almost everyone!I liked Dr. Octopus. I did find the background to his story a little unbelievable. He invents his artificially intelligent bionic arms that interface to his spinal cord. But he invented them simply as tools for his main project which was nuclear fusion research. I'd say that the invention of these arms were enough by themselves.Basically little things pleased me about this movie. But sometimes big things didn't.</fullReview>

It had great 3D effects, a decent plot dealing with the beginning of Spiderman, but a mixed bag coming from the acting department."Spider-Man 2" was exactly the same experience for me.

Tobey Maguire, for some reason, just doesn't cut it for me, and I can't determine exactly why that is. If it's the theory of a skittish teen suddenly morphing into an unstoppable web-slinging crimefighter than it can't be the actor. But if it's just me coming away thinking the role would be better suited for somebody else, I guess it is the actor.That quite sums up what this movie franchise is shaping up to be for me. Neutral films counterbalanced down the middle by the good and the bad. The door has been left wide open for at least another 2 movies, so I'll likely see Spidey 3 and hope it will be the one that breaks out of this state of neutrality."Spider-Man 2" gets 5 of 10 stars</fullReview>

This movie, while having it's own charm and a few good laughs, was a total let-down, both as a stand-alone movie and when compared to the original. I will now list the problems. a) Tobey Maguire - I'm starting to get really sick of this guy. His sole quality that makes him good for this role is the fact that people like seeing him get the daylights beaten out of him (maybe that's just me). He's stiff, boring, and makes Spidey's one-liners feel like a children's joke book. Except for the "This is really heavy" line. That was good. b) Aunt May - WAAAAAAY too much of the old lady. Her presence dragged down practically every scene, mostly from the recognition that her character is a clich. During the "I believe there's a hero in everyone" monologue, I could almost smell the Hollywood on her breath. Did Spielberg write this or something? c) The Cake Scene - this just made me angry. Yes, Peter's eating cake with his landlord's daughter who has a crush on him. Yes, it's a girl who isn't Kirsten Dunce. What's the point? d) All the pap - 'nuff said</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spiderman an Oscar worthy movie?? haha in what galaxy are the 2 people that wrote that from? people please read this if you want an accurate review OK....this movie was very entertaining and visually good with good special effects and a pretty good story but everything else was average at best!..toby mcguire can act actually but he did not do well in spiderman nor did he need to! all he needed to do was be a nerd when he was not in costume and spin webs when he was in costume, so in that sense he did fine. Kirstin dunce!! woops i mean dunst cannot act at all, she is another drew barymore is all but uglier!..and the acting by the rest of the cast was mediocre, I'm not saying this was a bad film, but it chaps my butt when i see so many people saying how awazing it was , give me a break both superman 1 and 2 were 10 times better then this, superman was the best hero/character movie , and even the hulk movie was better then spiderman...spidy gets a 7 out of 10 for me by all means its worth seeing but its not Oscar worthy nor is it worth 9 dollars, matine at best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable, but so was Bring it On.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was one of the few who did not like the first movie too much, where its bad acting and 'great' story of adolescence was wasted on me. With the big hype for the second movie, I expected more - better acting, better story, and basically a better movie.Well, I will say that I enjoyed this movie a lot more than the first one but that's only because they decided to add so many cheesy one-liners, overly dramatic scenes, too-well scripted scenes, and fan-service. Basically, most of my laughter and enjoyment was derived from points that I think the filmmakers didn't plan for. The acting was subpar on the part of James Franco, who I like, but I will say that was because of direction and his character. Tobey and Kirsten do a lot better this time around, and the other supporting characters really do shine.Story-wise, it was better. I was surprised a few times that they decided to go a certain way already and my prediction for the villain of the third movie that I gathered since the first seems to be pretty much set (with possibilities of more). The plot and characters were a lot more developed, spending time to accentuate those that needed it. However, there were many times scenes were used that were just irrelevant or longer than needed, its pacing was off, and the change between scenes was odd making me stop and wonder why.So, basically compared to the first, it is better, but I say not by much. I don't think this was as well-polished as X2 and definitely had flaws. I'm not quite sure why they are making out Spiderman to be Superman because Spiderman should not be that strong and it makes him out to be invincible, which was never the case.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too much violence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see this with my sons and their friends (8-11 years old). I found the scene with the doctors a little over the edge. There was no indication of the amount of violence we would see until this scene. A comic book hero is going to be appealing to a younger than 13 crowd. Why make it for 13 and up? It could have been done with out the scenes being as violent. Too bad that Hollywood is so careless with their audience. Good plot, just make sure your child has been desensitized prior to watching... It was a good plot and the characters were interesting. There was so much to the movie that was positive. It was a shame they put so much violence into the mix. Have they ever thought of releasing an PG version for younger kids?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great summer movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After Spider-Man's box office success, the incredible media hype, and the rumors about Tobey Maguire opting out, I honestly didn't have much faith in this film. I was worried that it would be a sub-par affair designed solely to reap profits from the cash cow that was the original. (Think, Matrix: Revolutions)I couldn't have been more wrong. This film actually exceeded the first in almost every aspect. The writing was smarter than can usually be expected from a summer blockbuster. It was true to the spirit of Stan Lee's comic book work, without being too clichd or campy. Now, before die-hard fans of the comic books jump all over me, I am aware that the storyline has been changed dramatically from the graphic novels, but, it seems that Sam Raimi, Alvin Sargent, and crew did their best to be respectful to Mr. Lee's work. J.K. Simmons' portrayal of J. Jonah Jameson was boisterous and funny without being too over the top. Maguire's performance seemed to add more depth to the characters of Parker/Spidey than in the original. Horrible films such as Bring It On and The Crow: Salvation (sacrilege!) notwithstanding, Kirsten Dunst is actually a very talented actress. This is not a role that will garner her an Oscar, but, she did a very passable job as Mary Jane. Alfred Molina's depiction of Dr. Octavius/Doc Ock stole the show here. A bit more explanation of the AI of his tentacles, and the motivation behind them would have been welcome, but Molina did an outstanding job with this character. Add to this a quite proficient supporting cast, and you have the makings of a quite enjoyable film. Some of the flashbacks with Uncle Ben were pretty contrived, but, not so much as to take you out of the moment.CGI Spidey was well-done, without being overdone, as were the rest of the effects. Great eye-candy, without detracting from the film itself. With technology today, it would be easy to let computer effects take over the movie (remember The Hulk?), but, luckily, some restraint was shown here.Final Verdict: A great escapist, action flick with a little bit of substance thrown in for good measure. You get superb effects, a love triangle, a vulnerable super-hero, great story, above par acting (for a summer blockbuster), and enough teasers to make you eagerly await the third installment. What else do you need? 7/10Rex</fullReview>

It should be a fantastic, stylish, comic book movie.The action and special effects are great. The acting is above par for this kind of film.

		<shortDescription>Good...But No Movie is Perfect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Review: This movie shows that we cannot have everything we want. That what you want is not always there and what is there is not always what you want. The difference I see between the first movie is Peter Parker trying to deal with everyday life that people SEE and his alter-ego that is Spider-Man. The action is great but the points in the movie that show the most intrigue are the emotional conflicts and challenges with Peter and others around him. There are quite a few 'fluff' moments between Peter and Mary Jane. And then there are conflicts between Harry and Peter that cause Harry to question Peter's motives. Not to mention the problems faced with Aunt May. Filled with these conflicts Peter must learn how to deal with them without giving his true identity up.Rating Explanation: Filled with a good dose of action and double the amount of emotional conflict, Spider-Man 2 definitely deserves an 8. No movie is perfect and that is why there is not a higher rating. With a few corny parts, to much of the loving moments, and not quite as much action I was expecting, I gave this an 8 out of 10.'Best Picture' Quality?: This is a question that has been on the boards for a while. Should Spider-Man 2 be 'Best Picture' or even be nominated? Sure this movie is a 'Summer Blockbuster' but 'Best Picture' quality, I think not. This movie is good and has a lot of points that could possible get it nominated: good storyline, awesome plot, most of all a moral. But this movie is highly overrated. There was and still is too much hype for this movie and that is what I think influenced some of the perfect 10 votes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A good solid movie... but seemed to lack the tight pace and flow of the original. Had some great scenes but the story didn't seem to hold together as well as the original. There were several bad scenes that should have been edited out. It's not that they were slow ... every action movie needs some slow parts ... its just that they didn't seem to fit. Examples : Peter's 'dream' about his uncle (just an odd and redundant scene). Aunt May's big long speech while she's moving (too long winded ... a few cleverly spoken words would have worked much better here). Spider man getting carried by the crowd in the train (just weird, awkward and melodramatic). The kids who find spider man's mask "we won't tell" (cringe inducing cheese). Of course there some great scenes to compensate for these bad ones... but with a little more editing this movie could have been made far better. 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad dialogue, OK story, Great effects, but just a Good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is for people who have already told themselves they're going to love it no matter what. I saw it last night and I was pretty disappointed. I loved the first one, and I don't think this one lived up to it's "better than the first" billing. Yes, the action is better, and even the special effects are amazing, but the story and flow are definitely sub-par. And don't even get me started on the dialogue. Alright, I'll start...I defended the bad dialogue in the first movie because I said it was how characters talked in a comic book. However, this time around, the dialogue used was by people who are morons. Take, for example, anything Mary Jane says. My favorite line of hers was when Peter asked her to go get some Chow Mein, and she rudely retorted "Peter, I'm engaged!" As if people who are engaged can never go out to eat with anybody ever. Or the exchange at the end....MJ: "You love me, don't you?" Spidey: "Uh-huh" MJ: "Even though you said you didn't?" Hey, moron, he just said he loved you, you don't have to badger him about it. I really like Kirsten Dunst, but I'm not sure I can blame the writers for her poor performance. She is getting really good at the look of being totally heart-broken though.One last rant...in the first major action with Doc Ock, there are some hilarious shots of young, hot women with tight shirts and sweaters, clearly showing off their perky breasts. These shots were no mistake, and they couldn't have been more obvious. I was laughing hysterically during one shot. Truth is, that was probably the most entertained I was during the whole movie.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Damn, I had high hopes for this one. After X2 did so well last year - I was sure Spiderman would follow suit. They managed to keep the director and the cast - what could go wrong? In two words.... the dialogue. It could be compared to Brotehr Bear on its style. It a typically overly-sentimental, moralistic style of dialogue, that achieves only, the comlpete loss of beleivability in the movie. Especially bad are any scenes involving Aunt May. However, even the scene with Peter in the kitchen of (pre-accident) Doc Ock, with the aformentioned Doc's wife - are fairly trite. I understand they were trying to get across that they really loved each other - but did the Doc have to launch into a pseudo-philisophical spiel about love. Ditto the doctor (MD) later in the movie examining Peter (if you've seen it you know what i'm talking about). On the up side - some of the action scenes were very good - overall 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spidey's greatest challenge</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie shows more of an emotional side of Peter Parker. It seems like he was losing everything,his best friend Harry Osborne,the respect from his childhood friend MJ Watson and occassionally losing his spider ability. It started to get more depressing when he told Aunt Ma that he felt responsible for uncle Ben's death. At the party Peter had no luck getting refreshments and Harry was so drunk that he embarassed Peter by telling him that he's not being supportive of his father's death and losing his business. That was enough to make Peter wanting to commit suicide. Dr. Oct was no joke. He had tenticle arms that can rip through steel walls and throw cars around like matchbox toys. This movie had great special effects and some cool fight scenes. But Spider-man knew he couldn't really defeat Dr. Octopus because to me he was much too strong and more of a menace then the Green Goblin. Although Peter Parker was losing everything he got his greatest gift back which was MJ Watson. In this movie Peter Parker had to stop a destructive Dr. Octopus,gain the trust of friend MJ Watson,cheer up a skeptical Harry Osborne and decide that if he wanted to be Spider-man anymore. A lot more in depth than the first movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**potential spoiler**The scene where Spider-Man stops the subway train is one of the best scenes I have ever seen on film. All of the depression and angst Peter Parker has felt, all the hatred that has been directed his way (focused thru the Daily Bugle),... and when those hands reach thru the glass, catch him, and gently lift him up and carry him,... tears were in my eyes! (I also liked how they cut the audio out and left Danny Elfman's music to make the moment more ethereal.)This one scene has brought me back to the movie three times already (first week) and I plan on seeing it more, buying the DVD, and supporting the franchise by telling everyone we are watching the birth of a classic!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I mean it. 'Spider-Man 2' truly IS the best movie of the year so far. Now, that may change when Oscar noms come around, but right now I'm sticking to my opinion. This film has splendid acting, awesome special effects, and Spidey finally gets the girl at the end. What could be better? I usually don't give plot summaries in my reviews, so you won't find one here. As he proved in the original 'Spider-Man', Tobey Maguire is perfect for the dual role of Peter Parker and Spider-Man. Kirsten Dunst, one of the best actresses currently working, is also very good as Mary-Jane, the girl who Peter is hopelessly in love with. Alfred Molina makes a great Doc Ock, but the curious thing is, he redeems himself at the end. Overall, this movie is GREAT. Spidey fans and movie-goers alike won't be disappointed.

		<fullReview>***********************Spoiler Alert********************************The fan says, Very good CGI, It isn't the Matrix or LOTR but still worth watching. Octavious is quite an interesting fellow, the green goblin added a certain comic charm not seen entirely in Octavious but he certainly is worth being the spider's nemesis. The choreography was excellent to say the least. The movie is certainly worth a watch. The critic says, Below average acting but then again, thats not what comic-book movies are famous for. A rather weak script with many loose ends. Too many tears, a super-hero movie isn't supposed to be so emotional or at least thats what the general stereotype portrays. Could do with some more characters and situations besides Octavious, MJ, Harry and aunt May to add a bit of variation from the monotony. Could definitely use a better storyline with more interesting twists and turns. There are no memorable scenes really besides the train sequence. Overall, I would say it is entertaining. You really don't ever want to look at the time during the show. A ****7*** at least. \Enjoy the show..!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Different than expected --Spoiler free!--</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the first movie I expected more action,excitement and adventure. Don't expect that from this movie, while there is definitely more plot there is less to actually keep your interest.Honestly I don't like Tobey Maguire or Kirsten Dunst cast as Spiderman and Mary-Jane, they are certainly big enough names but they aren't the characters that they are trying to play.One thing I did not like about this movie was the way the beginning and end (mostly beginning) were awesome and the middle was a bunch of twaddle. True you do see more history, more background and more set-up for future Spiderman movies but I'd rather read it and be able to picture it that way than have someone ruin it by dragging it way out with actors that don't know the character.Something I did like, however, James Franco was as Harry. He played the part well, you can see and almost feel the struggle that he's going through. Or maybe I just think he's cuter that Maguire. (by a lot) At any rate,Doc. Ock. was great along with Aunt May, (you do see more of her).All in all, to Spiderman fans: be prepared, know what to expect so as not to be disappointed.To the rest of America: go see it with a friend, that way if you're bored out of your mind at some point in the middle and looking at your watch isn't helping you can make faces at each other and still have fun!Enjoy</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Second verse, same as the first.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After a superb set of opening credits that artfully recap the prequel, "Spider-Man 2" ("S2") picks up two years after the original left off, although the elapsed time is barely noticed. Among the familiar characters, Peter Parker/Spider-Man (Tobey Maguire) is fighting through college and criminals; Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) is starring in a Broadway play; and Harry Osborn (James Franco), who still blames Spider-Man for his father's death, is running OsCorp. The company is aiding Doctor Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina) in his attempt to create a form of fusion that produces perpetual energy. You can probably guess what soon happens. As is often the case, this sequel has lost some of the novelty that carried the original. There are only so many ways Spidey can swing through skyscraper canyons, although a couple new twists do elicit oohs and aahs. In place of that originality are human emotions that expound upon what Peter was battling at the end of the first movie. As in the "Batman" films, this humanity makes "S2" better; in this case, better than the original.Despite this humanity, and also addressing great movie themes like love, revenge, courage, and destiny, "S2" falls short of greatness, largely because of how those themes are addressed. Too often longish dialogue scenes are used to explain the inner conflicts of characters, rather than pictures and actions. The pace change isn't a problem, but the heavy-handedness is. Perhaps for once the audience was underestimated. We know that the Marvel comics are supposed to touch on themes beyond the action, and don't need them to be force-fed. Especially with a quality actor like Maguire, we can see the inner conflict, and that is enough. We don't need Aunt May's five minute speech filled with double meanings. Peter's main issue is how to be "normal" while fighting crime. Primary amongst his concerns and the movie's plot is his love for MJ, because the ones he loves are constantly in danger from his enemies. But alas, due to the emphasis of the trite romantic story, the most interesting relationship of the movie, between Peter and Harry, is disappointingly (although understandably) under-developed. Young Osborn can't let go of his father's death. Because Peter is Spider-Man's personal photographer, their friendship is constantly strained, made more complicated by the plot progression. That is a very unique situation that I wish had been explored more deeply. But unfortunately, their relationship may not be further fleshed out until the third installment, which promises to be the best one yet.I'm generally a fan of the superhero genre, but neither this movie nor its predecessor connected with me. Part of the reason is derived from the typical storyline. Not once during the course of the movie was I particularly surprised by anything. Part of the reason was Kirsten Dunst, whose performance in a clich role wasn't bad, but wasn't good either. She tries just a bit too hard, as though in an objective role, attempting to nail the part, rather than be the part. My personal bottom line though is that Spider-Man simply doesn't do it for me. I can't fully explain it; that's just how it is. Fortunately the overall craftsmanship of the movie, including quality performances from Maguire, Franco, and Molina, is good enough to overshadow those issues. Although not perfect, the special effects mesh nicely with the comic book nature that director Sam Raimi has created. The visuals add to the almost cartoonish edge without distracting from the reality. Danny Elfman (Men in Black) has again composed an excellent score for an comic-based movie. His syncopated tunes, rife with percussive orchestral notes, provides enjoyable background music while appropriately accompanying the action. In sum, the world of Spider-Man is now established, and all hands are very comfortable with their work, as evidenced by the uniform look. Much like the original, "S2" is a good solid superhero movie, easy to watch and filled with action and melodrama. I didn't like it as much as many critics and fans, but I don't think you'll be disappointed if you spend $10 and two hours on "Spider-Man 2".Bottom Line: Good, not great. Some will love it, but Spider-man just doesn't do it for me. 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A little less talk and a lot more action</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although this movie as a whole was entertaining, it had it's moments when you were looking at your wristwatch wondering when the next "good scene" would arrive. Although romance is good in a comic book &amp; its big screen counterpart, it shouldn't be the heart of the movie. My feeling is that Sony Pictures was trying to target a larger co-ed audience and not target specifically the males exclusively. In addition to the romance storyline, the story further developed the life and emotions of Peter Parker and the effects of his uncle's death towards him and Aunt May.Another key point is that this movie needed more action between the villain and hero. Spidey's key nemesis isn't introduced in full-villain form until almost 45 minutes into the movie. Aside from fiscal/possessional gain, Doc Ock doesn't have any real purpose for opposing Spidey. Also, there isn't but about 10 minutes of dueling between the two of them. As far as the acting goes I think Maguire does not fit the mold of Spidey. I have a lasting image of the constipated look on Parker's face as he's trying to long jump the gap between the two buildings. The best acting in the movie would belong to J.K. Simmons (J.J. Jameson).Any true Spider-Man fan will like the movie for the comic nature of it alone, but will still be longing for the ultimate comic-book-to-big-screen conversion that I haven't seen since Tim Burton's Batman.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am still 'iffy' on "how" Doc-Ock came to be. The good doctor is working on creating a fusion power generator. Cheap, easy, free fuel for the whole planet. The only catch is that there was a "miscalculation" that causes the experiment to largely fail...fuse Doc-Ock to his little back-pack dealie with 4 powerful arms, kills his wife, and allowing the advanced 'AI' to influence his mind. Oh yes! The arms can think for themselves, and at times control Doc-Ock. He announces pre-test that the mechanical arms are necessary to do the experiment...as they are super strong, nearly indestructible, and magnetic-proof. But...short of a brief...'this is why I am wearing these arms' which in my mind didn't really give much of a reason to need to attach anything to his body....they really kind of blow his origin story. IMHOOf course the kid playing the Green Goblin's son is back. And once again...remnants of that terrible character almost ruined this one for me as well. Sam Rami...fire this kid. He is a horrible sub-soap actor. His lines are incredibly stupid too. He comes of with one liners like "I pay the bills" and "With my money..." and variations like that. He basically beats Doc-Ock over the head informing him constantly "who he (Doc-Ock) works for". I guess the whole movie felt rushed to me. The middle especially. I think Rami had a checklist of things he wanted to include in this movie.....so at about the 45 minute mark....it kind of becomes a mess. Spiderman loses his powers briefly. Why? Because he loses "focus". He's under a lot of stress so the poor guy can't seem to get it up. His webs stop working, he falls a lot. He can no longer climb walls either. Funny how he stayed 'ripped' tho. His eyesight goes bad again re-requiring the glasses he ditched in the first film. And he quits. Stops being Spiderman for a while. Crime in the city jumps by 75% and Spider is convinced by Aunt May (who supposedly doesn't know he's Spiderman, but speaks to him about the importance of being a hero, and why Spiderman shouldn't quit because little kids need heros..yadda yadda. So, Spidey puts the suit back on. Then his powers return. What?He regains focus....he something filler, more filler....and now he has his powers back. whatever.This, however, is where the movie starts to pick back up. Gong into the movie, I was frightened that they'd mess up Doc Ock like they did the GG. But, I was spared that. Doc Ock is now...IMHO...one of the best movie villains ever. Beautifully done...if not hampered by silly lines a good chunk of the time. So, really....I have 3 problems with it. 1: Most Important. They rushed the middle I think. 2: James Franco is a horrible actor and ruined every scene he was in. 3: Kirsten Dunst is ALSO a terrible actress...though not nearly as bad as Franco. Not only did this films Mary Jane have zero sex appeal but she looks fairly terrible throughout the whole movie. Lot's of close-ups on her half opened eyes (put the bong down) which reminded me of Garfield. Maybe it's just her Cat shaped head. I dunno. But her lines are some of the best in the movies, and she blows'em. In an Uncool way.It may be assumed that everything I DON'T complain about here...I absolutely loved. The effects are outstanding...mostly because they're seamless this time. The CGI is some of the best I have seen. Not to mention the sequences with SM "flying" through the city on his webs is outstanding...and has the capability of making a casual movie goer with a weak stomach sick. Bring It On! I say! Good stuff. SM himself is outstanding. Tobey nailed this character. The over-all story is solid, and there are nice toucher oh humor everywhere.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A rare feat for a blockbuster, this film exceeds expectations.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>These days there are so many blockbusters that are heavily marketed, and we see the trailers ad nauseum before we get to see the film. Most of the time, the film turns out to be disappointing. I certainly felt that way about the first Spiderman. Spiderman 2, however, is much more than your regular action hero film. We are too familiar with the Clarke Kent/Superman, Bruce Wayne/Batman identity dilemmas, and thought that another Peter PArker/Spiderman will be no different. But Sam Raimi explores this in a much more human and sympathetic way. Interestingly, the film seems to focus less on action, and more on the psyche of Peter PArker confronting his life and fate. Even though he is not as invincible as Superman, and not like Batman with his inexhaustible wealth and gadgets, Spiderman is more courageous and heroic in the way he deals with his problems, and the path he takes.As before, the scenes of Spiderman swinging through the metropolis are stunning. Dr Octopus is also a much more multi-dimensional baddie than Willem Dafoe's Green Goblin.I loved this film and will definitely see it again many times over.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spidey spins a web of entertainment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked it a lot. Much better than the first. However, I had a few problems with it.First and foremost, What is with him taking his mask off constantly? It's like half the city knew who he was after the movie. Secondly, he started to lose his powers because he was lovestruck and didn't want to be Spider-man anymore? Lastly, while I loved all of the character development and the fact the movie was more about Peter Parker than Spider-man - they went overboard with driving it in that his life sucked due to his responsibility of being the webslinger. At one point, I just let out a sigh of depression having to watch Peter go through so much s***. It didn't ruin the movie in any way, but I felt some editing might have been in order to relieve some of the unnecessary melancholy. Nothing that ruined the film - just a few things I would have done differently.As for the good points? A lot of 'em. The introduction credits were brilliant. Possibly the first time I've ever considered credits to be a contributing factor to the overall entertainment of a film. They were that well done. I wasn't a huge fan of the original movie due to some very cheesy dialogue. This time around it was a huge improvement. It retained the comic book feel while refraining to make me cringe. I think there were only a few lines I wanted to roll my eyes at, but held back because I was thoroughly enjoying the film. Major props in that aspect.The action scenes were awesome. Mainly the train scene. I could go into great detail on how much I enjoyed that scene, but the number of expletives needed may offend some. Orgasmic will have to suffice. The operating room scene was equally as impressive. Not in terms of overall excitement, but in that it accomplished expressing the terror these AI constructed arms were. I've never seen the Evil Dead series, but have read this particular scene was influenced by Raimi's previous work in said series. I will certainly have to give those films a look.Humor. The film had it in spades and I'm very hard to amuse in that regard. Most humor in films pass me by without the hint of a smile, but Spider-man used it effectively and there were several times I even gave a chuckle. J.J. was spot on. Absolutely hilarious and JK Simmons was able to pull of the character from the comics in stride. The elevator scene was another one of my favorites and I wish it hadn't been spoiled for me in one of the various commericals on the TV.A lot of people seem to have complaints with Kirsten Dunst's performance as Mary Jane. I agree to an extent. She didn't seem like she was putting much effort into the role - at least not as much as the first film. This is certainly not the MJ we know from the comics, but it doesn't detract too much. Her last scene in the film makes up for the shortcomings previous to it. Molina was good as Doc Ock, but hardly a standout as some reviews have claimed. It was his tentacles that were the villain in this film and I can't say I didn't enjoy the different approach to the character. As far as Harry goes - I think with his limited development in the film, he came off as being needlessly whiny. We all know why, but it's hard to really care. Either they spend a good deal of time with his character in the 3rd film or limit the significance of his findings. I have mixed feelings of him being the 'main' villain in the next film.Well, I could go on and on about all the different things I liked about the movie. It really was a big surprise for me after only semi liking the first one. I think I'll watch the first film again to see if there is any new found appreciation after having seen the excellent sequel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Naturally, a film that tries to appeal to *everyone* is not going to satisfy everyone equally. While "chick flicks" and "teenage comedies" are genres defined by their demographic, the summer blockbuster, and especially *this* summer blockbuster, are designed to have the mass appeal of the french fry.There are a few embarrassing moments of either unfunny comedy, or schmaltz, or strange ideas about what New York looks like, but overall I enjoyed this picture. The action scenes look good, and there is some believable emotional plot elements. In retrospect, people will find that the first film was indeed better, but hey.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a superhero movie should be really. Should of been called Spiderman Part 2. The continuing story of Peter Parker and his 2 peers is really the main focus here and what makes this movie stand out as feeling more real, over other Superhero Sequels (other than perhaps Superman 2) is that human factor, as opposed to the mistake that Batman for example made as it progressed, concentrating on the villains to the detriment of the main character.The Spidey FX although better than Spiderman, are still very plasticky, although I actually quite liked their comicky feel, and perhaps it was intended, as spiderman as a film is beyond having to lean on it's SFX to make a buck.Spoiler WarningAlso a great indictment of the film, that the whole cast of Spiderman returned for Part 2, how often does that happen?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spider-Man 2...The Best Web Spun Yet, And Not The Last!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Truly the greatest comic-book-based film in history. But also, one of the greatest films of all time. Spider-Man 2 proves to outstanding and much more entertaining than it's amazing original film. The new villain, Doc Ock, is a very challenging and worthy opponent of Spidey and Doc Ock's tentacles are terrifying and powerful that could've ripped the web-head to shreds. Hatred builds up between Peter Parker and Harry Osborn as they go from best friends to their worst enemies. As one of the greatest sequels in history, this film definitely deserves to be on the top list of the greatest movies. I give this film a 10/10 and if I could, I'd give it a 12/10. This films leaves me anxious to found out what will happen next between Spider-Man and his future enemies. The relationship between Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson grows more and more, but the risks will be greater. Spider-Man never gives up and will fight criminals and super villains until they meet utter and bitter defeat. A new villain's appearance rises in this film and you'll have to watch it to find out. Spider-Man 2 is one my favorite films of all time and I can watch it over and over again. Doc Ock is the worst, and I mean that in a good way, villain yet and I'm eager to find out who Spidey's next opponent will be. Sam Raimi has done it again. He's impressed millions of audiences and he sure knows how to give the Spidey fans one heck of a thrill!I congratulate everyone who has worked on Spider-Man 2 and to keep up the excellent work. Spidey has spun his second web, but it won't be his last!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maybe it the all the hype..maybe it was because everyone said it was 20X better than the 1st. Or maybe it was that punk 5 year old kid who kept talking through the whole DAMN movie. I wanted to slap the parents. Who knows, but all I know is that it was good and maybe just as good as the 1st, but not better.Spiderman 2 had some slow parts and not as much action as the 1st.The whole Jesus thing too was a little much. Yeah I get that the whole world is against him but the subway scene was just TOO much. (You'll know it when you see it, all that was missing was the cross) Oh and one more thing, why does everyone and their mother have to know who Spiderman is????? I think just about everyone finds out. Hell even Aunt Mae knows, she just isn't saying.Action (when there was some of it) was great. MJ was, how can I out it, FUGLY? They need a better MJ, and can we please stop seeing those pancake boobs??? We get it, you don't wear a bra when its wet outside.As for Doc Ock...well what can I say but AWESOME. A little chessy when you 1st meet him but still good.As for the whole movie in general, much more upbeat than the 1st, and maybe thats why I didn't like it. The 1st was a little more darker and thats how I like my comic book movies. Like the 1st 2 Batmans.Now heres what I think whats going on the Spiderman 3. ***SPOILERS***Doc Conner was shown in the 1st and more so in the 2nd, so I expect the Lizard to be in the 3. Also of course we all know who the new GB is going to be. Oh a little side note to that, was William D.'s cameo really needed? COME ON!! Just let HArry find the lab while he is tormented with the fact that his best bud is Spiderman, the man who killed his dad.Also, a long shot, Venom. Why? Well Brock was in the 1st movie and for some reason they needed to show Brock being fired again at the start of the movie for Spiderman 2.

		<fullReview>saw the movie and think that it was entertaining but didn't have that "wow" factor like the first one did. special effects were good though.so, not to be just saying it, heres my answer why i didn't like the movie:it got degraded into one of those newer "we have to cannonball movies at people" kind of class. in this class of movies the producers are shooting a movie under stress and pack everything for everyone in it so it is watchable for everyone. guys and comic nerds watch it for special effects and spiderman and all the sentimental people for the loooove story and its sad ending (peter cant be with mj and spiderman stands between their love,torment, sniff sniff). yes that happened in the comic book too. but compare 20 comics or whatever to 2 hours. doctor octavius is one of the coolest characters in spiderman (i think). what happened here though is this: the whole relationship what makes a superhero (between hero and villain) is completely played down in this movie. doc ock is only a sidecharacter to get the story going, what is this??? i didn't want to watch titanic 2!!!!!!!!!!!over half of the movie, spiderman isn't seen because peter has to resort his feelings and discover for himself if hes gay or not, if so when to come out or if it only is metrosexuality. no really though, in the beginning its funny but after a while when you checked your watch a trillion times and thought "man whats going to happen now? the movie must almost be over", the final fight approaches which sucked SSSSSSOOOOO much, that the meeting between spiderman and doc ock on the subway was ten times better.i hope i got everything and its not too long to read but this i had to get off my chest!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Superhero With Human Frailties and Boyish Antics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dumb, loud, and cynical blockbusters have long brutalized movie audiences. 'Spiderman 2' illustrates that a superhero film can always stand to strike a chord of what vibrant, intelligent, and heartfelt popular film-making could look like. Directed by Sam Raimi and adapted from a story whose many scribes include the novelist Michael Chabon; the sole screenwriting credit belongs to Alvin Sargent, who wrote "Ordinary People" and "Paper Moon". The new Spider-Man 2 is replete with dazzling colors, deafening noises and elaborate special effects. Of course this is what we expected.What distinguishes this film, I am pleased to report, is solid character development with sincere emotions. Much like its Marvel Comic book kin, "X-Men 2," this sequel, free from the dreary weight of excessive exploitation, is somewhat better than its predecessor as well as better than most other comic-book-based feature films. However, what disturbs me about this Super hero is his lack of maturity, looks, and good judgment. It would more aptly be called Spider Boy than Spider Man. His continuous child-like thinking and boyish appearance belong more in a high school teenathon than as the omnipotent Spiderman of comic book fame. This frail looking teenager hardly presents the image of a super hero who is able to attract the likes of a Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) or any other adult female.In the comic book, the hero is depicted as much older, more muscular, and able to assert himself wherever and whenever needed. I would suppose that the powers that be selected Tobey Maguire for those boyish looks since they would more likely appeal to the teenagers who would more likely provide the bulk of the film's attendance. Whenever Peter Parker kisses the mature-looking Mary Jane, it almost makes you cringe that he is about to be sexually abused.At the end of the film, the hero was forced to choose between his superhuman powers and the heady charms of Mary Jane. However, it was extremely irritating and difficult to sympathize as to why poor Peter Parker could not have both. True to action-hero clichs, he felt the world needed Spider-Man, and so Peter hardened his resolve and surrendered his despairing, life-long love of Mary Jane Watson. The dutiful web-slinger, although adored by the people, is unjustly scorned, and maligned in the Daily Bugle, led by the angry and abusive editor J. Jonah Jameson, played with fanatic passion by J. K. Simmons. However, his alter ego Peter Parker is the one who suffers the deeper emotional wounds. Jameson continuously insults, cheats, and badgers poor Peter while he is desperately scrambling to balance the demands of a normal life along with nocturnal forays into crime fighting. Perhaps even more insulting to Peter is the negative mirror image of Spider-Man he is forced to bear, being routinely hounded as penniless, lazy, selfish, and unreliable.His poor aunt May (Rosemary Harris), who is still grieving from the loss of her husband, (Uncle Ben previously played by Cliff Robertson, in a brief flashback), is in grave danger of losing her home, and her devotion to Peter is eroded by palpable disappointment when he confesses his negligent role in her husband's death. Even Mary Jane, whose career as a model and actress has been recently quite successful, is fed up with what appears to be Peter's consistent selfishness and unbelievable excuses. To make matters ever worse for Peter, she has become engaged to an astronaut, who just happens to be Jonah Jameson's son.All of this hoopla moves us to the film's midpoint when the pitiful Spider-Man, his webs drying up because of Peter's depression, dumps his Spidy suit into a back-alley garbage can. In the meantime, a brilliant scientist named Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina) is presenting a dangerous and ambitious fusion project financed by Peter's best pal and who incidentally is also another Spider-Man nemesis, Harry Osborn (James Franco). A disastrous malfunction leaves Octavius not only a widower, but transforms him into a monster. Malevolent, intelligent mechanical legs that seem to have diabolical minds of their own now propel his body. Doc Ock, as Jamison in the Bugle characterizes him, is now Spidey's enemy. Unlike Spidey, poor Ock is not the master of his octopus mechanical arms; rather he is their servant. Sam Raimi, the director who cut his teeth on the gory, low-budget horrors of the "Evil Dead" franchise, is not totally an aficionado of fancy computer-generated special effects (CGI). Nevertheless, they remain an integral part of the film. (No filmmaker working in this genre can afford not to). Yet, the digitized scenes of New York City's Spiderman flights and fighting are not the strongest parts of the movie, since Raimi does not yet have Peter Jackson's or Steven Spielberg's talent for a seamless combination of CGI with conventional movie-making. Instead, he attempts to develop the characters more and provide more of a storyline than other action films. The storyline, although much more interesting than the usual action extravaganza, still is a bit juvenile for my taste. The film is fun, yet often frustrating when the immaturity of Peter contaminates the hero mood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jon Monsarrat review: better than the 1st, not hokey at all</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first half of Spider Man 1 was brilliant because the characters seemed real and deep. It was OK for Peter Parker to get dirty (like the hobbits in LOTR). He was just a regular guy. There was no melodrama, the film didn't take itself seriously. But the second half was a lot of computer graphics combat and cheesiness that didn't work for me.Spider-Man 2 fixes all that. The Spider-Man costume is allowed to get torn. There's plenty of self-deprecating humor. Jamieson is brilliant. I'm not much of a comic book guy. I used to be when I was a kid, but there's a limit, you know? At about the point when some cartoonist says "maybe the gorilla has a third eye and he's got a gem instead of a heart and the whole universe is at stake again" when you just gotta sigh and give up comic books to kids. Anyway, I prefer real drama these days. I saw X-Men and X-Men 2 but thought it was a little too over the top.Spider-Man 2 is not like that. If you're skeptical of cartoons you can see it as a straight action flick or even as a drama. The only faults I might draw are that there is possibly too much plot packed in, and I just didn't sense a great romantic chemistry.Who should see this film:-- All action flick people &amp; comic book types-- Older kids-- Drama people, put on sunglasses and go slumming, you will enjoy this film and I won't tellI'll give Spider-Man 2 an 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm really being honest here and I never write bad comments, but, I could not stand to sit in the theatre for Spiderman 2. I'm sorry to all who thought it was such a great movie, but it was boring!!! There was no action to keep me intrigued and the plot just seemed stagnant and didn't flow. I wasn't captivated by the movie in the first 30 minutes but figured I would give it a little more time to get in to things, but I still didn't care for it after an hour. I wanted to walk out for the first time in my life, but my friends wanted to see how it ended (even though they were thinking it sucked like I did), so unfortunately I was forced to stay. So I just decided to take a nap until the end. So, I'm sorry, but Hollywood did NOT need to push for a sequel on this one just to make a few extra bucks. The first one was perfect and I loved it... They needn't make a sequel for EVERY SINGLE MOVIE that does really well in the theaters. It just makes for poor story lines. I'm sorry! Really, I am... But this one blew big time and I was so excited to see it, too! Oh well...</fullReview>

It was hard to stay awake at times. Not nearly as exciting as the first Spidey movie. Too much philosiphizing and not enough action. Booooring! Plus the novelty of seeing Spidey fly around through New York isn't as cool anymore. I thought the abuse Peter Parker took was a little excessive. Why was he constantly getting screwed with?

		<shortDescription>A disappointment compared to the first movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unfortunately, and I think most discerning folks that view this one objectively will agree, Spiderman 2 is something of a letdown. The first movie had great pacing, was able to more or less wrap the entire Spiderman origin into one tight story, had plenty of action but not superfluously so, and spent just the right amount of time on Peter Parker's ambivalence regarding the normal life/hero life dilemma. This one seems to meander, getting mired in the dilemma aspect too often and repeating the same theme over and over ad nauseum; the pacing just wasn't right. Too many things rushed into too short a space in some parts, one idea dragged out too long in others. There just wasn't enough action suitably woven into the plot the way there was in the first, and let's face it, this is a comic book movie-- action is practically paramount. There were two things I liked about this one, though. First, the fights between Doc Ock and Spiderman are really well-done, just how I'd imagine them. It was great to see that in "live action", so to speak (special effects notwithstanding). They were more involved than how I remember the fights in 1. **Slight spoiler** Second, the scene when Octavius is in the hospital after the accident is distinctly "Evil Dead-ish"-- same goofy-style camera work, and there's even a chainsaw, which has GOT to be a reference to it. Unfortunately, though, the movie also makes it quite clear that Harry Osborne is going to take up the mantle of the Green Goblin II in the third film, so that pretty much totally crushes my hopes, nay, my near-conviction that Venom HAD to be the next villain they would do. I guess they realized the backstory to that one would be way too convoluted to work into one movie. **End spoiler**All in all, this one isn't terrible, just not really a worthy follow-up. Maybe it was the novelty of seeing the origin of Spiderman unfold before my eyes in the first one, whereas he's already established in the second, but the first one far exceeds the sequel to me.</fullReview>

Jonah Jameson's appearances, the romance between Peter and Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst, beeeeeautiful) goes to another level and, mainly, the villain is great! Alfred Molina brings a multidimensional character to Doc Ock: he's not just the bad guy, but he, somehow, reflects Peter Parker "dark side". I'm not a Spider-Man fan, but that's an amazing movie!

		<fullReview>Spider-Man 2 is a very respectable follow-up to the 2002 original. The sequel stays true to its roots and even does some good foreshadowing of the third chapter. I wouldn't say it's better than the original, I'd rate the two about equally.On the positive side, the movie looks very sleek, the CGI has been updated and polished compared to the first film and the Doc Ock effects are excellent. The movie flows well and although you don't have to have seen the original to "get" this film, it does help tremendously.On the negative side, it seems like Raimi has rehashed a lot of ideas from the original film. Without spoiling anything, let me just comment that there are a couple of familiar "damsel in distress" scenes and a familiar feel to the ending (at least, the first part of the ending. I loved the Dafoe cameo in the latter part). While I understand that superhero movies are somewhat formulaic by nature, I was disappointed that there were so many plot similarities here.One other comment, I also felt the Alfred Molina was a great Doc Ock, but he should have been given more screen time, I wasn't able to connect with the character as much as I thought I would.All in all a good film, this will most certainly be one of the best of the summer and far better than the upcoming "Catwoman". If you enjoyed the original, you'll enjoy this. If you didn't like original, you may not want to bother with this one.It'll be interesting to see what happens in part 3.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just finished the big preview showing for June 30... pretty awful. Bad story, pretty weak acting (the tortured hero - puh-leeze), and strange homages. What was that "Mary Tyler Moore" moment with the freeze frame? And the screaming woman running at the camera...? Take off her shirt and it could be Airplane all over! The fusion ball - really stupid. And the rage from the Green Goblin's son and the tee-up for the sequel at the end - horrible.

		<shortDescription>The Moose Hole - Review of Spider-Man 2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You would think a sequel to one of the highest grossing films of all time, sixth on the list once Shrek 2 swings past it sometime this summer, would have an easier road to completion but what kind of challenge would that be for the Amazing Spider-Man? As the original film was racking in nearly $115 million in cash at the box office and smashing every box office record in the book, the ink was drying on the deal to develop two sequels for the comic-book superhero, with more to come gathering that the profit margin was still worth the high production price for Columbia Pictures. Unfortunately production for the highly anticipated sequel didn't start off on the right foot with Tobey Maguire, fresh off his new horse-racing drama, Seabiscuit, holding up the film's start date due to complaints about back problems. It didn't take long for the rumors to start churning out possible replacements, among which was the boyfriend of Kirsten Dunst, Jake Gyllenhaal. But, like the web-slinger he plays on the big screen, Tobey bounced back and in a small way, though inadvertently, he demonstrated one of the film's prominent themes.The story picks up near where the last film left off, only several months in difference, with Peter Parker balancing his personal life and the life of New York's favorite web crawler, Spider-Man. No one said the life of a superhero was going to be easy, though no one said it was going to be quite this hard either. Peter Parker tries as hard as he can to live a normal life but every time he's handed the opportunity to keep his promises, whether it be showing up to Mary Jane's performances, performing his job correctly or paying the rent, the role of Spider-Man gets in the way, thus allowing the one's that depend on him to suffer. As Peter does all he can to balance his two lives, those in the real world are moving on with theirs ? Mary Jane, tired of waiting for Peter to admit his true feelings for her, plans to marry the son of J.J. Jameson, a handsome and successful astronaut. Aunt May, struggling after the death of her husband, falls behind on her house payments and faces eviction from the bank if the late payments are met. Even his best friend, Harry Osborne, has moved on and taken over operations at Oscorp ? but the anger left by the death of his father at the hands of Spider-Man still remains and threatens to push him over the edge. The family business is all that keeps him on the level of sanity and Harry has big plans for Dr. Otto Octavius' new device to create and control fusion power, which, in essence, puts the power of the stars in the hands of mankind. But in a freak accident which results in the death of Octavius' wife and the fusion of the mechanical arms to his spine, Octavius goes on a rampage to finish his work, possibly taking half the city with him if he fails again. Just as he is beginning to enjoy the retirement he has taken from the superhero life, Peter Parker must again put on the suit and fulfill the promise he made to protect the innocent and bring justice to those who deserve it.The story for Spider-Man 2, though flawed, is without a doubt one of the best comic-book adaptations ever put on screen and excels beyond the expectations set not only by the original but every comic-book franchise that has come before it, including that of the winged one himself, Batman. As was said previously, the storyline is far from perfect and there are some noticeable flaws. Among them, the whole discussion of fusion power between Doctor Otto Octavius and Peter Parker in which they use strange and complex scientific vocabulary and theories is lost on the majority the movie-going public, unless you happen to be on the same level as these individuals but to be sure such people would be few and far between. Granted these individuals are meant to be in sync with the subject of science but since the discussion is so obscure, the audience is just meant to trust what they say, which takes away some of the attachment they are meant to have with the story. And there are moments within the film that seem to last a little longer then some would like them to, and, in part, seem to drag the film a bit, but they are easily forgivable.Most, if not all, of the cast from the original film are back for another go-around and there is substantial improvement in their performances from the last time we saw them, though that can not be said of everyone. One performance that fails to disappoint is once again given by Tobey Maguire in the lead role of Peter Parker, or better known as Spider-Man. The non-superhero side of the character appears to get more screen time then in the original which isn't a bad thing. Maguire is given a lot more room to demonstrate emotionally what the character of Peter Parker is going through; at one end attempting to fulfill the promise he made to his Uncle Ben in the role of Spider-Man while at the same time trying to lead the life of a normal human being. Kirsten Dunst, returning to the role of Mary Jane Watson, gives another wonderful performance by maintaining the 'girl next door' charm she had in the original film but at the same time demonstrating a character that is desperately yearning for something more. Crafted in such the perfect manner, Mary Jane is not another dimwitted damsel in distress as the connection between Spider-Man and Peter Parker slowly begins to develop in her mind. It's hard to say who's the better villain, the Green Goblin (who could forget that terrible costume) or Doc Ock, but even if Doctor Octavius' performance wasn't quite what everyone may have wanted it to be, Alfred Molina fits properly into the role. The only truly bad mark out of the entire cast belongs to James Franco, who drops the ball with his over the top and, at times, flat-out ridiculous performances as Harry Osborne. Rather the see the slow transformation of his impeding insanity, the audience notices the unbalanced behavior of Harry right off the bat and don't really sympathize with his situation, though the understanding of who his father really was may be also to blame. And just when you thought he was gone for good ? don't miss the quick, though wonderfully developed, cameo of William Dafoe as Norman Osborn, which, in turn, hints at the possible villain for the third film.Overall, Spider-Man 2 delivers most of what the hype and promotion promise, not only in the areas of spectacular special effects and an emotionally driven storyline, but in the film's enduring message of heroism and self-sacrifice. Before rounding off what made this sequel the fulfilling feature it was, let's focus on items that failed to live up to the rest of the film. First, the random shots of normal civilians, though some well placed, were mainly an annoyance. There is one specific shot, when Spider-Man (costume and all) makes his first appearance, where a woman shouts, 'You go, Spidey!' ? this was humorous for the wrong reason and should have been left out, along with the several long focus shots of people screaming and running in terror. Not that they weren't needed but it was the amount of time Raimi used to focus on them that was the problem. Secondly, as was said earlier, it hard to determine whether the Green Goblin or Doctor Octavius is the better villain as Doc Ock isn't nearly as menacing as Goblin was, though he does offer up more action packed fight sequences in return. Depending on how you felt with the first film, this feature's villain could go either way. Third, some of the sequel's more subtle jokes, namely the homage to Butch Casidy and the Sundance Kid, are lost on the majority of the film's target audience, though they are quite humorous to those that know what they are referring to. And finally, the film's final sequence, in which the audience sees Spider-Man swinging between two helicopters over the rooftops of Manhattan on his way to another crime scene, is quite possibly one of the worse computer animated sequences presented this year and is a severe disappointment considering the sensational sequence the last film ended with. The problem is that the computer graphics are way too obvious and ends the film on quite a sour note considering most of the effects presented in the film were spectacular.Though the problems of Spider-Man 2 seem to significantly out weigh the good, the film's emotionally driven messages of self-sacrifice and heroism are what truly set this one apart from all the rest. Where the first film hammers the idea that even the most unlikely of individuals in this world can be heroes, the sequel drills home the belief that there is a hero is every one of us ? we just have to make the choice listen to the voice that lets it shine through if it means we have to give up on the things we want the most in life. It's easy to relate the idea of self-sacrifice with the fire and police departments of this country after the tragic events of September 11th but there is another aspect that many of us as Americans fail to respect or even recognize. Right now thousands of American troops are deployed overseas, either in Afghanistan or Iraq, bringing about freedom and opportunity in parts of the world that have not experienced such fundamental principles for over three decades ? they are risking their lives not only for the protection of the American people but to further the causes our founding fathers endowed upon us nearly three centuries ago. It is obvious that there are polarizing views in this country on the conflicts we find ourselves in but there once was a time in America's history where the people of this land looked upon the self-sacrificing men and women of the armed forces with respect and admiration, and, in a slightly smaller way, they still do today. But there are also the people who view these true 'heroes' with anger and hatred, not understanding nor having the will to accept the good they are doing in the world, despite what many may say. Symbolism of this can be found in Spider-Man 2 and, like in the comic book adaptation, we believe that a time will come when frustration and hatred can be washed away to fully understand the reasoning behind their sacrifice, as well as the sacrifice of every 'superhero' in this world ? to bring justice to those that deserve it.My Rating: **** ? out of 5 (Grade: A)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After watching the film i'm totally at a loss of words... Not because it was a crappy movie... but it was a movie that left my mouth wide open gaping in awe. Every scene is filmed with perfect emotion and definitely a great job by the actors. Every angle the director shoots of spidey swing from wall to wall, every punch he throws at Doc Ock, makes you momentarily feel you are WITH them. Everyone plays a perfect role in spiderman 2. Well that's all i have to say, cause the last show that blew me away like this one was Lord of the Rings: The two towers.If you haven't seen this i highly recommend it, it's a whole new experience, especially for comic book fans. 7 out of 5 stars ;P</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched the movie on June, 29th, in a preview session. I walked out of the cinema thinking how could these guys improve so much the franchise from the first movie to the second. The effects are great, outstanding, but the plot is so much solid! There is more drama, with the comic relief in J. Jonah Jameson's appearances, the romance between Peter and Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst, beeeeeautiful) goes to another level and, mainly, the villain is great! Alfred Molina brings a multidimensional character to Doc Ock: he's not just the bad guy, but he, somehow, reflects Peter Parker "dark side". I'm not a Spider-Man fan, but that's an amazing movie! It's worth to stand in long lines to watch it, no doubt!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining and enjoyable...but not perfect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spider-Man 2 is a very respectable follow-up to the 2002 original. The sequel stays true to its roots and even does some good foreshadowing of the third chapter. I wouldn't say it's better than the original, I'd rate the two about equally.On the positive side, the movie looks very sleek, the CGI has been updated and polished compared to the first film and the Doc Ock effects are excellent. The movie flows well and although you don't have to have seen the original to "get" this film, it does help tremendously.On the negative side, it seems like Raimi has rehashed a lot of ideas from the original film. Without spoiling anything, let me just comment that there are a couple of familiar "damsel in distress" scenes and a familiar feel to the ending (at least, the first part of the ending. I loved the Dafoe cameo in the latter part). While I understand that superhero movies are somewhat formulaic by nature, I was disappointed that there were so many plot similarities here.One other comment, I also felt the Alfred Molina was a great Doc Ock, but he should have been given more screen time, I wasn't able to connect with the character as much as I thought I would.All in all a good film, this will most certainly be one of the best of the summer and far better than the upcoming "Catwoman". If you enjoyed the original, you'll enjoy this. If you didn't like original, you may not want to bother with this one.It'll be interesting to see what happens in part 3.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Webslinger Returns</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tobey Maguire is back in action as Spiderman in the sequel to the original blockbuster hit. But this time he faces a new villain, Dr. Octopus. An experiment attempting to tap into the power of fusion energy goes awry. Dr. Otto Octavius is then transformed into a maniacal creature controlled via an input into his brain by the artificial intelligence of four mechanical arms welded onto him. It is unclear why the arms were needed for his fusion energy project though.Multiple SPOILERS below.Meanwhile, Peter Parker just can't seem to get a break. His alternate lifestyle as Spiderman is costing him his job, his grades, and most of all the girl of his dreams, Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst). She has given up waiting on Peter and plans to wed an officer.At the same time and almost as some supernatural message, Spiderman begins to lose his "spidey powers". He no longer is able to sling webs, climb walls, have perfect vision, and superhuman strength. Peter Parker takes this as a sign that maybe he no longer is no longer supposed to be Spiderman. Maybe he has a choice to decide who he is to be.With that thought in mind, Peter abandons his superhero lifestyle. His new carefree attitude has him leaving crime to the cops as Spiderman has quit the job. He intends to live a normal life and confess his love for Mary Jane.But just as soon as he has altered his perspective on life, he receives some wise words from his Aunt May. She wonders where Spiderman has gone, as heroes give people hope and courage. They give the promise of a better tomorrow. In each of us is a hero who can do the right thing even if it means giving up our dreams. For Peter, this is a life of fighting crime and losing Mary Jane. He realizes protecting the city is more important.Harry Osborn, whose father was killed by Spiderman in the original, has struck a bargain with Dr. Octopus by agreeing to give him a crucial element of the fusion project he is reconstructing in return for bringing Spiderman to him. The ensuing battle between Octopus and Spiderman is riddled with action. But what is most shocking is that our superhero is unmasked before and entire group of passengers on a train. His efforts at trying to save the train from peril and the physical stress he endures mark his care and concern for helping others. The passengers agree to keep his identity a secret as the admiration for Spiderman endures.Taken captive and returned to Harry Osborne, Spiderman is unmasked just before a knife is about to be plunged into him. Harry is overcome by shock that the entire time it was his best friend that was his father's murderer. Spiderman escapes and quickly flees to save the city from the destructive energy of Dr. Octopus' fusion project.Mary Jane remains hostage (again) as Spiderman battles with the mad scientist in a decrepit warehouse on the river. But Dr. Octopus' defeat is in Spiderman's reminder that intelligence is to be used for the good of mankind. The mechanical arms were controlling him for evil purposes. Intent on not dying a monster, Dr. Octavius destroys his fusion project, sinking it into the river.Unmasked before Mary Jane for the first time stands Peter Parker as Spiderman. They confess their love for one another but Peter knows he cannot allow her to share a life with him where she would be put into danger. Their love can never be.On her wedding day, Mary Jane looks into her heart for the truest answer of "I do." She finds that the answer is with Peter Parker. She jilts the officer she is supposed to marry and runs to Peter's slum apartment. There she tells him that she has a choice too. She is the one who can choose for herself a life of risk in order to be with him. It is her decision. Ironically she has already been abducted twice due to her friendship with Peter.And so Hollywood has another happy ending. In the conclusion we are given a sneak peak into the birth of The Green Goblin as Harry Osborn finds a secret arsenal of his father's Hobgoblin weapons. While this is an unlikely event it is even more so that Harry would run his father's company with a board of directors involved. While this movie has just as much action as the original, the love story is not as memorable. What this sequel does and does well is to further develop Spiderman as a human being with all the same emotions, flaws, and conflicts that afflict us all. And his triumph over some and ability to weather other human aspects are what truly define him as a superhero.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not my kind of movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not a big superhero action movie type, so I went to Spider-Man 2 not expecting much. Even with low expectations, I was disappointed. The movie was like a boring roller-coaster: long, drawn-out, slow sections between overly-intense action sequences. And then, just when the movie should have been over, it continued with too much more story, which could have waited for Spider-Man 3 (which I'm sure will come out).I would imagine that if I were into comic books, this movie would have been more enjoyable. But it's not my kind of movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spiderman 2 has more pieces of a love story and less fighting than the first Spiderman. Mary-Jane is getting married to Mr. Jameson's son and Peter Parker is trying to win over Mary-Jane after letting her down by not keeping promises because of his responsibilities as Spiderman. Peter Parker seems to spend a lot more time contemplating whether or not he should continue to be Spiderman than anything else because he wants to have a normal life. Alfred Molina did a great job as Doctor Octopus and played the part exactly the way a comic book fan would expect. When the movie did have fight scenes between Doc Oct and Spiderman, they were better than the first movie's fight scenes between Spiderman and the Green Goblin. Like the first movie, the ending makes it clear that there will be at least one more movie in the Spiderman saga.</fullReview>

I had the same doubts about the choice of villain in this movie being Dr. Otto Octavius(Doc Ock) but Alfred Molina did a superb job with the character as did the visual effects department. Tobey Maguire really swayed me with his performance in this movie, i was one of the naysayers of his casting in the first place. Kirsten Dunst was also very good in this. James Franco with his Harry Osborn was perfect being torn between his best best fried and the man he believed killed his father. One of the highlights for me at least was Willem Dafoe's haunting cameo at the end as Norman Osborn.The thing that really got me was the Bruce Campbell cameo. All in all very well done acting, directing, visual effects. Better then the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To make this short, there are a lot of plot continuations addressed in this 2nd film. Lots of action, and very entertaining overall. The one thing that I enjoyed most about the first film (which also is carried over in this film), is where spiderman tries to figure out who he is, what he is supposed to become, and how to grow and become a man. As with the first film, this film raise all kinds of new questions *Spoilers*. Now that Harry knows who his father was, then he must know the reason spiderman killed him. So.... will he still seek revenge or will he forgive spiderman. He also knows that spiderman is Peter Parker, so how is that going to factor in? Interesting to see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tobey is too thin. We saw in the first SM Tobey as PP thin but transforms as Spiderman into a nicely buff young man. Its gone in this movie. Has Tobey been sick? I think this one uses too much computer generation. I know, I know that its scifi, but I think they tried to carry the whole movie with CG. Also I think they tried too hard to show the contrast between PP and his alter-ego as SM. More to the point that SM is strong and has a purpose and PP is a goof. Its a wonder that PP survived long enough to become spiderman on that fateful day. With as little self-esteem as PP has NOW when he knows he is SM the poor guy couldn't have made it long as PP only. I know some of you will say he (PP) is just acting to preserve his PP persona, but is he or did the writers just over do it. Overall I was a little disappointed in this sequel, but not to the point that I won't see SM 3 when it comes out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, I wasn't bored, but that's about the best thing I can say for this meandering, lackluster effort. Doc Ock was a pale shadow of a villain compared to the Goblin, and the whole sequence of events leading to his creation made absolutely no sense. Kirsten Dunst, poor girl, looked positively dreadful - since when does Mary Jane Watson look like a heroin addict? The plot really bogged down in the middle, and I was unsure for awhile if Sam Raimi realized that he should have ACTION in his action movie.The effects were, predictably, fantastic, and the elevator scene made me laugh out loud, but I found myself leaving the theater with no images imprinted on my mind, unlike the carnival sequence, the upside-down kiss, and the great speech Peter gives MJ in Aunt May's hospital room from the first movie. A nice piece of throwaway summer mind-candy, but that's about it. Catch a matine.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For once I agree with Roger Ebert. This movie was the best super hero movie I have ever seen. This comment is for the history of film making, not just the modern "Marvel Comic" craze. The cinematography was amazing and the acting was ten times better than it was in the first one. I love the fact that the screen writer tried to stay so close to the comic book. Bravo!It is a movie for the whole family but it has a really great story. I really got into it. All I have to ask is, when is the third one. This is going to work so well as a trilogy or even more. I can't wait.Highly recommended!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this movie at a midnight showing, and after a long and hard day's work that started at 6 a.m., I can honestly say that I was awake and alert throughout the entire movie. Spiderman 2 easily surpassed everything that was done in the original (hopefully the box-office record too). The graphics were improved, there was much more comedy, and it even was quite touching at certain points. The villain, Dr. Octopus, played amazingly by vet Alfred Molina, is even better than Willem Defoe's Green Goblin (and doesn't look half as ridiculus). The ending leaves a huge amount of open space for a sequel I would gladly go see. All in all, see this movie at least once. I know I'll go back several times.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I won tickets to an advance screening of this movie in Sydney.The film is what you would expect from a typical movie version of a comic. Not seeing Spiderman 1 doesn't detract from the movie at all, though reading some of the comics does help. The film itself has some very awesome chase scenes, and as previously mentioned by MisterBling, the CG is quite good (though nothing when compared to The Matrix!)It's a typical Marvel comic... with it's cheesy one liners (though not cheesy as ones found in The Punisher), predictable ending, and the heroes and villains doing the 'ultimate' battle. Oh, and who can forget the damsel in distress!This is a no-brainer movie. Great for watching on a date... it's got everything.

I'd give it an 8/10... just because I've seen better... but it is worth checking out on the big screen!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much better than part one, still no X2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all this movie is 10 times better than part one, the characters begin to take off so Tobey and Franco can actually flex some acting muscle, the story is WAY better, the action and editing are much better 2. I'm glad to see them cast obscure character actors as their villains, Molina really relishes the role and Dylan Baker will make a great Lizard in the future. Like X2, the annoyance of Cyclops cannot be lost; in this franchise it takes the form of Kirsten Dunst and Rosmary Harris. The CG spidey is still unrealistic but looks better than in part one. All in all it is a far superior movie but it doesn't reach the heights of X2 because of director Sam Raimi, the impending success of this one will ensure he sticks around for part 2 but I think the franchise will reach new heights once they change directors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfect Mix Between Action, Superhero, and Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spiderman 2 is directed by Sam Raimi and once again stars Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker, a nerdy kid attending college in New York. However, he's secretly a superhero as well, a hero that calls himself "Spiderman." After the accidental death of his last villain, the Green Goblin, the tension between Peter and his best friend, Harry, has heightened, and the connection between Peter and his love interest, Mary Jane has begun to feel uneasy. Once a new villain called Doctor Octopus has presented himself, Peter must balance his life as a superhero and a college kid while keeping his relationships intact.Spiderman 2 is one of those rare sequels that improves upon the already amazing first film. Most everything in Spiderman 2 is great in most ways, and stands as one of the best superhero films to date. With a great villain, script, and perfectly well-rounded main character, Spiderman 2 is everything it promised to be. Sam Raimi handles this movie pleasantly, and not only built upon the first installment in the franchise, but improved upon it as well.The confliction of the main character, Peter, is absolutely flawless. Constantly throughout the film, the script beats Peter, and the audience, over the head with his problems. His failing relationship with Mary Jane, his inability to hold a job or keep grades up, the constant feel of tension between Peter and Harry, and the new villain on the rise, Doctor Octopus, all combine to make Peter's life completely awful. As the audience, we feel these conflicts through our main character, and subsequently want him to come out on top even more than before seeing the film. This capability to emotionally feel what the main character is what makes any protagonist, whether it be Spiderman or Han Solo, great.The acting, as well, is fantastic. Tobey Maguire, while not exactly improving upon his performance in Spiderman (2002), again does pretty well. Maguire plays a great Peter, and a decent Spidey, which add together for an ultimate success. James Franco plays an even better Harry this time around, improving upon his original performance in every way. Once again, Kirsten Dunst plays a pretty good Mary Jane. While her performance is fine, the character of Mary Jane starts to feel almost like an antagonist throughout the movie. Through her shaky connection with Peter, the audience is, at first, confused with her actions, and then just starts to get slightly annoyed with her character.Despite all of the great performances throughout Spiderman 2, Alfred Molina completely steals the show, playing a magnificent Doctor Octopus. Although Willem Dafoe's Green Goblin/Norman Osborn was great, Molina's performance slightly tops that of Dafoe's. Molina plays an astounding villain, with an understandable motivation and a sensible plan. Doc Ock isn't just a bad guy for sake of being a bad guy; he makes sense. The viewer understands why he does the things he does, and won't take him for granted at all. From his actions to his lines, Alfred Molina's Doc Ock is one of the best superhero villains in cinematic history.Sam Raimi also handles the direction very well. Throughout the entire film, no action is filmed poorly, with no quick or abundant cuts, and great wide shots of Spidey swinging around the city. However, Raimi knows when to cut down on the "cool" shots and such during a talking or exposition scene. He smartly recognizes when the camera shouldn't be taking over for the script, and it pays off greatly. Although he utilizes his traditional "Raimi" camera angles, it works out well, and doesn't distract at all from the plot and characters.Now, I can't write a review of Spiderman 2 without mentioning the train sequence. The train sequence involves Spidey and Doc Ock fighting on a moving train, and it's easily one of the best action sequences in superhero film history. Everything about this sequence is absolutely perfect, and it works in every way. This particular sequence combines the genres of comic book and action so flawlessly, and it works perfectly.The only issue I took up with Spiderman 2 was a small one, but it is present. It is very hard to explain without spoilers, but it is this: Peter's problems are large throughout this film, and it's obvious. However, one of his specific problems is only halfway present. The problem is existent, but it disappears when convenient. Like mentioned above, hard to say without spoilers, but there it is.Spiderman 2 is one of the greatest superhero films ever created, and slightly improves upon its predecessor. I'd recommend Spiderman 2 to anyone who enjoys action and drama wrapped together in one movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Spider-Man sequel and the best superhero movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spider-Man 2 (2004) is Sam Raimi's the best spectacular sequel Marvel's Action superhero film ever and It is Way Better Than the First! I am sorry but I think Spider-Man 2 is way better Than The Amazing Spider-Man 1 and 2. It may take a while for the action to start up in Spidey 2, but when it does it's great. This sequel deals on the inner turmoil our protagonist must face not only as Spider-Man, but as an adult living in the real world -- a nice contrast by the writer. The new villain, Doc Oc, is way better than The Green Goblin could ever hope to achieve. He's a struggling soul just as Spidey, only his has been focused on better achieving what he failed to do, as is Spidey -- saving the world after the death of his uncle. The script here is great. The acting is once again, very well done -- Simmon's character is wonderful. The music is basically the same from the first, a misstep by the composer Danny Elfman. Overall, this is a great sequel and could very well exist had the first not been made.Spider-Man (2002) was fun. I mean really, really fun. However, it was weighed down by the prospect that it took itself too seriously. Spider-Man 2 takes all the fun of Spider-Man and throws away the cheese. That is not to say that those shallow moments are entirely gone, but at least Spider-Man 2 knows exactly what kind of movie it is. Spider-Man 2 starts out a lot slower than Spider-Man does, but when the ball gets rolling, man is it worth the wait! The characters are more developed, the action is so poetic it's almost like watching a synchronized dance, and the story contains more drama and humor. Real humor. The funny moments here are less laughable and more funny, let's just say. Also, where Spider-Man contained some, well, "objectionable" content, Spider-Man 2 is surprisingly chaste. Here is one of those rare occasions where the sequel outdoes the original in every aspect. Swing us away, Spidey! CONTENT: Much stylized action violence; mild language; a few low tops. WHO: Teens and up. Now this is what a superhero movie should be. "Spider-Man 2" believes in its story in the same way serious comic readers believe, when the adventures on the page express their own dreams and wishes. It's not camp and it's not nostalgia, it's not wall-to-wall special effects and it's not pickled in angst. It's simply and poignantly a realization that being Spider-Man is a burden that Peter Parker is not entirely willing to bear.I wish more people could see and appreciate the heart displayed in Spider-Man 2. I love this film I love It the most so much because his life was really hard and because Doc Ock gosh I love him. The film it self more focus on a characters and the same time does the story. The film is struggles more Peter's life and what it Is life as Spider-Man and life as Peter Parker. His life is such a stress and he is trying everything, he even get's to stressful so he loses his powers. The film wasn't focusing only on Peter's life It was also focusing on Mary Jane, Harry Osborn and Dr. Otto Octavius. I love Spider-Man 1 &amp; 2 tough Spider-Man (2002) has flaws and it isn't portrayed by comic books. That is why I prefer The Amazing Spider-Man (2012) over Spider-Man (2002)even tough I do Like the first film. "I believe there's a hero in all of us." In Spider-Man 2, the latest installment in the blockbuster Spider-Man series, based on the classic Marvel Comics hero, Tobey Maguire returns as the mild-mannered Peter Parker, who is juggling the delicate balance of his dual life as college student and a superhuman crime fighter. Peter's life becomes even more complicated when he confronts a new nemesis, the brilliant Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina) who has been reincarnated as the maniacal and multi-tentacled "Doc Ock." When Doc Ock kidnaps MJ (Kirsten Dunst), Spider-Man must swing back into action as the adventure reaches new heights of unprecedented excitement.The movie demonstrates what's wrong with a lot of other superhero epics: They focus on the superpowers, and short-change the humans behind them."Spider-Man 2" is the best superhero movie since the modern genre was launched with "Superman" (1978). It succeeds by being true to the insight that allowed Marvel Comics to upturn decades of comic-book tradition: Readers could identify more completely with heroes like themselves than with remote godlike paragons. Peter Parker was an insecure high school student, in grade trouble, inarticulate in love, unready to assume the responsibilities that came with his unexpected superpowers. It wasn't that Spider-Man could swing from skyscrapers that won over his readers; it was that he fretted about personal problems in the thought balloons above his Spidey face mask.Spider-Man 2 is a 2004 American superhero film directed by Sam Raimi and written by Alvin Sargent from a story by Alfred Gough, Miles Millar, and Michael Chabon. The sequel to the 2002 film Spider-Man, it is the second film in Raimi's Spider-Man film trilogy based on the fictional Marvel Comics character of the same name. Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, and James Franco reprise their respective roles as Peter Parker/Spider-Man, Mary Jane Watson, and Harry Osborn.I love this film and It kicks Ass! 10/10 Score: Bad-Ass Seal Of Approval Studio: Columbia Pictures Corporation, Marvel Enterprises, Laura Ziskin Productions Starring: Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, James Franco, Alfred Molina, Rosemary Harris, Donna Murphy Director: Sam Raimi Producers: Avi Arad, Laura Ziskin Screenplay: Alvin Sargent Rated: PG-13 Running Time: 2 Hrs. 7 Mins.

		<shortDescription>Spiderman 2 or Dark Knight</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Usually when it comes to sequels, its a failure compared to its predecessor but Spiderman 2 was certainly an exception and one of the best superhero films in world cinema today. The story is about Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) who is finding it hard to come to grips with his new profound abilities and his normal life. But he has even a bigger problem to worry about as a new villain known as Doctor Octopus (Alfred Molina) causes havoc in New York City and its up to Spiderman - Peter Parker to save the city and the world from Octopus's destruction despite his current issues. The film was simply awesome!! and takes it to a whole new level. The performances of the cast was of top-notch. The only question Spiderman 2 leaves on my mind is whether its the greatest superhero film to date or is it the Dark Knight? because both were right up there amongst the greatest but that's a question for another day. Spiderman 2 was fun, entertaining and had a lot of romance and is a movie worth watching again and again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overrated Spider-Man Movie in my opinion! Too much love duty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All the critics think this is the best spider man movie and call it one of the best superhero movie of all time and everyone else calls it the best one too. But in my opinion, I think that this is an overrated spider man movie. I like that it starts fresh and has very funny moments particularly J.K. Simmons who is still fantastic as J. Jonah Jameson, but as the movie goes on it starts to get boring, especially for a spider man movie. The special and visual effects are great and spider man looked as real as ever, but the movie drags on in the middle part. Tobey Maguire, who was excellent as the titular character in the first film, lacks heroic presence in the movie. Kirsten Dunst sort of disappoints in the movie a little bit but still is convincing as Mary Jane Watson. To be honest though, I thought Alfred Molina was not that menacing as Dock Ock. He lacked as a villain for me in this movie and I prefer the green goblin over him from the first film. However, James Franco I thought really does a great job in this movie and is my favorite performance in this film but is a little underused.Overall, I thought this movie is just good, not great as everyone else thought. The first hour is excellent but becomes too boring and too much love duty afterwards. Maguire and Molina are disappointing as the hero and the villain. Dunst is still good. The special effects are still amazing. Franco and Simmons both steal the show.Overall: 7/10 Good but overrated Spiderman Movie my least favorite one.</fullReview>

They are always playing/speaking to the ultimate truth/good, and never being themselves.

		<fullReview>Spiderman 2 is not as exciting or brilliant as its predecessor. The villain (Otto Octavius) is just sheer rubbish. Hes not as threatening to Spider Man as the Green Goblin, and could of easily been played by a better actor. The dialogue is, in most parts really cheesy and you would expect to see that in a forty's film but definitely not in Spider Man. It drags a lot of the time as well, as if your begging it to move on.There are also some scenes in Spider Man 2 that could have easily been taken out. For instance the bit when Aunt May is taken up the building by Doc Oc and Spider Man has to save her and when Doc Oc shouts NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO felt embarrassing and easily could of been altered. That leaves the story which is the only average bit to remember this film for. OK it may drift in some and gain speed in other areas but on a whole its averageThats all that Spider Man 2 is really: Average and a disappointment to what it was hyped up to be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is not terrible, but it's not great either. The cheesy moments in the film are some of the corniest ever in cinema history. The movie still has some great action though and Doctor Octopus looks great. The fight scenes are excellent. But the stupid storyline with Spider-Man losing his powers because he's depressed and Doctor Octopus being a sympathetic character is just bad. We already had that with Norman Osborn in Part 1. And having his arms develop personalities of their own was dumb. It was like having 4 hand puppets attached to his back. Not all of Spider-Man's enemies are good people being pushed to go bad. Some are just plain evil and Octopus is one of them. Why change the character. All and all it's a decent popcorn flick. It's a far better film than the horrifically bad first Spider-Man, but it still has it's share of sub-greatness.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Spider-man 2" is the movie the first "Spider-man" should have been. Effort has been put into correcting the mistakes from the first one, and it shows all around. For starters, the visual effects have at last become great to look at, there are still some bad moments though, but at least Spidey swinging in the air seems real this time around. Everybody except Tobey does a wonderful job, Alfred Molina and Kirsten Dunst deserve special kudos here. The first is a great villain, showing a rainbow of emotions and making his character as believable as humanly possible and Dunst, whom I never liked, grew on me, like fungi on stale bread. She saved scenes where the script was corny and considering she had to react accordingly to the vegetable that is Tobey Maguire, she was great and played her character perfectly. Tobey himself is still the same lame-ass actor, looking more retarded than not, unable to show a facial expression without looking ridiculous, and he is one lucky s.o.b. for having others saving his terribly ineffective performance. The guy just isn't Peter Parker/Spider-man, he is physically just a weird looking guy that has a weird (bad) way of acting and just didn't understand what he had to do to get into the character. He doesn't seem to be having any fun at all with his performance. Yet strangely the movie works out fine, without any real damage. Besies also having some weird editing there is of course the fact that the movie has many truly ridiculous moments when our friendly neighborhood falls from 100+ feet to the ground about three times during the movie, just stands up and goes about his business. Spider-man as a superhero is also an incredibly careless and hypocritical guy, on one side denying his love for MJ for the sake of keeping her safe if his enemies discovered his true identity, and on the other taking his mask off like he just din't give a damn if somebody saw him. But in the end everything falls into place incredibly well, nothing feels rushed and the movie ends on a truly high note. With Danny Elfman's music also used much more effectively than in the original I finally had the feeling I was watching a superhero movie. Many great scenes, mostly great acting and effects, and a solid superhero story, I feel I've become a light-weight fan of the series.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite frankly Spider-man, your amazing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This so far has been the best movie I have seen all year...it was all I expected and more. Better than the 2002 hit, this Spider-Man is well worth seeing. A plot I was not expecting when I saw the previews helped too, as it continually surprised me with where it went and where it was going. The special effects are top notch, as was the acting, and generally everything about the movie was just great. Not the typical summer action movie, this movie had heart and just has to be one of the best comic book movies made if not the best. The story has Peter Parker/Spider-man really having a tough go of it as of late. He is late for classes; he cannot hold on to a job, he is neglecting his friends all while trying to lead a double life. Meanwhile, a brilliant scientist is developing a process to make energy. Of course, this is Doctor Otto Octavious. During the two hours you are in for a ride both action wise and emotional. Spidey loses his powers because of all the problems he is having in his life personally and the good Doctor has an accident that causes him to fuse with metal arms he created to handle the unsafe fusion process. The highlights of this one include a very good bank heist by Doc Ock (dubbed that by JJ Jameson) and the best action sequence in any comic book adaptation a fight that starts on a clock tower and ends on a speeding train. Doctor Octopus is a definite improvement over the Green Goblin as he has much cooler fights with Spidey, plus he looks and fights more like the villain in the comic than the Goblin did. The focus in this one, however, is mostly on Peter Parker/Spider-Man as he tries to deal with the enormous powers he is given and trying to find a way to deal with his love for Mary Jane Watson a girl he seemingly can not have. That is what also made this movie work for me...I just can totally relate to his situation. Not that I have super powers, but any woman I fall for I never act upon because I think they will be better off not knowing me. I also have the bad luck and I am a bit of a klutz. Heck, if I did have powers I would have abandoned this life long ago. All in all a great movie that I look forward to buying on DVD. The best superhero ever...go get em' Spidey.</fullReview>

As an avid reader of the Spiderman comic book titles, I really appreciate the way the movie parallels the comic's mythology.My only problem with the movie is the casting of Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson. I'm sure she's an excellent actress, and I'm not too disappointed in performances in the Spiderman series.However, Mary Jane Watson first gained her fame (in the comic) as a model, and I believe the term "supermodel" was even used in a few issues. Kirsten Dunst is an attractive girl, but make no mistake, she's no model.In short, Mary Jane Watson is a hottie, Kirsten Dunst isn't.I know it's a small complaint against an excellent movie, but it had to be said.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A movie like Spiderman 2 is almost impossible to review. I mean, come on, a sequel to one of the most highest grossing comic adaptations of all time? You're just waiting to be slaughtered.Well, okay, let's start at the beginning, I wasn't a HUGE fan of the original Spiderman movie. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the first one as being entertaining, but what was it ABOUT? It seemed to just be mainly character development and nothing else. Oh sure, Willem Dafoe WAS menacing as the Green Goblin (Is Willem Dafoe anything BUT menacing?) but there wasn't anything substantial to come of it.Which brings me to Spiderman 2. This is a lot better story wise then the original Spiderman. While I can do without Alfred Molina (and who wouldn't? Ever see Scorpion Spring?) as Doc Ock, The thing I like about this version is the neat little side story about Peter Parker's struggles of whether work, education, Mary-Jane or being Spiderman is more important in his life. While the answer is predictable from 100 miles away, hey at least Tobey Maguire is entertaining, like he always is,.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director Sam Raimi brings back the Marvel comic book hero, your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man. Peter Parker(Tobey Maguire)is still coming to terms with his dual identity. He's now going to college, delivering pizza and taking photos of...Spider-Man in order to pay his bills. His world is tumbling down around him; he's having trouble at college, his friendship with Harry Osborn(James Franco)is strained, his Aunt May(Rosemary Harris)is being pressured by the bank, and most of all wrestles with the thought of telling Mary Jane(Kirsten Dunst)of his secret identity. The web-slinging Spider-Man has recently been bashed in the press; but NYC needs their hero for the city is threatened by Dr. Octo Octavius(Alfred Monlina)who has turned himself into Doc Ock, a multiple metal armed villain.CGI perfection. Danny Elfman's score meets his genius standards. The story is actually good for an action flick. I could do without the "Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head" sequence, but I realize it is needed to show how the weight of the world has been lifted from Parker as he temporarily tries to disown his work as Spider-Man. The pizza delivery is pretty cool; and the train fight is pulse pounding. Of course, the close-ups of Dunst also do something for me.Also in the cast are:J.K. Simmons, Daniel Gillies and the hot Venessa Ferlito. And for continuity there are the cameos of Willem Dafoe and Cliff Robertson. Spider-Man 2 should please children of all ages... from six to ninety-six.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Storyline: Spidey is back in action as a crime-fighting super hero. But this time, he seems to be grappling with his situation, struggling to strike a balance between his life as Peter Parker and Spiderman.Comment: The performances remain more or less similar to the previous movies. Tobey Maguire has done his job well. The movie makers could have definitely found someone better to play the role of MJ. In fact, in Marve's comics, MJ is shown to be a voluptuous model, a role which Kirsten Dunst fails to fit in to. She looks like a popularity seeking cheapster. James Franco as Harry Osborn and Alfred Molina as Doc Ock/Dr. Otto Octavius have done their roles well.The most notable feature of the movie is the improved special effects that leave the viewer asking for more. The action sequence on the train is especially exhilarating. The cityscapes of Newyork seem more real than the previous movie.Talking about the negatives, the movie has been turned into too much of a love story. The worst part of the movie however, is that his mask is off and he is seen by many. Since kids would be greater fans of Spiderman, I am not sure as to how well they would appreciate it.</fullReview>

Special effects were great, except that at times Spiderman looked a little too fake. Maybe his CGI costume needed to turndown his glossy levels. Regardless, it was worth the 2-hours watching this film.A final comment: With all that web Spiderman was shooting at the buildings and other public/private property, would you not think that some people would be a little upset about his 'littering'? Just a thought.6 out of 10. Look forward to seeing the third installment, although we do have a preview that the annoying Goblin (Jr.) character will be back.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hate to rain on everyone's parade, but I suspect that many of you have been watching too much anime. The CGI work in this movie is possibly worse than that in "The Hulk", which I thought had set an all-time low. The lack of attention to detail and the cartoonish characteristics of the CGI images are just appalling and reflect a total lack of any concern for realism. As I have said in other reviews, it IS possible to do good, realistic, seamless CGI. Check out the now-venerable "Jurassic Park", which made every CGI dinosaur a work of art.With that said, the acting is good, the plot is superior to that of "Spiderman", and the pacing is very good.Just, please....stop hurting my eyes with 10-cent CGI!

But at least you can watch it.Peter Parker a.k.a Spider-man has gotten even worser loser at school than in Spider-man 1. It's because he had so good time flying around N.Y with his web. Everything is falling apart around Peter. Mary-Jane has got a new boyfriend, Harry hates him and Doctor Octavius has gone mad and tries to kill him. In the end Peter Parker ends story of the Spider-man: He throws Spider-man's clothes in the trash can.Yeah. Overrated. That's the only word to describe this film. Isnot good and it's not bad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not very good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Spider-man 2" was one of the biggest hits last year, but, at least in my opinion, it is not very good. Basically I didn't like anything in this movie, except maybe the performance of the actor who played Harry Osborne. Actually he should have been Spiderman and Toby should have been Osborn jnr. Sadly, this is not the case, so we have a whining fragile super-hero, who is a complete loser. Why? In the comic books Parker isn't like this. He is almost a humorous character. This Parker is pathetic. About Marry Jane... nothing personal against Kirsten Dunst, but she is not for this character. Mary Jane from the comic books is witty, clever and very beautiful, in the movie she is an ordinary girl, who knows only to cry. Molina as Dr. Oc... he played well, but where is the costume? In the movie he looked like a fat worker. I'm a fan of the comic books and the TV series, especially Spiderman Unlimited, but this movie wasn't good, it didn't capture the spirit of the hero. More it was a copycat of the first movie as story. I give it 4/10 just because it's Spidey and he is my fave comic-book hero.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know about you but I like my super hero's to be tough and macho. Not emotional and sensitive. This one one of the first of a new style of film. The Dra-Action film. Drama / Action flick. The best of both worlds. Something for the men and women. The men get the fast action(not much action) they like, while the women get the getting in touch with your feelings side. Everyone this side of the North Pole loved this movie. Even Roger Ebert put it on his top 10 list of 2004. I just don't get it. It was rather boring to me. The only thing missing was Dr. Phil telling Spidy to open his heart. I must say that the special effects were much better in this film then Spider-Man 1. I give it a 4 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm glad to see this amazing film back in the top 250 movies of all-time here at IMDb. Credit the drop to a jealous frenzy of fools who voted it 1 out of 10 because of some strange agenda. I'm glad the true rating is gradually sliding back to where it belongs. I agree with Roger Ebert who states that this is the best film of this genera and I also agree with him when he states that it should've been nominated by the academy for best picture of 2004.Even in an era when an explosion of comic-book superheroes is hitting the silver screen, Spider-Man stands alone. You must own this flick! It's tight, emotional, lean and superbly done and I enjoyed it even more on the small screen because the extras were fascinating and very well done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than the first Spiderman, but still fairly unimpressive</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spiderman is back and he's kicking butt. Unfortunately, his alter-ego Peter Parker (Maguire) is having a hard time multi-tasking and everything in his life is suffering. He is failing in college, he can't hold down a job, his aunt is losing her house, and (seemingly most important to Peter) while he's Spiderman he can't romance Mary Jane Watson (Dunst). To make matters worse, Harry Osborn, (Franco) Parker's best friend, keeps harassing Peter to tell him where he can find Spiderman so he can avenge his father. When Parker's school career comes down to a paper that he is writing on Dr. Otto Octavius (Molina), Parker is delighted when Osborn offers to introduce the two, since his company is funding Octavius' research. The two strike up a repoire, but unfortunately, the next day an experiment in fusion goes horribly wrong and Octavius ends up with four metal limbs with minds of their own fused to his spine. Because he has lost everything, (including his mind) Octavius (now known as Doc Ock) goes on a mission to redo the experiment, wreaking havoc on the city along the way. Meanwhile, Parker has decided to give up his double life so that he can concentrate on his life, so he has to make some tough decisions about his future, and the future of Spiderman.When I saw the first "Spiderman", I was entertained but I wasn't amazed. I found the effects to be too cartoonish, and the story to be pretty lacking. In the case of "Spiderman 2" I found the story to be better and more compelling (the amount of conflict that arose was decent) and the special effects were definitely better, but again, I was less than amazed. I certainly didn't see the need for it to be on the IMDb Top 250 list, and it doesn't surprise me that it has fallen off, but from the reviews (both professional and from friends) I read and heard I expected a lot more. The acting was about on par with most action films; meaning it was okay but not great. (Although I still can't stand Kirsten Dunst.) Unfortunately, the best actor in the film was woefully underused, which was a disappointment mainly because he was the villain. Alfred Molina is a fantastic character actor and I think that he could have really made the role of Doc Ock great if he had only been given a sufficient amount of screen time. He didn't get to chew the scenery as much as Dafoe did in the first "Spiderman" film, and I think the movie suffered for it.While the story was better this time around, and the special effects didn't make me cringe at times, I'm still unimpressed by this franchise. Considering I'm a fan of Raimi's other work, and I used to read Spiderman in comic form I think I should be a little more excited with the film than I am. It gets a 5/10 from me.--Shelly</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I walked into this movie I was expecting it to be good not excellent but good. Then the movie started..After a few horrible jokes and just bad acting I decided that, okay its not good but I think they were aiming it towards little kids. An Asian woman playing spiderman on a violin with her fingers and singing with an accent....WHO THOUGHT OF THIS!! The whole beginning part was done horribly or aimed completely towards making little kids have a few horrible cheap laughs. Then DocOc was formed and he overkilled a few people. From that point on it was just pretty bad, Tobey Maquire is OK at best along with Kirsten Dunst. No one else in this movie is above average at all.Story:7/10 What can you ask from a comic movie. I love comic movies and its fine with me to have a simple plot. Acting:7/10 The acting was OK. Nothing that stands out at all.Action:9/10 really coolSpecial FX: 10/10 REALLY good special effects, Doc Oc is done extremely well and you forget it is computerized sometimes.Overall Movie: 6/10 It seemed really stupid. I think they could have made this movie better in a lot of ways. I love the comic book movies so I will always go to see which villain comes next that saves this movie for me.OK, I'm not saying this movie was horrible but it should not be above a 7 at all. It doesn't deserve that AT ALL. This has the same rating as many movies that should have at least 2 points higher than this, for example:Battle Royale(7.9), Hana-bi(7.7), Breakfast Club (7.6), About a boy (7.5).I rate it a 6.5 though i rate it a 7 out of 10 on the IMDb rating system.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a kid growing up in the 1970's, I never missed Spider-Man in the comic books and the Sunday paper. By far, my all-time favorite villain and episode(s) involved Doctor Octopus.I was severely disappointed by the first Spider-Man, and had pretty much given up on Hollywood ever doing a proper comic book adaptation. Although the first one was watchable and not too bad, it fell far short of my expectations. At best, it was mediocre.This one not only met and exceeded them, but it utterly overwhelmed them. Finally, I have lived the dreams of my childhood brought to life on the big screen, and clearly CGI has at last achieved its potential. God, but I regret having missed this in the theater! If you ever liked comic books, Spider-Man or the Dr. Octopus episodes then RUN, don't walk, to your nearest video store and rent this. Then RUN, don't walk, and buy it so you can watch it over and over.This film has renewed my hope that Hollywood still has a vision, and still has capable (even excellent) screenwriters, directors, animators and producers.The best movie of 2004, and easily among the five or ten best movies I've ever seen. An easy 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>People are hailing Spider-Man 2 as the best movie during the summer of 2004. There was only a few good movies during the summer of 2004, so you could easily get away with saying that this was one of the better ones. It's a super hero movie, so realism isn't a huge concern of mine, but yes, Spider-Man 2 is somewhat realistic for the premise that it follows.The reason this movie was considered the best popcorn movie of summer 2004 is because it has two huge elements in it, action and a love story. I have no problem with there being a love story, but I felt as though the love story in this movie wasn't as great as it could have been. The love premise is about how Mary Jane is upset with a guy because he can't show up to her Broadway play. It would be disappointing for someone not to show up, but the character Peter Parker is a busy person and I felt that MJ's character should have realized that. She seemed to be rather ignorant in this movie if you compare her to the original Spider-Man.The reason people hailed this so much is also because of the fact that there is a love story, unlike many other action movies that are very mindless. Even though the love story is mediocre, at least it didn't become a soap opera.There are some great action scenes, but I thought that the mediocre love story interfered with them. At least I appreciate the fact that the film makers attempted to add more story to this movie.Another problem is that the dialog wasn't as good, especially compared to the original Spider-Man. Some of the lines that the character Aunt May had seemed very sappy at some points.This movie does have a great villain known as Doctor Octupus. The movie's high points are where Dr. Octopus is clawing his way up the side of a building and Spidey is swinging through the air trying to stop him.From what I hear, many comic book fans were disappointed with the fact that this movie relied more on a love story than on the action scenes. I'm not a comic book fan, so I wouldn't know.Even though everyone says this is way better than the first one, I have to disagree. I saw the first one at the theaters three times, and I own a copy of it. This one I only saw once and I didn't buy it on DVD.You might completely disagree with me. This was a pretty good movie, but I don't think it is a 4-star movie like everyone says. If you look at the fact that people are comparing this movie to classics like The Godfather and Schindler's List. I think a lot of people should consider how overrated it is if people are comparing it to those movies.This is worth watching once, and yes, it's a good date movie. You might absolutely love it, or you might think of it the same way I did. Whether or not you should buy it is completely up to you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best superhero film ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sam Rami needs to be congratulated on making a film that totally outdoes its predecessor. Tobey McGuire is great and is one of the most likable characters (re: Peter Parker) that I have seen in a film in a long time. Alfred Molina is great as one of the more charismatic villains that have ever been portrayed on the screen. I found myself cheering several times throughout the movie.Peter Parker can't seem to hold a job (he's killing a pizza business that promises on-time delivery or it's free), his grades are stumbling (his extra-curricular activities as Spiderman keep him from being prepared for Dr. Connors class) and he keeps disappointing the woman he loves (he can't even show up to her Broadway performance). He lives in a squalid one-room apartment and the landlord is constantly screaming at him for his rent while the landlord's daughter keeps staring longingly at him. Everything comes to a head when Mary Jane announces that she is getting married to J. Jonah Jameson's son.Peter starts blaming Spiderman for all his woes and as a result his powers seem to slowly ebb from him. He makes a decision to go against the promise he made to his dead Uncle Ben and decides to toss out his Spiderman suit and try to lead a normal life.He seems to be doing better in school and during a very hilarious sequence he struts around to the tune of Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head (reminiscent of a famous old movie).Meanwhile, Dr. Octavius has been turned into a supervillain (thanks to some computer controlled mechanical arms that have attached themselves to him and taken over his mind because of an accident during a scientific experiment). Octavius, now Dr. Octopus, is on a crime wave to get the materials he needs to crate a nuclear reactor that could wipe out the city.A heart-to-heart talk with Aunt May and an attack by Dr. Octopus on the woman he loves, makes Peter realize that he must honor his motto (with great power, comes great responsibility) and become Spiderman once more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The superhero as existentialist.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*Spider-Man 2* is clearly an improvement on the first feature in every significant way, from the script to the F/X (though Spidey still looks like a cartoon when he swings from skyscraper to skyscraper). I watched with increasing amusement as director Sam Raimi and his commission of hacks (including the likes of Alvin Sargent and prize-winning novelist and comic-enthusiast Michael Chabon) irresistibly turn Peter Parker into a comic-book Hamlet, replete with metaphysical conversations with beloved dead relatives and existential soliloquies. It can be argued that *Spider-Man 2* is the perfect movie for our times, a stripped-down and workmanlike rehash of the old, artsy-fartsy cosmic themes that have engaged writers since Aeschylus, custom-made for a generation made pathologically jittery from too much TV and too many colors and lights from noisy Hollywood blockbusters.But let's not get carried away, shall we? The movie isn't a masterpiece, or anything. And not because of its comic-book -- that is, fantastical -- origin. The subject-matter here is no more foolish or "unrealistic" than, well, the plays of Shakespeare, with their ghosts and witches and fairy-queens and the like. The difference, of course, is that Shakespeare (and the other great writers who dabbled in fantasy) added magnificent poetry to their nonsensical plots; Raimi &amp; Co., on the other hand, dumb things down by necessity. The Medium Is The Message, as McLuhan pointed out, and the Medium here is the Summer Blockbuster -- no big words allowed. And that's fine; not every movie should be High Art. But even genre pictures can attain masterpiece-status by rigorous crafting: *Spider-Man 2* is a little too bloated and excessive (over 2 hours of running time) to pass the discipline test. Also, the dialog, while required to be simple, does not have to be simplistic, as well: most of this movie's wit, as in the case of the first *Spider-Man*, resides in the personage of J. Jonah Jameson, played by J.K. Simmons (having a ball by stealing yet another movie). Thus, while the movie's themes are worked out rather magnificently, the tools that build the edifice are just too dull to get us really excited.Stepping away from theoretical flights, let it be said that Doc Ock is probably the biggest reason why the sequel is better than the original. This new villain's exuberant monstrousness -- four gigantic mechanical limbs grafted onto his back, giving the man a total of eight limbs (hence "Dr. Octavius") -- is more in line with the source material's conception of Atomic Age bad guys. That is to say, he's a perfectly modern mutant in the tradition of not just comic-books in general but the various monster-movies of the Fifties and Sixties when the *Spider-Man* comic was created. He's a villain truly in spirit with the material, unlike the Green Goblin from the first movie, with his ridiculous airborne surf- or skateboard that smacked of a bad Mountain Dew commercial. And Alfred Molina takes what little characterization that the script gives him and makes the most of it.As for the other actors: Tobey Maguire, by sheer force of his talent, makes Peter Parker a great role. He intuitively grasps what the character is struggling with, which is, of course, the transition from adolescence to adulthood. The "Spider-Man" persona, from his comic-book origins, was always just a web-slinging metaphor for Growing Up; and while the pedestrian dialog denies Maguire any real exposition on this theme (no poetic flights in iambic pentameter, natch), no actor of his generation has proved to be better at manifesting inferiority. He does it all with his eyes and inflection. Besides Maguire and Molina, the rest of the cast are not served well by the script, but even so, I felt that they were inadequate, especially James Franco as the son of Spidey's former nemesis Green Goblin (and, rather doubtfully, Parker's best friend).All in all, 5 stars out of 10. I have to commend Raimi on his bravery: he's making a franchise that he wants to make. I hope the suits continue to let him have his way, which, if untrammeled, will finally produce a masterpiece that will flop at the box-office. Raimi's auteurist ambitions have been clearly manifested by the loftier goals of *Spider-Man 2* . . . as well as by the ever-so-slightly disappointing box-office returns in comparison to the first outing. In other words, the ground-lings may be catching onto his act, and are starting to get suspicious. Good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Spider-Man 2" is an huge improvement over "Spider-Man".In my comment for "Spider-Man" I complained about several things. One of my biggest complaints was that it was a movie that looked great from the outside but was shallow and empty on the inside. "Spider-man 2" looks great from the outside AND from the inside. The depths and emotions are handled better as in "Spider-Man" and the characters have become more interesting. Sam Raimi still tries to make the movie more than just a superhero movie but difference with his other movies "Spider-Man" and "Darkman" is that it works this time, even though the whole 'spider-man quiting' thing was a bit clich and perhaps not needed.The main thing of this movie is to entertain. The characters have become far more entertaining and there is far more humor added, something I'm extremely happy about.Also the villain has improved big time Alfred Molina's Doc Ock is far better than Willem Dafoe's Green 'plastic mask' Goblin. The villain is cooler and more entertaining and Alfred Molina himself does a better acting job than Willem Dafoe did. Still I was glad to see Willem Dafoe in a small role in this movie, as long as he doesn't start wearing that 'Power ranger' outfit again.Another thing that has improved is the action. "Spider-man" was seriously lacking some good action scene's, luckily "Spider-Man 2" is filled with some spectacular action and some great fights between Spider-Man and Doc Ock along with some great looking special effects.The ending leaves the door open for a lot more Spider-Man sequels and after seeing "Spider-Man 2" I'd say; Bring them on!9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I left the theater on hands and knees, laughing, after seeing Spiderman 2: Electric Bugaloo. Though the CGI looks incomparably better than the first movie, wherein Spidey looks like a cat toy flung about Manhattan, images alone do not a movie make. The absence of a plot made this movie a series of vignettes, loosely related, that in the end go nowhere and advance the hero very little. Even the bad guy really isn't that bad, though it is hard to be evil when you are only in the film for about 20 minutes.To best summarize the movie in 10 seconds or less:Spiderman: I don't want to be Spiderman anymore. (He's not.) (Bad stuff happens.) Peter Parker: I want to be Spiderman again. (He is.) (The Movie gets incredibly silly and ends.)I did not fall asleep through this, however, because it appeared that Sam Raimi never spoke to a science consultant or the script writer had never seen a freshmen physics textbook. I was willing to overlook many typical errors that come in to play when "fusion" appears in the shooting script (magnetic fields strong enough to move cars downtown would destroy every computer in a 500 mile radius). However, when Harry opened his wall safe to get some "tritium" for Dr. Octopus I just lost it. When they suggested dumping the self sustaining nuclear reaction in the river I laughed so hard I cried. A fusion reaction is not a flaming bag of dog doo. It was the greatest blunder since Keanu Reeves outran a nuclear explosion on a motor scooter in "Chain Reaction". Please Hollywood, if you want to have science as a plot point, either talk to a scientist or don't try to explain anything. "Back to the Future" was great because they didn't try to explain time travel. They made a Flux Capacitor. What did it do? Make the car travel through time. How did it work? They didn't try try to tell us. Why? Because it would discredit the movie and break the fantasy.Fiction allows for the suspension of physical law. Unfortunately you must scrap this veil on reality when you try to explain away the magic. Good science makes for bad movies; keep the mystery intact.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>By far this was nowhere near the worst movie I've seen this summer (Van Helsing gets that designation) but I was disappointed. From reading the reviews I see I'm in the minority but sometimes it's like that.What I didn't like: So much angst and not enough action reminiscent of last year's Hulk movie.The overly done heavy handed "Mr Loser" jokes were just too much. Dr Ock is my least favorite Spiderman villain. he is right up there with the equally lame Stilt Man or giant poodle from the Hulk. Why weren't the more interesting villains like Venom, Carnage, Kraven the Hunter, Scorpion or Lizard used? The new contrived origin of Dr Ock and his motivations were weak.Considering how Peter Parker is always disappearing just as Spiderman shows up or Peter is the only person able to get pictures of Spiderman, the idea that no one suspects Peter is Spiderman is as bad as no one realizing Clark Kent is Superman with glasses. The scenes with Mary Jane and Peter. Painfully dull and journeys to nowhere.What I liked: The little CGI that was there. The movement of Dr Ock as well as improvement of Spidey swinging through Manhattan were excellent. Wish it had been the Lizard or Scorpion instead of Dr Ock. Good character development but overdone killing what should have been a great action movie.That's my opinion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie had no real story. This was more about Peter Parker dealing with issues that a superhero movie. The special effects were pretty much the leftovers from part one. The ending of the movie seemed to drag on and on forever. Tobey Maguire does a good job of acting but somehow doesn't seem to fit the role of spiderman. I guess the director forgot about the entertainment factor in the movie because it was quite simply boring. I guess the movie makers wanted to make everyone happy and the ending was just ridiculous. Kirsten Dunst is mediocre at best and her character in the movie is pretty weak. She does look good though. The overall special effects were disappointing considering that there was nothing new from the first movie. Hopefully part 3, which was set up beautifully by the director will have more meat in it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good action movie, but I much prefer the first installment. 2 has arguably the greatest comic book villain of all times, Doctor Octopus, which kind of makes the movie a disappointment since, after him, it's rather forgettable. It really should have been better with such a cool bad guy. Unfortunately, it really drags during the dramatic segments. The film makes no points that weren't made in the first one: can Peter Parker exist without becoming Spider-Man? Will his being Spider-Man always put his loved ones in danger? We've been over all this before, so, at its worst, 2 seems like a simple retread of the first, which I actually found fairly poignant at times. Besides the action sequences involving Doc Ock, there aren't any images as memorable as those of the first, which we are reminded of by a nice opening credits sequence where those famous images are presented as drawings. There are some pretty great comic sequences, fitting well into Raimi's varied career. Bruce Campbell has a hilarious cameo, and, once again, J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson gives the best performance in the movie. 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you have a basic understanding of the world and enjoy watching movies where common sense is applied then this is not a movie for you, because it is no where to be found.First let me say, the characters and story just suck. MJ comes off as a gold digger, Peter is always spineless and confused, Harry has serious daddy issues, and the entire time I was hoping the villain would just kill them all.Now for the lack of sense, apparently Harry and the doc thought it would be a great idea to create a mini SUN in what seems to be someones apartment. Not only do they mention it could blow up half the city, but the sun never seemed to emit any heat at all as to what you'd expect. It also absorbed all the metal around it except for that in the device that's trying to contain it... which makes no sense at all... because if the device is failing to contain it then why wasn't it absorbed? There was also the points in the movie where Peter instantly lost or regained his power, it was an overnight experience in the first movie for Peter's genes to mutate, but now it seems they can switch back and forth in an instant. :/ Plus he's abusing the #1 rule of being a superhero and constantly taking his freaking mask on, exposing himself to an entire train.Another annoying bit was the Doc walking on his robotic arms, it wasn't the movement that was annoying but the sound. Apparently the robotic arms struck the ground with such force from just walking it made buildings trembles and the earth shake with it's loud thumping sound.. I mean come on, it's not a T-REX from jurassic park, just some guy with metal tentacles.By far the worst part of the movie must be the overall story line. Peter spends the ENTIRE movie trying to convince himself that he cannot be with Mary Jane because as spiderman evil may target her.. We'll apparently he didn't know that by being the ONLY person to have some kind of relationship with spider man, that evil would target him or his loved ones to get to spiderman. Then of course at the very end of the movie all of that was just thrown out the window as they ended up together anyway.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Big-budget bummer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Peter Parker learns that being a superhero doesn't necessarily pay the bills, and at the beginning of "Spider-Man 2" he's struggling just to keep a job (he tries delivering pizzas-on-time while being Spidey, which may represent a new low in the superhero genre). Despite a mid-movie montage set to B.J. Thomas' "Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head" (!), this beleaguered sequel is unhappy, unfulfilled, and it doesn't know where to go as a film. Parker confesses guilt to his aunt over the murder of his uncle and is rebuffed, his lady-love is engaged to someone else, his eyesight is going, he has psychological problems, and Spider-Man is being called a "masked menace" by once-adoring New Yorkers. The film invents a foe in Alfred Molina's Doctor Octavius, but he's a ridiculous villain; with four iron tentacles grafted onto his back (with pincher-heads that seem to have brains of their own), he proves just as powerful as Spider-Man--and what's the point in that? Spider-Man gets a good pounding in this one, and the action sequences (always involving one of Parker's loved ones as a target) are CGI crazy. Tobey McGuire is still rather odd in the lead; sleepy-eyed, like a post-modern Tommy Kirk, he has a wonderful moment late in the film trying to stop a speeding subway car but otherwise just ambles through. Director Sam Raimi pauses occasionally for moments of Spidey beauty, but whole scenes don't play (such as every moment at the Daily Bugle), character conflicts are muddy and confused, Molina looks embarrassed, and the tag at the end--setting up the next sequel--is woefully clumsy. Staying true to formula, in movie trilogies the second installment is always the weakest. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If meaningful dialog's your thing, you're going to be disappointed.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In between the overt, gratuitous explosions and debris of Spider-Man 2, you'll be hard pressed to find anything actually worth taking away from the film.The dialog is far too clichd to be taken seriously. The acting isn't exactly top class either and only lends to the overall cheese factor of the 10-a-penny attempts at emotionally charged one-liners.For one thing, there's far, far too much crying for a superhero movie. It seems to me that there wasn't enough emotional weight in the script for the audience to attach themselves to, so the director decided to simply have the main characters cry every couple of scenes in a not exactly subtle attempt to inject emotion into the bog standard plot.I did give the movie 2 out of 10, entirely for the special effects. However, there simply isn't enough adrenaline pumping action to keep even the most optimistic entertained, and to be honest, there's not much that can be considered mind blowing for it's creativity. The characters themselves also have a tendency to look rubbery and out of place in certain scenes while duking it out.As a Spider-Man movie, this one really didn't hit the mark for me. I feel it's an uninspired transition from the first (which I enjoyed much more) to the third (which I am hopeful for, despite this train wreck) iterations and I see it as no more than mindless CGeye-candy at best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Actually better than the first movie.....WOW!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Spider-Man came out in 2002, I thought that the movie was a sheer work of genius and could not be surpassed by any sequel....well how wrong I was.Because when Spider-Man 2 came out in 2004, I was pretty surprised. This movie is one of the best movies ever released. Everything was perfect in the movie, the acting, directing, action, even the script and story were perfect. The moments when the story didn't even matter were perfect!Sam Raim and Tobey Macguire simply out did themselves in this one. And Alfred Molina was pretty good too, and if you ask me, he probably had a better role than Willem Dafoe did as the Green Goblin in the first movie. And don't get me started on J.K. Simmons who plays J.Jonah Jameson(funny as always).But unfortunately as in all movies, it had its downfalls. The downfall of this movie however is the corny lines that MJ says in the movie.But besides that, the film was good and very enjoyable, I strongly recommend this movie to people who are fans of the first film and the ever loving comic books.I give this movie a 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not nearly as good as the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>i don't care how much the critics loved this movie. I for one did not. If you like mushy, gushy romance chick flicks, this movie is perfect for you. If you like Spider-Man, than 1 is the perfect flick for you. This was a major disappointment for three reasons. One; Alfred Molina stunk. Unlike Willen Dafoe as the Green Goblin, Doc Oc was not by any means a threat to Spiderman or a formidable adversary. He wasn't even really evil! Two; aside from the scene where Spider-man battles Doc Oc on the train, there was no action at all in this film. This movie is just about how Peter Parker can't handle the pressure of being Spiderman and Peter Parker, and Spiderman is screwing up his love affair with Mary Jane. No action in that. Three; the question that has been on our mind for a long time after the first movie was this: What would Harry Osbourne do to Spiderman if he got him in his clutches? What has he do when he gets him? He let's him go. It's was unbelievable. The acting was fine with the exception of Alfred Molina, but you don't look for acting in an action movie. You look for action! This movie did not supply us with that and that's why it didn't do it for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cheers went up around the movie-going world in 2002 when "Spider-Man" hit the big screen. It was a rousing success that exceeded every expectation of movie-goers (myself included), comic book fans, critics and investing movie executives. The sequel picks up two years after the initial installment left off. The action sequences are soaring, the effects are eye-popping and the original cast and director return with a new writer who is completely dedicated to their vision. The same comic book fans, movie goers and critics again gave a tremendous vote of praise through massive waves of attendance and positive reviews. However, in the midst of all this positive noise, few have been willing to look at the fact that this blockbuster comes within a hair's breadth of collapsing under its own weight.Peter Parker (Toby Maguire) has spent the last two years living a double life of student and the costumed vigilante, Spider-Man, when the story begins. His life is like a spinning top losing its momentum as he juggles 2 jobs, college classes, and his personal life. He tries to help his Aunt May (Rosemary Harris), but feels guilt about his accidental contribution to his Uncle Ben's (Cliff Robertson) death at the hands of a mugger. Norman Osborn (as played by Willem Dafoe in the first movie) was also the costumed villain, The Green Goblin, but Peter as Spider-Man concealed that fact from the public to save Norman's reputation. As the result of that good deed, Peter's best friend, Harry Osborn (James Franco), blames Spider-Man for his father's death, and their relationship has taken on a love-hate tone because Peter continues to sell pictures of Spider-Man to the newspapers. Peter is also trying to conceal his love for his life-long friend, Mary Jane Watson (Kirstin Dunst), because he feels that his self-appointed obligation to be Spider-Man would endanger her if they become more than friends. His teachers are critical of his absenteeism. Spider-Man keeps interfering with these parts of his life. All this is happening while he lives in a dumpy apartment with no visible way out of his rut, and he begins to wonder if his double life is worth while.As part of a class assignment, Peter soon meets with nuclear physicist, Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina) who is under contract to the company Harry Osborn inherited from his father. Peter has the opportunity to bond with the scientist before a botched experiment (possibly the worst-planned in history) causes the death of Otto's wife and the ruin of Harry's corporate reputation. A tool comprised of four computerized metal arms used in the experiment becomes fused to Otto's body, and this, combined with the loss of his wife and dream, drives him to become an insane villain, dubbed "Doctor Octopus" by the press. While "Doc Ock" begins to reconstruct his failed experiment on a scale that could endanger all of New York, Peter has falling outs with everyone he cares for. The combined stress causes his super powers to falter, and he gives up his second identity. Much needed perspective comes from his break, and he starts to pull his personal life back into order. However, the villain reemerges, and Peter must rise to the occasion to save the city and the ones he loves.People who make comic books have well-developed senses of humor, and at one point, a self-effacing issue entitled "The Megalomaniacal Spider-Man" was published. The issue parodied Peter's constant troubles by showing people getting tired of his self-involvement and him missing the world around him as he took brooding to new lows. I couldn't help but think of that comic while watching this movie. Although attention to character development has long been missing from the comic book genre in film (take Joel Schumacher's "Batman &amp; Robin" as a prime example), the story dwells so frequently on watching Peter suffer and listen to other characters give long-winded speeches, that Peter seems unnaturally frozen from taking action to help himself ? even within the confines of the story. (And that is certainly not to knock Toby Maguire's performance, which is spot-on.) He just seems to brood and worry. One example is a short scene after he has renounced his life as Spider-Man when he sees a mugging in an alley. It is a scene where anyone could simply shout to attract the police or distract the thieves, but Peter freezes in position and gives a contemplative, worried look before moving off. Renouncing a vigilante identity would not erase a person's conscience, and the scene is unintentionally laughable. This type of too-obvious exaggeration weighs the movie down.The themes of honor, responsibility, sacrifice and what really makes someone a hero are at the very core of Spider-Man's character, and have been with him throughout most stories in his 40-year existence. However, there are so many characters giving speeches about these things, that it breaks the flow. It speaks to the filmmakers' dedication and to get Cliff Robertson to return for a single dream sequence as Peter's Uncle Ben. Although these kinds of things have occurred in the comics, the dream sequence takes on an odd tone. It is intended to be a "Star Wars" moment similar to those between Luke and Obi-Wan, but it ends up being self-important and just a touch creepy. If Peter had finally reached the end of his rope, he wouldn't take two scenes to think about quitting ? he'd just quit. With that and the double tongue-lashing Peter receives from his friends at a party, you wonder if while everyone spends so much time contemplating what is important, they haven't just missed the chance to do something about it.Raimi leaves all these scenes in (along with too many of his signature horror film close-up shots of screaming women), and they smother what is otherwise a faithful, heartfelt and fun adaptation. Hopefully, the anticipated third installment will let the characters' actions speak more for themselves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Man, was I disappointed with this film - particularly the first half...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As far as I can remember, I've never watched a movie that's led me to want to get up out of my chair and leave the room due to frustration over what is being presented to me on the screen.It happened during the first half of this film - Spiderman 2.When I watch a movie, I want to be taken in by it and believe what's going on - believe in the characters and believe their situation. Is that too much to ask? I think not.But in this film, the makers want me to believe that Spiderman can't be killed, like he is Superman in a world where Kryptonite doesn't exist. He's thrown around, he falls from tops of buildings, bounces off of walls and cars before hitting the ground face first - but gets up with nothing more than a bit of a sore back... "My back! My back!". Jeez.The makers of this film also want me to believe that Peter Parker's character is a true, down to the bone, loser - I mean, someone who can't even take care of himself let alone the entire city of New York. This doesn't make sense. I know we're supposed to see him as unlucky, and down-and-out money wise. OK, I would accept that - but no! The makers of this film need to stress, for scene after long scene, that Parker is a NERD, a GEEK, a LO, a SER! Why? I never got this impression from anything I remember reading when I was a kid...Stan, why didn't you say anything?? Moving on to feats of strength... am I watching Spiderman in action here, or is it Superman wearing Spiderman's tights? Since when can Spiderman hold up entire building walls for like... ever, while he waits for his girlfriend to scurry away to safety? And the scene with him sticking his legs out onto the railway ties to try and slow the train - I didn't get that at all - the second (and successful) attempt made more sense for the Spiderman I know, using his webbing.I know that anything goes in the comics, it's a make-believe world. But I'm just asking the makers of this film to try a little harder to make it believable...please! I personally feel it was the fault of the screen writers going overboard on things in the name of the mighty god of "Blockbuster Film". How about the idiotic scene where he's saving the little Asian girl from the fire? Were my eyes deceiving me or was she, after being thrown across the room to get by the whole in the floor, actually pulling parker up to safety? Was it still the little 4 year old girl, or her older, sumo wrestler sister, that comes in to save Spiderman? (insert Twighlight Zone music here)...This brings me to my last point: Too much focus on romance! Gag me with a spoon - talk about corny. Was I watching an action/sci-fi/fantasy movie, or Gone with the Wind? I know that the really big blockbusters need a little romance in there to appease the masses, but c'mon...this was too much. WAY too much. I found myself calling out to the screen to move along, get to some action, get away from the corniness! Jeeeeeez! I'm honestly afraid to give this film a second chance and I seriously question Sam Raimi's vision and judgement. I have no idea why there wasn't more negative feedback on this film from the community - I'm hoping it's because I'm just out of touch and in no way a film connaisseur, and unable to understand the reasons this picture was so successful. Otherwise it will mean it was mass-hysteria and marketing that controlled the majority of the fan's reactions and the high scores this film obtained on this site.Sincerely, Kwake</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>NOT the best super hero movie ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some of the top film critics have called this the greatest super hero movie ever made. Not true. I like the Spider-Man series but I find Tobey Maguire too soft for the role. His looks and his voice don't strike a super hero chord in me. There's NOTHING wrong with his looks or voice, it just isn't for a super hero role. A super hero role needs to have an actor with stern looks and a commanding voice of presence like Michael Keaton or Christopher Reeve in their respective roles as Superman and Batman although, contrary to popular belief, Batman is NOT a super hero because he is mortal and operates with very human qualities. The definition of a super hero is someone who has special powers aside from the mortal way of life.'Spider-Man 2' has great special effects and Alfred Molina's role as Doc Ock is a memorable villain but 'Spider-Man 2' just gets lost in its own mix of elements and it clearly ends setting up the film for a sequel strictly for the purpose of making money. A lot of films do this but this film makes it look SO obvious and having too many people know your true identity weakens your strength as a super hero and while this is good film making, director Sam Raimi directs it by the numbers without clever interjections of his own vision, elements which were also present in the first film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nowhere near the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seeing Spiderman 2 I find almost dumbfounding that people are actually calling it better than the original. The first movie was a brilliant movie with a deliberate pace that crafted the plot wonderfully and really made you care about the characters. In the second everything is just sort of thrown together in order to make it more of a fast paced ultimate action movie. I suppose this is okay, but it sort of left me feeling like "blah" as far as the characters involved. Not to mention the fact that Peter Parker takes off his mask for like five hundred people to see and doesn't seem concerned even though masking his identity was supposedly his ultimate motivation so that his friends and family are never injured. All in all I'd say this movie was an overblown action flick that was a bit of a rip off Superman 2. (I.E. losing your powers to be with girl and then reclaiming them to save said girl) I rate it at about a six because of the excellent effects and some of the humor. Still I hope they don't continue down the ladder as they venture into the third film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We've been to see two sequels this weekend, and were thoroughly disappointed with both. Besides Spiderman 2, we also saw Shrek 2 - I'll put my remarks about that in the appropriate place.My major criticism of the film comes under the heading of "character development". Despite going to inordinate lengths to try and paint the main protagonists as real people with real concerns, this side of things fall flat. The characters remain one-dimensional, with Kirsten Dunst contributing mainly screams and a gratuitous wet-dress-no-bra moment.Tobey Maguire also fails to deliver a convincing performance as Peter Parker, and seems to have been cast for his ability to get into comic book poses, rather than his ability to deliver lines in anything but the most whingeing tone. It's not surprising Spiderman has enemies - after just 2 hours in the cinema I was ready to slap him, too. And asfor Peter Parker being a genius? It'll take a better actor than Tobey Maguire before I believe that.James Franco also makes a meal of things.What this most reminded me of, to be honest, was an episode of Smallville. James Franco has taken all his cues from the young Lex Luthor, certainly. The difference is, I would have enjoyed watching back to back episodes of Smallville more - they actually have a plot, some character development, some acting ability, and actors who are capable of obtaining some empathy from their audience. Oh, and it's free to watch on the telly,too.The continuity also sucks in this film - it's simply not credible for James Franco to find his father's bad guy kit in a secret room when it all got destroyed at the end of the first one, and his Dad had to break back into his laboratory to get the only prototype in the first place. Or did he, somewhere along the line, create a duplicate MacGyver style in case he trashed the first? Not credible. As for the action? Snore. What happened to the random chasing of bad guys in between interludes with the villain, with a few good punch-ups and some wisecracks?So - very simple to fix: recast the lot and get a decent writer on board.One of my largest criticisms is that the entire film just seemed to be building things up for the next sequel, rather than trying to stand as a film in its own right. The result is the feeling that I have completely wasted my time. There are film trailers more interesting and exciting than Spiderman 2. Failing that, watch a few episodes of Smallville - you'll be a lot less disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, being a fan of the comic and liking, if not enthusing over the first spiderman-movie, I really wanted to like this - and after the second trailer I made certain to see it. Looked like one of this summer's highlights...What a let-down it turned out to be - while Spidey 2 does have some pretty nice fight scenes, nifty ideas for setting and some great moments of the dry wit that makes the comic so special ( Gotta love the newspaper staff - or the elevator scene, for the record..), this also suffers from intense emotional overload. Nothing against some intelligent, relevant minor plots, BUT...... there is just too many cluttering sub-plots leading no-where special or any place at all, far too many of the non-spiderman scenes we could easily have done without simply because they are _redundant_ (yes, I am no dimwit, after the very first letter from the bank we all realize theat Aunt Marge is in financial troubles. There is no second or third scene necessary - unless the scriptwriter gets paid per word, I guess. His "quality" writing is certainly up to those lofty standards ), many more could have been edited to _some_ degree of crispness and several of the smaller running gags turn stale when seen for the second time...and then again, ad-infinitum ad-nauseam...As for Spidey's temporal inability to "perform" properly - did someone forcefeed the scriptwriter some mildewed books on clicheed Freudian theory recently ?&lt;Spoilers ahead&gt; The movie's one big problem is, that it rips off the better scenes from the first movie, and rehashes them. I mean, is MJ ever in danger from anything else than dropping to her death (which, on the other hand happens all the time - even to Aunt Marge..) ? Why is it always the same house on fire with Spidey running inside to save the lost kid ? As for the 'Grand Finale'.....&lt;shiver&gt; besides Doc Oc's sudden turn-around of ethics and ability to listen to constructive advice the utter inanity of disposing the movie's "McGuffin-device" by dropping it into the Hudson river (yeah, a fusion-reaction is some kind of fire...water will quench it, not like it is burning up metal and won't need oxygen anyway....... ROFL, even for a on-screem comic _that_ is hilariously silly ) - especially in dramatic slow-motion.... Still, if the movie had stopped there, I might have been miffed, but the whole thing would have remained a fine, if faulty movie.But the script then goes on and pours another 5 minutes of pure, kitchy, clicheed sugar-coated soapiness onto the audience, which had (around here, that is YMMV ) the entire theatre angrily roaring and disgusted, while the movie was getting wrecked, thoroughly ! Dear "Scriptwriter", dear Director - if we want "Melrose Place - the Sugarcoating" we switch on the TV, drugged to the gills if possible, for *****sakes !!! I don't go to see Spiderman 2 to see Kirsten Dunst breathlessly hustling through new York in high heels and a bridal dress, especially not if done in Soft Focus !!! And if there ever has been a more stupid and cheesy final line in a comic-adaptation script than the "Go get them, tiger !", I stand stupefied.As for the acting - just up to standards, as usual, the villain is (surprise !) the much more interesting character, Kirsten Dunst is in her usual "slightly-retarded" track and Tobey Maguire doesn't appear to have any fun at all (unless he turns into an FX, but then its not really Maguire anymore, hehe). William Dafoe's short cameo painfully reminds us that there are actually decent actors around, just not all that many in this contraption.Waste your money at your own leisure - the DVD release will certainly do, especially if someone else paid for it. Oh, and as a warning - even the girls who tucked along hated itPS _ I will never find out why the Doc's tentacles were hissing and making spitting noises... Probably meant to underscore the vile wickedness of AI-sentience and self-preservation... but does that give them the ability to do so ? 'nuff said3/10 spiderwebs</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you look at what happens in this movie, you can basically see that the 2 in the title is pointless, this is just spiderman one, all over again. Spiderman 2 is boring. It has a few good laughs, mostly unintentional. It has a few scenes that are just pointless. It has a few good action sequences with a few references to Raimi's Evil Dead awesomeness. Now that being said, I must pay my respect to Sam Raimi-a talented and amazing action sequence director, for sure. The rest of the movie however, was boring and predictable. It was predictable because the exact same things happened in the first film. Switch out how the bad guys move around, swap out high school angst with your basic quarter life crisis, throw in a bunch of Mary-Jane (excuse me, totally rad M.J.) in trouble scenes, Aunt Mae in trouble scenes, another boring and so far from reality science lecture by some slightly flawed pre-bad guy bad guy, throw in another spidey saves a mass transit train, and then fill the rest with the exact same relationship dialogue from the first film. To prevent our country from going nuts and killing each other in the theater-give em the Ross and Rachel friends ending...whew, that made it all worth listening to ALL OVER AGAIN. I am completely surprised by the audience and critical response to this movie, it really doesn't deserve the way the country is spitting its web juice all over it. I was hoping this would be an awesome coming of age story, a story about self confidence, how finding that is the cornerstone of becoming a man. It wasn't that. If you think it was, go back and see at what point Peter remembers what his capabilities are...not when he decides that he's back, after a long slow motion sequence of him running across a roof top...no not then, when it wouldve couldve shouldve been about self confidence. Nah, he gets his abilities back when hes filled with rage over doc ock taking MaryJane away. Great. Like we need more kids out there thinking that rage is what it takes to realize your "power" within.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm apparently in the minority of film goers in that I despise this film. Its simply one of the dullest, most predictable films I've seen in years, and yet people are falling all over themselves with praise for it. Which version did all these people see since it wasn't the one that played my local cinema.Basically this is a Spiderman film with out Spiderman. The Parker/MJ relationship trudges on, Osborne moans about how his father was killed by Spidey and Parker tries giving up the suit. Its dull and worst of all you know where its going. Perhaps its the trailers, or perhaps its just the conventions of the genre, but what ever it is this film is so predictable that Las Vegas is considering banning it as too sure a thing.The only joy is Alfred Molina's Doc Ock. When he is on screen you realize what this movie should have been. He is a villain of the highest order and gives a performance that Oscar will be noticing come award time.(It better or else some super villains will tear down the Academy) Molina gives the film a reason to be. Unfortunately instead of being the main thrust of the film he's given the short end of the stick. If I did my math right he's in it for around 30 to 40 minutes, and disappears from even conversation for whole sections of the film. He's the best thing in this movie and he's second banana to angst.Not that anyone is going to listen to me, but wait for cable or home video when you can zap through the dull parts.Four out of ten, simply because the 10 out of ten Molina bits are dragged down by less than zero rest of the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Distant characters, plot is a commonplace, the film a mess.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow! It is unbelievable how weak this movie is. It is so full of flaws that they seem interconnected between so that the few moments of real acting and art are washed away by the erratic stream of less-than-mediocre story-waving. The plot is flat and trite, full of the usual American brainwashing blurb about how there's a hero in everyone, about benevolence, the dream of justice, and so on. In fact, the characters (with the exception of Mary Jane, perhaps) are acted out as if they weren't really alive and had no spiritual bond between them whatsoever. They just cannot feel, they only act stupidly and get caught in the web of artificiality and commonplaces. Sincerely, if Americans can recognize themselves in these characters, I feel great sorry for them, for in that case they do not know what human compassion, human warmth really means. ...OK, I must nevertheless recognize that the scene when Spidey stops the train went berserk and loses his mask, is very moving and inspiring. And the end is very pleasing, with a very human and intelligent Octavius who is back to his senses. Not the worst super hero movie I've seen after all, but it would have been much better without the usual soapy American moralizing nonsense.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I expected to love this film. The first Spiderman film was beautifully done and I'm a big fan of Sam Rami's work. I never dreamed it would turn out to be so badly plotted, poorly scripted, self-indulgent, over-stuffed and under-edited.To be fair, there were several good points. J.K. Simmons is a joy to watch as he nails the J. Jonah Jameson character -- his scenes are the best in the movie -- and the Doc Ock role could not have been more perfectly cast than with Alfred Molina. The action scenes were the best I've ever seen when it comes to capturing the feel of comic book action sequence. Unfortunately, much of the writing was equally true to capturing the feeling of comic book thought balloons -- and in a movie, that's bad.Worse, much of the plot made no sense at all -- the entire subway fight was spectacular but completely contrary to the villain's objectives. The resolution to the Doc Ock threat was insipid at best, and the entire first hour was painfully dull. Everything in it could have been fully established and better done in 30 minutes -- 40, tops.Raimi's usually deft touch with humor was painfully absent. The broad comedy was overdone, highly repetitious and delivered with a sledge hammer. At the end, I felt I'd just watched Spiderman Meets Abbott and Costello, with poor Tobey Maguire being forced to play Spiderman and Abbott and Costello.This was a terrible disappointment for this Sam Raimi (and Spiderman) fan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I assume that most of the reviews for this film that I've read, have been written by non comic book fans. So I'll allow the synopsis that its a good movie to go. It is. BUT... a good Spiderman film it is not &amp; I really really cringed when I saw it first time. It breaks all the rules of Superhero film... He exposes his identity 3 times in less than half an hour, once to a whole train of people, its slow, the humour of Spiderman is sadly lacking &amp; I can honestly say the only redeeming piece of this mess was the fabulous Doc Ock, Alfred Molina is magnificent &amp; steals the whole show. Take out half an hour of nonsense (raindrops keep falling on my head scene? Whats THAT all about), pull it closer to what comic book fans want &amp; don't hack with the formula &amp; bring back Spideys sense of humour &amp; you might just have a near good movie here! Why does Hollywood always feel the need to mess with things that are perfect just the way they are. Its doesn't need updating. It doesn't need depth. It doesn't something more gritty or something more inspirational... its Spiderman for gods sake... the wealth of source material is endless! STICK TO THE FORMULA.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst Comic Book Movie Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sequel to the 2002 Crapfest, with a bigger budget and an interesting villain I finally gave Spider-Man 2 ago having watched it with a friend of mine, I sat and watched on with the opening twenty minutes of solid boredom and the greatest line in the history of cinema "Spider-Man stole that guys pizza's" yes the lame opening twenty minutes is almost rivaled by the stupidity of New Yorkers depicted in this movie.Worse of all the one lines are unfunny, lame and boring, compelled by Aunt Mays falling down a skyscraper being saved holding onto her umbrella I've got to hand it to the writers of this film they pulled out all the stops *hint of sarcasm I think* Alfred Molina does an OK job as Doc Ock but even he looks bored in this piece of drivel.The Action is very good in this movie, but it falls down when I have to watch a Spider-Man video game being thrown about on top of a moving train did they call in Activision to do the special effects? The roof top battle on the train is the best part *pinch of sarcasm again*, not only does he take his mask off but ensures every low life and loser of New York now knows what his face looks like, followed by two children who say "We won't tell anyone" yes the kids speak for every person on that train, yet again I can hear the snaps of *talented writers* then Harry finds out, Mary Jane, and then Doc Ock by the end of the movie, and after his dramatically boring rescue of Mary Jane he puts his mask back on which begs the point of why bother, just web sling around New York with your normal face there's no point anymore.Overall I wouldn't recommend this movie for anyone to watch, I'd find watching paint dry, and best part of all I find it amusing its in the top 250 movies of all time, and made a lot of money, must have been a slow year at the box office, I give this 2 stars and that's being kind, I'm going to mail Sam Raimi some money so he can go and see Batman Begins and see how a superhero movie should be done, and not some second rate two hour pile of garbage that deserves more razzies than Star Wars Episode I.Disappointing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I understand that a lot of the audience at the spidey films are comic book fans or even avid watchers of the cartoons. This does not of course justify for the popularity of the film. This movie was just as disappointing as 'The Hulk'. Just like the audience I was intrigued to watch the movie as a comic book fan. Part of the disappointment might have come from the high expectations for it, but beyond that there are some things to take into account. First, the movie was too long, slow paced and extremely sappy. The best example of this is the subway scene. "we'll protect your identity spidey" oh please give us a break. I would have been the first to go tell Mary Jane and get some good money off the newspapers for his cover. A million bucks? oh come on, you wouldn't do it too. If it had not been for the fact that my little cousin was enjoying the movie, I would have walked out. Two hours of my life, I won't be able to get back. What a waste of money on production, acting, and consumers. Bottom point, don't see this movie... it might just make you a little less smart.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My husband and I just rented Spiderman 2, skipping it in the theaters because we hated the first movie so much. I can't believe it, but we actually hated Spiderman 2 even more than its prequel. The sequel rehashed the dull moral quandaries of the prequel, and the CGI effects were lame. Plus, the villain was a non-entity with Alfred Molina, a usually vibrant actor, phoning in a dull and mannered performance. What was up with the cinematographer? Kirsten Dunst looked terrible. She was washed out, dressed in unflattering clothes, and barely registered a pulse with her performance, or lack thereof. The action sequences looked so fake that my husband and I laughed and laughed, especially with the idea of disabling a fusion generator by drowning it in a body of water. Suffice to say, we were so disappointed that we almost asked for a refund of our rental fee.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A rare sequel that improves on its already very good predecessor in every respect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A rare sequel that improves on its already very good predecessor in every respect, this is an absolutely brilliant superhero film. The film has a first rate screenplay by Alvin Sargent based on the storyline by Alfred Gough, Miles Millar and Michael Chabon. In my review of the first film, I criticised it because I felt that some of the characterisation was lacking. On this occasion, however, the character work was placed to the forefront and it is never less than entirely convincing. It is not all character drama, however, as there are some very funny moments peppered throughout the film. Sam Raimi's direction is superb and the action scenes are far more exciting than those in the first film.Tobey Maguire's performance as Peter Parker is excellent and I really felt for Peter as circumstances have placed him in more than one unenviable position. It has been almost two years since he became Spider-Man but he has yet to find a balance between his life as a crime fighter and his personal life. His lecturer Dr. Curt Connors laments that he is wasting his great scientific potential as his grades have been steadily declining and he seldom makes it to class on time. In a development clearly inspired by "Superman II", Peter temporarily loses his powers and abandons his superhero mantle in the hope of resuming a normal life and pursuing his long held dream of having a relationship with Mary Jane Watson. In contrast to the earlier film, the reason behind Peter losing his powers is never specifically stated but I think that it was psychosomatic. After he focuses his attention entirely on being plain, simple Peter Parker, he is probably the happiest that he has been since before Uncle Ben's murder but the crime rate in New York City increases by 75% in Spidey's absence. He is inspired by Aunt May to resume web-slinging after she tells him that Spider-Man is a hero and sometimes heroes have to sacrifice the things that they want, even their dreams. This is a very effective character arc as it illustrates that life as a superhero is not all saving pretty girls from falling to their deaths and beating bad guys with alliterative names. It is often incredibly unfair but it carries great responsibility.Alfred Molina is wonderful as Dr. Otto Octavius, a leading nuclear physicist who is trying to create a viable means of fusion power in order to cure the world's ills. However, all does not go according to plan as the fusion reactor destabilises and Octavius' beloved wife Rosalie is killed in the resulting explosion. In the process, the four robotic arms that he had been using become bonded to his body and the inhibitor chip that he had designed to protect his higher brain functions are destroyed. As such, the arms' artificial intelligence begin to exert its influence on him and he becomes the supervillain Doctor Octopus. Octavius is a very tragic figure, considerably more so than Norman Osborn. He is a very nice man who takes a liking to Peter and would have perhaps become a mentor and close friend to him if things had turned out differently. Although Rosalie only appears in two scenes, the first of these is so well written that there is a clear sense of warmth, love and affection between her and her husband. Kirsten Dunst is very good as Mary Jane, benefiting from the stronger material that she has to work with this time around. She is enjoying great success in an Off-Broadway production of The Importance of Being Earnest and Peter promises to be there on time to finally see her critically acclaimed performance as Cecily. However, his extracurricular activities mean that he arrives late and is consequently refused admission. This causes Mary Jane to lose faith in him. In a lovely little scene, Peter "confesses" his identity to her over the phone after the call has already ended. When he abandons his superhero lifestyle, he attempts to finally start a relationship with Mary Jane but she rebuffs on the basis that she is engaged to J. Jonah Jameson's son John. She later realises that she loves him but her timing is a little off as Peter had recently decided to resume his crime fighting. In order to protect her from his enemies, he lies to her and tells her that he does not love her. James Franco is very strong as Harry Osborn, who harbours a deep resentment towards Spider-Man as he believes that he murdered his father. His once very close friendship with Peter is suffering as he thinks that Peter is hiding the superhero's identity from him. Harry has become so obsessed with vengeance that he thinks of little else. Rosemary Harris likewise receives more interesting material in this film. One of the best moments involves Peter confessing to Aunt May that he could have stopped the carjacker who killed Uncle Ben. She is understandably shocked and upset by this but her initial reaction is to remain silent and retreat upstairs. Aunt May eventually forgives Peter as she loves him like a son and even commends him on being brave enough to finally her the truth. Cliff Robertson returns in a great cameo as Uncle Ben, who represents the better angels of Peter's nature and attempts to persuade him to do the right thing. In a scene inspired by "Hamlet", Willem Dafoe returns as Norman Osborn, who represents the darkest part of Harry and urges his son to avenge his death. J.K. Simmons is once again brilliant as Jameson and gets the lion's share of the funniest lines. It also features nice appearances from Donna Murphy, Elya Baskin, Elizabeth Banks, Ted Raimi, Dylan Baker, Aasif Mandvi, Bruce Campbell and the one and only Stan Lee.Overall, this is everything that I ever wanted from a Spider-Man film and more.</fullReview>

It had a great cast, well executed story, amazing CGI, and a comic feel to it. I was very excited for the second one. I mean who wasn't? 2 years seemed impossible to wait for me. When it finally arrived, I was pumped. And I left the cinema with a good feeling. This movie right here had everything. Alfred Molina's likable villain, Peter's hard time with his alter ego, great performance from JK Simmons as J Jonah Jameson, comic relieved scenes and great CGI. But aside all of that, it was a magical tale of love and adventure.</fullReview>

Toby Maguire, by comparison, looked terrific, with his steely eyes and deadpan expression throughout. The special effects were superb, with Doc Ock's multiple arms excellently done. This film proves how close comic books and movies really are --- except one costs two hundred thousand times the other. It's a tailor-made "family" picture with something for everyone. However, I did not think the pair of lovers were convincing: Peter was so wretchedly tongue-tied throughout, and they only kissed for five seconds at the very end. Still, it was good fun to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inferior to the first, but still a good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Spider-Man 2" is the second film from Sam Raimi's trilogy on everybody's favorite spider. It plays 2 years after the first film. Almost exactly 10 years ago, it won an Oscar for its visual effects and it was also the second most successful film in terms of money from 2004. Only the "Shrek" sequel topped it. There are quite a few parallels to the first film. The main antagonist is another brilliant scientist who seems to like Parker, but personal tragedy (in this case, the death if his wife) happens and he goes over to the dark side. I have to say I did not like Doc Ock as much as the Green Goblin, but that has more to do with the greatness of the latter. Doc Ock is a fine villain on his own. Kirsten Dunst returns as Mary Jane and I'm still not completely sold to her, maybe because I don't find her particularly attractive and I can't see great acting range in her performances either. Also the whole love/cannot love her storyline got a bit repetitive by now and the fact that she was about to marry a famous astronaut and that pictures of her were seemingly hanging everywhere was a bit too much in the face for my taste. The wedding finale was extremely cheesy and I wish they could have finished differently. The "Go get them tiger!" does not help either. Maguire does a decent job, even if you occasionally still feel he is a strange choice for a superhero character. He was convincing, however, in depicting his ailing superpowers. And especially taking that into account, there seemed quite a few collision where I was actually surprised Parker survived them in his human form. Same can be said about Molina's character.In this movie, many people find out about Spider-Man's identity: the people in the train, Mary Jane, Harry and possibly also Aunt May. Rosemary Harris has some great scenes in this one. There is a fire scene that reminded me of the trap from the first movie, but this time it is real and a child was actually in danger. Would have been too repetitive if this had been staged again. There are also a couple funny moments in this movie. One would be "I'm back! I'm back! My back. My back." Apart from that, Jonah Jameson is the only character really intended exclusively for comedic reasons and J.K. Simmons made a job so great that the character was not included in the new Spider-Man films (starring Garfield), maybe because he did not reprise his character. And they also got him to do the voice work for the new Spider-Man animated series. On a side-note J.K. Simmons is an Academy Award winner since last night. The movie has two interesting versions of the Spider-Man theme song, one sung by an Asian woman in the middle of the movie and the other coming from Michael Bubl during the credits.The last scene with James Franco (and Willem Dafoe) would also have worked as an intro to the third (and final) Spider-Man movie. This second movie is certainly worth a watch, especially if you enjoyed the first. Recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spider-Man 2 is a rare sequel that is much better than the original movie. Plot In A Paragraph: After two years of fighting crime as Spider-Man, Peter Parker's life has begun to fall apart. The girl he loves is dating someone else, his grades are slipping, he cannot keep his jobs, as he is always late due to some crisis always coming up. He reaches his breaking point and gives up life as Spiderman. But at the same time after an accident scientist Dr. Otto Octavius is transformed into super villain Doctor Octopus, having four long tentacles as extra hands. Tobey Maguire is much better this time around in the lead role as Peter Parker. Raimi also gave the sequel a very memorable villain in Doctor Octopus, as played by Alfred Molina, who was terrific as Doctor Octopus. Spider-Man 2 gives Otto a tragic backstory and you did actually feel some pity for him. Director Sam Raimi gives us a good story too, with Harry Osborne (again brilliantly played by James Franco) hunting Spiderman down, for what he believes is the murder of his Dad as a subplot.The screenwriters of Spiderman 2 must have studied "Superman II", because its story is very similar to The Man Of Steels sequel in many ways. Both films re-cap the first film through their opening credit sequences. In this film, Peter Parker chooses to give up his double life as a superhero in order to have a relationship with his one true love, Mary Jane. In "Superman II", Clark Kent gives up his double life, and his abilities, so that he may be with Lois Lane. In both movies, the hero is urged not to give up his powers by a relative, and both regain their powers when it's needed. In this film, a train-full of people stand up to Doc Ock, and he easily dismissed them. In "Superman II", a street-full of people stand up to General Zod believing he has killed Superman, but he simply blows them away. And finally in both movies the love of the heroes life finds out his secret identity.But copying a movie considered by many to be one of the greatest Superhero sequels ever made, is no bad thing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tobey Maguire returns in the dual role of awkward adolescent Peter Parker and web-slinging vigilante superhero Spider-Man. He urges to tell the truth about his identity to his beloved Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) and thus build a solid relationship with her, but he knows that this would result in putting MJ in harms way, so he remains silent."Spider-Man 2" is not an action spectacle, certainly not as hair-raising or as fast-paced as the original. Rather director Sam Raimi's attempt to fashion the human characteristics and foibles of Peter Parker. Very wise move. There are many welcome scenes where Peter merely talks to his aunt (who has some idea of why people need heroes), Mary Jane, Dr. Octavius, Harry and so on. There are some witty exchanges between Parker and his landlord who insists that Pete pay his overdue rent. But something is missing, perhaps some aura or level of surprise. The movie starts in fits and spurts, like a broken engine. There is a blandness in the direction when Raimi aims for those endless close-ups of Maguire's cherubic, sincere face. The movie feels inert at times, hardly as invigorating in the dialogue scenes as in the high-powered action scenes.</fullReview>

Give credit Raimi for giving plenty of screen time to the love story between Peter Parker (tobey Maquire) and Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst), something other directors would ignore in an action film. I think it actually helps the film.I didn't much care for the villain in the film.

		<shortDescription>Far superior to the first film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spiderman 2 is by far a much better film than the first. The storyline is better, and some other important characters, besides the three main characters, are given some of the spotlight this time around. I liked it a lot.This time around Spiderman (Tobey Maguire)has to fight with Doctor Octopus and face up to some of his own personal demons while battling the man with six arms. Is he up to it? Well if you haven't seen it yet (if that's even possible) I'm not about to tell you. Let just say that the villain Doc Ock (played beautifully by Alfred Molina) is much better than the Green Goblin from the first film.We also have the usual supporting characters with Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst), Aunt May (Rosemary Harris), Harry Osbourne (James Franco), and of course good old J. Jonah Jameson (J.K. Simmons). All of which are great for this movie. Both Aunt May and Jameson are given more to work with in the second film, and they do perfectly. They are one of the reasons why part 2 is the better film. Of course the special effects are an improvement over the first one as well, and Dunst, Maguire, and Franco are just as good as they were last time. And lets not forget the story, a big improvement.Spiderman 2 is one of those few times where the sequel is better than the original. It is in fact in my top five list of comic book adaptations, just behind the first Superman way back in 1978. I know some people wouldn't agree with this, but than everybody has their own favorite. I'm cool with that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A far more satisfying outing for our favourite web-head</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having just recently written a review for the original Spider-Man, I decided to continue the trend with Part 2. Something I'm all too eager to do, since in my opinion, Spider-Man 2 is considerably superior, and offers up a much more multi-layered adventure.Picking up two years where the original left off (and for any newcomers, there's a nicely animated prologue through the opening credits), Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is between jobs as a pizza delivery boy, photographer for the Daily Bugle, continuing his studies at university, and living up to his responsibilities as Spider-Man.That's a lot of things for one man to do. And not surprisingly, it's getting him down. Peter's web-slinging is constantly getting in the way, causing him to lose his job as a pizza boy, his grades are starting to suffer, and putting a strain on his friendships with Mary-Jane (Kirsten Dunst) and Harry Osborn (James Franco).MJ is sick of Peter standing her up all the time, and has gotten engaged to astronaut John Jameson, son of (gasp!), J.Jonah Jameson! As for Harry, he is still bitter over his father's death at the hands of Spider-Man, and since Peter takes so many pictures, Harry assumes he's covering for him. And then there's Aunt May (Rosemary Harris). The bank is threatening to foreclose on her house. And if all that weren't enough, Peter's powers are suddenly fading in and out for some (wisely never explained) reason.All this has plunged our hero into the teen equivalent of a mid-life crisis. Peter is left with one inescapable conclusion. It's time to give up Spider-Man. Bad timing! Dr Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina), a respected scientist, is working on an experiment with creating a ball of self-sustaining energy combined with nuclear fusion. To stabilise the experiment, he uses mechanical limbs. But the experiment proves unworkable, causing the lab to explode, and fusing the limbs to Octavius's body. Thus Dr Octopus is born!The metal limbs seem to have taken on a life of their own, and have made Dr Octopus (or Doc Ock as he's affectionately known) mentally unstable. Refusing to give up on his experiments, he turns to a life of crime, rebuilding his lab, and won't allow anyone to stand in his way. Making a deal with Harry, Doc Ock will deliver him Spider-Man in exchange for what he needs to try again. Even if it means kidnapping Mary-Jane.Phew! That was quite a bit of plot developments to write about. But I feel it was necessary, because it proves how much is going on in this film compared to the last one. Sam Raimi has polished his act, and crafted a superhero film that is much more accomplished. The characters are fleshed out more, Raimi has broadened his horizons, shaken out the flaws the original had, and Spider-Man 2 is all the better for it.Raimi's direction is damn near flawless this time round. Where the first one wandered about a bit aimlessly from time to time, here everything comes together in a most satisfying way. Tobey Maguire again is spot-on as Peter Parker, especially since he gets more exposure than Spider-Man. And he also seems more confident in the suit too, bringing an electrically charged fierce determination that lights up the screen.Kirsten Dunst is much improved too. She had a tendency to be an annoying screamer last time. She still does occasionally, but not as much, and brings a more feisty side to MJ that makes her an appealing love interest.Alfred Molina is wonderful as Doc Ock. He turns the character into a tragic figure. A man who had a great job, a beautiful wife, and then lost it all through science gone bad. Sort of similar to Peyton Westlake in Raimi's Darkman. Doc Ock is very intimidating with his metal limbs, stomping the ground announcing his presence (Jurassic Park?). He looks very impressive, and makes more of an impression then Willem Dafoe's Green Goblin.James Franco is also much improved from last time. He was the most annoying character in Part 1 because of his insipid sulkiness. Here he channels it into his passion for eliminating Spider-Man. The two best scenes for him are when he unmasks Spider-Man. A rare case where the trailers don't lie. And the very creepy scene where Norman Osborn's ghost (or possibly Harry's growing instability) appears to Harry and shows him his destiny.Fortunately, Aunt May isn't shortchanged. She does wonders with the scenes she's given. The moment where Peter confesses his part in Uncle Ben's death is marvellous. The look on Rosemary Harris's face is unforgettable. A sign that the relationship between her and Peter may never be the same again.And J.K. Simmons is given more to do as J. Jonah Jameson. Again chewing on the scenery. Stealing every scene he's in. Last time he just disappeared from the film. Here he's in it right up until the end. And I'm certainly not complaining.The action scenes are far more ambitious too like the storyline. The two most memorable ones are Spider-Man trying to stop a runaway train, and the final battle with Doc Ock. The train scene is pulse-pounding entertainment, and you feel just as tense as Spidey does. And Doc Ock finally regaining control is gratifying, and even makes him seem heroic in his last moments.All the plot threads are neatly woven, and lead up to the wonderful climax. MJ discovers the truth. Where will this lead? We'll have to wait. But hints are dropped at this stage at the possible directions. I can hardly wait for Part 3.Spider-Man 2 is a triumph on all levels. All the main characters get an effective payoff, and even Willem Dafoe and Cliff Robertson make cameos. Sam Raimi has crafted a far superior film, and makes the wait unbearable for the next exciting instalment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spiderman 2/2004/****Main Stars: Tobey Maguire Kirsten Dunst Alfred MolinaThis film was the other perfect film of the summer! The reason why I say this is because the acting was perfect for this story and the special effects were great! I like the way Spiderman (Tobey Maguire) swung from the buildings and how Spiderman climbed the walls. I also liked how Dr. Octopus (Alfred Molina) climbed the walls with his robot arms. The special effects for his arms were the best! But his arms were also real in some scenes accept for the wall climbing. The music by Danny Elfman carried the movie along very well. The main reason for this movie was to catch Dr. Octopus. Dr. Octopus's robot arms were the reason why he turned bad because they told him to do the same experiment as in the beginning of the movie. His experiment was to get the power of the sun. Anyway, Spiderman has to catch Doctor Octopus before he destroys all of New York City! But while trying to hunt down Octopus, Spiderman also has a girlfriend (Kirsten Dunst). So, while trying to catch Octopus, he has a girlfriend he has to worry about, too! Basically, he has two sides of him (as you know from the first), a normal side and a heroic side. NOTE: I do have this movie and I count on you to get it. Movie directed by Sam Raimi.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At first I didn't used to be a spidey fan. I would watch the animated TV series and not really understand it. I watched the first movie and didn't really like it but this movie got the job done for me. After a couple months of wait I finally got to rent this on DVD as I missed it theatres. Spiderman is a character that was hard for me to understand it it took a little looking into for me to get on the wagon. This was a really good movie. I liked this movie because we get a DECENT villain in this one. Doctor Octopus is a great villain with a touch of genius. Tobey M. does a nice job of playing spidey in this film as I think he got the role down better. I also like how this movie brilliantly ties into the first one with the Green Goblin storyline. Kirsten Dunst plays Mary Jane once again. I felt MJ was toned down a bit and I felt she wasn't quite involved like the first one. I guess that was the film's direction. The action sequences between Doc Oc and Spiderman are first class here and the CGI is done at a reasonable level. The storyline was gripping as I think the plot was just too good to hate. I liked the fact that Peter Parker proves he can be a hero without his spidey powers and the scene where he proves it is a really well made scene (my favorite scene in the movie). Loose ends are met here from the first one and the end leaves room for S3. I'm glad they got this movie just right and I'm glad I watched this movie. This is the movie that got me hooked on Spider-man so S2 gets a thumbs up from me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of a few really good comic book movies!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We have come to an age in movies where there are a lot of heroes with superpowers . Strength beyond human, speed beyond belief, intelligence beyond the smartest that's just a few powers that can be seen in todays superhero movies.When it comes to movies where heroes doesn't have superpowers, we can see people like James Bond. There is nothing really wrong with good old James Bond, but the movies monotone, and sometimes predictable and boring. We have a guy who is intelligent and good-looking as well as being strong. But only in the human-fashion. It might be a little more realistic, but it can be boring.Man has always been dreaming of being more than human. We dream of flying, of being able to breath under water going to outer space without a suit or being able to beat the crap out of whole army's. Sad to say, that isn't really realistic. But we can always dream. And we can always thank the comic-, film-, and literature industry for helping us reading and watching stories about, sometimes, ordinary people becoming strong and loved. In this case, about Spider-man! when I was a kid I didn't know much about Marvel Comics. Accept for three special characters: The incredible Hulk, Nightcrawler (The X-men, but Nightcrawler was my favorite so I only remember him in my childhood) and of course Spider-man.The only thing I remember about spider-man, in my childhood, was the character and the great change of Peter Parker. He was an ordinary kid, bullied, he had glasses and wasn't popular. One day he go bitten by a spider and transformed shortly to the loved Spider-man. The thing I liked mostly about him was the fact that I wanted to be him. A little nerd, transformed to a super-hero with strength beyond imagination. I was bullied as a child and I always wanted to be stronger than the guys who bullied me. But thanks to my love of escapism, I could travel to Marvel universe and become Spider-man. The once a push-over becoming a strong hero.The first film was very good, it gave you many things: action, humor, romance and psychological traumas. Peter Parker became Spider-man and had to struggle with having go to school, have a part-time job, help taking care of his aunt, and saving the day for the people of New York. I can relate to that because I have to balance my job, my friends, my work in a political group, and my hobby which is movies and music.The second movie came as a chock! It is rare that a sequel is really good, especially in a comic book-movie genre. Spider-man 2 gave me many things that the first one did; action, humor, romance and the great choice; be a hero or not be a hero. Spider-man 2 i a great movie that gives you all that an much more.There a few really good comic book movies. There are some good, many bad but very few really good ones. Spider-man, X-men, X-men 2, V for vendetta are some of the few really good ones. And now adding to the list is Spider-man 2. Even people who hasn't read Spider-man comics will love the movies. And that is a good thing!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a movie that was great to watch. I am a big Spider-man fan so when I heard that Doc. Ock was to be the villain I was disappointed but only because I really wanted to see Venom. But after that I realised that Doc. Ock on screen should be brilliant. And I think I was right. Alfred Molina was stealing the show during the movie. I had heard reviews and read what the critics had said and so many said that Molina stole the show. I thought "Someone stealing the show in a spider-man film who isn't actually Spider-Man. Couldn't be, but it is. I was a little let down by the ending but a great watch totally worth seeing. Some parts drifted from the comics but if it didn't why watch the film. 9/10 (needed some Venom or Carnage)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow! What a really excellent, nail-biting, edge-of-your-seat action-packed first sequel! That is the main thing that I can say about SPIDER-MAN 2. Anytime Spider-Man/Peter (Tobey Maguire) was being yelled, I felt sorry for him. I could particularly relate to how he was feeling at the very beginning of the movie. You'll have to see the movie to know why. When he and Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) kissed, I got all warm and tingly inside. Doc Ock (Alfred Molina) really made me jump when he appeared from out of the blue. Now, in conclusion, I recommend this excellent, nail-biting, edge-of-your-seat action-packed first sequel that you'll want to see over and over again to all Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst fans who haven't seen it. When you see this movie, hold on tight and prepare to be taken on a fast and wild ride. I guarantee you you'll be taken on a fast and wild ride.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's been almost two years since Peter Parker (Tobey McGuire) became Spiderman and he can't seem to to hold a job, his college grades are falling, and his even him tenacious friendship with Mary Jane is eroding. What's a costumed web-slinging wall crawler to do? Why, through in the proverbial towel, of course. Peter gets fed up at the constant hassles of him life and decides Spiderman no more. But when Dr. Otto Octavius suffers a freak accident that fuses the mechanical tentacles that he invented to his body and destroyed the inhabiter chip that kept him as the one in charge, changing him into a super-villain whom the Daily Bugle deems Doctor Otopus, the only one that can stop his rampage is Spiderman, but does Parker have the hero spirit still in him? This film had me feeling divisive. On one hand, Alfred Molina's performance as Dr. Octavious and later Doc Ock is phenomenal, and I have very happy that the campy tendencies of Willem Dafoe as Green Goblin in the first one were nowhere to be found in Molina's portrayal, the action was suitably thrilling (maybe more so than the first), and Bruce Campbell's role of 'snooty usher' warmed the cockles of my heart. On the other hand, Kirsten Dunst STILL doesn't jibe for me as Mary Jane Watson, even less so in this sequel as she looks sickly hideous, AND annoying. And more people saw Spiderman unmasked than was really feasibly acceptable. But all in all, I did enjoy this film way more than I have gripes about it and I think it was infinitely better than the huge let-down of X-men 2.My Grade: B+2-Disc Collecter's Edition DVD Extras: Disc 1) Commentary by director Sam Raimi, producer Avi Arad, co-producer Grant Curtis and star Tobey Maguire; Second Commentary by Special FX supervisor John Dykstra and his effects team; subtitle trivia track; 4 web episodes; "Ordinary" music video by Train; Blooper reel; Theatrical trailer; Trailers for "Hitch", "Spider-man", "Christmas with the Cranks", "Spanglish", "Seinfeld on DVD", "the Forgotten", "White Chicks", and "Hellboy" Disc 2) 12-part "Making the Amazing" documentary; 3 featurettes (Hero in Crisis,Eight Arms to Hold You, and The Women of Spider-Man); multi-angle 'Pier Sequence' deconstruction; artwork gallery; "Spider-Man 2" video game preview3 Easter Eggs: Disc 1) In the Commentaries menu, there's a hidden spider icon, find it for an introduction by Sam Raimi made for a preview audience in Japan Disc 2) go to the Making the Amazing menu and highlight one of Doc Ock's tentacles for a special guest wearing Doc Ock's suit; Go to the Gallery menu and highlight the invisible Spidey Sences over Spidey's head for Doc Ock singing 'If I were a Rich Man" from "Fiddler on the Roof"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like all good sequels, Spider-man 2 builds on and emphasises the features of the first. Unfortunately these features are inane predictability, a ludicrous plot and constant clichs. It is beyond me quite why so many people seems to think this rubbish has any worth.It was rare that a scene started without it being totally obvious exactly what was going to happen. The sub-plot with MJ being the worst of this. As soon as she says 'don't let me down', it was blindingly obvious that he wasn't going to make the play. Just as blindingly obvious it was that she wouldn't go through with the wedding, because in true mundane Hollywood pap 'love always wins through'. Give me a break...As to Doc Ock? Did anyone not know that he was going to suddenly find his humanity in the 'finale' and sacrifice himself. So unoriginal.And Parker's 'dark' side, where he leaves someone to be beaten up. Well, they should leave that to Batman and stick with nice happy kiddie gloss in future. It was half-hearted and totally unconvincing.And finally, the 'comedy' moments were strained and weak. I saw nothing in this film of any worth at all. Everything it did has been done much much better elsewhere.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very much alike the previous one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>** Be warned, here be webs of spoilers **Recap: Peter Parker (Maguire) is struggling to keep his life together. His responsibilities as Spider Man are taking a heavy toll on his life. He's unable to keep a much needed job as a pizza delivery guy, he's far behind in his studies and his relationship with Mary Jane Watson (Dunst) is deteriorating. He is unable to pay his rent and has difficulties with being in time. At the same time a fusion project goes awry, leaving the leading scientist Dr Octavius (Molina) a mix between a human and four mechanic limbs. The result, soon named Dr Octopus wreaks havoc in the city to be able to repeat and complete his dangerous experiment. Soon he and Spiderman become enemies. And Harry Osborn (Franco) is still out to avenge his father and kill Spiderman. All this pressure and strain tears inside Peter and gradually he loses his super-abilities. Finally he quits being Spiderman, trying to lead an ordinary life and trough that win Mary Jane's affection. But can he really leave the streets to thugs and thieves? And what if his friends and relatives are threatened?Comments: Much money was spent on the digital effects, and that shows. They are beautiful and very striking. Other than that I wasn't impressed by much. Dunst and Molina was best in their roles otherwise it seemed to me just to be more of the same as the last movie. As Parker lost his abilities and had to rediscover them, it felt just the same as in the first movie where he had to discover them. His internal struggles with the relationship to MJ and to the city in general are just a continuation from the last one, and for a big part of this movie, no development. And then Mary Jane was abducted and needed rescuing, again, but not before he had to save some innocent bystanders in some sort of public transportation. Seem familiar? And then there are numerous visual references (read: repeat of scenes) to the first movie. So on numerous occasions I felt like I just watched the first movie all over again, with just another villain. In a sequel, you do have the advantage of not having to introduce the main characters (especially if you have a complete recap in the intro). This advantage was not used at all as the plot turned out to be. In one way Parker and Spiderman was re-introduced. And that is a little boring actually. However, as the previous movie was good, this means that this movie was also somewhat entertaining, but still a small disappointment. I expected much better.6/10</fullReview>

Shrek 2, Bourne Supremacy, Napoleon Dynamite, Harold and Kumar, Dodgeball, and Anchorman were all far better. Spiderman 2 was a drama, which might have worked except that the leads, Tobey Mguire and Kirsten Dunst completely mailed in their performances. Mguire seriously looked high the entire time (I would know). The two best actors were Franco and Molina, and their roles were minimalized by the fact that this was not an action movie. The special effects were excellent, but again they were rarely used because of the lack of fight scenes.3 stars out of ten, and those were only for Franco and Molina.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>suffers only from being a sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The opening credits of Spider-Man 2 show comic-strip like scenes from the story, leading us gradually into the idea that this movie is a comic strip brought to life. This small device helps set the stage and the viewer can easily bypass any questions of ?how real' the subsequent action appears ? it has only to live up to the comic strip rather than live up to ?reality'. To the makers' credit, the special effects however are incredibly life-like ? we can concentrate on the story and action without being distracted by them. As an extension of the comic strip, Spider-Man 2 works extremely well. What is the appeal and purpose (if any) of comic strips? Surely it is to define, without the restraints of the real world, the action hero ? the person whose moral standards and efforts to do good, to resist evil, to respect the individual and uphold justice inspire us to similar qualities within ourselves (a function of all heroes and super-heroes ? real or imaginary, religious and non-religious). Spider-Man 2's self-examination of the role of the hero, his internal dialogue shared with the audience, make this function more apparent than it is in many similar movies: the character becomes conscious of his purpose and, by articulating it, provides a comment on his own character that draws our attention to his symbolic function rather than simply engaging us by example. For entertainment value Spider-Man 2 also outstrips its predecessor, and the love story between Peter Parker / Spider-Man and Mary Jane has a classic quality to it. This is also one of the movie's greatest weaknesses perhaps ? the female figure, as in many hero stories, is subjugated to one of a weak woman rescued by the male (in this case it is also the male's adventures that bring her into danger). We have yet to see fairy tales, religious mythologies, or comic strips where the heroine asserts her identity and capabilities on an equal footing with the hero (and without becoming masculinised). But Spider-Man 2 is a triumph of adaptation ? a new generation of comic book writers is perhaps needed before the power of feminine principles is glorified alongside the masculine.</fullReview>

We really did all get the 'seen it all before' feeling while watching this. The initial Spiderman movie had the benefit of surprise - we didn't know exactly where the story would be taking us, how it would be told or how the leads would interpret their parts. We know all that now so a sequel has to offer so much more - or approach a tale from a different and fresh angle. This sequel unfortunately does neither - but instead relies on the power of CGI and fast action sequences to overwhelm.An enjoyable enough way to spend two hours but we already knew all the answers to the rather simplistic plot and nothing unexpected came along to surprise or delight us.</fullReview>

Jonah Jameson (the always reliable Simmons also reprising his role) and out for blood-thirsty revenge with Spidey in his sights. The visual effects are absolutely incredible and the action sequences are amped up soaring to new f/x heights with some wonderful fight sequences between the two rivals high over the sparkling city of New York (best bits: bank sequence and subway brawl) but the film really owes its great debts to a truly surprising amount of emotion wrung from its conflicted hero and humanizes its villain largely thanks to its smart screenplay by Alvin Sargent and storyline by Alfred Gough, Miles Millar and Michael Chabon. A crowd-pleaser and a new leap for big-screen comic book adaptations that nimbly leaps over its predecessors in its fun and ? shocker ? deep themes that resonate for anyone whoever felt like the underdog. One of the year's very best films.</fullReview>

It is goofy, but remember that it's a COMICBOOK movie, so it can pass. It's an entertaining flick from beginning to end and has a lot of heart. I much prefer the extended cut(Spider-Man 2.1) since it extends the already brilliant action scenes and gives some more moments to the supporting characters. It may be over ten-years-old, but it's still the best Spider-Man movie. It's probably in my Top 10 All Time Favorite Films, it just leaves you with such a satisfying feel at the end, which kind of makes Spider-Man 3 all the more disappointing?</fullReview>

The effects are a FAR improvement from the first film. It still looks pretty good honestly, has aged very well. The cinematography is decent, and the action, most of the time, is very satisfying and well done. And the vibe, while I don't personally care for the cheesiness of it, is nailed well. I don't like it, but Raimi did what he wanted. And while I don't like how he's written at all, Alfred Molina is the best actor in the entire trilogy. He just needed a better script.Now lets go for what I dislike. Main issue: Tobey Mcguire. I can't stand him. There are very few movies I watch where he doesn't instantly incite a fury of anger inside me due to his complete lack of emotion or semblance of acting ability. He's an actor with no charisma, playing a character that is known for having charisma. Yes, Peter Parker is a nerd, he's awkward, but he's not a moron who whispers all his lines, underacts, and has the single worst crying face of any actor in Hollywood. I CANNOT buy him as any incarnation of Spiderman. I have read the comics and watched the cartoon. Every incarnation of spider man has been better, and when your main hero is being poorly played, thats a huge problem for a comic book film to have. And don't give me the excuse that he's doing it all on purpose, not acting on purpose is still not acting, it feels annoying. I want Spiderman to be like Spiderman, courageous, intelligent, quick-witted, and likable. (And yes nerdy.) Mcguire is none of these things. You can't even say he's smart or nerdy because of Raimi's 'Tell don't show' style of filmmaking. We never see him APPLY his brain, and i never buy its him inside the suit.Other main issue: Kirsten Dunst. I thought it was impossible to underact Tobey, but somehow, Ms. Dunst did it. She actually reads her lines like she doesn't want to be there. Not to mention as far as writing and character goes, she is, by far, the WORST superhero love interest ever. She never helps, she is never independent, she is never caring, she always plays Peter at an angle, she gets kidnapped more than Princess Peach. She is legitimately the OG Bella Swan, but in the end of the awful Twilight movies, she was a vampire and did some cool stuff, Dunst gets kidnapped, screams, and continuously puts Peter in-between a rock and a hard place. He has no reason to like her. Their chemistry is non-existent. It is honestly painful to watch them together. Its painful to watch her at all.Alfred Molina is a fantastic actor in a bad role. Doc Oc sounds ambitious, starts off pretty well in fact. however his motivations and moral fluctuations make him illogical. If you introduce a smart character, keep him smart. By the time he becomes a villain, he makes so many logical errors it makes him seem like a different person. He looks for Peter Parker and needs to talk to him, so what does he do? Throw a damn car at him! Why? Why are you attempting to kill the person you want to find?? I'm not nitpicking, I have so many genuine questions about choices these idiotic characters constantly make! Why does Octavius steal money to buy the parts he needs... rather than just STEALING WHAT HE NEEDS? Why does he have a sudden hatred for spider man? He knows he's doing something wrong, which is supposed to make him sympathetic, yet he acts like a tool and somehow feels justified in trying to kill Peter? He has no character arc! The plot just says 'Uhhhh, the arms make him crazy, so he's crazy, but you still like him because he constantly monologues about how he's trying to fulfill his dream!' NO! Not to mention, why in the blue hell did he design the arms with artificial intelligence if he was only going to use them to move things? That doesn't make any sense! Why? Its a genuine question! every time I have a legit question about a character decision the reasoning is 'The script told them to, so they did'And the whole 'losing powers' thing. Why? I'm supposed to suspend my disbelief, its a comic book movie, but why are stupid things constantly happening? Just because you establish a universe where strange things happen doesn't excuse idiotic writing. Why does peter suddenly lose his powers? He's jealous and loves MJ, yeah whatever. She gives him no reason to, but whatever. So, his powers go away when he's sad? The whole second act is a drag because it focuses on this plot point that feels like it comes out of NOWHERE. Not a SINGLE character in this entire franchise has a consistent motivation or tries to logically solve their problems. TL;DR My point is this. Sam Raimi can direct. He cannot write. This movie, I feel, is grossly overrated. Why? It has obvious issues that are ignored by both Raimi, and the fan base of these films. They act like everything is intentional and if you criticize it that 'You just don't get it' or 'You clearly have bad taste'. No. My bias towards movies is that I think about them, and the second you start thinking about this movie, for me, it made it unwatchable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superman 2 rehash</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must be one of a very few detractors on this. Apparently a lot of people bought into this dreck, but not me. First of all, it's Superman 2 all over again. Give up his powers for a girl ? Been done. Dropping the girl from the top of a building...hmmm, now where have I seen that..oh yeah, Superman 1. The action sequences are really great but everything in between is just so bad. Raimi indulges himself way too much, the completely out of context and totally unnecessary Singin in the Rain sequence comes to mind. I can't believe George Lucas gets a bad rap for stitled dialogue and stuff like this gets a free pass.I also didn't think the Spiderman CGI looked very good. For starters, let's just throw out all the laws of physics. Secondly the lighting is terrible noticeable and detracted from any notion of realism. The movie does have some things going for it. Alfred Molina was cast well as the villain; the soundtrack was great and the fight scenes were really well done.</fullReview>

I tried to enjoy it i really did but the special effects were horrible; the storyline sucked and as a whole...just don't go there. The train scene was really bad and when a few people (on the train) saw him their like oh my god he's just a kid...who else would he be a 50 year old batman wannabe!? Oh yeah i hated the ending...the return of green goblin seriously get over it he's dead already; as other members have said get some originality... Some interviews said the best lines were, "I'm spider-man no more", that scene was BAD. and in the end you don't find out what happens to the house.

		<shortDescription>Untie the Web, Spidey!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Only a thin crust of pop culture relevance stands between this bloated summer bland fest and ignominious delivery to cinematic history's dustbin. Certainly, those keen on remaining abreast of major releases and developments may find collective value in going to catch a Spidey 2 showing, yet for others of a less dedicated disposition there's basically no reason to even bother. The trilogy's second installment suffers from an unhealthy infusion of obviously fake CGI standing in for most action scenes and other com-motive elements, resulting in a cheap, plastic look many of us find rather offensive. Too much cheesy kitch also found its way onto the script, displacing the previous Spiderman flick's excellent conversion of the timeless comic itself. Film goers likely recall Raimi's first SM movie, which did a superb job of bringing to mass audiences a long-neglected phenomenon, by way of demonstrating Peter Parker's gradual transition from geek-anonymous to geek-superhero. Sadly, the newest effort doesn't have its predecessor's energy and stimulus, instead falling back on predictable situations, tiresome gags and low-rent computer gimmicry galore. Those unfortunate enough to have seen last year's The Hulk will know what went so humongous wrong with Spiderman 2 the second they lay eyes on it. Based on Stan Lee's milestone characters, Raimi's current project shows Parker (Tobey Maguire) struggling to balance his two lives. While fighting evil on behalf on the meek comes with much pride and satisfaction, it also translates into losing the love of your life (Kirsten Dunst) to dashing astronaut John Jameson (J. Jonah Jameson's son, played by Daniel Gillies), miserable college performance and getting fired from a pizza delivery gig. Add to all this Aunt May's impending eviction and guilt lingering from past traumas, and one can see why the old webmaster might be fed up and clamoring for the normal life. So off he goes, dumping the costume and slowly relinquishing his various super powers, until demented scientist Dr. Octavius (Alfred Molina) comes along to wreak havoc all over the city, en route of course threatening to take out Parker's loved ones in a few well-placed fell swoops. The be tentacled Dr. Octopus uses advanced technology to operate four mechanical arms, which may be a tad spooky, but doesn't explain how he suddenly becomes impervious to pretty much everything except arachnid trickery. Ours is not to question etc. etc. Additionally, Molina and his portrayal of Octavius/Octopus carry no discernible potency, resulting in a half-hearted entry apt to leave no impression even on the easily impressed. Naturally, virtue prevails over foul madness and Spiderman comes on top once again, alas the torment takes more than two hours, making you wish Parker just gave up and became a Verizon call center employee or something. Save for charismatic James Franco as Parker's best friend/arch-nemesis Harry Osborn, hardly any genuine talent lends itself to good use throughout the film. And yes, we all miss Willem Dafoe very much, thank you. At least Raimi and Co. saw fit to squeeze him into a brief cameo at the very end, foreshadowing things to come. Will we wait gingerly till the next one arrives in 2007? How'd you like to buy a bridge? Persuant to so many of its high profile, hype-hungry peers, SM2 also fails to live up to expectations. Forget about being wowed. For that you'll have to be a movie virgin practically, or ten years old at most. Instead of pinning folks to their proverbial seats, Spiderman 2 pulls off the inevitable curse of the tank by casting a pall of malcontented boredom over those gullible enough to have shelled however much tickets go for these days. Seriously, when an all-star summer caper has you sitting there like a dummy, going "yeah, yeah" and anticipating every single scene, something has gone terribly awry beyond all reproach. Adding insult to injury, the producers, in their infinite wisdom, apparently decided to pay homage to NYC's multifaceted personality by putting immigrants in every major part of the story. This could have been viewed as proactive and beneficial, however, like the film as a whole, actually culminates in a badly-constructed farce, starring caricatures and stereotypes. To wit, Parker has a cynically greedy Russian landlord, and a bossily insensitive Muslim supervisor. He also saves the child of two Asians who (naturally) don't speak English, and listens to another Asian destroy the song from the original animated show like there's no tomorrow. Next time, for social courage and action, see Casting Someone "Ethnic" in a Leading, Non-Generic Role. This kind of mistake typifies Spiderman 2's ilk quite nicely, we're afraid. Their hearts are in the right place. Everything else kinda got lost along the high-budget way.Rating: * *</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well-done but clichd and uninteresting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is Spiderman...but it's affecting his personal life. Peter can't hold down a job because he's always out helping people AND he's failing his classes at school AND he can't pay his rent AND he's losing his powers AND his Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) is going to loose her house AND his friend Harry Osborn (James Franco is becoming an alcoholic AND he loves Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) but can't let her know cause it would put her in danger etc etc. Then Doctor Octopus (Alfred Molina) shows up with deadly mechanical arms that do his bidding. I realize that the movie has to show the hero overcoming adversity but this just pours on the misery to a ridiculous degree. I started getting the uncomfortable feeling that the screenwriters of this enjoyed making the character suffer. To make matters worse Maguire can't act. He's stone-faced throughout the entire picture so, instead of feeling sorry for him, you don't feel anything. Add to that is the comic book dialogue and plotting which just dumbs down the entire movie. Yes, I'm well aware that this IS based on a comic book but what works as a comic does not translate to movies as well. Also J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson is not funny or cute--just annoying.So why am I giving this five stars? To be honest I was never bored. Annoyed yes but not bored. Franco, Dunst, Molina and Harris all give good performances (despite the material). The special effects are superb and the fight between Doc Ock and Spider Man on top of a train is exciting and fun. Without Maguire in the title role this might have been better--but I can never accept him as Peter Parker or Spider Man. A 5 at best.</fullReview>

I realize that the studios need to push Kirsten Dunst for the 15-22 year old audiences but this was dreadful! I can't believe that Sam Raimi attached his name to this crap.There were a few pluses: (Alfred Molina was solid as Otto Octavius, but nowhere in willem defoe's league... he would have been better served as an auxiliary villain than the sole one)...

This is along the movie is entertaining and not awfully stupid.Spiderman 2: This movie, unlike action movies I like, was boring and awfully stupid... And of course it was cheesy and FULL with the same American bad movie clichs. In fact, the only reason it is 2/10 and not less is because there are indeed some nice CGI effects.So yes, the arms of Dr.Octavious look nice, there were a few minutes of nice fighting... But really, hardly anything new compared to the first SpiderMan.I could go over the stupid, melodramatic, cheesy and illogical points of this movie, but it would take too long, that's why I'll just sum it up with these lines from the movie:Stupid_Woman_Reporter: "But Doctor (octavius), wouldn't the AI of these mechanical arms interfere with your judgment?" Doctor_Octavius: "Yes! That's exactly why I have this chip (*pointing on an exposed tiny lamp on his back*) as long as this chip functions the AI of the arms won't take over my brain!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, I just got a chance to watch Spider-Man 2 again. I must say this is a bad movie. Period. Every time I get into and think "ahh, this isn't that bad" something stupid happens or there's some cheap crappy effect. Let's start at the beginning the whole pizza scene was absolutely horrible. I mean who cares. Spidey has these amazing powers and this is what he does with them? I know he wants to be a normal guy but this is just stupid. What else? Well, Otto introduction was horrible. Those stupid arms and the control mechanism in the back of his neck. Isn't it enough that through his actions his woman was killed and now he's obsessed with getting it right for her sake? Now everything he does is governed by these arms. Oh and then there's the Evil Dead like scene with the arms in the hospital. None of that is called for. Some of that stuff was pretty brutal. Not that I personally have a problem with violence but I wouldn't let my kid who'd want to see this movie see that. Save it for darker comic characters like The Punisher or Black Widow. And I absolutely hate the whole "I don't want to be Spiderman and now my powers go bye-bye." What a load of crap. And yes I know that idea was pulled from a comic but some of comics pro including Lee himself said maybe that wasn't the best idea. It's a bad idea simply because of the purpose of Spidey. "With great power comes great responsibility." Take one away and Spidey in pointless. That's one of the problems he faces in the comics he can never give up being Spidey because the powers are aways there. And the train scene was total crap. Let's take the word of a little kid that nobody's going to tell anyone of my identity. Meanwhile, you can picture someone running out the back of the train to break the news. But what's it matter, by the end of the movie half of New York know's who he is. Over all this movie isn't worth the time. It's a bad story and other than Ock and JJ there's nothing but bad acting to go with it.</fullReview>

The wonderful sequences of Spidey crawling and swinging about were the only things to perk up about. Even the elegant Rosemary Murphy managed to irritate. Cardboard cartoon characters? Well, of course. It's Spiderman! Don't let all of that talk about it being a relationship movie fool you. It does not work as either a cartoon adventure or a movie about people with real feelings. Somehow the relentless abuse heaped on poor Peter Parker, the ludicrous Molina villian, boring love story, and all that exact-same-level of extreme violence seemed better left to the comics where you can turn the pages at your own pace.</fullReview>

I don't think you are supposed to sympathies with the villain in these kind of movies, but Spiderman is simply too much of a loser to feel for. Consequently, I cannot believe the ratings for this movie. It's got little or no humour (kind of essential I'd think ), bad acting ( or is that on purpose? ) and a lousy script. Perhaps I'm missing the point and it's actually wickedly funny and has all the marks of a classic, but somehow I don't think so.I did enjoy Spiderman 1 for what it was worth: a straightforward action movie, but that's not enough to save this one.I have come to rely on the ratings from IMDb.com however, this surely must be one of the worst blockbusters ever.

This movie - and I'm not talking about all the errors that slipped in (which were a lot - and annoyed me throughout the whole movie) - isn't a spiderman movie at all... It has way too much romantic crap, this seems a Pearl Harbor/Titanic ripoff with all it's clich's that come with it for free. That's not what a real spiderman-fan wants to see, not that I am one, but I know some guys that were really really disappointed. OK that you have some romance I can understand - but this? It was way over the top. It's not even worked out very well - has plot-holes everywhere, and one blatant thingthat is so completely against the whole spiderman-story concept.That this movie ends up in the top 250 is unbelievable for me, what was so good about it? The acting? The plot/story? The CGI? The action-scenes? I've seen much better in a lot cheaper productions. Yes, the action scenes were nice from time to time - but it's a freakin' spiderman movie! What would you expect? People actually seem to believe that this money-making blockbuster is actually better than Rain Man (place 214 at the time in top250, while SP2 has place 212), I would rather place it in the regions of Godzilla.Guess that the big score is because of the romantic and "drama" parts in it.

Whatever hatred she harbored for him in the first movie is unleashed. She gets angry whenever he can't make it to a play. It's tiresome and very annoying.Harry. His character has also worsened in terms of... EVERYTHING. James Franco tries to be dramatic, but it only oozes over into the actual idiocy of the movie. The whole film, Harry walks around mindlessly blaming Spiderman (and Peter!) for his now-awful life. He doesn't have a place in the movie and his character brings down the energy.Otto Octavius. I hate his character. He initially seemed like a great guy, but was transformed by the movie's try-too-hardedness. You already know something is going to go wrong, but we are forced to watch it all. One scene I'd like to highlight in particular is the part when he is getting ready to get the tentacles removed. *NOT SUGGESTED FOR CHILDREN UNDER 9*. The doctors give a horrific portrayal of "surgeons". This scene was TERRIBLE. Whoever thought that filming this scene in B&amp;W was sadly mistaken.

		<shortDescription>Sam Raimis first misfire is a big one!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, i'm a huge fan of comic book heroes and spider man in particular, as well as the work of Sam Raimi.That said, I was utterly shocked at how terrible this boring, unoriginal, uninspired movie was. Raimi did a good (though admittedly not great) job with the first film, so how in the hell did he go so horribly wrong with this turgid piece of crap? First of all it is almost a carbon copy of the original, only with less action and a lot more tiresome because we've seen it all before. A mad scientist receives super powers while testing out one of his inventions. He kidnaps Mary Jane. Spiderman even rushes into another burning building to save a screaming child. Finally, in the climactic battle (which is about 2 minutes long), the villain expresses regret to spider man for his previous antisocial behavior. Only this time he's serious! I didn't expect this series to remain completely loyal to the comics, but Doc Ock turning good?! Raimi, are you even a spider man fan? I have absolutely no idea why the critics love this movie so much. For a group of people who seem to constantly bemoan Hollywoods penchant for repetition, they all jumped on the bandwagon for a movie that has literally NOTHING new to offer.I gave it an extra star (grudgingly) for it's excellent special effects. Aside from that, it has nothing to recommend about it. The story drags, Alfred Molina is completely wasted, and the action is sparse.Shape up, Raimi! Remember when you used to make fresh, enjoyable movies? Many more like Spiderman 2 and i will be tempted to forget.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I didn't see the first Spider-Man but I really enjoyed the second!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Possible spoilers...As I wrote in the title, I didn't watch the first Spider-Man when it was released in 2002. But a friend invited me to go and see "Spider-Man 2" at the movies and I honestly don't regret it at all. I was surprised to discover that Sam Raimi made this sequel (as well as the first Spider-Man movie). I found out later that he is a big fan of the comic strip; so he seemed to be cut out to shot the adventures of Peter Parker alias Spider-Man. It's better this way because this blockbuster has got plenty of qualities that worth the detour.The movie owes its success partly thanks to the nearly constant humor that are in the dialogs and also in the character acted by JK Simmons. For him, it is the opportunity to offer a delightful performance.Spider-Man 2 also enjoys quite stunning special effects which are never intrusive and used only when necessary, mainly in action or bravery sequences. But these sequences don't seem to be the most important ones in Raimi's eyes. We can't say that "Spider-Man 2" is a pure action movie from the beginning to the end. Indeed, the director rather put the accent on the psychology of his main character, Peter Parker. He doesn't introduce him as a perfect super hero but as a clumsy young man torn between his private life that he can't manage to assume and his doubts about being Spider-Man. In short, Raimi goes against the clichs generally attributed to super heroes and offers a more complex and ambiguous view of a super hero. He also had intuition by choosing Tobey Maguire for the first role because he's truly talented and perfect. Moreover, he's got a nice personality which makes him likable straightaway. There's also an excellent choice for Kirsten Dunst whose beauty and face light the film up.With "A simple plan" (1998), Sam Raimi had achieved a tour de force in the thriller. Here, in another extent, "Spider-Man 2" can be taken for a new success in Raimi's work and his efforts are widely rewarded because the movie is already a huge commercial success in France. Even, if you can find faults in the film (when Spider-Man flies in the air, the movie resembles pictures taken from a video game. The film also follows a classical outline typical from Hollywood scripts with a scientist acted by Alfred Molina who wants to use his power through his latest discovery to control New York. So, it seems that Spider-Man can be the only one to save the city. Then, the end of the movie which sees Maguire and Dunst united together lets suggest that Hollywood has been through that), you can only find pleasure in watching Raimi's film which should logically lean on to a third opus in the Spider-Man series. If it's the case, let's hope that Raimi will shot it and as far as I'm concerned, the success of "Spider-Man 2" made me want to watch the first movie. But at the moment, for once that a follow-up is really successful, let's take advantage of it!</fullReview>

Even better than "Hulk 4" and "Aquaman 8"!! The comics are so cool, but the movie really got me going! Let me know if I annoy you with the exclamation marks!!!! I'm writing from a lunatic asylum and they've under-drugged me a bit!!! I hope Tobey has a long-lasting marriage with his MGM sweetheart - the beautiful daughter of the honourable studio boss who released "Spiderman 2"!! I'm sure he really loves her!! As I love this film! I'd give it a 15 out of 10 but I can't count that high! I also love Van Damme action films and Whoppie Goldberg comedies!! I listen to Britney Spears! I love the cool classical movie score here!! It reminds me of The Beatles and of Schopenhauer's music!!!! I read the Philosophy Writings of one called Paris Hilton! She rocks! She's so cool!!! My favourite scene was when Tobey said something or other to that guy in the scene that came after the one I just mentioned!! I hope they make 20 more sequels!! I hope they release me soon so I can write "Tobey, I love youuu" on a banner 100 times and stick it in front of his villa! Tobey, you were so smart to make friends with Leo Di Crapio when you were both kids!! So smart to fall in love with a rich daughter!! Sam Raimi, please cast Drew Barrymore to play the evil Dr.Einstein in "Spiderman 14: More Dull CGI &amp; Crap Casting"!!! Does anyone know where Tobey lives??? I gotta know!! I LOOVEE THIS MOOOOVIEEEEE!!! Don't you??</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a terrible joke... But thank you for coming.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can honestly say that this was the WORST film I have seen this year. While I had some excitement for this film, due to the amazing sequel known as X2: X-Men United, what I actually witnessed was nothing more than an unlimited budget creating some of the least creative characters in film history. I had several friends tell me that this was one of the best "character study" films of the year. That this sequel was more than just good vs. evil, but also an inner dilemma between Parker's personal lives and that which he has been called to do. While this may have been the case, what actually translated onto the screen was a reassurance that Toby Maguire was miscast, Kirsten Dunst is loosing her sexual appeal (though Raimi felt enough self-guilt to place her in water to reveal her "bits and pieces" for the pre-teen in all of us), and that you can go too far with a villain creating a cartoon instead of a physically frightening creature.So, where do I begin? At first I had hope, here we find ourselves following Peter as he attempts to get to work after noticing that he was running late. He has just a few minutes to deliver some pizzas (oh, how the mighty do fall) or he will be fired from his job. He apparently really needs this job, so he resorts to transforming himself into his alter-ego personality Spider-man to help him get out of the tight situation. While we are stunned by this cheap display of his super powers, we assume that it will show that Spider-man is a crafty guy. Immediately, we are proved wrong as Peter Parker is fired and forced to go back to his run-down apartment that he cannot afford. Instead of showing us a hero for children to look up to, we have a guy that says to the youth of our nation, be late to work, don't pay rent, and everything will be just fine. This is not the character that I was hoping for. This only leads us deeper into the mind of Peter Parker as he struggles to maintain a very busy life. Also saying to our children that if you have too much to do, please just give up. When life throws you lemons, go ahead and cry like the babies that you are, or at least like Toby Mcguire has patented.Spider-man is not the hero for our youth. He is not the passionate crime-fighter that we have envisioned or at least that was drawn for me in the first film. Instead, Toby is given the possibility to "grow" his character and give him "5000 dimensions" that continually fail. He uses the technique of huge-teary eyes to portray the struggle that is happening inside of him. He never really feels strong. He never really makes a decision. He only does what the villain forces him to do. He continually remains indecisive and weak through all moments of this film. I lost respect of his heroine status. I instead saw him as this whiny kid that couldn't handle the pressures of the job that he was handed. He cries, and is wimpy instead of showing a true emotional struggle. This only proved to me that you couldn't take an independent actor, one that prides himself on the dramatic element, and give him a role in a huge-budget film. I once thought of this in the first film, but this sequel only proves my theory correct.This goes the same for Kirsten Dunst, who progressively became uglier throughout the film and whose bosoms fluctuated in size in nearly every shot. She was drenched yet again for the pre-teen audience and for those that like to use the stop-motion feature on their DVD player. She was useless, and perhaps should be replaced for the third installment to this series. Finally, there was the unsupportive villain that seemed less "evil" and more like a cartoon Elmer Fudd, constantly messing up and not really causing any chaos or destruction. He didn't frighten the people of Spider-man's city, so why should I be frightened of him? Molina was horribly cast as Doc Ock, only proving that a large man with tons of robotic work can be evil, or at least try to be evil.Finally, I would like to say that Raimi needs to go back to his roots. For me to ever be interested in one of his films again (especially after this sequel), I would need to see Raimi go back to his roots. He needs less money, better scripts, and an unknown cast that can prove themselves and try something new. All I could see in this film was the strong hold of Hollywood telling Raimi how he needs to create the film and what scenes would be needed to ensure tons of people going into the theater to give their money to these characters. It was sad, it was poor, and it was an inexcusable issue. Raimi is a "cult" film director that has eyes the size of Toby whenever money is thrown his way. This was a very poor film. It was exactly what Hollywood represents and the type of film that I despise. There was no substance, no structure, and nothing exciting about this sequel. It was, for lack of a better word, very poor. I am embarrassed to say that I have seen this film, and will deny it whenever anyone asks. This is my final word on this film. Good-bye!

		<fullReview>This movie is quite awful. The plot is simplistic, at best, and just a sorry excuse at worse. The love story is painfully corny, to a truly unimaginable degree. The movie is littered with inconsequential events and random bits of slapstick humor (i.e. Siperman randomly falls. hahahah... terrible) The plot does not even try to make any scientific sense, the villain has no real reason for being and Spider Man is a terribly fake character. The directing is I think the reason behind it all since the actors are otherwise decent, but have been warped into mediocrity for the sake of this movie. Even the action is sub-par. It is decent but nowhere near deserving of the great reviews it has gotten. I give this movie a one, simply because of the over three thousand simpletons that gave it a 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tedious, overblown, boring sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>MORE and BIGGER is not necessarily BETTER! I actually enjoyed the first SPIDERMAN (2002) with its simple, focused story of Peter Parker (played soundly and solidly by Tobey Maguire) bitten by a radioactive spider and discovering that he had unusual abilities to shoot webs from his wrists, scale buildings, and sense things! The characters were fresh and interesting, the villain (Green Goblin) was cool and the film moved at a leisurely pace.Here comes the sequel SPIDERMAN 2 (2004)! And OF COURSE the masses fall for all the hype, the multitude of characters, the longer running time, etc! But this flick is just plain BORING! In SPIDERMAN, the filmmakers so eloquently and effectively showed us Peter Parker's pain and shock as his selfishness inadvertently led to his uncle's death. THEN, they had to try to one-up themselves by having a super sad, annoying scene in SPIDEY 2 where Peter (again played by Maguire) tells his aunt that he was responsible. That scene was Hollywood Manipulation 101! The point of the first one was that Peter was a kid (a high schooler for cripe's sake!) with no goals, no direction, no maturity. And I hated his aunt's reaction. To shun him like that for not getting involved in what was rightfully a police matter. Last time I looked, Spiderman was not impervious to bullets! He could have been killed. Did not fool me with that one! Also, the object of Peter's affection...Miss Mary Jane Rotten Bottom (Kirsten Dunst)...is a WHORE! That's right, a SLUT! She went from Harry Osborn (James Franco), who was just using her to get back at Peter in SPIDERMAN to Jameson's nephew (or son or whatever) in this movie. So she goes from Peter's best friend to Peter's boss's son (or nephew or whatever). THIS easy chick is the object of his desire? And that J.K. Simmons as Jameson is annoying as heck and NOT funny... and he's the comic relief! More like comic refuse! And there's the obligatory population of useless extras who add NOTHING to the proceedings but to scream and screech and be wowed by Spidey's abilities...It's a bird, it's a plane, it's Spiderloser!And they had this one scene where Harry slaps Peter at a party in front of a bunch of people...What? And Peter just stood there and took it! I'd have taken my chances with the spoiled millionaire and hit his tail back! Or at least sued him! May be a hero, but Peter's still a MAN! This sleaze basically stole the woman meant to be your girlfriend in the first movie and you let him get away with this? C'mon, Petey! But the biggest travesty was this part where Peter temporarily loses his powers and have this extended sequence where Peter is blissfully free and human again and they play RAINDROPS KEEP FALLIN ON MY HEAD!...I repeat...they play RAINDROPS KEEP FALLIN ON MY HEAD! Reason #1 any human being can say this film sucks!Of course, there is the perfunctory special effects extravaganza! But it's all show and is much too hard to believe. The villain is Dr. Ock (Alfred Molina), who's ticked about something (aren't they all?) so he plans revenge on the city of, New York, is it? At least this is New York as New York and not Chicago as Gotham City! See the multi-armed CGI villain octopus his way through New York...see Spidey shoot webs endless webs miles and miles...see Peter pine for Mary Jane...see Mary Jane act like a mindless idiot for not knowing this guy is obsessed with her ass...YAWN!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first movie was much better than this bomb, mainly because of Willem Dafoe and his fine acting. I can't fathom how critics say Tobey pouting and whining throughout the first half of this way too long movie was character development. The first movie established Parker as a loser and we didn't need to spend nearly an hour watching a depressed Maguirre sulk his way through the movie.The action sequences were nothing special, and were much too drawn out and boring. Overall this movie was all too predictable. It tried to copy the Return of the Kings into tricking the viewer with false endings (although anyone who read LOTR would know they were not false endings). Dunst was annoying as MJ and as usual tends to overact. Without Dafoe in this movie the performance came from J.K Simmons who had provided comic relief in a limited role.As a whole this movie is slightly better than the dreadful Daredevil and Batman and Robin. Best Superhero movie ever? Not by a longshot. The original Superman, Batman and both XMen movies were much better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film wants to be a drama, a love story, sci-fi movie and action extravaganza all at the same time, and then just screws up everything.The action scenes are not bad, but really not that different from the first movie.As far as sci-fi goes, it's all fiction and no science. The whole idea of professor Octavius and his "great invention" is completely unconvincing and seem extremely far fetched, not unlike the plot twists. But then, it is a comic-book-movie.But where this film really goes south is the drama/love story. It's an endless string of clichs, the characters are cardboard and the only thing truly dramatic is the quality of the dialog. Both the characters of Peter and of Mary Jane are so hopeless and indecisive that you end up hoping the bad guy kills them, just to get it over with. The pace is excruciatingly slow, so during the seemingly endless dialogs, ones eyelids tend to get very heavy.Even the jokes in the movie don't work that well. It *tries* too hard to be funny, but it just isn't. The only exception is the scene in the elevator, that was hilarious.If all of this isn't bad enough, the studios Morality Department also got hold of the script somewhere along the line. They injected a large dose of those wholesome "American Values", talking at lenght about American Heroes and rolemodels etc. Almost made me physically sick.I still would have given it 3/10, but right now it's in the top 250. Even if you're not a harsh as I am about this film, then let's at least agree that in the history of cinema, surely we can find at least 250 films that are better than this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"-Peter, I can't survive without you-MJ, you should not be here"The final dialog of Spiderman 2 is illustrating my feeling on the whole film. Not once, did I believe that MJ could love a character so undefined and uninteresting as Peter Parker. And yet, she is running away from her wedding to come back to Spiderman.I had the same (lack of) feeling during the entire film. I could not connect with Spiderman, and I did not feel empathy for his aunt when she is in danger, or have to leave her house. Or when Octopus is robbing the bank. Honestly, who cared?? So why is Spiderman running after him? Who cares, I'd rather have an ice-cream.Clearly, I don't think if it is a lack of focus from me. Rather, I believe this is the diagnostic on these commercial products. Hollywood movies are so artificial, so disconnected from the daily reality of real people, that I did feel its creators cared about the viewers, and in return I did not care about those characters at all.Technically, this film is still in good fit shape, despite its 10 years of age. SFX are still alright, and Sam Raimi had a good selection of camera angles, and scene rhythms.The acting is globally very bad, from Tobey Maguire (At the end of the day, not such a long filmography) to Kirsten Durst (much better interpretation under the direction of Lars von Trier in "Melancholia"). James Franco is at is usual quality level (I have to admit I have not watch "127 hours" yet).Globally, the script and storyline are lacking. A director has yet to come, who will inject some human truth in the Spiderman brand, like Nolan did with Batman. But the even harder challenge will be to avoid copying "The Dark Knight".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A solid sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No one would ever argue that Sam Raimi doesn't know how make a great film and even a great sequel or two. The director of the EVIL DEAD trilogy and 2002's SPIDER-MAN comes through with a worthy sequel to that last title, as Spidey takes on Doctor Octopus aka Doc Ock while wondering if he should continue on as the world's most misunderstood wall-crawler. His powers are beginning to fail him, the love of his life, Mary Jane Watson, is preparing to marry another, and his best buddy, Harry Osborn, is not feeling real good about him since Spider-Man "killed" his father, the Green Goblin, at the end of the first film. Talk about a conundrum. The best parts of this mega-budgeted action flick are taken up with the lonely youth's personal concerns. As with the first movie, the least effective parts come whenever he dons costume and cowl. These scenes are almost 100 percent computer-generated cartoonery and hard to swallow. They're also hard to follow, as everything rushes by in a virtual blur. Toby Maguire again plays the titular character, and reminds us why the first movie worked so well. His internal conflict can be readily seen in every twitch of his face and those highly expressive eyes of his. He's Elijah Wood with acting chops. The chameleonic Alfred Molina is absolutely wonderful as Doc Ock, and puts Willem Dafoe's Green Goblin from the first movie to shame. Unfortunately, Kirsten Dunst remains a supporting player, little more than eye candy, although she tries hard in her few scenes. In the end, is SPIDER-MAN 2 worth seeing? Unless you are a die-hard comic book fan, probably not. It doesn't really advance the youthful angst and romance and action sequences seen in the first movie. It also lacks the grandeur and mythic components of the first two X-MEN movies. But it is a decent time killer, a pleasant diversion for a super-slow evening.</fullReview>

Unfortunately the super-bug has, for some reason the movie never explained, lost his super powers and has furthermore gotten fed up with the whole idea of being a super hero instead of a regular teen.Sounds pretty good and it is, except when the movie gets into the "personal relationships" of spiderman when he's just Peter Parker. Lots of idiotic heart-to-heart talks with his girl friend and then there's this obnoxious old aunt who can't shut up and is always giving peter meddlesome advice.Still, the fight scenes are great and the animation of S flying thru the air is great too. I remember one scene where peter thinks he can fly again and takes off only to come crashing down and violently bounces off a couple cars. Looked extremely realistic - the director even thought of having the tail-pipe on one of the cars swing back and forth after peter smashed into the side of the car.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With his performance in "Spider-Boy 2," Tobey Maguire firmly establishes himself as the "thinking person's" Ralph Macchio. The almost 30-year old Maguire's on screen adolescence is virtually undiminished from episode 1, but the darker themes in episode 2 are an intriguing disconnect for older, more discerning viewers (those dragged to see the movie by younger, less discerning ones). I have no doubt that straight girls under 16, and gay men over 40 will enjoy this one as much as the first one, but there is also a little something here for the indifferent captives in the theater as well. Now that the "Batman" series has been resurrected with Christian Bale as the Caped Crusader, I'm thinking that Maguire should be on a short list for Robin should that character show up again in the future, thus sealing the poor actor's fate as an omnipresent junior action hero (while he laughs all the way to the bank, no doubt). Anyone for a big budget, live action version of "Jonny Quest," or "Speed Racer?" Call Tobey!</fullReview>

Opening night of spiderman was like going to a rock concert thats how packed it was (It was so packed it took us a half hour to leave the theatre!). When we went to go see number 2, we thought that the matine would be better. We were so wrong. It was as packed as the opening night was 2 years ago. This all has nothing to do with the movie, I know, but I have to include the massive impact that Spiderman has on our culture. Spiderman 2 kicked major ass. It was excellent. The story was great and the villain was better. The ending gave me chills. The whole Peter and Mary Jane story was good, (even though I felt that the villain didn't have to use her as bait again).

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed the first film, despite its unevenness in the script, and its length. This sequel is almost as good as its predecessor, and for me one of the better sequels out there. If there is one thing that I do prefer over the original, despite the rather slow start, I do think this film has the stronger storyline. The script is in general very good too, but the only other real problem I have with this film is its length. Despite the flaws, it is a pretty darn good action sequel. Two things made this movie as wonderful as it was. One was that it was terrific visually and technically, with splendid special effects and jaw-dropping stunts. The final action sequence between Spiderman and Dr Octopus was in particular brilliantly staged. The cinematography is focused and makes the film even more a wonder to look at. The other was the villain Dr Octopus, superbly played by Alfred Molina. Dr Octopus is made into a rather complex villain, after the death of his wife Rosalie, and becomes a villain after being part of his own invention. The music was also dramatic and fun. The remainder of the performances were very good too, while not admittedly the most charismatic actors ever, (Sean Connery is definitely a contender for that) Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst still give believable lead performances. All in all, a very good sequel. 8/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the worst movies ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is probably the worst movie I have ever seen. Those of you who saw "the greatest movie ever" must have seen a totally different film. Tobey Maguire is more annoying than he was in the first, making me want to bash his face in with a shovel the whole movie. Kirsten Dunst is OK at best playing the normal superhero love interest. Alfred Molina's acting is unmemorable at best. The only two good performances in the film were J.K. Simmons' J. Jonah Jameson and Willem Dafoe's Norman Osbourne who are in this film for a combined 5 secondsThis movie reminds me of a soap opera rather than a comic book, more focus is placed on the annoying Peter Parker pinning for Mary Jane instead of the real reason we go to see the move, Spider-man. I don't go into a comic book movie and expect to see something on par with The Godfather, but I do want to be entertained and this movie falls way short of that mark.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know many people that have enjoyed this film, but I am definitely NOT one of them. I wish I had waited until the DVD came out. The few action scenes that were in the film were good, but there weren't enough for me. I didn't go to see this film to see a drama, I wanted to see an action/adventure movie. Just my opinion, but I really wasn't that impressed.I think that the acting was fine, but the story was predictable, whether or not you follow the comics. I don't, but I have heard from friends that it stayed pretty close to the story in the comics. I honestly can't understand how this movie did so well. I hope others enjoyed it, but I feel like I wasted my money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A dull grey boring affair...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite all its accolades, perhaps some deserved, I have yet to see any for Spiderman 2's pure entertainment value. Before anything else, I was expecting a good action/adventure superhero film with cool action (fight scenes etc.), thrills, and suspense. Instead, this movie is incredibly slow-paced, has minimal fight scenes between Octavius and Spiderman, and in total, they only constitute maybe 5 percent of the film's duration. Moreover, the way Octavius perishes can only be described as pathetic. I grant that there are some funny moments and that character development is in-depth, but this movie feels more like a drama than a superhero flick. I seem to remember that the first Batman was masterful in its mix of both elements.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing new, just better graphics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WEll, i went in the movie with not so high expectations, especially after the first film let me down. I think of myself as a fair guy, and decided to go watch spiderman 2. THe movie starts off slow and leaves you staring at awkward moments, the acting is more of the same from Tobey, but i have to admit, Franco outdid himself in this film. Spiderman must now defeat DR.Octavius who is the bad guy in this movie as if you didn't know, He must face tough decisions like usual, and go into burning buildings to save babies once again, HMmm i think the director forgot that he put that in part 1, i will not get into details, for that will spoil things, but when you begin to hear the fans in the thearter, you know the movie is moving slow, there will be many parts where you as a spiderman fan will be like "OH NO WAY! How is that happening?" "ok how does he from hero, to zero, in a matter of seconds" BUT YOU MUST GO AND SEE IT TO FIGURE IT OUT! It's nothing new just better graphics, meaning more detailed fight scenes, So i do recommend seeing it, but not more then once unless your a hardcore fan, the critics are giving it A+ reviews as i type this to hype it up, and in some respect it deserves that A+ but in my view, its a ***/**** not the BEST, and surely far from the worst, SO CHECK OUT SPIDERMAN 2 keep the expectations low, and you will have some summer fun</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The worst of The Spiderman movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For some reasons, superhero-comics turned into movies are always done by directors, that take the subject way too seriously. Which means way, way too much talk and way way too little action. Which is the main problem with Spiderman 2. Nothing works in this way too long movie with so many moral talks and lessons to be learned, that me and my buddy stopped counting after the annoying Aunt May gives Parker lesson number 30 about always doing the right thing. We both felt like throwing up. The best thing about the third installment, besides from the added and constant actionscenes is definitely that Aunt May is only in one scene. Lets hope they kill off her character in the fourth movie.The biggest problem is the geeky dork Tobey Maguire. He is just so annoying and has the most annoying face and he is character is so clumsy and always screws up whenever he is not in his Spiderman suit. And Peter Parker in the comic books are taller than Tobey, better looking and not that much a dork.The scene in the beginning, why does Parker ride around delivering pizza's on his crappy scooter, when he is Spiderman?? Why is he so obsessed with MJ played by the unattractive bad actress Kirsten Dunst, when he could get laid all the time as Spiderman?? And why doesn't he sleep with his landlords daughter who is clearly into him?? The part where he loses his powers is dumb and unnecessary and happens at a point in the movie, were there has been almost no action at all, and we had just watched Parker screw everything up for himself for about an hour. Not to mention all the constant scenes with his Aunt May.The villain is dumb and pathetic and badly played by Alfred Molina. And definitely the worst villain in all the movies. And the scene with the train, is the only big actionscene in the entire film. Not acceptable in an "actionmovie" like Spiderman.The scenes between Parker and Harry where Harry blames Spiderman for his fathers (wonderfully played by Willem Defoe) death in the first movie, doesn't work. And when he finds out that Peter is Spiderman a real confrontation is not allowed in the horrible script, because the annoying MJ has to be rescued once again.The scene where Harry finds The Green Goblins equipment and suit should have been the final scene if you ask me, but no Sam Raimi had to add one last nauseating scene where MJ runs away from her own wedding and into the arms of Parker. Probably one of the worst endings in movie history.Fortunately the third movie has all the things that this lousy sequel builds up to for nearly two hours but never follows up on. Lots of action and a a selfish mean Spiderman and more violence.Lets hope they fire the entire cast for a fourth movie and find better actors that are better looking and give it a higher rating. Like 16 or 18, so we can have even darker movies than the excellent third installment. I read that Leonado DiCaprio turned down playing Spiderman. Lets hope he changed his mind if a fourth movie becomes a reality.How great could these films have been with him. He is handsome and a far better actor than the short annoying dork: Tobey Maguire.This movie gets zero stars from me.</fullReview>

Funny enough when she was asked if Peter was invited to the wedding, she said "No." Why didn't the SWAT team take Doc Ock out when he was robbing the bank? When he was climbing the building with Aunt Mae, did anyone find it funny that New York's Finest would just open fire at any building in New York? The list goes on and on. One more question... In New York is there Spider-Man insurance? Because when he was trying to stop that train he rip some really big holes in those buildings. If your property is damaged by a Super Hero do you think insurance covers that?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went into this film looking forward to it, it had broken records in the US and so I expected a fun, good humored action film. Sadly I was wrong, the action scenes were limited and the the main plot centers around Spider-Man's feelings. It was far too predictable, the humour was poor, and far too long was spent on whether he wanted to be Spider-Man (but I thought this was dealt with in the first film) and then right at the end the deal with the bad guy. If you want to see an action film don't see this, if you want to see a film in which nothing happens see this. Having seen this and The Hulk I just hope that other comic book films have more action and more entertainment. The pain of "Raindrops are Falling on my Head" will never go away.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>First movie I ever walked out of</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have watched thousands of movies in my life, from the very best to the very worst. Even the bad movies have their redeeming characteristics: until now. The slow painful tedium was like a root canal, without the sense that it's actually worth it in the long run.If you saw the first movie, you'll know that Spidey is a neurotic doormat desperately searching for something in the way of a personality. If you loved the first movie, you'll be pleased to know he doesn't show any sign of growing up and getting a life. He's still just as useless, and shows even less chance of getting over himself than ever. Nor will he ever get the girl, which, in this humble reviewer's opinion, is a good thing. She deserves better, but not by a heck of a lot.Such morbidly pathetic characters can be watchable if there is some realism, wit or spark. Unfortunately, in Spiderman the acting is terrible, the dialogue could be written by an 8-year-old, even the direction and cinematography are weak and incoherent."So what," you say, "Spiderman is an action movie". I'm afraid not. Spiderman 2 is an inaction move. Nothing happens, dreary scene after dreary scene of Toby in a street somewhere looking expressionless. The greatest rush is when Spiderman's web malfunctions and he falls out of the sky. A fitting end, you'd think, but no such luck.There are scarce few action scenes and they are among the worst paced I've ever seen. And we've all seen enough CGI recently to not be too thrilled by a guy with robot arms who doesn't do anything except wave them around a lot.If you want to watch home movies of Toby Maguire tripping over his own feet on the footpath, this is the movie for you. It was about this point that I realized that my life was too short. About 20 minutes later, I realized I wasn't even watching the screen any more, so I walked out. I have never done that before.I advise anyone who considers watching this movie, even for a moment, to go and find something better to do. Play outside, watch a pot boil, clean the toilet. Your life will be more meaningful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing, too many groaners not engaging enough</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This review is targeted at thirty somethings like myself who consider our time valuable. I generally enjoy comics (reading, not collecting) and especially like Spiderman. DISCLAIMER: THIS POST DOES LOOSELY DISCUSS THE END.The movie is quite disappointing from the get go. It starts off very slowly which I don't usually mind but it never gets off the ground. His love interest is completely a pre-teen fantasy of an adoring lover who looks past all his shortcomings. I realize that this movie panders to that crowd but the adoring little girlfriend is painfully clich. The bad guy, Doc Oc is actually not all that bad but I found that to be the only refreshing part of the movie. The plot meandered through his personal life, which is completely uninteresting in the movie but acceptable in the comic. The pop psychology littered throughout was the most painful like when his old aunt goes on about Spidey being a good role model and the world needing heroes. The ending is excruciating with the heroic rescue and romance. As B-movie as you can ever get with such a high budget flick. Not sure how so many people loved it.All in all, save yourself the time, money and aggravation, Cheers, Enn.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember being taken to see this cinematic offering when it was released here in the UK some years past. My now ex-girlfriend, I recall, woke me rather violently after I had drifted off at some point during the previews.I only wish she could have left me sleeping. Once awake I have to admit that I not impressed with what I witnessed on screen.Both Maguire and Dunst are actors of reasonable quality when paired with the right cast and directors. Maguire put on reasonably good shows in both 'The Cider House Rules' and 'Plesantville' I have also seen Dunst do rather will in a number of differing roles 'Interview With A Vampire', 'The Virgin Suicides' and when working with Cameron Crow, she put on a spectacular performance in 'Elizabethtown'.With Sam Raimi's help they have actually managed to participate in a film that was SO BAD I was actually angry when I left the theatre.The lackadaisical narrative, the shallow characterisation, sketchy continuity (especially during that ridiculous sequence on the train where we all saw Spidey doff his mask whilst trying to stop the passenger train careering off the end of the track by leaning against the front of it, only to have said mask returned to him by two kids inside the train. How on earth they ever managed to find the thing is beyond me).What all this boils down to is that perhaps this is one of the worst films Hollywood has ever produced. Apologies to all my friends who, for some reason, believe this? This? Thing to be the epitome of comic book movies. I'm sorry with no characters deeper than a specimen jar, no great narrative, no endearing features what so ever, aside perhaps from Ms Dunst (who was decorative more than functional in her role) this is utter tripe. Trite and tested tripe I grant you but tripe none the less.Perhaps the true, die-hard fans of this Spidey sensation see something in it that I am missing, but while I still have an ounce of respect for my cinematic sensibilities? I'll be giving it a big old thumbs down.</fullReview>

God this sorta sounds like a Disney movie to me. And of course spider man gets the women at the end and not the poor astronaut. Only good part of the movie was spidermans boss who kept dissing him and being mean. I enjoyed these parts. It was kinda whack how it was spidermans fault how his uncle died?? Also the train scene was amusing.

		<shortDescription>" Trailer Rocked, Movie Sucked. "</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sorry for this comment, But I got nothing else to say. I was a huge fan of Sam Raimi's first Spiderman. When he came up with second chapter by watching those trailers, Behind the scenes footage, premier notes, I expected a better sequel. But what I got.. a disgusting insulted trash.I was completely exhausted; it neither comes under a love story or an action movie. I was the most dumbest person to expect such greater stories from Colombia pictures. I got a stupid chubby love story. It was Crap; It's simply a Movie for the Sissies.Spiderman 2 (Spoilers******) I don't know who scripted this screwing story, being Spiderman the script didn't give Parker a dual personality. After the first original movie he must have something developed in his character but the script shows Parker like "he was a looser, he is a looser and he always be a looser." Tobey is still best in portraying Girly Peter Parker. Only God knows whether he has an expression called 'Anger'. Despite his body image I accept him as the confused Peter Parker in first movie which was well played by him. But this time, a role which was well established now in the second run, were fans willing to see his mature dark side, Tobey unnaturally shows his sissy side. Weak in dialogue presentation, no thick sound, no extreme expression he looked like a Bisexual chicken in Spidy/Parker costume. Also Kirsten Dunst was the worst part of the movie. MJ supposed to be a gorgeous character was more like a whore in Kirsten's hand. I hate J.K. Simmons from the first movie. He changed the enraged J. Jonah Jameson into an angry buffoon. Alfred Molina also sucked up his negative part, he has no mannerism in portraying the arch enemy which was done perfectly by the talented Willem Dafoe in the first movie. After Dafoe's surprise cameo, the only thing excited me in this movie was the performance of James Franco as a tortured soul thirsty for revenge. I am sure he will make a great villain like Dafoe in the coming chapter.The great villain in this movie was Sam Raimi. When the first movie released I always imagined Raimi's versatile take on - MJ discovering the truth 'Parker is Spiderman'. But I never expected he would do this much destruction to this franchise. Seems that entire people and their children plus their pets, discovered that Peter Parker is Spider-Man. Why he did such freaking turn-overs on Peter's secret identity. Raimi raped Spiderman and all his fans by doing this idiotic mastery.Also Danny Elfman failed miserably for giving a thrilling score comparing with the smashing music on the trailers. The only best thing from this movie is its trailer as well as the trailer music, which misguided me and lots of others for seeing this crap.All in all, the weak screenplay with ridicules story lines makes this lame chapter a big disappointment for the True fans. I wish Sony should have avoided this sequel; it should have taken a more time gap from the original movie without this lame plot. Making Maguire a more matured aged late 20's male with some strong sound and built. This movie is only meant for the sissy females and girl men, the true fans and the angry males like me hate these types of junks. "I gave this movie 0 out of 100!"Spiderman 2 = Movies for the Sissies.Go and watch if you are that much sissy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to see an action movie and all I got was a boring beginning that didn't start picking up into the end which I didn't' get to see cause I was sleeping through it. I love Kirsten Dunst she's a great actress very pretty too. I mean could they make the movie seem more realistic. Daredevil was more realistic and I still believe that it was a better movie than the two Spidermans combined. Tobie Maguire isn't' that great of an actor and he just flat out stunk again. The only reason I went is because my family went and the only worthwhile thing was seeing how beautiful Kirsten Dunst looks like in a wedding dress. By the way it was so easy for her to figure out that he was spiderman she knew it at the end of the first why didn't they go into that instead of drawing it out and having her engaged to some wack off in NASA.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The biggest summer disappointment. (for me)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>so watched it today and i think this is the biggest disappointment of all time to me. It's a normal, stupid sequel. I liked the first but this one is just crap. Everythink's full of CGI crap.(as you mentioned sequels nowadays are like these). Sequels nowadays destroy the first one. They always think they have to use a newer version of cgi program or whatever. Just because they think they have to do it better. Who likes this stuff? The villain wasn't as good as willem dafoe. Tobey Maguire still thinks he's god. although he didn't do much. He's just a guy you know to get all the money in. Like orlando bloom etc. Maguire only had to wear 5 times the costume and say like 30 lines and that's it. The rest of it will be done in the computer. I hope for Sam Raimi he won't do the 3rd part. Oh wait there's something great in this one. Yeah, that's Bruce Cambell and the appearance of Willem Dafoe. That's it. Everything else in this is sh*t.Thank you Sam for saving me 7 Bucks for part 3. :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>God awful movie; its high rating signifies the low standards of moviegoers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was the most awful schlock-fest I've seen in at least the past six months. I thought the first movie was okay, not great, but certainly not awful; I was entertained by it. While watching the sequel I was continually incredulous that anyone could consider this movie to be anything other than a smrg?sbord of crap.Sure, people will tell me: "It's just a movie. Suspend your disbelief." And while I'm more than happy to suspend my disbelief that there's a kid with superhuman spider powers swinging around New York and fighting crime, I'm not willing to concoct an elevated subway train running through what looks to be midtown Manhattan, said to be bound for Bay Ridge (which is in Brooklyn) but somehow the end of its line faces some body of water (the east river, perhaps?) and there is no platform or station in sight.That was merely part of my gripe with the movie. What about the asinine bank robbery scene where Doc Ock is stealing gold coins of some sort? He makes off with two bags and somehow has enough to buy whatever absurd supplies he needs to rebuild his machine. From where did he order the supplies? "Wholesale_sci-fi_nuclear_machinery.com?" Did they deliver it to his run down layer on some dilapidated pier in ... where, Queens? Wouldn't that set off some alarms somewhere? There's only so much disbelief that can be suspended.There has to be some semblance of believability for a movie to work and while superheroes are obviously a fiction, having fleets of cop cars racing down the streets of NY (in 2005? This isn't Dinkin's-era NY), being flipped--and shot at by white nu-metal looking hoods cruising in convertible 50s-era cars--is *bleeping* ridiculous. It's not entertaining, it's insulting and moronic.But hey, the general public seems to be comprised of morons who eat stuff up so long as it makes a lot of noise and has a lot of movement and color and, of course, explosions and property damage. This film dragged on forever with absurd, feckless bits of exposition (the cake scene with the Russian landlord's daughter? Wtf?? What was the point?). "Spider-man 2" might as well have been directed by Joel Schumacher; it was almost as bad, if not as bad as "Batman and Robin".This movie was a disgrace. I could go on, but why bother ... the people have already spoken and I'm just one lone movie-goer who wishes films didn't have to suck.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than the first, but pointless altogether</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While the special effects and story lines are greatly improved from the under-whelming first Spider-Man movie they alone can't make this movie worth your money. The strongest points of this movie were in the supporting roles of Aunt Mae, Dr. Octavius (before he turned evil) and of course Harry Osborn. They were the only characters that acted like actual human being in this movie and the only actors that didn't just chew up their words and spit them out. For me the real problem with this movie is that it accomplishes nothing that wasn't a part of the first film. All the themes of the original are just redone here, and for no apparent reason. We learned from the first movie that 'With great power comes great responsibility' and that 'there's a hero in all of us'. So why is the sequel not trying to cover any new territory? Peter loves MJ but they can't be together?um why? Obviously her life is in danger already so what would it hurt to tell her? Peter is reluctant to become Spider-Man and struggles to use his powers, yeah that happens again to. The news paper irrationally hates Spider-Man yet Peter sells them pictures for only $300?!?! Paparazzi photographers can get THOUSANDS of dollars for a picture of Brad Pitt or Madonna or Britney Spears, so why is the clown only making $300?All in all if you liked the first movie you'll like this one more. If you thought the first one was lame, you should save your money and just rent Hellboy or X-men 2, which are both superior super hero films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vastly Overrated Summerflick at the Right time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is vastly overrated to say the least. Sure, it's a good summer movie - but that is all (don't believe the IMDb score). It's a summer action movie at the right time without competition, that's why it's a box office smash hit (nobody goes to see Troy anymore) - not on movie merits. If you don't believe me yet at how overrated this flick is; look at the votes. 50% of voters has given this movie a 10. A 10! Imo it's more of a 6 or a week 7 (I gave it a 6) and here's why.This is more of a drama then an action movie and some scenes are really drawn out. "What?!! You just want brainless action!" I hear the Spiderman fans screaming from the top of their lungs. "No.", I reply calmly, "I don't". But when you want some sort of drama or a strongly emotional driven storybase (or what not) you need, imo, at least 2 things.1) A good script. This is not it, no matter what you say. The script is very poor by all means and I'm not reacting to the liberties taken over the spiderman story (and some things are really out there), it's just not a very good script by any standards. The tempo and wrapup of the movie is really strange aswell (but that's the editings and / or directors fault).2) Good acting. And this is not it again. Tobey Maguire surprised me with how poorly he acted in this movie - looked mostly like he was wandering about being sleepy all of the time without any emotions to show for his life. Kirsten Dunst never was (or will be) a good actress. Alfred Molina? Hah. It feels like they're trying to make the movie as cheap as they can, what a poor substitute he is for the great Dafoe in the first movie. In fact, the best acting by far is that of James Franco and he only has a small part (he truelly shines).The effects are still mediocre at best aswell (Harry Potter 3's are outstanding) and cleary compatriot. There isn't any excuse for it either this time around since the first Spiderman movie pulled in as much cash as it did. No, simply put this is a good movie; but not great by any means. no matter how hard people try to project on you that it's "innovative" cause of the emotion overload (poorly executed) they try to fill it with.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I don't see what everyone sees in this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was horrible. It might be that I'm not a big super hero fan to begin with, or that I actually know something about science, or maybe I'm confused on what a bad screenplay is defined as. To begin with I found a lot of the dialogue very awkward and full of clichs. The line "Go get 'em tiger" should never be used unless as a joke in a movie. There were others too. Then there were some plot holes. Why would Dr. Octavius give his mechanical arms artificial intelligence, much less why did he need them in the first place? I know he needed them to set the story up but at least explain why he needs them. Second of all it really wouldn't have been too hard for the screenwriters to take 5 minutes to get a general idea of what nuclear fusion is. They were right in that fusion takes place in the sun. Thats about all they had right. Fusion is when you combine two atoms, generally hydrogen, to form larger atoms, usually helium. This releases a ton of energy. First of all fusion reactions release so much energy that they can't be used to create energy simply because they destroy everything around them. The movie has Dr. Octavius testing his new form of fusion in the middle of NYC - which would most likely destroy the entire city. The hydrogen bomb is nothing more than a fusion reaction. People are working to create "cold fusion" which would be a fusion reaction but at a temperature low enough that it won't destroy anything within a few miles of it. Then Tridium or whatever they had in the movie doesn't even exist. Much less spinning it and firing lasers at it definitely won't make if fuse together. Then at the end of the movie they solve the problem of the uncontrolled fusion reaction by putting it in the river. That is the absolute worst thing they could do. Whenever you heat water to extreme temperatues - even a fraction of the temperature of fusion - it separates into hydrogen and oxygen. You might remember the three mile island incident a while back. That was caused by water entering a nuclear reactor and creating hydrogen, which easily blows up. At the end of the movie the entire river and city should have blown up due to the massive amount hydrogen created from the fusion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strong Sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spider-Man 2 (2004) *** (out of 4)The second film in Sam Raimi's trilogy finds Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) struggling with his superhuman powers because he's starting to realize that in order to be a hero he's going to have to turn his back on everything he loves. Mainly this goes for Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) but he also has a new villain, Doc Ock (Alfred Molina) wanting to kill him. SPIDER-MAN 2 is a very good follow-up to a pretty good movie. It seems over the past several years fans have debated on which film is actually better. The first one was about as good as you could get with a comic adaptation and this film improves on it in most spots. Like the first film, the screenplay here is the biggest key as it really allows all of the characters to grow and especially the Parker one. The entire film really does seem to be built around his mental state as he struggles with what to do as he's constantly wondering what would work best for him and those around him. The majority of the movie deals with him outside the costume and this was a pretty unique and different feel. The screenplay throws in quite a bit of character development for the supporting players as well. With that said, once the action scenes are put into place they too are impressive and especially a sequence on a train that happens towards the end of the picture. Once again the performances really come to life with Maguire doing an excellent job with Parker and James Franco also getting to shine as his best friend. Dunst is good as the love interest as is Rosemary Harris in her part. The one thing I think doesn't live up to the first is the villain. While Molina is good in the part I think the character on the whole just isn't interesting as the one in the original. With that said, SPIDER-MAN 2 is still a very good movie that ranks right up there with the best comic adaptations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I didn't even like the first one, and this one pulled me in</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the first times I've ever written a review to a newly released movie. I wasn't a fan of the first film and I in fact walked away disappointed at the end of the movie. However, when I walked out of the theater at the close of Spiderman 2 I was the exact opposite of disappointed. Does this movie still use too much CGI? Probably. Could they have developed the villain a little more? Yeah, but in the long haul this movie is a story-driven action movie, a rare thing in a time of mostly action-driven action movies. The effects in the first one just looked fake to me and the Spiderman character himself seemed flat. But in this second installment the effects worked for me, not because they were of a higher quality (which they were) but because they were empowered by characters whom the audience cares about, and it's through these powerful performances that this movie is able to set itself above the original and above all but a few movies in the genre. I was able to suspend my disbelief in this movie and embrace Raimi's world. This is much more than the basic summer blockbuster and it will undoubtedly pave the way for both, sequels and individual successes for all the cast and crew involved in this movies production. They did an A+ job and though I am not sure about this film belonging in the IMDB top 250 (especially this soon after its release) it definitely deserves high acclaim. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spider-Man 2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Sam Raimi (The Evil Dead) brings a fantastic sequel that is just as good as, if not better than the first. Basically Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is still saving the city as web swinging super hero Spider-Man, but he is also trying to stay best friends with Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), after refusing to be closer. Spider-Man is the biggest reason for his personal life problems, and pretty soon, for some reason, he starts to lose his powers, and eventually dumps the suit, oh, and Mary Jane gets engaged to Captain John Jameson (Daniel Gillies). Meanwhile, (before "quiting") he witnesses an experiment by Dr. Otto Octavious (Alfred Molina) to create new energy, "the power of the son", and this experiment involved four mechanical arms put in his spinal cord, and when the experiment goes wrong these arms, or tentacles, are welded on him. He is now to be known as Dr. Octopus, or Doc Ock. Peter meanwhile is getting more used to a life without rescues and crime fighting, but with the threat of Doc Ock and other city problems, he sees that Spider-Man should return. There is also the story of Harry Osborn (James Franco) who has a grudge on Spider-Man, since he believes he killed his dad, Norman (a brief return by Willem Dafoe), or Green Goblin, and with Doc Ock's help he may get the opportunity to get his revenge, and in return, Ock gets to build the disastrous energy machine again. Also starring Rosemary Harris as May Parker, J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson, Donna Murphy as Rosalie Octavius, Happiness's Dylan Baker as Dr. Curt Connors, Bill Nunn as Joseph 'Robbie' Robertson, Cliff Robertson as a brief Ben Parker, Ted Raimi (Sam's brother) as Hoffman, The Evil Dead's Bruce Campbell as Snooty Usher and director John Landis as Doctor. With even better special effects, action, great music by Danny Elfman (he also did Batman), and the better love story, and Mary Jane discovers Peter's big secret. It won the Oscar for Best Visual Effects, and it was nominated for Best Sound Editing and Best Sound Mixing, and it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Special Visual Effects and Best Sound.

		<shortDescription>A bad review for Spider-Man 2...? How shocking!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alright this will be my first time commenting on a movie here at IMDb. The reason I joined was because it was just so irritating to see some of these awful movies receiving rave reviews. 10/10 for Spider-Man 2? I have a question: Have you ever seen a movie besides this one? Is it simply that you don't have any good movies to compare this to? Now on the whole I don't really like comic book movies. That's not to say I don't like any and it's definitely not to say that I don't like comics. So with that out of the way let's jump into the problems.One thing a director or writer must be careful of is bad dialogue. Conversations that seem awkward or would never, under any circumstances (including hypothetical situations) occur. The conversations between May and Peter are so corny I had to force myself to continue watching. I know some of you might argue that it's a comic book movie so it's allowed to be corny. That doesn't necessarily mean anyone is going to like it. The first Spider Man was tolerable for me because it didn't have this problem.The second problem: the characters. Peter Parker is portrayed as being reserved, shy, etc. Where did this idea come from? He's a superhero! He is allowed to be cocky, to make bad jokes about the villains, and to trust in his own abilities and knowledge. Let's move to Dr. Octopus. I can summarize this with a Chris Rock quote: "What happened to just being crazy?" Why is the doctor is some sort of a struggle with his mechanical arms throughout the movie? Why can't he just be a villain? The third: the annoying people of the city. Their fondness for our webbed hero is overplayed. Some of this part is simply ridiculous. Watch it you'll see what I mean.In conclusion, please don't give this movie a good review. The fate of all movies which are actually good depends upon it.</fullReview>

I don't understand how this film have been deemed better than the first and basically regarded as one of the greatest films ever. It is not! Box office ratings are high, because people including myself loved the first film and went back for more, and more is what we got. More of the same. The film was predictable to such lengths that you could have left after 15 minutes and quoted word for word the rest of the plot.The SFX were nothing new, and often obviously computer generated. The narrative was segmented, and much was left unexplained. There were moments of sickeningly obvious character interaction, take the train scene where Peter's mask comes off for instance... "we won't say anything." Yeah right! Mary Jane's "Its my decision" speech was pathetic and again, predictable, as is what will happen in Spiderman 3, and whats worse, does not fit in with the comic books original plot. The film wasn't bad, but it certainly wasn't good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really, a terrible film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw Spider-Man 2 last night and was appalled. As for the IMDb rating, I am shocked, as I have never disagreed with one so completely. There were so many things wrong with this movie, I can't even begin to list them all, but I'll try:The Acting: Tobey Maguire is a terrible, frighteningly bad actor. He doesn't have emotions, he doesn't have a nice speaking voice, he doesn't have talent. Kirsten Dunst is alright, but not great. The Direction: I felt like I was watching a made-for-TV movie. The camera felt cheap, the angles were needlessly bizarre, the special-effects unimpressive. At times the movie was so unintentionally comical (I know, it is a comic book, but hear me out) that I couldn't take the drama seriously.The Script: Mindless. It's that simple. Overall I gave it a two, because I was feeling generous. It's not a good action movie, it's not a good drama, and it certainly pales in comparison to other comic-book adaptations like the X-Men films. This summer-flick is overrated.</fullReview>

And Raimi is at the top of his game--and there are sweet little tidbits for those of you who have followed his career over the years--certain actors, types of camera moves and angles, will make you chuckle with delight and remind you who's directing this wonderful film.

		<fullReview>Writing a review about an endeared comic book character is harder than you might think. You don't want to spend a lot of time talking about the hero that most people who are taking the time to read the review, already know. You can talk about the history of how the film produced a sequel, but movies such as these have so much fanfare before they hit the big screen that by the time they are released, everyone is sick about turning on their television or looking out their office window to see yet another advertisement. And going into the details of the character as not seen in the movie but rather between the pages of an illustrated magazine, forgetaboutit! One small miscue, and the comic book convention guys are all over you petitioning your house and threatening your children (granted I live in a condo and have no kids, but it's possible). So when the event movie of 2004 hit theaters in June, I wondered how I was going to introduce the review. So for inspiration, I climbed through the attic and found a box labeled 'Old Clothes 1976' and pulled out my old Spider-Man underoo's. (To be fair, I should mention that they were not really underoo's just underpants and a t-shirt that my father had drawn webs on with a black marker). In full gear, I sat in front of my computer and started to type?.Spider-Man 2 is the sequel to the multi-million dollar grossing Spider-Man released just two years earlier. Back at the kick of the proverbial second can are actors Toby McGuire and Kirstin Dunst as Peter Parker (Spider-Man) and Mary Jane Watson, and director Sam Raimi (Evil Dead). SM2 picks up a few years after Spider-Man had rescued Manhattan from the evil deviance of the Green Goblin and things have changed greatly for the web-slinger. The oddly contorted swinging from building to building that was present two years ago has now been perfected, and variations of web constructions have improved for the betterment of mankind. But where thing have improved for Spidey, things have taken a turn for the worse for Peter Parker. He has lost his job, his woman, his friends. Hell, he can't even get a free drink or appetizer at a high-class gala. Also standing in his way of living happily ever after is none other than Dr. Otto Octavius (or Doc Ock for those of us who feel we have earned the right to be on a nickname basis). Played perfectly by Alfred Molina (Species), Doc Ock and his tentacles of terror strike a deal with Harry Osborn to deliver Spider-Man in exchange for the trillium he needs to complete his scientific experiment. So, Aunt Mae, Mary Jane and half of New York (including an El-Train?) are subjected to the terror that these two adversaries cause atop the tallest structures of the inner city. The special effects for these battle scenes are an improvement on the first installment, following the sequel rules that everything must be bigger and louder. Buildings are destroyed, cars are thrown at will and a riverside dilapidated structure is destroyed which will probably get Spider-Man credit for cleaning up the waterfront. Of course, like the first film (why change a winning combination), there is a love story at the heart of SM2 that runs cold then hot then cold then hot again. There are so many volleys back and forth between Toby and Kristin that I felt like I was watching Martina Navratalova and Jimmy Conners during a US Open tennis match. But where the Spider-Man had sparks fly, SM2 drags it out over too many scenes and doesn't capitalize on an emotional scene at the beginning of the film where the two speak with but a fence between them.But love story, blub story. Who cares, right? Are things blown up? Yes. Are the special effects cool? Yes. Is the movie better than the first one?I am not so sure. I wasn't completely enamored by the original and the second one had too many dry spells to keep my interest for the full two hours. Although the sound was incredible and the visuals stunning the story and dialogue lacked a great deal of substance and final climax between web-head the Octavius was? anti-climatic in terms of what was building up to be a phenomenal finish. There is a good deal of humor in the SM2 and that is a good thing. A scene in an elevator between Spidey and a passenger was good fun, and the violin player outside the theatre house was worth a chuckle or two. But all the snickers in the world couldn't keep me from ignoring some incredibly inane dialogue. The final words as uttered in the film from Mary Jane to Spider-Man ('Go get 'em, tiger') got laughs when it shouldn't and that is not the way you want to remember a film. And don't even get me started on Raindrops Keep Fallin' On My Head or the Here Comes The Bride musical treats.When you get down to it though, this is the ultimate summer flick and it will make wheel barrels of money no matter what any of us say. The young women will like it due to Toby's presence, the young men will be happy that Kristin gets wet again near the end while wearing a tight outfit, and teachers and theologians will talk on the storyline of how Spider-Man suffered through a mental condition that affected his web slinging ability. Oh yeah, I guess the kid target audience will like it too due to the violence and cartoon action. Me, I was indifferent. Glad I saw it and will probably buy it on DVD in 6 months. I just expected a little more.So there you have it, I can finally take off these stupid Spider-Man underpants and go back to the normal boxers (which also have cob webs?.unfortunately, real ones). With Spider-Man 3 more than hinted at the conclusion of the second, I just best not put the Old Clothes box anywhere it can't be easily found.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An action movie gone sour.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the first spider-man movie my anticipation was another action flick with a little romance thrown in. But, spider-man 2 came across as a Shakespearean tragedy with a little action thrown in. Peter parker's relationship with Mary Jane was an important part of the picture and I think should have been explored but it was elevated much higher than necessary for an action flick... The special effects was great and the action that was present was good. I can enjoy a good love story with heart brake and heart ache but not at the expense of blowing things up, mischief and mayhem. The train scene was great action then went straight downhill. That "win one for the gipper" stuff is just very hackneyed and usually not very well done as is the case in this movie. Even though spider-man is a comic book character and if you read the comic book you had an idea of how things would end up, the movie seemed to telegraph what was happening next to whom and when. There was no real drama just a lot of Kleenex moments which don't fill the void for some action.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I honestly liked the first movie, no masterpiece but one of the best based on comic books ever. I liked it because Parker was presented like a "real" person that faced problems and transformation into a super hero was fun to watch and gave you a good feeling. The sequel is just another stupid Hollywood movie, with American flags everywhere (ok you are patriots), with a stupid plot where a stupid so called dramatic situation ends with an unjustified moronic happy ending. The sequel is all about special effects (really bad work, looked really fake), Octopus is awfully conceived, the newspaper editor-in-chief is ridiculously over-acting. Finally, It was so awful that I don't wanna waste my time explaining why.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this tonight and thought it was quite poor. Very slow at times and I didn't find the acting between Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst convincing. The pace really hurt the storyline, and didn't learn from the mistakes of the first film. Some of the jokes e.g. mops falling out of the cupboard had people laughing out loud at the cinema. They brought a wry smile to my face but weren't that funny. The CGI was not so spectacular in some places. Doc Ock looked completely different in CGI form, and near the end where Spiderman turned away from the camera to jump away the transition to the CGI Spiderman was noticeable. The film's saving grace was really in Dr. Octavius and Parker's Grandmother. Overall I would give it 6/10.Clearly this is a film were I am against the majority, like I was with 'Signs'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Overrated!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***POSSIBLE SPOILERS BELOW***Now I was disappointed with the first Spiderman?.it just didn't seem to hit home with me as it seemed to with everyone else. The hype behind this Spiderman movie franchise is what drives it, because this sequel is just as good as the first..... in other words, not that good.I've heard everyone, from most critics, including Ebert, to many of my peers, that this was simply a GREAT movie, guys like Ebert went so far as to say that Spiderman 2 is 'the greatest superhero movie ever'. I only have one thing to say to that: YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME!!Did anyone see 'Batman' (1989)? Or how about 'Superman'? How could ANYONE compare this campy movie to those two superhero CLASSICS?? This flick does absolutely nothing new?more of Mary Jane looking and acting retarded, more of the CG Spiderman swinging all over NY, more of Peter Parker fumbling all over himself, and another villain who just drops by sparingly and engages in some unrealistic fight scene with Spidey. This was very lazy film-making IMO, they just handed the audience the same old formula used in the first one?making this sequel very dry, but somehow more campy and corny. I can't believe all of the praise this film is getting?.with talk about how its soooo much better than the first?it's basically the same movie!! Peter doesn't want to get with MJ for fear of luring her to danger, though he ends up doing it anyway; some villain was just born wreaking havoc all over NY, Parker's so-called best friend is jealous of him?yada yada yada. Spiderman is no 'superman', so how does he takes the falls and bumps he does and get up like nothing happened?? What makes the world of Batman so realistic is the fact that he can indeed get hurt. and it's easy to relate to him. Same with Superman; he actually has superpowers but still seemed more realistic than Spiderman here. Everything in Spiderman 2 just seemed so lame; he doesn't want to be Spiderman anymore, so just when things start to look up for Peter 'The Ultimate Loser' Parker, he quickly learns that they're not. All of a sudden because his 'mind' isn't into his crime-fighting occupation he can't do his basic abilities. Were the writers really serious with that? He got bit by a spider, so the spider traits are a PART of him! But no, just because he's having a hard time at school, can't pay his rent and is too much of a punk to confess his love to MJ, he can't scale walls and constantly runs out of web?? How ludicrous! Hell, I felt more sympathy for Doc Ock than I did for Peter Parker, he was just TOO MUCH of a loser for me to feel sorry for him. Kirsten 'Dunce' still sucks, she's just hideous. Tobey Maguire is average as Parker, he's too much of a wimp to be taken seriously IMO. Green Goblin's son tries to portray himself as some big shot, going to board meetings and what not?give me a break, he's like 20!! What's even worse is that they're setting up part 3 with him as the villain (yes Green Goblin yet again), wow that ought to be great! LOL please. Who absolutely stole the show to me was Jameson, the leader of the newspaper. He was hilarious; the only character I liked. I'll just say this about Spiderman 2: Don't Believe The Hype! It's not as good as everyone's saying it is. I knew I'd be disappointed, because it was just common sense for me to realize that it couldn't be THAT much better than the very average original, contrary to what critics were saying. This is a very average, flawed movie that doesn't deserve to be even MENTIONED among the past great superhero movies. ** out of **** stars. This shouldn't last much longer on the Top 250 list.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.I was as disappointed in this sequel as the first. Not because there weren't some interesting elements - there were. But because the key promise is broken. This is a superhero whose herolife is swooping and three-dimensional. The future of exciting movies is in exploring and exploiting this notion. `Finding Nemo' does. `Val Helsing' does. But this one, which is built around the graphic senses of motion and depth is completely devoid of these except for a few brilliant moments in the first exterior fight with Ock.I used to think this was because huge projects demand risk avoidance. But with so many big films having a dimensional architecture these days, even to `Pirates of the Carribean,' I can only say that now it is a matter of incompetence.There are other blots as well, most notably Kirsten Dunst. She had one of the most explosive introductions of any actress in `Vampire.' But as an adult (still playing youngsters), she is in way over her head. She needs to stick to vacuous, fun-loving dimwits like she did well enough in `Eternal Sunshine.' MJ in the comic is a voluptuous model. They needed to get someone who actually looks redheaded and IS voluptuous and full of life. An Alicia Witt type.But there are things to like. As I understand, the shooting started without a script and at some point much later Michael Chabon was brought in to fix it. The film was the mess we sometimes still see. I'm told that he fixed many `ordinary' elements relating to dialog and sequence and such.He also emphasized the basic foundation of the thing. Spidey was invented not as another superhero, but as a story about the superhero story. A metastory, one that already had several `story-about-story' elements. The main one in the ?book was the deal with Jameson's creating a negative) myth with Parker himself complicit.Chabon uses all his `Wonder Boy' tricks to emphasize these and add others: MJ is now an actress, and get this - starring in the first play about metastory. Osborn creates a metastory about his Dad, Aunt May about her husband, her husband (from beyond the grave) about Peter, MJ about young Jameson, arms about the motivation of Octavius...Its a carnival of narrative pasted on other narratives. If only the vision were as clever and competent as the ideas.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Shame on you, Sam Raimi! How can you take one of the most iconic comic book characters of all-time, and end up with a movie like this? What are you doing? I've got to ask how Sam Raimi ended up in the director's chair of this movie in the first place. What had he done to prove himself worthy of taking on a project of this magnitude? The "Evil Dead" trilogy? Give me a break! Those B-movies should have been used as evidence to show he wasn't the right man for the job.I could go into detail on each and every single thing I had a problem with in the movie, but I don't have enough hours in the day to write them all here. I will, however, go into detail on a few things I found particularly frustrating, or laughable.Soft-spoken nerd Tobey Maguire once again robs his character Peter Parker/Spider-Man of all his comic book counterpart's charisma and sense of humor. Casting Tobey Maguire in this role has got to be one of the biggest casting mistakes of all-time.Kirsten Dunst is no better as Mary Jane. She manages to zap any hint of spunk her character had in the comics, and portrays her very melodramatically, and at times it's just hard to watch.As far as the scenes are concerned, there is one that stands out in my mind as being the worst. That's right...the train scene.The train scene rates right up there with the utter ridiculousness of Shia LaBeouf swinging like Tarzan from vine-to-vine in "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull". You mean to tell me that in New York that even though the true identity of Spider-Man is revealed to an entire train full of people that not one single person decides to make trouble for the wall-crawler by going public with his identity? Yeah, right...After three Spider-Man films from Sam Raimi, I say it's time to go back to the drawing board. Let's reboot the franchise, get the casting right this time, let's leave out the camp, and get to the core of what has made Spider-Man one of the most beloved characters of all-time. Spidey deserves so much more than this!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As the "Evil Dead" movies showed, Sam Raimi knows how to do a good job with sequels, and "Spider-Man 2" affirms that. This one has the title character (Tobey Maguire) battling Doc Ock (Alfred Molina) while still wooing Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst).Granted, this IS a sequel, so one might wonder how much they can do without repeating things from the original. Well, they have a lot in store for ya. I will say that Doc Ock doesn't look quite as menacing as the Green Goblin, but he's still one nasty dude.All in all, I don't know whether I would call this a masterpiece, but Sam Raimi still has some good ideas. To paraphrase the first movie, he has shown great power and great responsibility. Most of the cast from the original (James Franco, Rosemary Harris, J.K. Simmons, Bruce Campbell) also returns. Quite good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>That Was It...?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the movie opening night. MINOR SPOILERS It seems like Spider-Man 2 is the best movie of the year, right? To me, this could be one of the, if not, the most overrated film in the movie industry ever. I'm a huge Spider-Man fan, and I liked how the movie felt while I was watching it. It felt like a comic, but other then that, this was a joke.Spider-man, aka Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire), picked off where he left off. He is again having troubles coping with his life as a superhero, his personal life with his `on and off' romance with Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), and his college education. Things get even worse when the brilliant Dr. Otto Octavius's (Alfred Molina) fusion experiment goes terribly wrong. He gets possessed by the four tentacle arms he attaches to himself and goes on a rampage in order to finish his experiment at any means necessary. Harry Osborne (James Franco) makes a deal to give Ock what he needs to finish the fusion device if he brings Spider-man to him alive. The plot is simple but is poorly executed on the big screen. First and foremost, I liked the comic strip style credits from the start. It somewhat recapped what happened in Spider-Man. As the movie starts, I wasn't too much hyped because I knew I would be disappointed considering all the praise this movie got. I knew in my heart the movie would flop, and it did.The plot wasn't very solid. So many plot holes, so much bad dialogue, so many problems. The whole movie could be quoted. Sam Raimi would have the camera centered on one character, and then that character would talk for a few minutes or so. No real conversations actually take place. The character interaction was very weak. Raimi didn't forget to add the old save the gal before she gets harmed routine. The character development was even weaker. Did Raimi think we'd ignore the part on why Dr. Otto Octavius became this mad villain? They just gave us some scientific nonsense and we just ignored it. I don't know what Raimi was thinking when he was trying to make Doc Ock look like he had split personalities. It seemed like he had mood swings instead. He didn't have the same villain vibe like the Green Goblin did in the previous Spider-Man. What were his motives anyway? He was a scientist that wanted to use his `gift to help mankind' and ended up wanting to control the sun for the sake that Spider-Man needed a villain? I liked the few moments where Raimi sneaked in Dr. Connors. That was a surprise. Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst acted horribly. It sounded as if Tobey Maguire was reading off his lines off paper. I didn't know what the hell was going on with Kirsten Dunst. I didn't know whether she was serious, friendly, sad, happy, or what. She talked in the same tone of voice throughout the whole movie. James Franco was horrible. He was trying way too hard and on a very simple part. All throughout the whole entire movie he showed no love Peter Parker even when he was his so called `best friend.' He would also risk the half the city to kill Spider-Man, but then he gets convinced that he should let Spider-Man rescue the city he was willing to destroy to get to the position he was at only because Spider-Man was the man he despised anyways, Peter. He probably thought to himself to would get a piece of Spider-Man in Spider-Man 3. The special effects didn't offer much. There was just more CGI that's done because it's easier that way. I didn't really notice any differences between both films when it came down to the special effects. Maybe it was sharper this time around, not that's all. Fighting on the side of a building? Not really my cup of tea. Saving a train with a bunch of people in it at the very last second? It's been done. Why can't there be a limit on the amount of time CGI can be used on a film or something? I did, however, love the Evil Dead like scene in the hospital when chaos occurred between the doctors and nurses with that one doctor using a chainsaw like tool and the Bruce Campbell tombstone. Nice touch by Raimi. Overall, not what I expected, but then again, I wasn't expecting much. Spider-Man 2 was an average superhero movie, but nothing special. I tried to like the movie, but it's just not possible with all these problems the movie faced. Story: B- Acting: D- Visuals: C Cinematography: C Overall: C- (Not an average)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Peter-Parker 2 *SPOILERS*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't understand why this movie has a 94% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. X-Men 2, while not being a cinematic masterpiece, held my attention throughout, and even made me smile repeatedly. I loved the ending. I should say that I am a long-time Spider-Man fan (subscribed for over ten years) and enjoy comic book movies, so it's not the subject matter that is the problem for me. It's just the crappy movie making. Really.Peter-Parker 2--sorry--Spider-Man 2 has several obvious problems.1) Say it with me: Exposition!The intro credits are beautiful, and cleverly establishes the back story from the first movie. But for some reason we still get to hear the whole story told again in the movie, in one of the most annoyingly slow scenes.I don't know how many scenes there are where characters have long monologues explaining to the audience what their motivations are, how they are thinking, what will happen next, and so on. Sometimes they have another character standing in front of them, but they aren't really speaking to them, they're speaking to us. This is evidenced by the fact that sometimes they don't have anyone in front of them, or even in the same room. They are just speaking out loud, talking to themselves.There is a saying that anyone who has taken a writing class will have heard many times: show don't tell. But in Peter-Parker 2, nothing is shown. Everything important comes out of the mouths of the characters instead of being played out for us on the screen. Every motivation, every conflict, every idea.Peter Parker says loudly to himself: "I can't tell M.J. that I'm Spider-Man. My enemies would never leave her alone!" (Or something like that.) What enemies?? Spidey has enemies? The Goblin is dead, Doc Ock isn't around yet, and we have seen no other enemies. He's imagining things. Out loud. It would have been a good idea to show us some of these enemies.One of the funniest sequences, that actually had me laughing out loud, was when Aunt May tells Peter about the young boy from next door who idolizes Spider-Man. Somewhere in the monologue the line turns from a story about the boy next door to a motivational speech for disillusioned superheroes. It's so blam in-our-faces it cracked me up. And it wasn't a nice chuckle.There isn't a plot point in the story that couldn't have benefited from more scenes where stuff happens, and less talk.2) Spider-Man should be about Spider-ManI know, I know. The Spidey comic was so great because Peter Parker is a realistic character with ordinary problems and, like, dimensions and stuff. But we didn't buy the comic because we wanted to read about Peter Parker. We bought it because it was about Spider-Man. Peter Parker is an attribute of Spider-Man. He is Spider-Man's secret identity, not the other way around. What made us nerds really like Spidey was that during the day he was this feeble nobody with few friends who Flash could pick on--but we knew that he wasn't really like that at all. He could lift a van over his head and had the wittiest lines in Comic-Verse. That was how he really was.Sam Raimi seems to think that he is honoring the comic by making it about Peter Parker's love stories firstly, and about Spider-Man's struggles against super-evil secondly, but he isn't. He just misunderstands the concept. Peter Parker's life is seasoning. Spidey's battles with villains is the real subject matter.This shines through in the casting as well. As much as I like Toby in most movies, he's not a good Spider-Man. (In the very few scenes when he and not a CGI effect is Spider-Man, I mean.) Parker/Spidey are two radically different characters, as is so often the case. (I mean Kent/Superman? Banner/Hulk?) But Maquire is Peter Parker ALL the time. In the movie, Spidey is just Peter Parker with a Spandex mask over his head, and that is simply wrong.3) Lousy crookI bet you thought Doc Ock was real cool, huh? Yeah, he looked pretty mean and was decently acted. But think about it. What is his motivation? He MUST finish the project at any cost! He MUST make a mini sun on Manhattan, whatever the consequences! Why? Who knows? Whatever, he's just a subplot in the movie about Peter Parker's somewhat predictable love story anyway, right? Compare Doc Ock with Magneto in X-Men. Magneto used to be in a Jewish concentration camp in Germany. Non-mutants are trying to force all mutants to register with the authorities. He's starting to recognize the old pattern. Add some pathological megalomania to the mix and the result is inevitable. He overreacts, and goes on the war path against humanity. Meanwhile, Doc Ock MUST make his little sun, and nothing will stop him! Jeez, Magneto is a Shakespearian character in comparison. (And that has nothing to do with that McKellen has played Richard III on the big screen.) The script writers didn't care very much about the Doctor Octopus plot because Spider-Man is a sensitive story about a young man with relationship problems, doubts about his future, and such uncertainties as young men are wont to have. Ptooey to that! Bring in the doomsday machines!What about the good stuff?There is some. J.K Simmons as J. Jona Jameson is absolutely wonderful. Every scene he is in is pure pleasure. His lines are okay but his delivery is perfect. Jameson is an important character in Spidey's life. The movie also has its moments when the drama works. Most of the time it drowns in exposition or never lifts off because of poorly established motivations, but there are exceptions. When M.J sees Peter as Spidey near the end is one such exception. The earlier train scene also works action-wise, and is more or less the only one that really does. Dunst is good, although under-utilized throughout.And the intro credits are some of the coolest I have ever seen. I wonder who the artist is?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The worst is X-Men 3. That movie is god awful.Anyway, on to this film. There are so many flaws it's hard to like any portion of this movie. I haven't seen it since it came out in 2004 but I remember hating it, especially Doctor Octopus. He is one of the worst villains ever especially because he isn't much of a villain. Another thing I hate is that he never shows any signs of being in a battle after being trashed around some. He has robotic tentacles, not super human healing, which makes me hate the fight scenes. Then he sacrifices himself because he wants to be good again or whatever but that, too, is completely stupid. I've only seen it work with Godzilla and Darth Vader and they really failed at it with this film. That's just Doctor Octopus.Spider-Man was super emo in this and completely stupid. I hated how he fell down like five flights of fire escape stairs only to say, "Ouch, my back." If someone falls down five flights of stairs and hits every single one, more is going to hurt than just his back.I honestly wish this movie would stop existing but it won't happen. I can't understand any of the love it gets. The main reason that the first Spider-Man was good was because of the Green Goblin. Without him, it really shows just how awful Tobey McGuire is as Spider-Man. Plus, no one could act worth crap in this film and everything felt forced.So, yeah, that's my review of the second worst superhero movie I've ever seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed "Spider-Man 2" very much. It had lovely special effects and interesting characters. However, I also felt annoyed about one major aspect of the film. Tobey Maguire's version of Peter Parker was just too darn stupid and annoying. Throughout much of the film, Parker has horrible problems balancing his life as Spider-Man and Peter--and did a horrible job as both. In fact, his ineptitude really made me cringe. Can anyone be THAT klutzy, nerdy and dumb? It tried to make him endearingly inept--but I wanted my superhero to be less of a knucklehead and less pathetic. Peter, unfortunately, was often just pathetic. So, when the movie introduced a great villain, eye-popping stunts of Spider-Man appearing to really fly through the streets of New York and a very spunky and likable Aunt May, you still couldn't help feeling that Peter needed to stop whining and be a man! Too bad, as otherwise this was a likable film and an amiable follow-up to the first Spider-Man film.Also, what's with that scene with the annoying woman on the street singing the Spider-Man song in the most god-awful rendition in movie history! Homer Simpson's "Spider-Pig" song would have been far more fitting than this tuneless moment.</fullReview>
