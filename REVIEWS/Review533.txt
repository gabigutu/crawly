		<shortDescription>CITIZEN KANE may let some people down, but it's still worth seeing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a difficult undertaking for someone of my generation to watch a film like CITIZEN KANE. Not because it's "too old" or "too boring", but because it has been hailed--almost universally--as the single best motion picture ever made. And while the anticipation of seeing a film with such overwhelming acclaim may be quite exhilarating, actually watching it is ultimately an intimidating and somewhat disappointing experience.This isn't to say that I thought CITIZEN KANE was a bad film; in fact, I thought everything about it was downright brilliant. From the enchanting performances right down to the meticulously planned camera movements and clever lighting tricks, there isn't a single element of CITIZEN KANE that isn't a stunning achievement in all areas of filmmaking.CITIZEN KANE's storyline is deceptively simple. Even though the plot unfolds by jumping in and out of nonlinear flashbacks, it is surprisingly easy to keep track of. The straightforwardness and relatively fast pace of the story are what make it seem intimidating. Because everything moves smoothly along without any standstill, it feels like we are being fooled-like there is something much greater that we just can't seem to grasp. As a first-time viewer, I knew from its reputation that there must be *something* that separates this movie from all the others; something buried within its simple plotline that everybody else has seen, but that I just could not seem to get a handle on. And then, during those final frames, that something was revealed, and it all began to make sense. To me, it was these moments of confusion and uncertainty followed by a sense of enlightenment and appreciation that made watching CITIZEN KANE such a meaningful experience.But no matter how great of a movie CITIZEN KANE really is, it can never live up to one's expectations. Although I do feel that it is deserving of its acclamation, the constant exposure to its six decades worth of hype and praise will invariably set most modern viewers' standards at a height that is virtually unreachable--even if it really *is* the best movie of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK look, let me settle something between those who love and hate this film. A lot of people hail this film because it is technically brilliant and ground breaking. Director Orson Welles did a lot of things visually that no one had ever done before. Nearly every film maker was in some way influenced by this movie. This movie also had a great impact in its time. The title character was based on media giant William Randolph Hearst. He was that generations Donald Trump. He opposed this film so much he did everything in its power to stop its release and almost succeeded. Lastly this film contains some of the strongest and most common themes in literature; Life versus death. It is for these reasons why this film is so revered.On the contrary people who hate this film mainly complain that it is boring. Which is a legitimate complaint. The story is slow compared to today's standards, and there is no real Hearst character alive today in which to relate. So yes, the story on the surface is outdated. However, this does not make it a bad movie. It was not made as a Matrix/Star Wars type of movie which can be enjoyed even at surface level. This is not pure entertainment. Remember there is more to film than storytelling. This film was designed to be cinematically beautiful and to tell a basic story of love and redemption. There is much more to the story than the thinly veiled attack on Hearst, one just needs to look deeper. Look at Shakespeare or Hawthorne for example, their literary works are universally loved. Yet, many people blow them off because they refuse to look past the outdated language into the beautiful prose and simple ubiquitous themes. Just because something is outdated does not mean it lacks worth in today's world.My advice to those who did not like it the first time or have not seen it yet is simple. Watch it again for what it is. Do not expect to be on the edge of your seat for two hours. Watch it for the cinematography that alone makes this film among the best (I don't agree with AFI's number one ranking but I think it still ranks high). Look deeper into the story and try to connect with it on some level. At the very least appreciate how influential this film was and where the industry would be without it. If you can do this, then maybe some of the naysayers will change their minds. Again, you do not have to love Citizen Kane, but at least respect it for what it is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What do you say about a movie more analysed than is enjoyed, more envied and despised than any other piece of cinema: well documented for its perceived portrayal of William Randolph Hearst, and his efforts to have it destroyed....It has survived and now stands at number one on the AFI's top 100 list, for a movie that didn't even win the Oscar for its year of release.What can you say about the cinematography and direction and acting, that hasn't already been said? The lighting, the camera angles, the new visual techniques and trick photography used for the first time in an American movie to great effect. Special mention has to go to the acting of a 25 year old Orson Welles, an aspect the least highlighted.The grand-daddy of the American Soap Opera, it tells the life of Charles Foster Kane, from his humble beginnings, his mother's giving him up to a wealthy guardian, and his building of a newspaper/radio empire. It sees Kane go from an idealistic journalist to a powerful mogul able to manipulate history through his media empire. Despite all his money and power, Kane is not immune to the hand of destiny, and oh how she slaps Kane the old American way. A married Kane is caught through pure "innocence" with a "singer" and a scandal erupts, costing Kane the state governorship; you can guess the instigator of the scandal-mongering: the incumbent governor.In the first part of the movie, we see a Kane adored by the public and employees but we don't see the reason why his relationship with his wife deteriorated, shown in a powerful film sequence of spouses drifting apart through the years. In the second part we see his relationship with the "singer" whom he took as his second wife, and how he uses her to try and manipulate public opinion of himself, just as he had used the media empire previously. The only problem is that his second wife isn't as competent as the media empire was in gaining respect or adoration; she is just terrible as an opera singer. But Kane wants to prove to the public that the "singer" who he was caught with, was more than "whore" and that he had the power to shape public opinion; she even told kane that she didn't want to be a singer. It is the cruelest thing any man could have done to another human being; manipulated for his own ends. William Randolph Hearst was said to have been less angry about his own portrayal than that of his mistress, Marion Davies.The movie broke new grounds for cinema also, in its story-telling: we see first the death of a recluse Kane in his old age, and then there are flashbacks from newsreels and investigations and interviews of reporters piecing together the life of Charles Foster Kane and his dying word "rosebud".The reporters never found out what his dying word meant, but the audience is shown what it "is". No single word can describe a man's life after all, so what does it mean??? lost childhood innocence and happiness?? This movie bred a bunch of copycats like "The Carpetbaggers" and "Valley of the Dolls", and inspired the great TV soapies like Dallas and Dynasty. Many other movies from different genres have copied and perhpas bettered the camera work and lighting and yet this movie has stood up well through the 60 years from its sheer brilliance and originality.Despite its greatness, Citizen Kane seems to have taken some victims along the way. At age 25, Orson Welles starred, wrote and directed his masterpiece, but because of various reasons, political, envy, hatred, he was never able to match it. The other victim seems to have been Dorothy Comingore as Susan Alexander, mirroring the career of Marilyn Monroe who came after her.A great movie thats stood the test of time. See it for what it is: a fantastic piece of story-telling firstly, only then can you see its greatness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The march of time...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Citizen Kane is majestic, elegant and noble. It begins at the end, we see a man of obvious wealth and power breathe his last, and then the mysteries of his life are unraveled via a series of anecdotes, barely remembered scenes and highly subjective memories. The boldness of this approach cannot be overemphasized. At the time that this film was made Hollywood was for the most part used to creating straight-forward stories with clearly identified heroes and villains. Kane dared to present Man as he is, rife with confusions, internal contradictions and uncertainty.As the film progressed, we see Kane, loosely based on William Randolph Hearst, the famous newspaper tycoon slowly sacrifice his ideals in order to build his financial empire, losing his friendships with those who believed in him until ultimately he looses everything he has, his marriage, his friends, and his integrity. Though he is the richest man in the world he lives his remaining isolated in his privately built mountain estate where he has surrounded himself with material pleasures, alone and despairing, one senses that he welcomes death. The film takes the view that wealth and power are inherently destructive of human values. Kane himself states `If I hadn't been born rich I might have been a really great man.What is so masterful about Kane is its ambiguity. We never are certain if Kane really did believe in the values that he professed. At the same time that he sets himself up as above the world, he longs for the affection of the common people. This is symbolized by his exploitative, and patronizing love for a chorus girl, Susan Alexander (Dorothy Comingore). Her character is given a paper-thin characterization, the only obvious flaw in a nearly perfect movie.Orson Wells gives a bravura performance as Kane, both identifying with and condemning the man. This film was his first venture into movie making after the infamous War of the Worlds radio broadcast that threw America into an uproar. Wells, a child prodigy, had a background in Shakespearian theater, offering modernized adaptations of the Classics, a bold and unusual gesture at the time. He brought that kind of sweeping tragic romantic sensibility to his first film.Unconstrained by Hollywood's traditions, he broke all the rules. The deep focus photography that gives Kane its theatrical look was one of his innovations. A mastery of sound, gained from years of working in the radio was another. Kane is an avalanche of technical innovation, unmatched in any other Hollywood film.Despite the film's pessimistic outlook, it is studded by moments of joy, beauty and emotional truth. The supporting cast of characters, most of them regulars from Wells' Mercury Theater are also superb. Joseph Cotton is memorable as Jed Leland Kane's close friend who believes in him more then he does. And Everet Slone is wonderful as Kane's would be mentor Mr. Bernstien.So many scenes in this movie linger forever in the memory, one is left with a stirring vision of the frailty of the human condition, the film gives us no easy answers and while being fiercely critical of many of it's characters is universal in it's compassion and sympathy, this is perhaps the most vital ingredient for great art.Kane was one of the most controversial films ever made. Hearst, offended by his portrayal, offered RKO a small fortune to destroy the film. When that didn't work his newspapers embarked on a campaign of defamation against Wells, thus proving that the film's criticism of the power and corruption of the press were precisely on target. Wells was never given a free hand to direct how he liked again and American Cinema was deprived of the one of the greatest geniuses to adopt it as a medium of self-expression.It's influence, was immediate, incalculable and mostly unacknowledged, the film was a box office and critical failure due to Hearst's efforts and it was not until years later that this film got the respect it deserved. Nowadays there is not one living film director of serious artistic intent that has not been deeply influenced by Citizen Kane. It's not just a masterpiece it's a creative touchstone.Of course there were other talents at work in making Kane, Hermann Mankiewicz's efforts on the script were indispensable and Bernard Hermann, the composer most famous for working with Hitchcock provided the films beautiful music. Still, the film remains most obviously the work of Orson Wells, a veritable hall of mirrors reflecting the great artist's dreams, obsessions and fears. Citizen Kane is not just one of the great works of cinema it is one of the greatest artistic creations of the century</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Great Cinema Swindle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know why you're reading this. You're smart, you have great taste, a passion for cinema, and you see CK near the top of every 'Great Movie' list ever compiled. So with great anticipation you borrow a DVD copy and sit down for a real treat, and... you can't get through the first half hour. You fall asleep.Surprised, you think, 'It must be me, maybe I'm tired,' so a month later, you try again. But you don't even get as far as before, and wake up drooling out the corner of your mouth as a bloated Orson Welles, with really bad age make-up, groans 'Rosebud, Rosebud'. It doesn't make sense. You're perplexed. You've watched other films on the lists... Casablanca made you stand up and cheer, cry, laugh, feel connected to all humanity. You even adore films on the list that some might consider oblique, like 8 1/2, which you reckon reinvented cinema language, weaving in and out of memory, dreams, psyche, reality, putting the human spirit up on the screen, making you cheer, laugh, and feel connected to all humanity. So why does CK leave you so cold? You wonder, 'What's wrong with me? Am I stupid or something?'Your borrowed DVD copy gathers dust (notice how the lender never asks for it back?), taunting your unquiet mind: "You must watch me: I'm the greatest film of all time!" But you shudder at the thought. Life's too short and, after all, there's more engaging things to do - like scraping plaque off the dog's teeth.Years pass. Finally, you can take it no longer. You think, 'To be a serious film lover I MUST watch Citizen Kane! Maybe I was too immature before - yes, that must be it!' So you gird your loins and sit - awake! - through the whole thing. The whole turgid, ponderous, dull, vacuous, plodding, dank catastrophe. It's even worse than you feared. An emotionally and intellectually empty story. Your average six year old can invent a more complex, engaging tale.Genuinely puzzled, you ask people who name it as one of the greatest films of all time why they like it, and with barely concealed superiority that phoneys are wont to adopt, they wax lyrical talk about the haunting mystery of the final words, "Rosebud, rosebud". You notice there's no feeling behind what they say. They also talk a great deal about Gregg Toland's cinematography, with liberal references to "deep focus", and you appreciate this, you really do, the cinematography was damned fine, best thing about the movie. That shot which started outside the window then tracked back into the room was really cool. But you just don't believe a movie is made great by cinematography alone. In all your inquiries, you never once hear the following phrase, spoken from the heart: "God, I love that film".So here you find yourself, reading IMDb comments.Well, let me tell you this: There's Nothing Wrong With You! You Are Right! It's Overrated Flashy Unintelligent Rubbish!One day, perhaps (one can but dream), the coolest, greatest, most admired film being in the world will point out the bleeding obvious nakedness of this bloated Emperor, and the assorted film critics, film studies teachers, and others who need to be told what to think by an authority figure, shall squirm, and CK shall drop off the lists once and for all. Until that great day, don't be afraid to speak the truth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>why did Citizen Kane create such an impact upon its first release?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well as a media student myself , i have come across this question many times in books and during lectures. There are simply 3 reasons the film, which was considered as the "Mona Lisa of all films" , created such a legendary appeal upon release in 1941: 1) This was Orson Welles first cinematic debut , even though he had been a huge star in theater , he was given an opportunity few first time directors were permitted to having. He had full artistic freedom and above all power, to direct , produce, write and even star in his own picture. Therefore the film industry and RKO pictures had absolutely no influence in the making of the film and were not to know what was happening on set .Of course this was bound to generate a number of problems as businessmen were curious about the nature and plot of the film , which takes us to the second reason the film caused controversy.2)One of the main reasons the film posed contentions was because the main character , Charles Foster Kane(Orson Welles), featured a range of similarities with real media mogul and newspaper journalist William Randolph Hurst . Therefore the film was seen as depicting the life , problems and personal relationships of a real person thus fictionalizing his life. Some of the similarities between the two persona's are:KANE: newspaper tycoon , worked for New York Inquirer , known as the Kubla Khan of Xanadu ,married talentless singer Susan Alexander Kane, he was a political aspirant to presidency by campaigning for governor, bought his wife the Municipal Opera House, Financier Thatcher, and threat Getty's. Hurst: yellow journalist , worked for New York Journal, political aspirant to presidency by becoming governor, married acress Marion Davies, bought his wife Cosmopolitan Pictures, financier JP Morgan , and threat Tammany Hall.-differences: Susan Alexander Kane( Dorothy Comingdore) leaves Kane later in their life however there was no marriage breakdown for Hurst and Marion.3) The last reason and most pivotal of all to why the film was regarded the way it was , was due to its technical and stylistic innovations . The film upon its release was misunderstood and unappreciated by critics as they couldn't comprehend many of its elements and were too concerned with its dark and mysterious nature which is one of Welles's characteristics in his films. The film after all was 20 years ahead of its time and was only regarded as a triumphant success upon its second release after the American Film Noir era in the 1950's. His most prominent artistic inventions were: -the low angled camera movements -extreme facial closeups -long uninterrupted shots -chiaroscuro lighting -overlapping dialogue , giving a realistic effect to conversations -subjective camera angles -deep focus shots and depth of field -flashbacks that make up most of the film All the above and more constitute to why the film is so influential to all would be film directors and for why many people regard it as the best film of all time. Lastly we musnt forget the exceptional score by Bernard Herrmann who had collaborated also with the best known director of all time, Alfred Hitchcock , and made him the chillin sounds of strings in Psycho and Vertigo to name a few . In addition the superb photography of Gregg Toland in regards to Welles's unique eye on details. After all he wanted to put in each shot everything the human eye can see if they were present.There are many areas of the film which are crucial , these are some of the most important , and as you can see there is never too little or too much that you can add to this masterpiece .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>tough sledding</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have an observation concerning Rosebud (and I don't mean that story about Marion Davies). Everyone seems to assume that Kane saying "Rosebud" means he was thinking of the one time in his life when he was totally happy and had what he wanted. For years I have also assumed that. The other day something occurred to me and I am curious to know if it has occurred to anyone else.When Kane first meets Susan Alexander he says he is on his way to (or coming from? I don't recall which) a warehouse where his childhood belongings are stored which he has not seen in many years. He doesn't mention the sled, but presumably that is the one thing which drew him to the warehouse. Kane is splashed and Susan laughs at him and one things leads to another. But my point is this: Kane would never have met Susan but for Rosebud. If Kane never met Susan he would never have been caught in the "love nest" with her and lost the election for governor. Kane might have had another mistress, but this seems unlikely. Kane is not very interested in sex - perhaps because he feels he is making love to the whole world. His interest in Susan is primarily idealized and not physical. So but for the meeting Susan, Kane would likely not have had a scandal and would have been elected governor. We are told he would then have almost certainly been elected President. Also he would not have lost his wife and his son would not have been killed in the car accident. As President, Kane could have been the most powerful man in the world. Instead he loses this chance, loses his wife and loses his son - all because he happened to be on a certain street at a certain moment. And the reason he was on that street at that moment was Rosebud!So maybe when Kane says "Rosebud" he is not thinking of when he was a carefree lad playing in the snow. Maybe he realizes that because of Rosebud his whole life went spinning in a completely different direction from what it otherwise would have taken. By pure accident Rosebud ruined his life and shut him off forever from everything he otherwise could have been and could have accomplished. And maybe that is why "Rosebud" is the last word he speaks.But if this is true (and it seems quite logical to me) then why does no one else comment upon it? Why has no one spotted it? Or has someone I just don't know it? Or could it be that this is the kind of truth that no one wants to face? That all of our lives are determined more by blind, idiot accident than by design or purpose.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great piece of cinema, a magnificent example of storytelling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've heard so much told about Citizen Kane and Orson Welles, so I finally decided to get the film, and find out if it really is all that it's cracked up to be... I must say, it's great. The plot is great, and the way it's told is amazing. The story is first summed up in a matter of minutes, about 15, to be more accurate, and then the rest of the film has characters telling the story through flashbacks and retelling. We hear just about every opinion about Charles Foster Kane, apart from his own. The story is told after his death, and we see everything important that leads up to it, and only in the very end do we understand him, only then do we fully understand who he was, and what made him so. The ending also reveals one of the very most important things in any man or woman... one thing that everyone needs and knows of. I won't reveal it here, as it would almost be a crime to spoil the experience of this film to anyone. The acting is excellent; Welles himself is stellar as Kane, and his impressive appearance, along with his commanding voice, makes the character a forceful sight, nay, experience. The characters are well-written and credible. The character of Kane is probably the most well-rounded and perfectly built up I've seen in a movie, ever. The cinematography is excellent... the editing is great. I can't praise the angles, pans, zooms and transitions enough... it just has to be experienced. Now, for the one thing I can criticize in the film; the pacing. It's only two hours long, but it feels like much, much more. There were portions of the film where it felt like it didn't move at all. When there weren't great dialog or something equally as good in the film, it dragged terribly. There were too many scenes where the dialog seemed pointless, as well, I think. It didn't seem to be leading to anything. However, this criticism is so minor, due to the ending more than making up for it, that I still give this film a perfect score. I can't do anything but agree with its placing at the top of the top #250 films of all time, here on IMDb. As I'm writing this, it's #11. That's pretty much what it deserves, in my opinion. Not higher, not lower. Not the greatest film of all time(that pretty much still belongs to The Godfather, I think... at least, I haven't seen a better film than that, yet), but definitely far up there. I recommend this to any fan of film in general, and anyone who thinks they can understand it; it has a truly profound point that any man(and woman) should know of(preferably through seeing the film for themselves). Don't let the fact that it's old and black &amp; white deter you from seeing this masterpiece. A true cinematic masterpiece, in every sense of the word. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most important movie ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kane "Citizen Kane" (1941) was Orson Welles' film debut, and in it he created an enduring masterpiece that is considered by many to be the greatest movie ever made.Story: Shortly after "Citizen Kane" opens, we see aged newspaper tycoon Charles Foster Kane (Welles) softly drawl the word "Rosebud" and die. Sensing that there's a story behind Kane's dying word, a magazine editor shows a reporter a newsreel obituary that chronicles how Kane created a business empire, married a U.S. President's niece, ran unsuccessfully for Governor of New York, divorced his first wife and married a second, collected art, built a fabulous estate called Xanadu, and divorced his second wife. The reporter is then assigned the task of ferreting out the significance of "Rosebud." As the reporter's investigation progresses, fascinating details about Kane emerge.My opinion: Citizen kane is maybe for a lot of people (myselve not included) not a real entertaining movie, But there is no doubt about it that aws one of the most important movies ever made.The visual style of "Citizen Kane" looks stunningly fresh and inventive even today, and the unconventional narrative structure of the Oscar-winning screenplay still seems daring. Welles' portrayal of a character who gradually ages from 25 to old age is unexcelled, and the movie's supporting cast, most of whom had worked previously with Welles on stage and radio productions, is superb. In short, everything came together in "Citizen Kane" to make it one of the greatest character studies ever captured on film.Citizen kane is also one of my favorites and is listed in my top 5 of all time: 9.5 / 10 Masterpiece !!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>an example of a unique and well done movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie Citizen Kane was loosely based on the life of William Randolph Hearst. The movie begins with the death of Charles Foster Kane, who was the editor of the New York Journal. He says the name rosebud and drops a crystal ball, which falls to the ground a shatters. News clips are shown about the different occurrences in Kane's life depicting how Kane acquired his fortune. Throughout the whole movie reporters are trying to figure out what the word rosebud meant and why it was the last word he said before he died. The reporters find people who knew Kane throughout his life trying to get information from them that would put some sense to Kane saying `rosebud' as his last word. Many of the stories told by the people interviewed show the audience a lot about his life through flashbacks. One of the opening scenes is that of Kane's mansion called Xanadu. It has a sign that says `no trespassing' that is hung from the outside gate. The shot is very dark and gloomy, hinting that maybe Kane's life was the same way. He was a very power-hungry man that went from being at the top to rock bottom. Many other movies have definitely taken note to style and effects of this movie. The camera work, lighting, acting a music contributed to making Citizen Kane one of the best American movies of all time. Orson Welles deserves all the credit that he receives from this movie. He was the leading character, producer and director; basically a one man show that still many of us appreciate. I thought that this movie was well done. It had so much symbolism that made the movie unique, although if you didn't know what was symbolic during the different scenes it would be hard to follow, but most of the symbolism is easily recognized. One of the best symbolic scenes that also foreshadows is when Kane is at the top of the stairs and he is told that he lost his position and as he walks down the stairs the camera is shooting from at the top and it looks like a spiral showing that Kane's life and career are out of control. Citizen Kane was very dramatic and all who took part in the movie played their roles well. The characters seemed very real and believable making this movie very memorable. This film has features that every movie should try to incorporate; symbolism, great actors, interesting storyline, excellent camera shots, lighting and sound techniques. I think everyone should see this movie at least once in their life time because it is one of the greatest American movies of all time.</fullReview>

I want to see the last ten minutes of the film and be awed and amazed as I realize that Rosebud is something extraordinary. I want to recognize Mr. Wells' genius, daring, and inventivness. I want to feel the passion, emptiness, and all the other powerful emotions that the actors and "unique" cinematography portray in this movie.I have not been able to make it yet. This is the single most boring hard to watch movie that I have ever tried to watch. I can usually watch about any movie at least once, but not this one.I don't need exciting special effects, car chases, shoot outs, or sex scenes to keep me interested. I just need the movie to be interesting. This film is not interesting to me. I love history and I watch many older movies and I appreciate most of them for what they are, and in the time frame that they were made. But this one is just very hard to watch. If you have to have a college professor,(who himself has had to read a book about it to understand it) explain a movie to you so that you can appreciate it, then I'm sorry folks but then it just "ain't good".I have enjoyed thousands of movies, and I have disliked many also, but very few have I never been able to finish watching and this is one of them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Citizen Kane" was a dazzling movie debut for Welles, a twenty-four-year-old infant terrible whose brilliant work for stage and radio had already made him famous? RKO had given him carte blanche, and with the collaboration of writer Herman Mankiewicz and photographer Gregg Toland, he had produced a masterpiece? "Citizen Kane" is the story of Charles Foster Kane, a rich young man who decides to build a newspaper empire and in doing so sacrifices his professed high ideals on the altar of yellow journalism? His personal, political ambitions are ruined when his extramarital liaison with a young singer becomes public knowledge and his efforts to make her an international opera star bring him nothing but ridicule? Having alienated his friends and wives and lost a good part of his fortune, Kane spends his last years alone in the enormous art-filled palace he has had created in Florida?Told primarily in flashbacks, the film begins with Kane's death: after dropping a paperweight that simulates a snowfall when it is turned upside down, the old man whispers a single word, "Rosebud," and dies? Immediately a strident Mach-of-Time newsreel begins, reviewing the highlights of Kane's career as the camera had recorded them over the years? It is, however, an unsatisfactory record of a man's life, and a group of journalists decide to probe deeper in an attempt to discover the truth about Kane? Perhaps, they speculate, the word "Rosebud" offers a clue... Then ensues a series of interviews with the key people in Kane's life, each of whom relates the man's story as he or she knew it... The portrait that eventually emerges is one of a grasping, vain, selfish, and ambitious man... "He never gave you anything," an old friend recalls bitterly, "he just left you a tip." In the film's final moments, workmen in Kane's palace are seen destroying unwanted junk? One of the items they toss into the furnace is a child's sled; as it burns, the word "Rosebud" can be seen painted on it?The story of Charles Foster Kane is engrossing but not particularly profound? The movie is a superb piece of film-making, nonetheless, because the techniques employed, although not necessarily new, had never before been used together to such startling effect? Welles and Toland made brilliant use of deep-focus photography and of an arsenal of lighting effects? In the course of the film, flashbulbs pop, spotlights play, the sun's rays pour down into darkened rooms, beams of light are emitted by a movie projector, lightning flashes, and smoke, fog shadows, rain, and snow all contribute to the almost tangible atmosphere? Quick, dramatic cuts occur throughout? In one famous sequence, Welles employs six fast scenes to portray the disintegration of Kane's first marriage: each shot shows Kane and his wife at the breakfast table, but in each they are clearly more estranged until, in the final shot, they sit in silence as she reads a rival newspaper?Toland's constantly moving camera is somewhat obtrusive, but it is nevertheless mesmerizing? In the famous sequence at the opera house?the occasion of the second Mrs. Kane's disastrous debut?the camera shows the anguished vocal coach in the conductor's box and then moves upward to the flies, where one stagehand expresses his critical opinion of the performance by holding his nose? Welles' use of sound, ranging from thunder to a cockatoo's screech, reflects his experience in radio?There had never been a picture like "Citizen Kane." It openly satirized a wealthy and powerful living American, it deliberately antagonized Hollywood's ruling elite, and it bravely ignored conventional cinema technique? Innovative, aggressive, and fascinating, "Citizen Kane" electrified a complacent industry? Welles dominated Kane? He had become, in a single stroke, the most admired, envied, praised and detested man in Hollywood? Unhappily, the movie industry never learned to utilize Welles' quixotic genius, and his career never rescaled the heights it had reached in 1941?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Undoubtedly the greatest American film ever created.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Citizen Kane, the film, is many things. It is a brilliantly crafted series of flashbacks and remembrances. It is an engaging story of a dynamic man in a dynamic world. It is a remarkable statement for the wide range of time periods that it covers. It is a deceptively simple story centering on perhaps the most meaningful word in all of moviedom. Behind all that, Citizen Kane is the American cinema. There is not a major director today who has not been influenced by the genius Orson Welles put forth in his debut masterpiece. The film centers around a group of reporters investigating the origin of the dying newspaper tycoon (loosely based on William Randolph Hearst), Charles Foster Kane's last word: Rosebud. The movie begins with an unforgettable newsreel montage summarizing the man's life.From there on, the viewer is thrown into a gloriously chaotic world of flashbacks upon flashbacks, in which the viewer slowly learns just about everything about Charles Foster Kane's enthralling life. From his trying childhood to his rise to power to the pinnacle of his success to his marital difficulties to his fall from grace, the story of Charles Foster Kane is presented for the viewer in a way that few other movies can offer: magically. Citizen Kane, undeniably, is THE triumph of the American cinema, and one of the greatest films every created.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay. First of all, I DO like many old movies. 12 angry men, Casablanca, Where Eagles Dare, Psycho, The Treasure of Sierra Madre, The Great Dictator, Some Like it Hot and more. They're all brilliant and I enjoyed them throughout.But Citizen Kane...I just can't see what's so great about it. It made no impression on me whatsoever. When it comes to plot, camera-angles, themes, characters, acting and such, it seems like few movies are as praised as this. Still, when I read reviews on other classics, for example Casablanca, it feels like they say many of the same things.I'm not an expert on what makes some films objectively better than others, but if the other classics with most of the other "greatnesses" actually ARE interesting and fun to watch, then Citizen Kane should also be able to entertain as well as just being "great".You can say what you want about movies, but no matter how well they're made, they should also entertain in some way or another to be classified as great. And I'm not one of those guys who only like action movies. An example of a great movie is Requiem for a Dream. It's disturbing, repulsive and scary as h*ll, but I couldn't keep my eyes from it, and it made a brutal impression. Other examples of movies that are deep, makes an impression AND are entertaining could be One flew over the Cuckoos Nest, The Visitor, American Beauty and Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind.But entertainment isn't all. I see that. If Citizen Kane had made an impression it wouldn't fail no matter how uninteresting. Taxi Driver is another movie I bored me through, and don't want to see again, but still I find it good because I couldn't stop thinking about it afterwards. It made an impression. Citizen Kane doesn't do that either.And to all you die-hard-fans who hate me, wants to disgrace me, and finds it horrendous to call a classic "not entertaining" I'll just quote the great Ingmar Bergman: "Citizen Kane is a total bore!" To call me retarded or something like that would be to call one of the greatest directors of all time the same. In addition it's clear that many more agree as well. It's not long since the feature was in the top 3 on IMDb. Today it's number 29.So all in all, I may not know how to judge objective qualities of movies, but I'm certain that movies that doesn't leave any impression whatsoever AND isn't entertaining at all aren't great no matter what. And that's why "the greatest movie ever made" fails for me. 3/10</fullReview>

The first time I tried to watch it, I got a few minutes and hated it; I couldn't make myself care. I tried again, because it's a "classic" made by a "genius", and I sincerely wanted to understand how it could possibly be voted higher than Casablanca.It is boring and noisy and the makeup is horrible. I will never understand why this movie was voted #1. I wouldn't even put it in the top 100.It has failed in every way a film can fail. I don't care about the protagonist. I find it cliché, obnoxious and dull. Perhaps in its day it was fresh, but it doesn't stand the test of time the way Casablanca does.I don't care what anyone else says about this movie; in my opinion, it is the worst thing a movie can be: boring.

		<shortDescription>Citizen Welles</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Citizen Kane is probably the best that American Cinema has ever offered, nigh perfect from the start till the end. Often competing with The Godfather, to be numero uno, Citizen Kane is in a league of its own and nonpareil on countless number of fronts. The creative innovation and the technical advancements implemented, can be least regarded as incredible and astonishing, for a 1941 movie. The movie pioneered the phenomena of time switching and special effects in the world of cinema.Citizen Kane has stood the test of time for well over six decades, serving as a benchmark and source of inspiration to the film-makers of different era. Citizen Kane is an obituary about a fictitious Charles Foster Kane, a business magnate and a newspaper tycoon. Through this movie, Orson Welles, not only immortalized Charles Foster Kane but also proved his mettle, as a writer, director, actor and most importantly as an auteur. The scenes presented as flashbacks, not only display his versatility as an actor (taking care of the nuances and the subtleties needed to portray the different stages and aspects of Kane's life), but also his story-telling brilliance. Kane's murmuring of the word 'rosebud' at the time of his death and him publicly annihilating his election opponent, Jim Getys, represent the two extremes of human life, the very low and the very high, respectively.The scenes between Welles and Joseph Cotton are an absolute treat to watch, the latter being at his sarcastic best, depicting contrasting emotions of sympathy and disgust towards his childhood friend, owing to the dichotomy that he suffered, simultaneously taking care of his duties as a journalist, and his friendship with Kane. The movie is studded with numerous mesmerizing and unforgettable scenes and moments, which immensely contribute to the apotheosis that it so deservedly enjoys. A true cinematic magnum opus, without an iota of a doubt and a must for every cinema lover.</fullReview>

But when it came to this movie, which was praised by critics, I was asleep because Orson Welles let me down with his acting. Also, the movie didn't know when to stop, and for some reason just seemed to go on and on and on and on, not to mention how pointless the ending was. Number one film of all time nothing. The Godfather, The Shawshank Redemption, Casablanca, Star Wars Episode V, all exceed this film, in every single way possible.

		<shortDescription>One of the great films, if not "the" greatest.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>MINOR SPOILER IN SECOND PARAGRAPH."Citizen Kane" is, without a doubt, one of the greatest American films ever made. Orson Welles was basically handed the keys to the city - he had everything he wanted and complete control over budget, actors, script, and more.He plays Charles Foster Kane, who dies at the beginning of the film while uttering the immortal words "Rosebud." So the film starts off by searching for what "rosebud" really means. We see countless relations of Kane interviewed. None of them know what "rosebud" really means. But as the film goes on we see glimpses of Kane's life, and eventually the mystery unfolds itself.Like Akira Kurosawa's "Ikiru," "Citizen Kane" is a glance at a man's life and what has driven him to bitterness. Kurosawa claims he never saw "Citizen Kane" before making his film, but nevertheless they form a nice back-to-back viewing."Citizen Kane" has, perhaps, some of the best makeup ever seen on film. A twenty-four-year-old Orson Welles is easily disguised as a sixty-something, overweight man. (And this was before he actually WAS overweight later in his life.) I recently bought the Special Edition DVD with a commentary by Roger Ebert, who said in his commentary that there are probably more special effects in "Citizen Kane" than in the "Star Wars" films.Though subtle, I have to agree that there truly are many special effects used in the film. They're so flawless it's hard to even notice.Another thing Ebert pointed out is how low the ceilings are, which creates a feeling of paranoia. All these things work on a subconscious level that you don't really pick up on the first time.And if you want symbolism, this film is for you. As Kane hands over his empire in one scene, he walks over to a window, which to the naked eye looks normal-sized. But as Kane nears the window, guess what? Turns out the window is very, very high. It makes Kane look small. Think about it. He's handing over his empire and growing smaller in his wealth. It's all very symbolic.I recommend picking up the DVD; it also contains a two-hour documentary called "The Battle Over Citizen Kane," plus many, many more tidbits, including the original theatrical trailer (which is very odd and original).All in all, "Citizen Kane" is a classic of epic proportions. One of the very greatest American films out there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Childhood Ultimately makes the Determination</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>More movie review lists have awarded "Citizen Kane" the honor of being the best film ever made than any other film whatsoever..Deservedly so!! Why?... The superb character portrayals... Charles Foster Kane (based on William Randolph Hearst) was a character which sparked a lot of controversy in the movie industry back in 1941!! This film did not even win best picture that year, that award was given to "How Green was My Valley". Reluctance to allow a film like "Citizen Kane" to be released, evoked a formidable indication that people had a perception of the silver screen as the purveyor of the stilted panacea which provided glossy entertainment for the movie audience!! The ugly depiction of abhorrent human nature that "Citizen Kane" so succinctly illustrated, left a scar on the manufactured illusions of movies during this era!! So many film's entertainment agenda during the '30's and '40's were fortified by high budget fantasy!! These illusions orchestrated a premise of escapism that the moviegoers grew accustomed to!! (Wizard of Oz is a stellar example)...Nevertheless, "Citizen Kane" hit the big screen, and from there, received unprecedented critical acclaim!!What was the attraction?.... Charles Foster Kane was a neglected and irascible man who concocted a myriad of avoidable vulnerabilities in his life. His childhood became a pitfall of doom and despair which left an indelible mark on him!! His empathy for the working class people inevitably translated to his perception of them as chattel, and that he must be the ameliorated recipient of their gratitude!! His fame and fortune was predicated on the idea that the banal proletariat be relegated to the pathetic plight of a marketable commodity!! So many concepts were avant-gard in this movie, this is why they were widely unacceptable!! Concepts such as: The life of a corporate mogul being the culprit to making Charles Foster Kane fall prey to vanity and social entitlement!! He became a victim of megalomania, this was his ultimate downfall!! The dark human emotions and vindictiveness of politicians seeking election and/or re-election manifested themselves through very authentic reactions from the characters in this film!! The perennial egocentric demeanor which afflicted Charles Foster Kane throughout the entire movie, signified a pejorative compassion which was totally self centered!!!The character portrayal of Charles Foster Kane by Orson Wells was outstanding..Genuine feelings that were related to selfishness and avarice in this movie simply astounded me!! People have to consider the year this movie was made (1941) to fully appreciate the ideas which were thrown out at the movie audience!! No matter how reprehensible Charles Foster Kane was, he was also NEWS!!! This will always be the way of the world!! This newspaper king wound up being utterly thwarted by a form of convoluted justice!!! Leaving a largess of artwork behind, merely pointed out to everyone that his priorities purported a horrid arrogance!! The onus was on the movie audience to get acquainted with the despicable aspects of negative emotional qualities that Charles Foster Kane masqueraded around like coveted trophies!! Ultimately, his childhood put a lethal spin on his adverse reactions to everything, and played a significant role in this movie!! I strongly recommend to anyone who is interested in movies, that they see this film!! "Godfather" "Shawshank Redemption" "Lord of the Rings" (Fellowship of the Ring) and "Gold Rush" have all been selected as the greatest movie ever made by one critic's list or another, but, not nearly as often as "Citizen Kane" though!!! "Citizen Kane" is an absolutely remarkable movie!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More to Citizen Kane than meets the eye...yet more direct than the modern crap covering screens</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Citizen Kane was one of the first movies to portray the American Dream as anything less than attractive. As a child, Kane is fully happy as he plays in the snow outside the family's home, even though his parents own a boarding house and are quite poor. He has no playmates but is content to be alone because peace and security are just inside the house's walls. When Thatcher removes Kane from this place, he's given what seems like the American dreamâ?'financial affluence and material luxury. To most this would seem to be a piece of Heaven blessing them with good fortune for a happy life. However, Kane finds that those things don't make him pleased, and the exchange of emotional security for financial security is ultimately unfulfilling. The American dream is an empty, hollow shell for Kane. As an adult, Kane uses his money and power not to build his own happiness but to either buy love or make others as miserable as he is. When one watches the movie it seems that his purchasing of the newspaper was a fun venture. But if you look closer into the reality of the film, the newspaper was simply a means of touching thousands of people, and ultimately gaining their affection. Kane's wealth isolates him from others throughout the years, and his life ends in loneliness at Xanadu. He dies surrounded only by his possessions, poor substitutions for true companions. His last word is "Rosebud." Child hood and that which he missed out on. "I could have been great man without all of this money."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All That Ballyhoo!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On the Criterion Collection DVD of Orson Welles' classic "Citizen Kane" there is an original theatrical trailer where Welles cleverly advertises the film by introducing us to the cast including the chorus girls, whom he refers to as some nice ballyhoo. That pretty much sums up my opinion of the often over analyzed film that always shows up at the top of the list of greatest films ever made. Even though this was the first time I sat down to watch the film as a whole, I knew everything about it from studying it in film class and from the countless number of essays, homages, and parodies that have come down the pike over the years. It seems impossible now to judge the film against a blank slate, but with great ballyhoo comes great scrutiny.Released in 1941 by RKO as a Mercury Theater Production, "Citizen Kane" is the tale of an influential and shockingly wealthy newspaper tycoon (Welles) inspired by the life of William Randolph Hearst. The story follows the investigation into the origins of "Rosebud"-the mysterious word Kane utters on his deathbed. Following newsreel footage announcing Kane's death, we are then thrust into a series of flashbacks through interviews with various people who knew Kane that reveal the nature of his character.From a technical standpoint, Welles' film is as innovative and engrossing today as it was yesterday. Every single piece of cinematic trickery, every dissolve, every long tracking shot, every seamless edit, every play with chronology, every special effect is perfect. Welles was audacious and inventive with his art, and it is for these technical aspects that "Citizen Kane" will always stand the test of time.However, the story of "Citizen Kane" remains cold and distant. I didn't instantly connect with the characters and the plot the way I did with other classics from the period like "Casablanca" or "The Third Man" or even more recently, "There Will Be Blood." Often, the supporting players over-act, and the flashbacks are tedious (especially the one detailing Kane's second marriage) or emotionless (like the scene showing Kane's snow covered childhood). There's a certain smug arrogance to the whole production that makes it seem like perhaps Welles was secretly making a comedy. It leaves one wondering how it would've come across had Welles actually been allowed to do a straight up biopic of Hearst.Is it any wonder that so many critics today hail this as THE all time great? Much of today's cinema is geared towards style and technique over substance, and way back in 1941, Welles was the first to author this very modern brand of cinema where the art is not in the story but how it is told and shown to the audience. His "Citizen Kane" is technically rich, layered, and enthralling but narratively vapid. Did I ever really care about Kane or Rosebud? No, but it was fascinating to watch. It's some very nice ballyhoo indeed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A textbook I would have liked to study in school...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Orson Welles' CITIZEN KANE (1941)was perhaps the first American film since the silent era to fully demonstrate the possibilities of the film medium, and the role of the camera. Welles' camera is mobile, no longer the static device used to merely show faces, and Toland's deep-focus cinematography revolutionary. Welles tinkers with traditional filmic narrative conventions to craft a work that is now often termed a 'textbook' of the cinema.Welles himself plays Kane in a remarkable acting performance that requires him to age progressively (which Welles does very convincingly) over the decades. Welles draws significant parallels between Kane and media mogul William Hearst in a statement that probes wealth, power figures and what we perceive as 'truth'.Kane is presented to the audience as an enigma- we never do get a full-bodied portrait of the man, only snippets of highly subjective memories from those who say they "knew him". In the newsreel, a montage of images that details Kane's life and eventual decline, a variety of viewpoints are established. He could be both a Fascist and a Communist- a megalomaniac manipulating power to his advantage or, indeed, being manipulated himself. It is ironic that the true meaning of 'Rosebud' is never discovered by the on-screen reporters, just as the true essence of the man Kane is never fully revealed to the audience. What is Kane searching for? Is it the untouched youth and innocence symbolized in 'Rosebud', or something he himself is not aware of? Kane is never truly sympathetic, yet he is wholly fascinating. He seems to lament the status and power that wealth has given him ("If I hadn't been very rich than I may have been a very great man"), then buys another load of cold statues and ornaments. His cruel treatment of second wife Susan Alexander in his insistence that she train as an opera singer suggest his unwavering persistence, and unwillingness to accept defeat. Kane is willing to stand alone ("I am Charles Foster Kane!") yet seems to crave a filler to his loneliness ("I know too many people. I guess we're both lonely"). Kane is ultimately indefinable; a jigsaw puzzle that both Susan and the audience struggle to piece together into anything whole or real.Welles used actors from his Mercury Theatre to populate this story of greed, corruption and vanity. Friend and close confidant Joseph Cotten becomes friend and observer Jebediah, who is a witness to Kane's slide into moral decay. Dorothy Cormingmore portrays Susan Alexander, a thinly veiled take on Hearst's real-life mistress Marion Davies. She possesses a similar honking Bronx whine and limited talent in her master's chosen area of success (For Davies this was dramatic roles in films; her talent lay in comedy). Distinguished actors Moorehead, Sanford and Sloane also feature in support.One aspect that is perhaps ignored in favor of focusing on the technical innovations is the truly amazing screenplay, one which offers just as many quotable snippets of dialogue as a 'CASABLANCA' or 'ALL ABOUT EVE'. Welles' understanding of the soundtrack is often overlooked. A memorable scene involves a bored Susan Alexander whining to Kane that she "never gets any fun" because they "live in a castle". The visual portrait is fascinating, with Alexander perched on a seat as a princess, complete with tiara in her hair. The echo of her words and Kane's mechanical replies in the huge, yet empty, room speaks volumes for Welles' understanding of the film as a sum of all parts. Here, the sum adds up to perfect- direction, acting, writing, photography and music.The imposing, haunting Xanadu is similar to Hitchcock's Manderlay in REBECCA (filmed the previous year) in that the mansion operates as a both a character and a symbol of the protagonist. Kane's half-finished palace seems to come the closest to suggesting his character- grandiose, larger than life, powerful...yet strangely empty and unfulfilled.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Role of Sheer Chance in Life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One commentator made the original point that Kane may have uttered "Rosebud" as his dying word not because he was nostalgic about his childhood but rather as a symbol of sheer chance in affecting and changing his life. As the commentator pointed out, Kane would never have met Susan Alexander, his mistress and later his second wife, if he hadn't been at a warehouse looking over things from his childhood home. If Kane hadn't met Susan, his life would have turned out quite differently. Indeed, if one looks carefully at the childhood scenes of Kane's life, one would see little that Kane, as an adult, would be nostalgic about. There are strong suggestions his father beat him and that, however caring about Kane's welfare his mother was, she seemed emotionally cold and distant. Indeed, Kane's association of his sled Rosebed with the role of chance in his life would be reinforced by the fact that he was interrupted playing on Rosebud and told by his mother and Mr. Thatcher about the radically different turn his life was taking from that of a poor boy to a quite wealthy one really overnight. Indeed, by subtly showing the decisive role of chance in Kane's life, the filmmakers were undermining the powerful American myth of the self-made man. Hard work didn't make Kane's fortune, it was the result of his mother inheriting the title to a mine thought to be worthless but wasn't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful Cinematography</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If ever there was a film that I had a love-hate relationship with, "Citizen Kane" is surely it. Some of the non-script elements are as good as what one would find in any other film. Yet, the story of Charles Foster Kane (Orson Welles), an early twentieth century newspaper tycoon is terribly dated and painfully boring.The film's B&amp;W cinematography is arguably the best in film history. DP Gregg Toland uses high-contrast lighting and murky shadows to create a wonderfully noir look and feel. And in some scenes bright back-lighting puts foreground characters in stark silhouette, creating an authoritarian and oppressive tone to the story. This is true especially in the film's first thirty minutes. Throughout the film, frame compositions are clever and interesting, like one scene in the second half wherein a woman, with her back to the camera, blares out an operatic aria on stage to an audience that we viewers cannot see, amid murky, shadowy lighting; it's like something from a nightmare.And the film's visuals are laced with strange optical illusions, as a result of Welles' use of deep focus camera techniques. In one scene, for example, background windows appear normal in size relative to characters in the foreground. But when a character walks back to the windows, we see that the windows are actually much larger and higher than first appeared, and that renders the character small, by comparison. The same optical effects show up in the Great Hall of Xanadu, with a fireplace that appears average in size, until a character walks back to it; at which point the fireplace is seen in its true size; it's so big and high as to overwhelm the human figure.Sound effects amplify these optical effects. For example, in the Great Hall, the cavernous, mostly empty, room strongly echoes human sounds, creating the impression of some huge, dark cave. The whole feel is one of oppression and death. Just terrific.But the film's story, about a corpulent newspaper tycoon, is so dated as to be largely irrelevant in the twenty first century. Kane starts out with noble intent to help the lower classes. But over time he changes. And throughout, he is egotistical, overbearing, bombastic, loud, and generally too full of himself. His only real belief is in himself. He is fond of possessions, but is emotionally empty. In addition to an unlikeable protagonist, the script's dialogue is very talky.The film's acting is generally quite good. I particularly liked the performances of Joseph Cotten, Dorothy Comingore, and Agnes Moorehead. Special effects are good too and, when combined with lots of stock footage, create the visual illusion of a cinematic epic.Some viewers love this film; others loathe it. I love the cinematography and sound effects, but loathe the story. "Citizen Kane" should have won several Oscars, including especially cinematography. That it did not has caused Hollywood endless guilt, and to compensate, they routinely vote the film as "the number one greatest film in history".But it does not deserve that lofty title. Hollywood needs to give the film several postmortem, but well deserved, Oscars, especially for B&amp;W cinematography. Then, they need to let go of the guilt.</fullReview>

(That's either `Othello' or `Lady from Shanghai' depending on your religion.)First of all, this is not the work of a genius, but the excellent product of three committed artisans: Welles, Tobin and Mankiewicz.Mankiewicz, with his brother, were the industry's working intellectuals. Here (aided by Houseman), he simply got a client intelligent enough to know what was up. Similarly with Tobin, who was the Sascha Vierny of his day. These two men pulled on Welles, but as we will see, in independent directions.The story, Hearst and all that, is irrelevant except for the notion that a writer in the right place can create reality if willing to pay the price. The acting is fine of course, uncharacteristically abstract -- but that's hardly innovative nor groundshaking. No, what makes this film important are two features, and the failed relationship between them.The first of these is the incredibly complex narrative structure. Things that are normally nested frames: a reminiscent flashback, a text annotated with pictures... are here multiply set up and in turn enfolded into the film proper. We see a newsreel, whose footage later appears in the `real' action; we have a recalled death vision of a childhood but that becomes untenably self-critical; we see her singing and again from her perspective. We have several on-screen narrators but each gets swallowed. There are so many narrative devices at work it keeps us spinning, sledding as each comes into play and is then reabsorbed. The puzzle is assembled several different ways. Nowhere else is such narrative cleverness been even attempted, not by Lynch, Bergman, Wenders, anyone.The other innovation is the breaking of convention with the eye of the camera. The camera takes positions -- physical and philosophical -- that were previously utterly unknown. Previously, the camera was audience supplemented by `context' shots: perspectives that a human observer might not see but that seemed natural. Now, the camera is something unto itself that we have to accommodate. The camera does things no human would or could. It sometimes (often!) sees two things simultaneously, something that never happens with the natural eye. It has a curiosity that we would not have directed. The eye defines the lighting, not the other way around -- here everything is colored not by what it is, but by how the film's eye changes it.Both of these experiments are masterful. They changed the world of films, and hence dreams, and hence all of abstract thinking forever.But the flaw, the lethal problem with this film is that the two experiments have independent lives. They are not coordinated beyond some fairly easy touchpoints and then only in the simplest of ways: an image that is being described by a speaker and the nature of the newsreel. It is as if there were TWO geniuses at work, each doing something important and neither communicating with the other. So when there is a shift or a trick in the narrative, the eye is ignorant of it.But hey, it was just the man's first film. He quickly fixed that in `Othello' and especially `Shanghai.' The merger of eye and narrative is the real revolution. `Kane' raised the question, which is why it is important. Tarkovsky, some Bergman, Malick, Greenaway have subsequently succeeded with this merger using different devices, but the master is Kurosawa. Welles made Kurosawa possible. It all starts here, but only as a promise. In real terms, the film is a failure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was reading the list of the top movies one evening on the AFI, and I saw this movie was #1 American Film. So I decided I would rent it and I saw it today. I was expecting to be blown away and this would be the best movie I would ever see. Well was I in for a surprise.This movie is by far one of the worst films I have ever seen in my life. The worst would have to be Zigfield Follies but this comes pretty close. I do like and enjoy classic films. I don't care if a movie is in B&amp;W either. But this movie is just dated, and I don't see what the hype is about. This movie is just 100% overrated. I am someone who can sit through movies but this one I got bored of.I thought maybe it was because I got interrupted in the beginning of the film, and maybe it would get better later on. Well it just kept dragging. So I got to basically the last 36min of the film and had to just turn it off. So a few hours later I figured I would try to watch it again, but I couldn't even watch 5min. I just went to the last 10min of the movie and was disappointed.All I can say is watch this movie at your own risk, and I hope you enjoy it more then me. Seeing the reviews on here I feel good I am not the only person who didn't enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Love The Cinematography; Story Not That Appealing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hey, make no mistake: this film does deserve lofty status. It is a good film, fantastically photographed.....but the greatest of all time? I question that, but that kind of question - Who's number one? - is impossible to answer. I would think to be number one you would have to have a great technical film, great story, great acting, great camera-work as this has, AND have it generally loved by the public. Then you have a true number one picture of all time. I'm not a fan of "Gone With The Wind," but that was a technical marvel, too, for its day and was universally loved by millions of people....so I can see that being listed number over Citizen Kane. The same goes for Casablanca, Ben-Hur and a number of wonderful films.Anway, concerning this movie, I enjoyed it best for the cinematography. Orson Welles, the "genius" behind this film, was ahead of his time with his inventive camera-work. The acting is good and it's interesting to note that this was Welles' first acting role. Yes, he was an amazing talent, behind or in front of the camera. The story is pretty unlikable and, in this day and age would be too boring for most people under 50, sad to say. However, even older, more "mature" folks find this hard to get through sometimes from what I have read.The unlikable part mainly comes from the lead character, "Charles Foster Kane," played by Welles. He is simply a selfish egomaniac. Other unpleasant parts of the story include several scenes with his second wife, in which she berates him in this shrill hysterical voice; the fact there is very little humor in here and the ending is anything but uplifting. For those who find this a confusing story, I suggest giving it another chance. I found this film better the more chances I gave it. It also looks fabulous on the latest special-edition DVD. In summary, it was a great technical achievement but remember professional critics usually have the same mindset and are afraid to be their own person, so don't feel stupid or inadequate if this film doesn't do it for you. You are hardly alone. But, yet, that camera-work has to be seen and appreciated if you really love movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A case study in projection</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I rented this movie almost accidentally on the route back from shooting pool, without any preconceptions of what it was about, although I was very aware it had been dubbed "the greatest film ever" by many.Basically, the film asks a highly abstract question of whether we can reconstruct a puzzle from a set of available pieces: are the pieces independent or can there be a piece which fundamentally affects the reconstruction? It also presents a very specific example of how this kind of projection applies to human psychology: can there be a single event or item, a "rosebud", such that a man's life cannot be wholly understood without it? We all project our persona every day to our fellow human beings, but no one else really knows what's running in our minds as we lay in bed in the evening: the portions of our minds with no trespassing.I especially like how this theme is shown on so many levels at once. At the bottom, the reporter is trying to reconstruct Kane's life by anecdotal evidence; Kane's readers are trying to reconstruct the world state by Kane's newspaper; and finally, we the viewers are trying to reconstruct the meaning of the film by watching it. The film was based on the media mogul William Randolph Hearst, whose persona the writers first shattered to pieces and then reconstructed to form Charles Foster Kane.An interesting add to the interpretation (forgot the name of the critic behind it) is that the whole movie is imagination, or self-inspection, by Kane himself in seek of his rosebud. In this case, the unseen Thompson could be seen as Kane himself, trying to find his lost childhood innocence from the inner depths of his mind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yet another movie that people pretend to like just to be like sheep and follow everybody else. The story is terrible and boring. I honestly nearly swallowed my tongue and died when i saw this was in the top 30 movies of all time. Some of the movies it is rated above is just ridiculous. People need to start making their own minds up instead of following others. The Dark Knight was a great movie, but come on people, do you really think its the 3rd best movie of all time. Thats another example of people rating it highly based on other peoples views. Its got nothing on The Shawshank Redemption. I wish they could sometimes re-release movies and erase their history, so everyone can have a blank slate and see what it really gets.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"I don't think any word can explain a man's life"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Orson Welles' debut feature 'Citizen Kane' stands as one of the twentieth century's most revered films, and, indeed, the title of "The Greatest Film Of All Time" has often been bestowed upon it, from as early as Sight and Sound's 1962 rankings, when it indefinitely dethroned De Sica's 'Bicycle Thieves (1948).' After two viewings, I can't say that I find it to be the greatest film of all time, but any work with such a label would find it extremely difficult to live up to impossible expectations. Having said that, however, 'Citizen Kane' is nothing short of masterful. In 1939, in an unprecedented studio contract, RKO offered young prodigy Welles, fresh from his success on the stage and the radio, a two-picture contract with full artistic control (a promise that ultimately wasn't kept). Borrowing elements from the lives of tycoons Robert McCormick, Howard Hughes, and Joseph Pulitzer, but especially American newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst, Welles and fellow screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz weaved together the tragic story of Charles Foster Kane, poignantly highlighting the inescapable shortfalls of American Dream.Charlie Kane (Welles) rises from humble beginnings to become one of the most famous and powerful people in America. At a very young age, Kane's mother inherits a gold mine and becomes suddenly wealthy, sending away her son to live with Walter Parks Thatcher (George Coulouris), his mother's banker. Proving something of a disappointment for Mr. Thatcher, Kane shows little aspirations for success until the age of twenty-six, when he decides to head the 'Inquirer,' for the simple reason that he "thinks it would be fun to run a newspaper." Kane eventually becomes rich and powerful through publishing "yellow journalism," which, though frowned upon by most critics, proves immensely profitable. Decades later, after two unsuccessful marriages and a failed bid for public office, Kane sits alone in his massive, unfinished Xanadu mansion (the most massive, impersonal and even sinister abode ever to grace the silver screen), pining for the lost innocence of his childhood. This is the story of a tragic life, and the ultimate testament that money can't buy happiness.The most remarkable thing about 'Citizen Kane' is its narrative structure. The film opens with Kane's death. As the image fades into a large "NO TREPASSING" sign on the gate of Kane's vast and lonely dwelling, we progressively cut to images closer and closer to his house, witnessing the enormity of Kane's wealth, and yet all his riches seem to be in disrepair. A lone lit window stands eerily amidst the snow, before the light inexplicably goes out, the figure hunched within suddenly plunged into darkness. We see Charles Foster Kane's withered hand clasping at a snow-globe, and his lips utter the mystifying words, "Rosebud." With a sudden crash, the snow-globe slips from Kane's hand and shatters on the floor. A maidservant enters the room and covers the dead man's body with a blanket. Following his death, the producer of a newsreel about Kane asks a reporter, Jerry Thompson (William Alland), to uncover the significance behind Kane's final words, a well-meaning but rather naive attempt to encapsulate a man's entire life in a simple seven-letter name.A criticism often levelled at 'Citizen Kane' is that it feels less like a warm, involving biopic than a formal masterclass in film-making technique. It's true that Welles was exploring largely unmapped cinematic territory at the time, and there's a certain sense of experimentation about the film. Mankiewicz and Welles constructed the screenplay as a series of fragmented, non-chronological flashbacks, each sequence filling in the missing parts of Kane's life, sometimes even showing the same event from differing perspectives. Greg Toland's elaborate cinematography makes unprecedented use of deep focus, in which everything in the frame ? foreground, background and anything in between ? is constantly held in sharp focus; the end result is a film that feels far more dynamic and "animate" than anything preceding the French New Wave. All innovation aside, anybody who suggests that the life of Charles Foster Kane is somehow uninvolving really needs to revisit the film; Welles pours his heart and soul into portraying the arrogant, tormented and ultimately lonely millionaire, and it's uncanny how the director's own tragic career drew clear parallels with that of his most memorable character.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was troubled by a lot of aspects of the AFI's 1998 list, but Citizen Kane wasn't one of them; it thoroughly deserved the #1 spot. A magnificent story regarding the search for contentment and happiness among the squalor of cold material things. Kane's search is a paradox in itself; his happiness lies in a single material object - Rosebud - which represents his innocence and carefree happiness of childhood. The irony is that the other material objects he procures in this search only hinder his efforts. Welles' dramatic effects and his symbolic method of storytelling would make Melville proud; he always notes who is in shadow, what music is playing where, what position his characters are in, etc. The best ever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Good Film to Watch.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's important for all people to explore the world and pursue their dreams and goals for themselves. It's important for people to be happy with their lives and not force people to help them become successful. Money, greed, and selfishness don't bring happiness to someone that was forced to get into a career at an early age or of any age at all. It's important for a person to enjoy their childhood while looking ahead towards a brighter, happy future.The actor's portrayal of Kane and his colleagues was shown very well throughout the film. The juxtaposition of the flashbacks and the present time research of Kane's life were used well and made the plot flow through fast and easy for the viewers to understand what was happening in the film. The news reel and the voice narration of providing the back story of Kane's life and death was effective to set up the main idea that the viewers are going to see and find more information about Kane's life and what the meaning of the last word that Kane said at his deathbed was all about. The use of framing and cinematography was used well throughout the film. The lighting on the back of the actors and the front of the actors was really dramatic, sharp in focus in the depth of field, and kept people guessing what was going on inside their minds and the emotions that they're feeling at the present time as Kane and the reporter are searching for success. In other scenes, the use of lighting was soft and sometimes balanced through the film. The double exposures in some parts of the film were used well.Overall, it's a good film to watch. It has a great moral story that everybody should follow in their lives.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>New review from first time watcher: Kane still good today?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why another review of Citizen Kane, a movie that made its mark in cinema history and is often regarded as the best film of all time? I'm not sure why. Perhaps it's to put my two cents in and to share what a 36-year old first time watcher but movie aficionado thinks about it. I was amazed it was made in 1941. It's in black and white but has modern original cinematography. It was revolutionary back then and I still regard it as original today. The plays of shadows and lights, who is lit up or not, and how, are not only beautiful but are evocative and serve storyline purposes. The transitions from scene to scene, backgrounds and foregrounds old and new fading out or in, are amazingly well done. Even today, you rarely see anything as artistic as this. The flashbacks and flash-forwards are very cleverly done (witness the diner table scene between Kane and his wife going from early twenties to middle age). The makeup in Kane is for the most part positively astounding and ages the characters better than most modern films. The camera angles are mostly unconventional, playing often with perspective for story purposes (notice Kane smaller in the background during bad moments or bigger than life when things go well). There are quite a few shots (Kane standing underneath a giant poster of himself for one) that are quite memorable and still powerful. I could go on but technically this movie is a marvel even today.Despite the unconventional story structure, you never get lost, although you might be temporarily confused, and it makes the whole storyline very engaging. It follows the trials and tribulations of a very rich and influential newspaper mogul from childhood to his death but not in chronological order. As a matter of fact, the film starts with the death of Kane, followed by a newsreel (like in old World War II screenings) recapping his whole life and then followed by an investigation into Rosebud, his mysterious last word. It's inspired by the life of real newspaper mogul William Randolph Hearst who tried his very best to destroy this movie... literally. There are lots of creative liberties taken but if you study the background, you will notice the similarities. It's a great story extremely well told. You might not care about Kane but he's certainly a rich, complex and fascinating character. He's played by the director Orson Welles and he shows a wide range of emotions and acts differently according to age, not just in demeanor but physically. The other actors, most of them newcomers to cinema, are very fine although a few succumb, including Welles sometimes, to overacting just a tad (they were mostly theater actors which would explain the theatrics I suppose). On first viewing, I found the mistress of Kane particularly annoying and badly acted to the point of being grating but on second thought, I think she was supposed to be that way, a bit of a superficial simple floozy.Overall, I was impressed, despite high expectations, at how original, enjoyable and artistic Citizen Kane remains in 2009. It might not be one of my favorite films, nor would I consider it the best film of all time but I think it still appeals to modern sensibilities and deserves its reputation as a masterpiece. I highly recommend finding a copy of your own, preferably with the great commentary track by the famous critic Roger Ebert (Kane being his favorite film of all time) and with the illuminating documentary about the Battle of Citizen Kane showing the conflict between director/main actor Orson Welles and Kane's inspiration: Hearst, as well as their biographies.Rating: 9 out of 10 (not a 10 because I wasn't moved or awed as much as a few other select films)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fascinating--But Increasingly Problematic With The Passage of Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In order to survive the passing years, a film must be able to transcend the limitations of the era in which it was made. This is a difficult test, particularly for films that largely rely upon new technology and innovative technique for impact: as these new effects are seen more often in other films, we come to accept them as standard, and in consequence the film that introduced them no longer has same the freshness as once it did.To a certain extent CITIZEN KANE faces precisely this problem. A pioneer in the use of deep focus photography and in innovative editing, KANE stunned audiences of its day with a powerful visual and aural montage. Some forty years later, however, most filmgoers have had at least some opportunity to see other and later films that at least approximate KANE's effects; consequently, these elements lack the same impact they once had, and the film must increasingly rely upon story, script, and performances for continued appeal. And it is here that KANE runs into a bit of trouble.The story KANE tells is quite cold, and although the script has incredible precision, bite, and complexity, it ultimately presents its characters as second-rate personalities who prove unable to transform their lives into anything beyond the pathos they so deplore. They are not likable enough to be sympathetic, they are not dark enough to fully stir our curiosity, and for all Charles Foster Kane's millions they ultimately emerge as merely so many opportunity-squandering unfortunates. As such, while they certainly engage the viewer in an intellectual sense, they seldom engage the viewer in an emotional one; this coupled with the fact that the film's technique no longer offers quite the same shock-of-the-new as once it did makes CITIZEN KANE increasingly problematic with the passage of time.There is a tremendous amount to admire in CITIZEN KANE, but with each passing year it becomes more and more of a historian's darling and less and less of a film that remains able to engage a purely casual viewer at all levels. Even so, it is (and will no doubt for the foreseeable future remain) a landmark film, one that will be worthy of considerable reverence for many years to come.Gary F.

		<shortDescription>A cinematic landmark, and an achievement in any aspect of life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Citizen Kane (according to the American Film Institute) is the greatest film ever made. Though I cannot comment fairly on that (I haven't even seen half of the nominated 100) I can assure any readers one thing: Citizen Kane is marvellous. I am not simply following the crowd, as I thought one to many official movie reviewers were doing. I agree with them; Citizen Kane lives up to the hype, just about.I heard from a few average (but movie-loving) people that they thought Citizen Kane was good, but not superb or as good as it was supposed to be. I read so many great reviews, and really did think the reviewers were simply afraid to put this historic film out of place. I apologise: Citizen Kane is nearly perfect, and were it not for some small details in the second half of the film, it would be.Nearly everything is spot on. The musical score, in particular, is the best I've ever seen. The film has charisma, charm. The acting is impeccable. The script fantastic. It's epic. And all done by a 25-year-old, which really gives it full marks.And especially for the time, it must have been incredible. The cinematography, the landmark qualities, everything was so original and new. But in the final half hour, deeper insight is necessary. We are left hanging on a thread, wondering especially after some incidents how the newsroom is going. We know little of Kane newspapers, though the dilemmas in his personal life are particularly well played out.Top banana, this is.**** out of **** (4 out of 4)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We are talking about a movie that can't be described fairly enough with words. A movie that gave the lead in cinema to Americans. Very well high effects that were very superior at the 40s. the scripts remains as one of the best ever (if not the best already) it is the only Oscar the movie won after all . When I first seen that masterpiece I didn't expect anything out of it .. because a dear friend warned me and told me not trouble myself seeing a such a crap film. Well, one day I told myself that I have to see it, at least to see what's wrong with it .. and I did see it twice after the 1st time .. and frankly every time I see the movie it proves without a doubt that ethier: it is the best American movie or the best movie of all-time. Orson Welles did a hell of a job directing, producing and acting .. even, the way he talks as old Charles Kane sounds so realistic, Orson Welles without a doubt captures even the soul of the character of Charles Kane. It is a shame not to give the movie its all eleven deserved Oscars .. but when we know that the multi-billionaire William H. fought so hard to prevent people of seeing this film which touches his life somehow, I say we will be glad that we had a chance to see such a movie, aren't we?It is a movie that lost prizes but definitely won our interests of a fine piece of art.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A word of warning: The following review and critique contains "spoilers" (dialog and plot-points which may - and in this instance - will give away scenes and surprises in the film), but it is unlikely that this will be the first time you have read or heard this information. After all, what can really be said or written about this film that hasn't be said or written before? Everyone who writes about film (from it's release in 1941, to me tonight, to someone else tomorrow) has written something either about or in reference to "Citizen Kane". It is a true classic. "Citizen Kane" is not only one of the most talked about films ever, it is also one of the most influential films ever. And, perhaps, singularly the best film American cinema has ever produced. Art is a very subjective thing, and this film is clearly filled with it. Only great art or great tragedy can produce such lengthy and long-term discussion. So what can be said that has not been said previously? Let me start by saying I did not like Charles Foster Kane, nor do I believe I was meant to. I do not take for granted that characters must be sympathetic. They do not. There is such a thing as the dark and mysterious (sometimes dangerous) character; someone who, simultaneously, will shock and infuriate us, yet from whom (for some reason) we can not turn away. In other words, it is possible to care about and become involved in the life stories of less than idyllic people. This is especially true with regards to Charles Foster Kane. Mr. Kane is a tyrant. He's as hated as he is feared. By the second act we see Kane as a hostile, detached and driven man. But time offers the unique gift of insight to those who are willing to wait for it. Something did not occur to me until recently (I did not see or hear it in any speech or interview, nor have I read of it in any of the too-numerous-to-count reviews, write-ups and critiques of the film): Charles Kane is not a man at all. He is still the same scared little boy taken away from his home and his family, lost in the wilderness, scarred for life and seemingly irreversible damaged. Now, I am positive that I am not the first to come to this conclusion (simply based on my personal knowledge that I am not that bright), but I am the first (that I know of) to write it down tonight. What do we see in the beginning of the picture (which we don't realize until the end)? The end of innocence. Lost youth. Separation. These are the things that plague Kane as an adult and shape the broken soul who tried to purchase virtue, marry youth and fight for any kind of connection throughout his "adult" life. He needed a connection. To anyone. Or anything. Do you remember in the beginning of "Citizen Kane" when he says "Rosebud" and then drops the snow globe? The butler tells the reporter at the end of the film that Mr. Kane said it twice. You only hear him say it once in the beginning. But at the end of the film, when he tears apart the room after his wife walks out, destroying practically everything, he picks up the snow globe, and is about to break it, but notices the sled encased in it. He is crying and says "Rosebud". He then walks past several employees, including the butler (who clearly heard him) and then lies down, says it again, drops the globe and dies. Here is my point: He is redeemed. Regret equals redemption. Kane regrets everything. Susan Alexander, this wife that left him (whom he left his first wife and son for); Kane met her while on the way to the warehouse that contained his youth (including his childhood sled "Rosebud" which was his last physical bit of material possession that held any connection to his long-deceased mother). He never made it to that warehouse (that night or any other) because he met Susan. Because of this he never regained, retained or made peace with that lost youth. So instead he tried to buy happiness and marry the youthful Ms. Alexander, in an attempt to hold onto some sort of ideological notion of what childhood could have been. Only after the second Mrs. Kane walks out, and he sees that sled in that snow globe, does he recall what he would have or could have been had he never accepted that "hot water" that Susan Alexander offered him on that sidewalk that first night they met. He becomes a man in that instant. Charles regrets everything. Then, he makes peace with everything by remembering everything. And he dies with redemption.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I recently watched the Oscars, and my mom also told me how it was one of the worst audiences, like it was the 2nd least watched Oscars of this history of the awards. We were talking about what could be the possible problems, in my opinion, the movies that are nominated, people really haven't either heard of or didn't enjoy that much. But in general, movies just don't have the same magic they used too.Watching Citizen Kane for the first time was a relief for me because I almost forgot that there were terrific movies out there. Citizen Kane is a brilliantly made political drama with terrific acting and excellent cinematography. I almost forgot how amazing the classics can be. I think my favorite part about this film is just how the people never figured out what Kane's last word was before he passed, "Rosebud", meant. I felt like some things should just be left in peace and you'll always have at least one piece of the puzzle missing.What a terrific and perfect movie that should be watched by all. To those who feel the same way about cinema recently, take a chance to watch one of the classics. I think that's the only way we can just get a good view on Hollywood once again.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is a telling moment in CITIZEN KANE that quietly reveals a lot about what makes the film great. It is a scene set in the dark days of the Great Depression, where Kane is turning over much of his empire to his arch-nemesis, Thatcher. As they talk, Kane casually walks away from the camera and we suddenly discover that the room the men are in is an illusion. The background wall that looks to be right behind the them is actually twenty or thirty feet away, the window sill isn't at waist height, but actually is over Kane's head. The room is huge and Kane is dwarfed by his surroundings. Kane than walks back toward the camera and perspective again creates an illusionary intimate image.It is a neat camera trick and KANE is full of neat camera tricks. It discretely plays with our perception of reality, just as the story does. Through out, Charles Foster Kane is at a distance and slightly out of focus and then he is up close and personal; he is larger than life and suddenly small and petty; he is always at the center of the picture, yet concedes the foreground to the various witnesses who tell his story. CITIZEN KANE is a treasure chest of cinematic gadgets and gizmos; yet as deliciously stylized as KANE is, the style meshes perfectly with the content. CITIZEN KANE is a story of illusions and perceptions told through illusions and perceptions. Before KANE, and for the most part afterward, no film has quite taken hold of the medium of film and done so much with it. Other directors have tried to dazzle us with how cleverly stylish they can make their films, but usually the effect is self-consciously arty: Every rabbit pulled out of a hat is greeted with a drum roll and a fanfare. The beauty of KANE and the reason director Orson Welles remains an artist of awed respect, arise from the casual grace with which he performed his magic tricks. His rabbits are in themselves so fascinating that how he produces them is only of secondary interest. Yet for a film obsessed with stylistic trickery, CITIZEN KANE still manages to be an incredibly personal story.To say a film is efficient may seem like a backhanded compliment, but part of the wonder of KANE is that it tells so much story and covers so much territory on a B-movie budget. It is an epic created on sound stages and with editorial mosaics. Welles begins his film with a mock newsreel obituary announcing Kane's passing, then basically repeats aspects of that same story several times over from different perspectives, maintaining a vague chronology, but jumping around in time to let us know that there is more to a life than the mere passage of time. Welles tells us who Kane was to the world, then who he was to the people who actually knew him -- suggesting that who we are is defined not by what we have done but by who we have touched. It is one of the most effective and insightful film biographies that was ever made. The fact that it is a biography of a fictional character is totally irrelevant.The essence of CITIZEN KANE is the fable of the blind men and the elephant. Like the blind men, who, upon examining only a part of the beast, assume that the elephant is a rope (the tail), a tree (a leg), a sword (a tusk), etc., the witnesses to Kane's life see him as a spoiled child, an idealist, a hypocrite, a monster and so on and so forth. All are correct, yet all are wrong, only seeing in Kane what they want to see. We never meet Kane the man, only Kane the illusion, yet we end up with a vague grasp of who he must have been. If CITIZEN KANE offers any universal truth it is that a life -- or a movie -- is more than the sum of the parts.Even given all the well-deserved praise proffered to Welles as a director, he never seems to get his due as an actor. His embodiment of Charles Foster Kane is, simply put, one of the great screen performances of all time. We remember that KANE saw Welles as a first time director, but it was also his first time on screen professionally and he gives a performance that is both self-assured and subtle, bold and bemused. Taking Kane from his twenties to his sunset years without a false note, giving a performance that combines gentle humor with grandiose theatrics, Welles creates a character of shifting moods and conflicting motives, yet always consistently believable. In later years, Welles perfected his persona of larger-than-life bluster and wounded arrogance, on screen and off, but he never again got a chance to play a character of such complexity and nuance.KANE's status as "the greatest film ever made" is always being challenged, defended and debated, yet it is remarkable how seldom the film itself is imitated. Despite being given this perfect blueprint for how to film a biography, it is rare that any film attempts to break free of the this-happened-that-happened style of storytelling. It is as if the legendary stature of the film intimidates others.Hitchcock once said that film is life with all the dull parts edited out. Welles adheres to this and goes one better: CITIZEN KANE is all highlights and underlined passages, a Cliff Notes biography of sorts. Does this allow us to get to know the real Charles Foster Kane? Well, yes, and no. We are allowed to solve the mystery of "Rosebud," but Kane the man remains just out of our reach. We never really meet Charles Foster Kane, only his shadows. Welles and screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz give us pieces of a puzzle, but the pieces are not all from the same puzzle.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some of my generation have pegged Citizen Kane as boring and out-dated. Perhaps it is like Crime and Punishment or some equally long and laborious book: it is important, revolutionary, but not thrilling if you aren't completely into that kind of thing. However, as an American I thought it my duty to watch Citizen Kane, which is considered a "timeless classic." Incidentally, Kane is Number One on the AFI Top 100 list--bu the best movie of all time did not even receive the Oscar that year!!! This certainly exemplifies the differences in opinion here. I enjoyed this movie because of its tragic nature: Kane's sad fall from grace and innocence, brought on by the lust for power and wealth. At one point, Kane says, " yes, I bought many...things." And he sounds regretful. I suddenly realized we do buy so many things that do NOT bring us the happiness we anticipated. Kane lacks the one thing he cannot buy-love, and ultimately no one can survive without it.Perhaps the most famous scene in all of cinematic history, the closing shot of the Rosebud sled is at once the saddest and most riveting I believe I've seen. In that moment we see how that young boy in the snow, ripped from his parents, succombed to corruption and greed, and died as alone as he felt when taken from his parents.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Orson Welles' Citizen Kane (1941) is easily the most beautiful movie I've ever seen for so many reasons. It is visually stunning, the composition is amazing. I loved the focus techniques of a wide range of depth of field and the massive sets the most. It's a gorgeous film to look at but it also tells a great story.Charles Foster Kane lived an incredible life and the most important and significant thing in his whole world was tragically destroyed. Kane lived a successful life, he made a great fortune out of the poor lifestyle he was born into. Hidden deep behind the fame and fortune of Kane's life was a sad man who never found true happiness. The only thing that ever mattered to him in his entire life was tosses aside and burned without a second glance. The last scene was so painful, and as a viewer I felt so helpless for Kane. The writing was great, I loved that it made me feel so strongly.The camera work was wonderful in this film, a different way of focusing was introduced. In certain scenes the foreground, middleground and background were all in perfect focus. In other scenes everything would be in focus but the middleground. Unusual camera views were also used that had not been seen much before. Extreme high and low shots were often used, seeming disorienting to the viewer.I believe this film will continue to blow away viewers of any age no matter how old the movie gets. The cinematography is so beautiful, even by today's standards, which makes Citizen Kane timeless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Citizen Kane was an incredible film. I was sort of mesmermized by it, more so the camera work with the unusual angles than with the story. I liked the way Orson Welles played with time and the beginning was really the end and the film was told through flashbacks which were really told by different characters. There were a few grand, grand scenes that I really enjoyed-the party at the newspaper with the dancers, ice sculptures, and the rousing song. I was overwhelmed by the scene when Charles Kane was giving his campaign speech. I did start to lose interest in the story somewhere in the middle and really felt no sympathy connection with Charles Kane. Maybe I wasn't supposed to connect with him, as his character was larger than life and because we learn about him through others recollection of him, making him mysterious and unknown. We can only infer from his last word that he was forever impacted by being torn from a place that he held such dear memories of. This film made you realize that you were looking at a film and not someone's real story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite frankly the most intelligent film ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Citizen Kane is a marvelous piece of cinema. It transcends all efforts made before and after it. What we have here truly is the great American film. The black and white cinematography is to die for. Kane is by far the most visually appealing film ever made. I find something new in it's shadows with each viewing and it takes a really great film to offer that to a viewer. American movie making really owes it all to Kane. It really is the only film I can think of that fails to break into a sense of monotony. And of course Welles' performance must be praised. Here we have a twenty six year old man fresh off of a lucrative stage career make a seamless transition into film. To see Charles Foster Kane is to see the perfection of characterization. There are no loose ends with this character he is wrapped perfectly. Of course he is a metaphor for the joys and evils of capitalism. We must ask and why did he become what he did? The great thing about Kane is that it still proposes questions that require answers.howIn each viewing of Kane I just think to myself what bias cinema come to? There was a time when motion picture making was a challenge and it meant something. Kane should be studied because it is a perfect film. It gives the viewer something to think about and yet offers dynamic characters. And to think the lobotomized masses of American cinema goers would rather be watching a Transformers film. Now there's a series I would care to forget about. I mean what kind of movie has stupid robots? And that isn't even the problem with those poor excuses for celluloid. Each film in that series is a blood curdling experience. I absolutely hate the parent characters and Shia whatever his name is. The racial stereotypes are offensive and the idea of a Transformer heaven where Shia goes to in the first sequel is beyond ridiculous. I mean come on! And what about that stupid government organization? Really? You expect me to believe that they were able to keep a giant robot within the Hoover dam without nobody knowing about it? Or how about the fact that they actually had the transformer ship crash into the moon? You might infer that some telescope would catch wind of it. And the actor they got to play John Kennedy in the beginning of the film was doing the worst stereotypical Massachusetts accent ever. Transformers is dumbing down America pure and simple. All it exists to do is sell toys to idiot kids. Michael Bay makes millions of dollars while Orson Welles was abandoned by the Hollywood system. Really! It infuriates me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Seminal, innovative film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A friend once remarked that "Casablanca" is a much 'warmer' film than "Citizen Kane." Upon rewatching 'Kane', I found that is not quite the case. It starts out rather ominously, intentionally so, but once Charles Foster Kane's early adulthood is portrayed there is much humour abounding, both subtle and slapstick, until his (first) marriage begins to cool (as a decade is depicted in a memorable montage sequence over a long dinner table). Thereafter the film's noir shadows complement a descent into a very unpleasant downward spiral until the finale (obviously inspired by "Rebecca", produced by David O. Selznick and directed by Alfred Hitchcock, only a year earlier; some of that film's opulent interiors are also mirrored in Kane's extravagant settings). Welles must have realised the picture was plummeting into such dark, glamourless territory as to leave the moviegoers with a 'negative' experience that he tacked on an introduction to the Mercury Theatre players at the end of "Citizen Kane", backed by a jolly tune utilised in one of the earlier sequences.Not all of the music is by Bernard Herrmann, as is commonly believed. Two musical segments in the "News on the March" sequence were appropriated from the 1939 "Gunga Din" film which was scored by Alfred Newman. The first, a pastorale snippet accompanying a quote about Xanadu from Coleridge's (unfinished) poem "Kubla Khan", then the trenchant strains while Kane meets with infamous world leaders like Hitler and Mussolini. The first appears in the "Gunga Din" scene where Sgt. Cutter (Cary Grant), atop an Indian elephant, halts just before a chasm spanned by a wooden bridge. The second appears in "Din" during a scene where the Thuggee cult leader (Eduardo Ciannelli) rants about prior despots, saying, "Surely Napoleon was the maddest of them all!"None of Welles' later films comes close to "Citizen Kane" which only affirms that this was not a one-man show. A long list of superb collaborators only heightened the quality of this landmark motion picture.</fullReview>

Having it have been a box office bomb when it opened in LA in the 1940's only adds to the films greatness. Citizen Kane was before its time and still remains today a movie marvel. There is not a single film school in the World that will not show this film at least twice to its students. A perfect film to watch and discuss for the entire class period. Citizen Kane has more examples of modern movie making than any other film made before or after.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gaudy Reputation, But a Dull Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really can't find anything in "Citizen Kane" worth liking. Do I see what the big fuss is about? Sure. And it is one of the best looking and most well made film of the 40s (from what I've seen. I admittedly don't watch many films from the 40s, because of bad experiences with "great" films such as this). "Citizen Kane" is a monumental achievement because of some of the technical aspects. I have no reason to watch "Citizen Kane" ever again though. I don't particularly like any of the acting, and the story is just dull to me. I don't watch movies for editing, camera work, lighting or technical achievements. Those aspects of filmmaking certainly can greatly help or hurt a film, but without a good script, and without good acting, you just have a good-looking movie. That's the case with "Citizen Kane." Supremely directed and extremely well crafted for its time, but I just didn't care for the man or the exposition of most scenes. A lot of directors can make a good-looking film, and a lot have. The remake of "All the King's Men" is wonderfully shot, but the movie is a complete mess that is just butchered by the director (most noticeably the atrocious casting and the shampoo commercial-esque editing). "All the King's Men" does have a good performance from Penn, but that's about it. Other than that? It is a terrible movie. "Citizen Kane" is not that bad and Welles' direction is far better, but I think it's a similar case were two movies look a lot better than anything that's happening between the characters, or within the story. The characters might be exquisitely framed, but I just didn't care what they had to say. It is masterfully made for its time and it is a greatly influential film. That's what it is remembered for and what it was always be remembered for. Rosebud comes second. If you rate a movie purely on direction, then you probably give it a high score. If you don't, then your taste will dictate how effective it was. For me, "Citizen Kane" is another major disappointment to add to the heap of "disappointing classics."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Peter Griffin of the Family Guy said it best "It was his sled. It was his sled from when he was a kid. There, I just saved you two long boobless hours". Kane was about the only movie I have never been able to finish, maybe I'll try again some day. I can think of many better ways to spend 2 hours like watching the "Godfather" or "Shawshank". I just could not relate to the story. It is about a tycoon who becomes a recluse, it sounds like a good story but it was so long and drawn out I fell asleep and had to stop watching. I was disappointed mainly because the first time AFI came out with the top 100 movies of all time I wanted to see the best of the best. Many of the top 100 films I had seen, many more I hadn't (seen) and a few of the ones I hadn't seen were films in AFI's top ten. "Casablanca" is good I can see that, it is not in my top ten but its good. The "Godfather" is a masterpiece but for all the talk about the "Kane" I was extremely disappointed.</fullReview>

Fine, it was clever having Rosebud, and the importance of youth, but i felt that this is an example of a movie, that could be told in about 5 minutes, rather than stretching it out into one of the longest and most boring movies that i have ever seen. Now, i was also shocked at the acting. i generally find that acting supports a relatively weak script, however in this movie's case, i felt that the relatively weak script was supporting the awful acting. i personally was not very impressed with the acting strictly because the reactions felt very forced and everything was very overdone. all in all i was not impressed at all with this film, regardless of past ratings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Lighting Effects Used In 'Citizen Kane'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The limitations of the movie being in 'black and white' did not hinder the captivation of the viewer. The impact of Citizen Kane lies in mise-en-scene and the technical tools of film-making, lighting, framing, editing and angle. The most prominent cinematic technique used in Citizen Kane is probably the lighting. The director meant for it to be a dark picture with very heavy contrasts, so he used single source lighting. The objective was to use simple lighting devices in order to give the scene a certain ambiance and in some cases, to further develop the characters with the use of shadows. An example of single source lighting is when Thompson is reading Mr. Thatcher's memoirs. This single source light creates a sense of isolation which seems to accentuate Thompson's lonely quest. The way the light illuminates the room also says a great deal about Thatcher's personality, especially by how it illuminates the large portrait of him hanging on the wall. One of the most memorable times in the movie that a single light source was used is the scene where the reporters debate how they will add to the story. The bright light source that comes from the window is so soft that it, complimented by the cigarette smoke, covers most of the room in shadow. As a result, the characters are not easily seen. This scene is effective because it says a great deal about the reporters themselves, or at least how the directors wanted to portray them as; where they are not primary or main characters in the movie. Casting all of the reporters in shadow, implied that the director wanted the reporters to be seen as characters of no importance, not just as characters, but also as an institution when considering the media. The reporter scene also happens to be the strongest use of shadows and light, which is a more prevalent technique, used throughout the film that says more about character intentions and motivations. Shadows are used to express the ethical value of a character; they cast doubt on a character's reliability, or by the absence of shadow, display a character's innocence or truthful intentions. As opposed to the lighting of a scene, the use of shadow is more effective on a character. One of the most touching uses of shadow In the movie is during the scene where Kane reads the Inquirer's "declaration of principles", which he wrote. When he does this, he is cast in shadow as he reads the declaration but once he has finished reading, he is cast back into light. This says two things about Kane; regardless of whether his idealism is genuine, Kane does not have a strong enough character to persist with such principles. Shadows heavily used during the confrontation between Boss Gettys and Kane and his wife at the time at Susan Alexander's apartment.There is one scene in particular where Susan is standing between Gettys and Kane. In this scene both men are cast completely in shadow as opposed to her who is completely in light. This can be used to signify that both men are can be deemed as very dishonest people. Susan on the other hand is the innocent person in this quarrel. She is the victim of both men's ambition, which has forced her between them. Shadows were also used later in the film in order to display Kane's superiority over Susan. This is when she reads the horrible review about her by Leyland in the Enquirer. She tells Kane that she wishes to quit, but he demands that she continues singing. He stands up over her and she is covered by his shadow for a moment, suggesting his dominance over her. He intimidates her and she does continue with her career. Quality, direction, colour and source of light are large aspects of the scene where the reporters decided to find out what 'rosebud' means and therefore state the plot of the film. The quality of light is differentiated throughout the scene. The intensity and direction of the light source change depending upon who is speaking and the sources are intensified as the speaker's relevance increases. The main reporter, Thompson and his editor, Mr. Ralston, are highlighted and shadowed according to how big their roles are at a given time. From the beginning of the scene, Ralston's face is shadowed and his movement around the room is limited. While he is deciphering what he thinks about the news reel depicting Kane's life, his face is shadowed and dark as he moves across the set. Citizen Kane is still respected and admired because of the groundbreaking cinematic techniques that are just as inspirational to filmmakers today as they were fifty years ago.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why Is "Citizen Kane" the Best Film of All Times?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anyone who sees "Citizen Kane" (1941) for the first time today does so because he or she has heard that it is the greatest film ever made. One simply doesn't come across the film by accident on TV, watching it "for what it is," so to speak. The common approach of seeing it to believe it can be at best exhilarating and at worst hostile. Unfortunately, the latter is usually, although quite understandably, the case. For how can one do anything but look down at a film that elitist snobs have praised for years and years? One simply must prove oneself right by falsifying the critics' claims, leaving the theater or the living room with a shrug and a condescending comment: "it was okay." This will not do. It is a great tragedy if "Citizen Kane" suffers from these kinds of incidents since it ought to be treated with the same kind of respect as Shakespeare's "Hamlet" or Beethoven's "9th Symphony". In order to make this happen, or perhaps enhance someone's viewing experience, I would like to try and explain not why "Citizen Kane" necessarily is the best film, but rather why people have considered it to be. There are over a thousand reviews of the film on this site, and mine will probably drown in the vast sea with them, but hey what can I lose, and who doesn't love talking about Welles and "Citizen Kane"?One might begin with the basic fact that "Citizen Kane" wasn't immediately praised and considered the best film that has blessed the silver screen. It was a financial risk for the RKO studios to give free hands to the novice prodigy Orson Welles, who had gained quite a reputation with the radio show of H. G. Wells' "War of the Worlds", and not surprisingly it didn't pay off. Despite the praises of a few critics, "Citizen Kane" was soon forgotten, and the film wasn't, for example, screened at American cinemas during the late 1940's and early 50's. In France, however, the film was just discovered after the war, and the leading critic of the country, André Bazin hailed it as a masterpiece of the postwar stylistic tendency he characterized as spatial realism. Bazin's disciples, who we all know now as the nouvelle vague directors, followed and adored Welles' masterpiece. François Truffaut proclaimed that "everything that matters in cinema after 1940 has been influenced by 'Citizen Kane'." Thus the film's reputation grew and its new found reputation slowly found the other side of the Atlantic as well. But why did this happen? Why wasn't "Citizen Kane" forgotten, and why, for one, did it arouse the interest of Bazin?First, it ought to be highlighted that the story of "Citizen Kane" is excellent. Loosely based on the life and times of media mogul William Hearst, "Citizen Kane" tells the story about a lonely giant who conquered the American media. It's a story about a man who dedicated his life to possession, but tragically became to be possessed by it himself. As one might have noticed, I am using the past tense, and such is the nature of Welles' narrative in "Citizen Kane". The film begins with the protagonist's death, and then portrays the attempts of a journalist trying to figure out the meaning of his last words -- "Rosebud" -- by interviewing people who knew the man. "It will probably turn out to be a very simple thing," he supposes. This kind of structure was not considered the done thing back in the day. Although the basic structure of finding out a person's past goes back to Sophocles' "Oedipus Rex" as well as numerous detective stories, the uniqueness of "Citizen Kane" lies in the use of different perspectives, creating a non-linear narrative that has echoes from ancient drama and epistolary novels. Yet it wasn't really the intricate story that most fascinated Bazin. What Bazin emphasized was the film's style. Although all scholars have given up on the phoenix myth of "Citizen Kane" and its innovative use of various cinematic means, it is simply a fact that the film made the style public, thus standardizing it for Hollywood. The aesthetic features of the so-called spatial realism, which Bazin adored, supported by the technological innovation of the BNC camera, include deep-focus cinematography, sequence shots, and deep-space composition. These had been used before, but hardly with similar, dare I say, philosophic unity. This stylistic tendency is enhanced by Welles' relentless use of heavy low-angle shots and dynamic montage sequences. There are innovative cuts that spark imagination and soundtrack solutions that open the story and its characters to new dimensions. "Citizen Kane" is often celebrated as a bravura of the art of mise-en-sc?ne since it puts a lot of emphasis on pre-filmic elements such as setting and lighting, but the real gist of the film's brilliance lies in the unity of these together with cinematographic and post-filmic elements.More remains to be said, but space is running out. The end of the matter is, I guess, that none of the individual elements of "Citizen Kane" are, precisely, individual. They have not been distinguished from one another, but rather resonate luminously together in a unique fashion. Technological innovation goes hand in hand with aesthetic inspiration and both support the whole of story, theme, and style. Such unity may not have been present in Hollywood before 1941. From the groundbreaking use of the BNC camera to themes of power, loneliness, and defeat, which are reflected on the level of style, using setting and editing, for one, to reflect the emotional distances between the characters or their existential experience of emptiness, "Citizen Kane" remains a gem to any lover of cinema. It's up there with immortal works of art from poetry, music, and painting. It is, like all great art, a tightly and beautifully sealed original whole which is why (instead of one big nameable innovation) the film has been considered to be of such magnificent proportions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A true original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>RKO was the smallest of the Big Five Hollywood studios and the purveyor of mainly undistinguished genre pictures. For this reason they hired a young theatre producer called Orson Welles to make a prestige film. Welles had just shook up radio with his production of The War of the Worlds, a broadcast that was so innovative and realistic it caused widespread panic throughout the United States with some people really believing that Martians were attacking. Welles was given free reign to make the film he wanted. This was unprecedented for an untried film-maker. The film's central character resembled newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst. The film was delayed several months while RKO tried to appease Hearst's lawyers. It was well received by the critics but not a popular success. It would remain the high point of Welles career and the one time he enjoyed such complete control. This led in part to the auteur theory where masterpieces of cinema were attributed to the director's genius. However, this is too simplistic as Welles had great collaborators here such as screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz and cinematographer Gregg Toland. The former provided a disciplined structure for Welles to work off and the latter the deep focus photography that allowed him to manipulate cinematic space in a way that strengthened the story. The combination of deep focus and long takes allowed for scenes where characters moved around the cinematic space in ways that heightened the drama considerably.Citizen Kane is often considered a triumph of technique but it's really the way in which the technique was used and controlled to strengthen the story that makes it so notable. It wasn't the first film to utilise deep focus or long takes but it was the first one to use them so systematically. It combined many opposites ? social comment / surrealism, European art film / Hollywood entertainment, comedy / tragedy, realism / expressionism. Kane himself is presented in a variety of ways ? dreamlike images of him dying, a remote public figure, a man known by wife and friends and finally a detached being. This reality is expressed by a combination of objective fact and subjective opinion. The beginning of the movie illustrates opposites of approach. We begin with a subjective dreamlike death scene and immediately are thrust into the objective 'News on the March' segment that mimics the news documentary in a similar way to how Welles mimicked the radio news in The War of the Worlds. In this part we are told the whole narrative in summary. It's a microcosm of the film as a whole. After this we then piece together the story of Kane's life via the accounts of various people who knew him, all interviewed by Thompson, a man whose face we never see because he really represents us. The use of flashbacks, multiple narrators and an ambiguous conclusion was a very innovative one for the time. The film as a whole resembles one of the jigsaws that Kane's second wife Susan works on, each piece contributed another truth but some pieces are missing. To add to the complexity of the film, different people offer contrasting judgements that make up the differing periods of his life. Welles once remarked that 'the point of the picture is not so much the solution of the problem as its presentation'.Thompson realises that no single word can 'explain a man's life' and so it proves with 'Rosebud'. The sledge and paperweight represent the time when Kane was happiest and the love he lost but it's left essentially ambiguous and is never fully explained. Kane seeks to regain the love he lost for the rest of his life but always on his own terms, this leads to the ruin of his career and relationships. He winds up in Xanadu his very own pleasure dome with caves of ice. The final tracking shot moves slowly over the expensive rubbish that Kane has accumulated; as we pan forward we see items from further and further back in the story until we find the fateful Rosebud sledge. The 'answer' to our quest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is a childhood worth sacrificing for wealth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think the quote that my friend made about this movie sums it up pretty much: it is a modern day work of literature. I agree with him precisely on that point. I do not give it a 10 because at places it is slow and dull, but one does not appreciate the brilliance that is this movie until after one has sat down and thought about it. Citizen Kane is not a movie is simply watch, it is one to think about and mull over the ideas that come through it. Another friend stated that it was the most boring piece of crap that he has ever seen, and though that might be his opinion, I feel that he missed the entire point of this movie.Citizen Kane is about a man named Charles Foster Kane who is a US newspaper magnate. I will not delve into the plot because that is not the purpose of the movie. Rather it is a character study on Kane and it is also a tragedy for we see how Kane's life not only slowly disintegrates to its inevitable conclusion, but also we see how his life ended up as it is.There has been a lot of discussion over the precise meaning of Rosebud, the word that he mutters on his deathbed. At the end of the movie we discover that Rosebud is the name of his sleigh, and we see this as it is thrown into the fire. A journalist spends the entire movie trying to find out the meaning of Rosebud, but he fails to do so, walking out of Kane's manor, Xanadu, behind a huge amount of possessions packed away in boxes. We learn that the answer to the Rosebud question is an insignificant item amongst all of these meaningless possessions.What does Rosebud mean? It may be the name of the sleigh, but what does it really mean. I guess to answer that question we must look at what Kane had, and what he did not have. At the beginning of the movie we are told all about Kane, or what the media knew of it, but as we follow the journalist we slowly come to learn more about the more intimate and personal period's of Kane's life. We are allowed into Kane's personal space and into his mind to try and understand how he thinks, and by doing that we are given clues as to why he mentioned Rosebud.Charles Foster Kane was incredibly rich, having almost everything that he could want. Xanadu, his palace in which he died, was a tribute to his wealth. The palace was not finished, but that only says something minor about his character which I will not address. What I wish to draw out of that is that Xanadu represents his wealth and his ability to claim whatever possession that he wants. I use the word possession because there are three things in the movie that his money cannot buy: the presidency, love, and his childhood. The presidency is a minor thing, and love becomes more important after his first divorce. It is important because he uses his money to make his second wife famous, but one thing that this does not do is make her truly love him. He dies in bed a lonely man.I believe that the major thing that Charles Foster Kane could not buy was his childhood, and we see evidence of this throughout the film, and tied together at the end where we see his sleigh, Rosebud, burning in the fire. His actions and his attitudes all show signs of a little boy trapped in the body of a man, trapped since the days he was sent off to boarding school.The first instance is when Kane's mother decides to send Charles Foster Kane away. His father is against this, but his mother is adamant that Kane has a good education. When Kane learns of this his first reaction is to lash out at Thatcher, his trustee, with his sleigh. For the rest of his life he hated Thatcher with a passion. He refused to listen to him, and made his job incredibly difficult. Even though he was sent to the best schools, he reacted violently against them and was never able to last long. In the end he purchases a Newspaper because it seems like a good idea.He hated Thatcher because Thatcher was the man that stole Kane's childhood. When Kane came of age he was able to dissolve the trust, and as such remove Thatcher from his life. He reaction to the schools is his hatred of having his childhood stolen from him, and the newspaper was him trying to reclaim the childhood that he had lost. In the end he is too old to live out a childhood, but tries to anyway.The final thing that I wish to discuss is the reaction by Randolf Hurst against this film. It is a reaction that I really do not understand because I do not see Kane as an unflattering character. My friend described Kane as being a real and a repulsive character. I did not find him that repulsive, rather rash and unthinking. He actions which lost him the presidency was not due to any immorality, but rather due to lies fostered by his opponents. The divorce of his first wife is never explored, and it is doubtful that it was because of this because she knew the truth. Maybe it is because she did not really love him, but because she loved the fact that one day he might be president.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Citizen Kane (5/5)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Citizen Kane" has often been called the greatest film in cinematic history, and with good reason: it is a stroke of genius on the part of Orson Welles. He was only 25 when he directed this film, and yet he pioneered some of the most amazing cinematography and production techniques of his day or any other. At a first glance, "Kane" is a rather simple story: a young boy, Charles Foster Kane (played wonderfully by Orson Welles) inherits a large fortune and winds up dying alone and unhappy--his last words being the infamous "rosebud." Although it seems like a rather cut and dry endeavor, it is so much more than that, mainly because the film is done in flashbacks. We begin with Kane's death and then move backwards and forwards through his life, in an attempt to find out what "rosebud" means. This is brilliant editing on Welles part; he takes a simple story and creates a complex mesh. Through these many flashbacks we slowly but surely begin to learn of Kane and those around him, and this creates quite the portrait. Welles almost always shoots Kane and other strong characters from a low angle, making them appear lager than life--this especially aids in the character development of Kane. Before this film, using camera angles in such a way was scarcely heard of, but here we see a new technique:Welles shows us that angles can do more than just make a movie look"pretty."Another fascinating technique Welles employs for character development is set design. Whenever Kane is present, it seems that the ceilings are lower, for examples one should look at Kane's publishing house, and some of the rooms in his mansion. This further demonstrates Kane's massive size and power, and at the same time higher ceilings are used when more inferior characters are used. For example, a newspaper reporter interested in solving the mystery of rosebud, is first shown in a great hall looking at some old records and memoirs belonging to Kane's old guardian, Mr. Thatcher. Because of this we recognize that this reporter is not important, but rather only secondary. Also, Kane's second wife is often sitting in the largest rooms the Kane mansion, which makes her look rather small. However, the best example of how Welles uses set pieces to enforce Kane's power is when he is running for governor. Here, Kane makes a speech to a very large crowd, and behind him is a mammoth picture of himself. Of course, what is also amazing about this scene is that Welles discovers a new technique called deep focus: he is able to simultaneously keep the large picture and Kane in focus, giving the illusion of depth. After this speech Kane is all set to win the governor's race, but through a twist of some dirty politics, he looses, and soon after, his first wife leaves him. Of course, to anyone paying attention this comes as no surprise--we know there has been distance between Kane and his wife for quite some time. However, we do not receive this information through dialog but rather through Welles brilliance use of subtlety. Welles shows us several scenes of the couple sitting together and having breakfast. Each breakfast encounter comes and goes with great speed leading into a dissolve which then takes us to another breakfast meal. We see the couple slightly bickering, but the way Welles shoots the scene it looks as though they are still eating breakfast right next to each other, which does not usually indicate tension. However, the last frame of this breakfast montage shows a wide shot of the couple, and we see them sitting at a much bigger table then they were first sitting at, and they are also sitting directly opposed to each other. This part of the film tells us a wealth of information, and all because of a set piece (a table), the clever use of editing, and the camera placement. No other film maker before or since this movie has used these technical aspects to flesh out so many details, not only about the characters, but about the story.The amazing thing about Welles is how much information he is able to convey using subtlety and some simple yet poignant dialogs. Welles does not hit the viewer in the face with his film like so many movies in this day and age (i.e. anything done by Michael Bay), but instead he opts for letting the audience come to their own conclusions. And when I had mulled over this film, the conclusion I came to was rather depressing: Charles Foster Kane had all the money and power in the world but this could not buy him love, and like most of us, he never comes to realize that simple fact, which in the end left him bitter and lonely. Thinking about all of this was rather heart wrenching, but what really drove it home was when I came to discover the meaning of "rosebud": it was one of Kane's childhood toys. That to me is most upsetting of all: the only time Kane was ever truly happy was when he was a child--when he was free from his wealth.Kane could have said or thought of anything in the world on his deathbed, but instead he chose to reflect on his short-lived childhood. Now if that doesn't get you misty eyed, not much else will. I recommend "Citizen Kane" to any mature person looking for a deep and intricate film, in which there is much more than there first appears. However, it is probably wise to watch the movie twice, in order to discover all the little and large things Orson Welles so masterfully paints on his canvas of celluloid. All and all I give "Citizen Kane": 5 out of 5 stars.Copyright 2006 Imaginist</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the studio process at its very best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think that the making of a movie is truly a collaborative process, thus the films of the studio era are without doubt the most fascinating and inventive to date. This does not mean that an independent film cannot be a good movie, it just doesn't have the expertise and resources behind it to make it a truly great movie like Citizen Kane. It also doesn't mean that the big bygone studios didn't turn out their fair share of clunkers, but in my mind, to find the best movies of the last century you have to look to the big studios.As to Citizen Kane in particular, it is always fascinating to watch. Unfortunately when we think of special effects these days, it's with action films of dubious quality, but Citizen Kane probably used more and to better advantage.The innovations, such as deep focus, sets with ceilings, the mixture of newsreel footage(both real and staged),the effect of overlapping dialogue are amazing. And to think that this was at a time when sound movies were only about a decade old and the movies themselves weren't even a half century old. It's amusing to think that when these techniques were used to create a realism unseen in films up to that time, the audiences were put off, since it was so different than anything else they had seen and they thought it looked phony!I recently heard a comment from Richard Chow(the editor from Star Wars) on TV that he is still learning things from Citizen Kane, and its great cinematographer Greg Toland, decades later.So in conclusion to me Citizen Kane stands head and shoulders above any movie before or since.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Melville of Cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The careers of Orson Welles and Herman Melville are eerily similar...there is the great early work that is thought by some to be the alpha and omega of their respective forms (Citizen Kane and Moby Dick), there is the long eclipse, there is the great late work rediscovered (Touch of Evil or (the yet to be rediscovered and absolutely flabbergasting) Chimes at Midnight and Billy Budd, sailor), and there is the irrepressible mindf**k (F for Fake and The Confidence Man). But even more than that, Welles and Melville were the two most disillusioned artists America ever produced, which goes a long way toward explaining why average people interested in the arts as mere "entertainment" don't like their work. Both Kane and Ahab are singularly unpleasant individuals who are crushed by the cosmos in one way or another in spite of their indomitable defiance. These are not pleasant archetypes in the least...but they are infinitely more valuable than all the "heroes" of popular fiction. Welles and Melville take a speculum to the human condition by testing these characters to destruction. Citizen Kane has one of the most difficult structures in film. Its fractured narrative prevents the viewer from truly understanding Kane--but this is the point of the movie...why else would the film conspicuously leave out one crucial viewpoint (Kane himself)? In this respect, Citizen Kane is also a lot like Hamlet, which is similarly impenetrable. Anyone who demands identification with the "hero" is going to be sorely taxed by Kane--this separates the men from the boys, so to speak.Is Citizen Kane THE greatest film of all time? Of course not. To declare that any film holds that honor is ludicrous. After all, once a certain level of craftsmanship is attained, once a certain level of insight is expressed, these distinctions become meaningless. Star Wars lost the best picture Oscar to Annie Hall in 1977--is one better than the other? The experience of watching either of them is so radically different that the comparison is absolutely invalid...they have nothing in common except their relative excellence. Kane's hold on the honor stems from the fact that it invented more of the language of sound filmmaking than any other movie, but no one claims that the other contender based on that criterion is the greatest film of all time (that would be the extremely controversial Birth of a Nation). Dont get me wrong...Kane is ONE of the greatest films...but no film could or should be asked to stand as the alpha and omega of the art.Even so, Kane is a harrowing aesthetic experience.And Kane IS massively entertaining. I resent the notion that a film has to elicit some knee-jerk emotional response to be considered entertaining--having the eye engaged and having the mind challenged ARE entertaining...but I sometimes forget that we as a people more and more value feeling over thought...God help us all.(If anyone is interested, I also reviewed Cat People (1942)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ease the tension. Give it a 10-rating. I'm not sure if I could pick any movie and claim it was the Best Movie of All Time. That's a great deal of pressure. So I ignore such a label, and I watch the film."Citizen Kane" is powerful, but it's so well constructed as to give you multiple impressions of Kane that it's hard to realize how emotionally charged this movie is. I love it for lines such as Kane's explanation of what he would've been if he hadn't have been rich: "Everything you hate," he says. And I love the movie because of Welles's voice. You could look at this movie a hundred different ways, and the details would still remain to support you.It's perhaps one of the most intricately-constructed films I've ever seen, and the honesty in the film is magnificent. This movie does make me sad, because among other questions, it asks this: "If you're remembered after you die for what you did, what you will it be?" And, to me, that's a very sad question to want to ask. A feeling that there is no absolute understanding between people. That it's all skewed by our own personalities. That who you are depends on the paper you chose to read.How could anyone not think this movie is great? Best film of all time, whatever. The movie is brilliant, one way or another.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Any (re)viewers who came away with negative impressions of Kane probably made the mistake of watching the film on video. You should never approach a classic film in anything but a proper movie theatre. Would you watch "2001" at home on a 14" screen? You would! Why? Watching 2001 on anything other than a full-size movie screen, or even better an IMAX screen, is a waste of time. Its grandeur cannot be appreciated under home conditions, pausing the film every 10 minutes to check on the laundry.Citizen Kane has a lot more plot than 2001, but the problem is the same. Everything that's daring and exciting about the direction -- the crazy camera angles, the freakish tracking shots, the wildly imaginative changes in mood and lighting -- you don't get anything of that on a tiny screen. All you get at home are the clever plot, brilliant dialogue, and great performances, but even so I find Kane boring at home too. Oh, and don't forget the subversive assault on the necessarily irresponsible use of corporate power. Off hand, I can't think of a single Welles film that works on a TV screen. Well, maybe Touch of Evil, since it's so heavily plotted. But with Ambersons, Lady From Shanghai, The Trial, Chimes At Midnight, to cite just a few quickly, you're just ruining it for yourself getting your first exposure at home.There's a second-run movie theatre somewhere near you that needs your support and probably shows nice, scratchy prints of Kane, exactly the kind that everyone who loves Kane saw their first time.I'm one of the people who thinks the AFI list is a bad joke which can safely be ignored. By accident, some great films did manage to wind up on the list. Citizen Kane is one of them.As our Neapolitan compatriot, who most graciously excluded his own country's Ladri di biciclette from consideration, says, Citizen Kane is "il pi? grande film della storia del Cinema". I think it's the greatest in cinematic history as well. Yeah, and it's boring at home.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, this title is a classic and we can all agree that it has been critically acclaimed by many to be a masterpiece. This movie pops up in so many lists of the greatest movies of all time that watching it at least once in your lifetime becomes a must. So I prepared myself for at the least a good movie. Is it a good movie? Well, yes and no.See, it depends on why you are watching movies in the first place and where you derive pleasure from. For me watching movies is a way of entertainment and enjoyment, I want to have fun, I want to laugh, I want to cry, I want to think, I want to be engaged, I want to guess what is going to happen, I want characters that I can relate to and be attached to. Now all those things don't mean that I want MINDLESS fun,I do prefer intelligent plot with great characters and development but I want the movie to incorporate entertainment value as well. Citizen Kane was a character study, it was like an assignment for my university where I had to critically evaluate the title to get a good grade.Yes, cinematography was amazing and to think it was a movie from 1941 it is just jaw dropping. Yes, the character of Kane was complex and it was a good character study. Yes, the symbolic nature of "Rosebud" and what it represents was brilliantly done, especially when we see that Kane's romantic life with his women was screwed up. But all those things are meaningless to me when I don't enjoy the movie and I am ready to die from boredom. I literally forced myself to not fall asleep, all the time I was thinking "There must be something wrong with me, this is the greatest film of all time. Get your sh*t together, wake up and pay attention. This is awesome, right?". At some points I even thought that I must be stupid for not liking this film, but if people choose to name me stupid I don't care, at least I am honest with my feelings. What matters is that I consider myself to be fairly intelligent and I didn't see the appeal of this movie unless you are watching this for critical purposes.Now why this movie is in the top 250 and is considered a classic? That's probably because of the technical aspects of the movie and in this sense it might be a masterpiece, but I just can't see people enjoying this so much to have it so highly rated because of the entertainment factor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Years after the controversy, the film fails to stand on its own merits</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is virtually impossible to come across a 10 Best Films List from any "serious" critic or film institution that does not have Citizen Kane ensconced in the Number 1 slot. I have literally heard film historians who insist that if you don't like this film, then you don't like films. Well, I happen to love films and I do not especially like Citizen Kane and, refreshingly, I see from many of the comments there are legions of people that also do not appear to like this film much either. Much of the aggrandizement stems from the high esteem that the film industry and critics held auteur Orson Welles and the empathy they had for Welles in the obstacles that he faced in making this film. Yet while one can appreciate the single-minded ferocity an artist can have in bringing forth a vision ? one must also admit that many times the end product of that vision is not a masterpiece. Welles' melodrama, which is a thinly veiled depiction of the life of legendary power broker William Randolph Hearst, put him on the wrong side of the publishing magnate, who did not like having his life be the subject of a film and set forth the dogs of war to try to hamper Welles. Many critics gathered around Welles and starting inventing superlatives to describe the end result as an antidote. At the time, this picture caused quite the controversy and became a cause cél?bre. Unfortunately, decades after the death of Hearst, when many new film watchers barely know who he was, the film must be judged on its own merits and not the controversy it caused in its day, and that is where the film falls apart.The film opens with the death of its central character, the obscenely wealthy Charles Foster Kane (played by Welles) and his whispered dying word of "Rosebud". A group of journalists go on the hunt to figure out the meaning of what or who is "Rosebud", and we get to see Kane's life unfold in retrospect based on the investigations of journalist Joseph Cotton. "Rosebud" is the film's central mystery, but it is basically a McGuffin. People going into the film familiar with the answer will find the proceedings utterly pointless. Those unfamiliar with the identity of "Rosebud" may be less charitable once they realize that they have been gamed into hanging on for something so trivial. In fact, it is almost laughable as to how slight the storyline ends up being.Welles depicts everything on screen at arm's length. There is no character to draw the viewer into the events that unfold or to win sympathy. They are all just ciphers moving in and out of the frames. Emotionally, the film is positively glacial. The acting, even by Welles himself, is outrageously stiff. Events befall the central character and have minimal impact and thus the viewer has absolutely no reason to be impressed by them. Fans of the film drone on and on about "shots" and camera effects as though great film's succeed on those merits at the expense of story, acting, style and substance. Welles, the director, overuses the canard of mammoth Gothic sets that dwarf his characters to emphasize their purported loneliness or disenfranchisement. This may have been impressive at the time, but now it merely seems a ploy to compensate for the tepid dialog and stale performances. Anyone who truly wants to give director James Cameron grief about his dialog really needs to go back and listen to Citizen Kane with an unbiased ear. Additionally, the much lauded darkness of the film and trick camera shots that earned Welles praise for his cinematic decisions become far less impressive when one realizes that Welles directed and photographed ALL of his films in this fashion, whether it was warranted (Journey Into Fear) or not (The Magnificent Ambersons). It was simply his directorial style and he offered no other alternatives in his career because it was all he knew how to do. Unlike other films of the era which are still impressive, even if we don't like their point of view (Gone With the Wind comes to mind), it is difficult to even understand how Citizen Kane rated as a great film in its day. Its central character remains aloof and the grand secret of Rosebud leaves most viewers I know shrugging their shoulders, if not lamenting the loss of time it took to find out about it. The revelation, rather than arousing sympathy or understanding for Kane, fails to make him any more accessible and, like the camera work, ends up coming off as a last-minute gimmick to try to make Kane the man seem more human than we have witnessed in compensation for the lack of development during the course of the film due to the weaknesses of the writing and acting.And finally, for those film historians/critics who are still thumping their chests 70 years after the fact as to how the Oscar voters gave the Best Picture to How Green Was My Valley over Citizen Kane, the answer is quite obvious to someone watching the films with fresh eyes. HGWMV may have its share of downbeat moments and may not be "perfection", but it contains in its running time more emotion, character development and solid storytelling than Citizen Kane is able to muster on its best day. It is far and away the more accessible film for viewers emotionally - then and now.</fullReview>

Because of that first view, I've been under the impression that the film is strange and alienated.Yesterday I decided that it deserves a second view, now that I'm a little bit older (22) and have seen more than enough films, compared to when I was younger.I just finished watching it and it left me with teary eyes and a lump in my throat. I was moved - and didn't even see it coming.When I first saw the film I couldn't relate to Charles Foster Kane, and it wrecked the film for me - until I decided to watch it again.In my opinion, the early and final years of Charles are those that make the film get under your skin and into your heart.</fullReview>

It is certainly a visually spectacular film and its method of using a frame narrative to tell someone's life story is worthy of note/praise. Yet to be quite honest, I don't think that "Citizen Kane" otherwise really stands as a particularly intriguing film. Its pace is quite slow and too much of the film concerns itself on Kane's romances. I understand that it is worthy of respect, but I can't help but think that people are being a bit pretentious when labelling it as the GREATEST film of all time. As good as it may be, it certainly won't ever be in my Top 10.</fullReview>

The praise is certainly deserved, because this is certainly is one of the greatest motion pictures of all-time.

Welles had already created controversy with his "War of the Worlds" broadcast that shocked America, but that was nothing compared to what erupt thanks to Citizen Kane. Newspaper tycoon William Randolph Hearst believed that the film painted an unflattering image of him and was determined to bury the film, along with Welles. Due to Hearst's power of the press and radio waves, the film was barely advertised and flopped on its initial release. It would also lose the Best Picture Oscar to John Ford's sentimental How Green Was My Valley (considered by many to be the Academy's biggest mistake ever). Kane would disappear and only after both the careers of Hearst and Welles fell did it start to gain an audience upon numerous re-releases from the 1950's onward. It was praised by critics as a masterpiece and Welles was put alongside Chaplin and Ford as one of cinema's greatest artists. More and more acclaim is given to Citizen Kane each day and rightfully so.Millionaire tycoon Charles Foster Kane (Orson Welles) dies one night in his bed at his giant castle, Xanadu with his very last word, "Rosebud." A reporter (William Alland) working on a news reel about Kane is soon asked by his boss to investigate the importance of the word. So, he begins to interview previous colleagues of the newspaper runner, which leads to various flashbacks of his life. After his mother becomes rich, she sends Charles away with a bank owner and he soon grows into a prosperous man, who decides that "it would be fun to run a newspaper." He gains control of The Inquirer, which soon blossoms into a major enterprise. He soon marries the president's daughter and runs for senator. After that breaks off, he meets a young woman who he wants to become a successful singer, but she is not able to hold a tune. Yet, through all of this, does the reporter ever find out what "Rosebud" means?Citizen Kane has been looked into and analysed by many critics (including one providing a commentary for the DVD) and almost everybody has a different interpretation. I, for one, view it as a story of a man who despite gaining a lot of money, never really became happy and that one word is Kane realising that his death is probably the best thing to have ever happened to him. Kane becomes so insanely wealthy and successful, that he forgets what life is all about, which explains why he just melts away in Xanadu for all the years after his second wife's divorce. Kane may not be the kindest gentleman, but he certainly is fascinating, which is probably what adds to the everlasting appeal of Citizen Kane. Orson Welles set out to tell the story of one man and made a masterpiece and a classic motion picture history. His performance, direction and screenplay are all perfect in every way. His supporting players, which he brought to Hollywood with him from the Mercury Theatre are all impressive as well. Gregg Toland, the cinematographer, also deserves heaps of praise for his brilliant camera work and lighting effects.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What Makes A Film A Masterpiece?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is Citizen Kane a masterpiece? The results of the British Film Institute 2002 poll of major directors and critics found Kane to be rated the best film of all time, and Orson Welles the greatest director. Do the intelligentsia of film have the exclusive right to determine which film is or is not a masterpiece? Certainly not. However, the use of the term "masterpiece" is being thrown around so casually today as to render the word virtually meaningless. If you look at IMDb's user rating, you would find Citizen Kane ranked #23 and The Shawshank Redemption #2. This is a rating by us common folk, not people who have studied film or make their living from movies. Does this give rise to the contention that The Shawshank Redemption is a masterpiece also? One may argue the point, and if you read through the user comments, many, many people use the term to describe that movie. I'm sure if you read through the user comments for, say, Pulp Fiction, that ol' word "masterpiece" will be there again and again. Check out Forrest Gump. I haven't, but my money says you see that "m" word quite a few times there also. After all, it DID win six Academy Awards. If all these movies are considered masterpieces by enough people, does that make it so? I really don't know. I do have my opinion and the privilege to state it, everyone else like it or not. You may disagree with my view, but you shouldn't absorb it and react personally. A masterpiece in film is no different from any other art form. Painting, music, sculpture, literature; some works are great; others mediocre. Greatness must stand the test of time. It doesn't matter how many times you've seen that Dali, listened to Wagner, or read Shaw's play. Each time is the first time. There's a wondrous quality there which fascinates always. A sense of immortality. So, is The Shawshank Redemption a masterpiece on the same level as Citizen Kane? Not even close. Kane meets my criteria as do many others. In fact, in my opinion, Citizen Kane is not even Welles' best movie, so I must think highly of him as a filmmaker. Kubrick, Bunuel, Wilder, Ford, Fellini, Fassbinder, Lang, Ozu, Truffaut, Kurasawa, Hitchcock, Altman, maybe Goddard, maybe Herzog, look out for Tarr, Visconti, the list of great films by great filmmakers is long enough, but not so long that every GOOD film we see is a masterpiece. Let's collar that word and hold it in a safe place before it becomes completely superfluous. I'm sure Welles would approve.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Film-Study Exercise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A technical masterpiece, making it a must see at least once in one's life. Watch it as a film-study exercise, but not as the great film it is claimed to be.We follow the life of Charles Foster Kane, a fictionalized character based on the life of William Randolph Hurst. There are strong performances in the film, magnificent use of shadows, angles, sets, as well as the fact that Orson Welles wrote, directed, starred in and had complete control over editing it. (This was unheard of at the time. But this was not really the first independent film production. Look to Howard Hughes and John Ford for this.) Good or great film-making is ultimately about story telling. For me, a film that moves me emotionally and/or intellectually, employs subtlety rather than insulting my intelligence, has true-to-life characters, presents believable situations, can be enjoyed over and over again, and stands the test of time, earns such praise. I confess that I do prefer to have a strong reaction to the main character, be it empathy, hatred, love or disgust, and some understanding and sympathy of motives. I am well aware that there are people whom are extremely difficult to completely understand, (John Ford, for example), but they are not a complete mystery.I originally saw this film about 25 years ago. As a college student, I was very quick to parrot traditional perceptions and said, "Great flick!" rather than form my own opinion. I recently re-watched it, and am quite content to wait another 25 or more years before doing so again. When the audience has to don deep-sea diving gear to attempt to understand something about the character via interpretation rather than subtlety, then the film missed the mark. The only character I found evoking any emotion, empathy or real comprehension was Kane's second wife. The film ended without any real understanding of Kane or his why his final words are what they are, nor do you care.Study the cinematography once in you life. But that's quite sufficient.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why the viewers of Citizen Kane are an essential part of the film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Famously in the film Citizen Kane the title character Charles Foster Kane dies in his bed, muttering "Rosebud" and dropping a snow globe, without anybody other than Kane being visible in the room. Yet the whole film is based on the premise that "Rosebud" was Kane's last word and a reporter tries to find out the meaning of the word by interviewing people who knew him. So how could he do this if nobody heard him say the word? Towards the end of the film the butler claims that he was in the room when Kane died. We never saw him in the bedroom but not the whole room was shown to us, so it is very much possible. But why is it that he wasn't shown to us being in the room when Kane died? Given how extremely well thought through the film is it is more than likely that this wasn't only done intentionally, but with a purpose.The film mostly is told to us (quite literally) from a subjective point of view and through opinions of people who knew Charles Foster Kane. And Kane was a different kind of person depending on who told the story. A main message of the film - so to speak - is that there is no actual picture of a person, there are just many different fragmented pictures of which none are true or false. In the very first scene of the film we see a sign that says "No Trespassing". This sort of makes us the intruders to Xanadu and to Kane's life. The camera goes through his garden around the castle leading into the castle. So in the beginning we, like, become another one of those subjective witnesses who try to get the "full picture" and who eventually will form an opinion about this person. And to include the viewer into this bunch of unreliable witnesses and to manifest the concept that we are in the same position as all of those characters who told us THEIR story of Kane's life, the viewer obviously (for now) is the only witness to the first act of 'Citizen Kane' and the last chapter of Kane's life. It is this very event that gets the stone rolling. It makes us a witness and now the investigation of Kane's past life can begin. Now if you think of the interviewer/reporter who asks the people for Kane's story, we mostly see him from behind with the camera looking over his shoulders. Or he is obscured by shadows, a hat and (observating) glasses. Often he simply is off-screen altogether and we apparently are the interviewees' only listeners. The poor man is pretty much faceless. One could say that the interviewer, who never is fleshed out as a character - if you can even call him a character with an own identity - is taking the position of the viewer who witnessed his last word and who wants to find out what it means. You could look at it as an inside joke by Welles, that the very premise of the film is based on what initially looks like a goof. He waits until the last interview to tell us that the butler was actually in the room to witness the word, and now the film doesn't need us as witnesses anymore. We are done being witnesses, as now we have created our own individual image of Charles Foster Kane in our mind, based on everything we saw and heard. Maybe soon another viewer will trespass the the barriers of Xanadu, wondering who this man was. And this time he will walk up to us and ask us who Charles Foster Kane was, and we will be glad to tell him.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Few films in the history of cinema have received as much analysis &amp; acclaim as 'Citizen Kane'. This is most admired film of all times &amp; considered by many thinking men as a best piece of cinema by legendary actor, film maker Orson Welles. It is debut film of Orson Welles as a Director.America's largest &amp; most powerful landlord of Xanadu &amp; Newspaper tycoon Charles Foster Cane died with the last uttered word 'Rosebud' in the very initial scene. Next we see News clips &amp; documentary featuring the power &amp; riches story of his biography including his rise &amp; fall of empire covered by every news agency of the world. Now the million dollar question for the reporters is who or what this last spoken word 'Rosebud' supposed to mean. The flashbacks of Cane's life unfold by the other characters reveals the life story of social &amp; personal ups &amp; down of his life &amp; its really sentimental &amp; realistic portrayal I have ever seen. Welles has told the story of a man increasingly captive of his own needs. Even as the suspense about "Rosebud" unfolds in the last scene to the audience, it still remains enigma to figure out what it is. Orson Welles has done remarkable work here in acting &amp; direction &amp; production at the age of 25 &amp; its simply his inborn talent. Its character not only the character of lifetime for him but for the world of cinema to cherish forever. The movie's technical brilliance lies in its landmark B&amp;W cinematography by George Toland with apt use of light &amp; shadow &amp; deep focus photography. One can also notice the powerful lines of dialogues &amp; speech uttered by Cane throughout the film. Most of the principal actors in 'Citizen Cane' were new to the motion picture &amp; yet everyone performed extraordinary especially Joseph Cotten as Jad. The movie is regarded as the "world's best film by Sight &amp; Sound magazine in the last 40 years (1962-2002). It is quite sad to know that it was flop at box office but gradually became admirable classic as time passed. Nominated for 9 awards at 1942 Academy awards it only won one: Best Original Screenplay. A Pure Gold.Ratings- 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Expert On What People Will Think</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The problem with writing about a film like Citizen Kane is that with 809 previous comments on the boards here, there is little that hasn't been said already. The best you can do is not look at any others and express your own thoughts your own way.I've always felt the real reason that William Randolph Hearst so bitterly resented Orson Welles's masterpiece is that it got really too close to his own soul for him to be easy. Most folks who talk about Citizen Kane go for the obvious target, Welles's depiction of Marion Davies (Susan Alexander) as a no talent gold digger. In fact Welles himself in later years said he thought he was unfair to Davies then in Dorothy Comingore's performance. What Welles showed in Charles Foster Kane was the insincerity of his beliefs. The key line in Citizen Kane I've always thought was what Joseph Cotten said that his friend Charlie Kane had a lot of opinions, but didn't believe any of them. To this day serious biographers of Hearst still wonder exactly what he did believe when the day was done.Citizen Kane came up with a host of Oscar nominations, but only took home one award for original screenplay for Welles and Herman Mankiewicz. Original it certainly was in concept and execution.The role that was written by Welles and Mankiewicz and directed by Welles for Welles is one of the greatest roles ever written for any film actor. The technique of Citizen Kane is always discussed, the flashbacks told from many points of view for the audience to get a grasp of what the title character was all about. What's not discussed is Welles himself.What he does in fact is give several performances of the same man in one film. Welles reinterprets Kane five or six times depending on whose flashback we're seeing. He's a scared child being taken from his parents, he's a rich frat boy and incorrigible scamp as seen by George Couloris the J.P. Morgan like banker, he's an idealist and crusader as seen by his business manager Everette Sloane, a man with no core set of beliefs who will do anything to bend the public to approval by his closest and maybe his only real friend Joseph Cotten, a lonely man with a compulsion for real love by Dorothy Comingore, and as an aging tyrant by butler Paul Stewart. Welles makes every one of these Kanes come alive and each relates to the other.The names of all those I've mentioned in the cast before were from Welles's Mercury Theater Company, nearly all went on to substantial movie careers. Others from the cast who did are Ray Collins, Agnes Moorehead, Ruth Warrick, and Erskine Sanford. I don't think any other film comes close to introducing so many talented players to the screen.The film begins with the aged Kane's death and that single word 'Rosebud' which sends everyone scrambling to find out just what he had on his mind in his final moments on earth. Those searching never do find out, but you the audience does and the unveiling of Charles Foster Kane's inner soul is something once seen and never forgotten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lot less heavy than I expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into this knowing of its great reputation, but fearing it would be very slow and boring with a lot of dialogue and a heavy 'moral message'. Although it did have an underlying message (and a very strong and well made one too), the film wasn't at all what I expected; the camera work and music in particular livened it up, and at times it was quite light hearted. I think this helped make the emotional scenes all the more powerful. It kept me gripped all the way, and I don't have a long attention span. The acting throughout is superb, with very little of the overacting that you might expect from this period, with Welles in particular giving an outstanding performance in the lead role. My advice is give it a try, even if you think it's not your type of film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's more than just a great looking movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What makes a great film? In my opinion it is the following: #1.Photography (most important because it IS a film. If it's shot badly, then your skrood.) NOTE: I consider the best filmmakers to be great cinematographers first, such as Stanley Kubrick, Steven Spielberg, Etc.#2. Directing/Editing (I lump the two together because the director really edits what is going on while it's being filmed, then finishes the process in the cutting room)#3. Acting (If we can't believe the people, we've lost it. But, bad acting can be corrected in the cutting room, and with multiple takes).#4. Sound and Music (If what we hear doesn't fit, the movie might as well be silent).Now, this is all well and good for a movie that tells a great story. Add to that a serious dose of style, ingenuity, and passion, all of which can be found in each frame of Citizen Kane.Citizen Kane isn't just a great movie with great characters, a great cast, great music from Bernard Herrmann or great photography. At the time of its creation it was like a cannon shot from the camp of RKO at the media moguls who were dominating the minds of people at the time.This message was not only important to the American public who had a right to objective journalism, but also because we were seeing the affects of divisiveness over the airwaves thanks to Hitler, and the power that comes from shaping the perceptions of the masses needed to be acknowledged from a semi-fictional standpoint, and Wells did it with so much energy and style you can't help but admire this work even 60+ years later. Citizen Kane shook the rafters of the media, and even though they played it down, everybody at the time was feeling the quake.Above all else, Citizen Kane tells the story of a man who is a victim of his own success, a story that can never be told enough.When you see Citizen Kane, you're not just watching a well made film, you're watching a piece of art, a piece of history, and a timeless story of how power corrupts.Absolutely.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Give Welles due credit as actor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Enough has been said in the comments about the use of lighting, directorial and editing techniques, etc. I love this movie and each time watch it enthralled. The plot moves along brilliantly, and while many of the techniques have been applied by countless filmmakers since, there's still something about seeing the trailblazer in all its glory - especially as it still holds up. But I just want to give Welles due credit for his acting. I think part of the absolute magic and impact of this film is Welles' ability to transmit a sense of someone larger than life in every way. When he's caught up in the chase of a great story - or the creation of it - his intelligence and vision and sheer conniving brilliance emanate from his every gesture and word. He is expansive and dynamic, he was incredibly handsome, and he seemed to burst from the screen when playing the young Kane. The figure of Welles himself creates a powerful internal tension within the film because he lights up an otherwise dark, morose palette. In many ways, his character has nothing to do with Hearst - Welles himself was a force of nature, and in some ways Citizen Kane is a prophetic vision of his own fate in Hollywood. Welles was a great actor, as was his co-star, Joseph Cotton, one of the great understated actors of the screen. Cotton is a perfect foil for Welles - as he is in that other absolute masterpiece (not directed by Orson), "The Third Man" - because he hints at his own uneasy depths which are always being stirred up by Welles, whether as Kane or Harry Lime. I also see the end of Apocalypse Now, with Brando's dark, isolated, ruminating semi-madman as an homage of sorts to Welles alone in Kane's castle at the end of Citizen Kane. The two greatest burn-out male geniuses of the American silver screen, both gorgeous in their time and both expanding into bloated ruins, their "potential" often seen as unrealized - but both perhaps having transcended even those expectations of themselves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perhaps it was the best movie 60 years ago.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Citizen Kane is about the life of a notorious media mogul. Based on the life of an actual person, this film takes us through his life as he finds love, power,etc. Considered as one of the best motion pictures of all time and granted the tittle of technically brilliant.To me this film was bad. It might have been brilliant in terms of art, direction and on a technical level but, all of those aspects make a movie great? The answer is no. I think most people pretend to like this film just because is supposed to be great. Don't get me wrong, I think I can appreciate its achievement in the aspects I mentioned above, but the merits of this self-indulgent film end there. It was really boring, the plot was just average and the acting was terrible. I really hated Kane's wife. Comingore was a lousy actress, her accent was bad and all the emphasis she put when her character asked questions was like torture.As I said before, this movie is so self-indulgent that it almost feels like Welles knew beforehand all the praise he would receive in the future. What I can't believe is that this film is often compared to Casablanca (Well, compete would be more accurate) when people talk about classics. That was a great movie and there's no way this film can compete with it.I don't recommend this title to anyone, unless you claim to be a film lover. In that case you should see it just because it is "the best movie of all times". You will judge if that is correct or not after you saw it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest movies of all time...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Orson Welles' 1941 masterpiece, "Citizen Kane" is widely hailed as one of the greatest movies ever made, and AFI placed it atop their 100 MOVIES list. Don't get me wrong, this is not a mega-Hollywood blockbuster. There are no explosions, the movie is sixty-four yrs. old, and it is in black and white. Some people will stop reading this here, but I would seriously advise anyone who has not seen this classic story of power, life, love, loss, and death to rent or buy it immediately. The B&amp;W cinematography, and the nostalgic, almost haunting feel to the lighting and the "deep focus" camera-work draws you in to the outstanding visuals. The visuals! From the opening shots of Kane's storybook like castle (no reavealing anything about that here!) to the crane shots over the bar in the rain, the movie is a stimulating and detailed picture to watch. Not only that, but the story is rich and detailed, and structured beautifully, with Orson Welles playing the title role as a recently deceased newspaper tycoon, a la William Randolph Hearst. A powerful and both loved and hated public figure, a young reporter is sent with the task of finding the meaning of his last words, and in turn takes a journey through flashbacks and meetings with various people connected with the gigantic tyrant. You leave the story as confused and as haunted as you come in, but it doesn't matter. The acting, visuals, and timeless story draws you in and leaves you with a film classic that is not easily forgotten. Highly influential and an American classic, "Citizen Kane" is an outstanding drama any real movie buff will appreciate.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>They say that the Bush-Kerry race is full of negative campaigning, but neither candidate has yet gone so far as to pledge that, when elected, his first act will be to see to the "indictment, prosecution, and conviction" of his opponent. Charley Kane does, though, so much for political civility, not to mention guaranteeing a fair trial.Re-watching "Citizen Kane" at any one time is to discover it anew. There are a lot of great films, great because of the way they advanced the art of film, which don't burn their way into your brain and heart the way "Kane" does, finding new ways to amaze every time you watch it. The wonder of "Kane" 63 years later is not only its greatness, but how much doggone fun it is.Orson Welles made a film so electric, so outrageous, so simultaneously joyous and sad, it's a wonder it did as well as it did, getting nominated for a Best Picture Oscar and winning the prize for best screenplay. So ahead of its time in so many ways, it's a wonder too RKO ever released the thing, even without significant pressure from William Randolph Hearst to destroy the movie because he believed, not completely correctly, that it was all a big dig at him."Kane" manages to be entertaining from first to last. Its quick cuts and clever transitions have only benefited from the MTV generation like few films of its time, yet it also retains a certain classic Hollywood grandeur, in its gaslit sets, black-and-white compositions, Joseph Cotten's marcelled hair, and the endlessly quotable dialogue.And it's often hilarious, too. Sometimes in very overt, slapstick ways, like Signore Matiste's music lessons to the impossibly amateurish Susan Alexander Kane. Sometimes in cleverly sardonic ways, like when we see Bernstein examining the alternative headlines the morning after Kane's unsuccessful gubernatorial bid. There's more subtle jests, some which require multiple viewings. I just caught one, where Kane first makes the acquaintance of Susan Alexander by taking her up on her offer of "hot water." She provides the hot water alright, as Boss Gettys makes sure.Welles performs the rare trick of making intelligence fun, his own as well as the viewer's. It's a magic show that has lost none of its power all these decades later.Welles was only 25 when he directed and starred in this, his first real film role, but he already made his mark on popular culture as something of a trickster in 1938, when he convinced millions of radio listeners the Earth was under Martian attack in his adaptation of "The War Of The Worlds." "Kane" starts out with similar trickery, putting up a fake newsreel of the kind moviegoers were accustomed to seeing back then. Welles himself was quoted as saying the whole identity of "Rosebud" was a bit of a blind alley, "dime-store Freud" he called it, but the notion works, not only in setting up an air of mystery to the proceedings (shades of film noir, the genre that immediately succeeded Hollywood's Golden Age that concluded with "Kane") but asking a question that Welles' own life seems to beg in retrospect. When is greatness enough for its own sake, and when is it just a way people isolate themselves from the rest of humanity?It's a shame that "Kane" didn't launch a series of Mercury Theatre productions, not just the truncated "Magnificent Ambersons" and the weird "Journey Into Fear" but a slew of other films, as Welles and his team once envisioned. It fed a bit of a myth, of Welles as an artistic martyr. Welles did suffer from his vision, but he also suffered from being Welles, impossible, petulant, and mercurial. "Kane" suffers a bit, too, seen too often as a start not followed through on by its prime creator than as a brilliant individual achievement that has fed so many other great minds since its release.A couple of reviews down, someone calls this "another boring black and white film," and I almost peed in my pants. Not from anger, but laughter. People can think what they want about "Kane," and they will anyway, but as Matiste would say, "some people have it, and some don't." Give it a chance; you won't be sorry.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I rate "Citizen Kane" 4/10 and that too just for the ONLY 3 best things about this Movie - Cinematography, Acting &amp; the suspense about 'Rosebud'.After understanding "Citizen Kane"'s high acclaim &amp; its status as one of the finest movie ever made, I was very curious to see this Film. I was definitely disappointed by far end. Indeed its boring especially in first half &amp; has some very inconsistent characterization &amp; scripting. Many things remain unexplained.The Philosophical strength I feel could have been understood by very less number of people because of its inconsistent characterization &amp; many loose ends.Its a story about Charles Kane who becomes heir to huge wealth when he was a child. Kane when grows up, instead of investing in Gold Mines or getting professional consultancies for his investments, intends to run a Newspaper company &amp; starts endowing his wealth in it. Here is where Kane is shown as a Non-greedy, humble &amp; wise person who aims to reach his readers with the best &amp; truthful News, which he &amp; his team can. But at the same time we learn later, that he is self-centered some times. He spends his wealth in a monumental palace known as Xanadu &amp; disregards the aspirations of his wife. At one point he is shown wise, ambitious &amp; a person who plan things &amp; achieves success. On other side we see that nothing works good for him as he keeps failing in later part of his life. Not because of just some ill-fate, but because of some motivation &amp; intelligence aspects which he was capable to do at some points but never attempts to do. Its a major contradiction in his characterization.We learn that Charles Kane was just a Tycoon because of his wealth which he inherited. Whereas he was absolutely incapable of monumenting or expanding his empire. His approach to get involve in politics was for betterment of people &amp; not for any status benefits. Just when he met Susan Alexander (a small time singer), everything after that turns wrong. He marries her &amp; things turn worst. He looses the election, incurs huge losses in Newspaper business &amp; finally we see him settled down in his Xanadu living his last days. After Susan leaves him, Charles die with his last words "Rosebud".One thing is sure, We are never allowed to get into the character of Kane. Whoever saw this movie, cannot tell what kind of person was Charles Kane. This I feel is a definite Script error for Characterisation. Orson Welles instead spent much of his ideas &amp; efforts in Art Direction &amp; Cinematography. But that does not solve purpose. We are talking about movies, which means entertainment. Where is the Substance? Where is the intensity &amp; drama &amp; understanding of the characters ? We know that he runs a Newspaper Company. The Scenes concerning only shows how Kane counts his number of readers &amp; how he throws party. What about his involvement &amp; personal approaches which boosted his business ? What Speciality does Kane have ?? There is no answer to this. No Salient Features about Newspaper Company is shown !! The First half is boring, but the second half gains some intensity. We slightly get gripped with it. The second half, when Kane's bad fate begins to overcome his life. Kane tries high to captivate success for his new love. He builds Opera for her but she was not skilled enough to hold the audience's applaud. She fails. But that failure was of Kane. His decisions never fruitified. He keeps failing. Things go wrong &amp; one his best friend who worked for the Newspaper, too leaves him.But characterization.... still a problem. While watching the movie we get discomfort that Hey Man ... somewhere something is lacking !!! The Story just donot land up in right corner. There is no emotional bond created with the audience. We do not feel any relishment while watching the friendships &amp; love relationships which Kane tries to maintain with various other characters. Although Charles Kanes emotions are tried to be reflected but we feel that it must've became a struggle for Orson Welles.I cannot land up in a right corner about this Movie. Of course it is Overrated, but narrating some good points &amp; bad points are necessary.Plus Points : 1. Cinematography : In word is Excellent. 2. Kane's Psychological behavior : His Ego during break off with his Friend Leland / His belief &amp; Self-Satisfaction for his Performing Wife, Susan. 3. Acting : I feel Orson Welles' Act as Citizen Kane is one of the finest amongst any classic movies.4. The Suspense about Rosebud : It absolutely justifies the Psychological realization of the dying Charles Kane.5. An innovative Non-Linear Story telling which probably was influential attribute during those days. 6. And the Best Scene of the Movie : The Night of the Opera - No words to describe it.Bad Points : 1. Inconsistent Characterisation of Charles Kane 2. Weak briefing about the Working Pattern / Sources of Revenue &amp; Team Work of the Newspaper Company 3. Boring first half 4. Very Bad Performance by Dorothy as Susan Kane 4. Xanadu scenes which were over directed &amp; the reasoning of Charles Kane's decision to live in Xanadu which was not shown 5. Some pathetic scenes like Jigsaw Puzzle 6. Lengthy 7. Poor dialogs etc. etc. &amp; many other bad points.Finally, Citizen Kane MAY BE a story about a Person who is like any common man. His incapability for being a Tycoon &amp; governing Monetary interests formed his down-to-earth personality which also becomes the reason for his failure like how Orson Welles failed in this over - directed project now an overrated classic !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Greatest movie of all time?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm sorry for saying this but, in my opinion there are much better films. And for people who think this is just The Best, please don't just go off talking about how wrong i am or how i don't know anything. I'm not saying it was bad, cause i did enjoy it, I'm just stating that I've seen much better films. MUCH better films, like Chinatown and The Shawshank Redemption. But in my opinion, picking the best film of all time is difficult but i think it could've gone to a better film.I mean, i frankly didn't like Orson Welles. At all. He was just extremely annoying at parts, and i know that the character wasn't meant to be the greatest guy in the world, or a good guy at all, but listening to Orson Welles and also knowing he directed it gave me a bit of a headache. I mean whats the point of giving his film "Greatest Film of All Time" if he doesn't even appreciate the film industry. To me, its just mocking other better films and directors. Thus, i change my mind, i don't really like Citizen Kane. AT ALL.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Citizen Kane is a classic, a truly great movie, one of the best movies ever, it is completely great. Rosebud is such a great line, I loved this movie. The story is amazing, everything is amazing, it truly won an worthy Oscar. The screenplay is also truly great, the dialogue and characters and everything are great. The acting is great, Orson Welles is amazing in the lead, great. The direction is great, Orson Welles again is a very talented filmmaker in every way, he's a great actor, great writer, great director, and this is his best film. The visual effects are great, amazing. Its great for now, much less 1941, how did they get so great visual effects than, they didn't exist. Citizen Kane is one of the best movies ever put on film, every one should see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It never gets old. I remember I first watched it back in 2008, and I was mesmerized, it sucked me in like Star Wars did when I was seven. It never ceases to be entertaining and fun, and yet Kane is such a sad character. Seen only from the perspectives of his friends after his death and from the cold machinery of a newsreel, no one really knows Kane, and sadly not even Kane himself, who after being second-guessed out of his childhood and subsequently second-guessing himself throughout life in search of his new stage or "snowglobe" in which to play, finds himself gazing through his own void, in pain and depression, with only the frozen memory of his happiness uttered in eternity through the walls of his palace in a single word. Through greed and misanthropy disguised in benevolent intentions Kane finds himself in a prison of things and empty halls, all new toys he acquired and just as hastily discarded, still a child when he played newspaper man, collecting his statues like action figures, all more things to fill the empty void in his life. When the one person he comes close to loving, Susan Alexander, leaves him, he no longer has anything to cling to and so destroys himself and lives a life of regret and longing. Susan Alexander is the only one who might have got through cage and saved him, someone who knew nothing of his reputation but just liked him for a night, but he imprisons her too like a pet.The film shows the effect Kane's lifelong self-destruction has on others, particularly Susan Alexander who ends up depressed and alone, and Jed Leland (Joseph Cotten is great as always) the cynic who sees through Kane's glib charm for what he is.I can relate to Kane, he's a very human character I think many can relate to. He may have had a way out of his pain with Susan Alexander, but it never happened, the damage was done early on. He was taken away from his sled and into the care of a cold, serious, heartless man upon discovery of gold on his mother's land. His mother seemed very attached and maybe he wanted to be perfect in his mother's eyes too, Leland mentioned that he loved his mother.In the end it seems there is catharsis for Kane, as all his possessions are burned and his precious sled too, the truth of his famous last word incinerated forever into the atmosphere. It's very powerful and striking to see all the worth of this man's life turned into black smoke. The imagery in the film is striking and the way it's filmed too. Seeing Kane walk through a hall of mirrored reflections really makes me you feel his loneliness visually, and that's what cinema is all about.Citizen Kane is held up on a pedestal, and much has been and written about it, but beyond the huge importance it has in film history, it's just a really entertaining, fun classic that anyone can watch and enjoy and relate to, not just film buffs, and that's why it's so fondly remembered.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Citizen Kane was the first movie I watched from the pre-war era, and maybe because I kept comparing other movies to this is why I couldn't appreciate some movies the way I liked this. Why's citizen kane this good? Because it has actual thematics even today. The whole movie is a sort of mockumentary/fake biopic of a multi-billionaire and some of the events in his life, a sort of a hunt for the scoop made by a journalist. The way the movie's plot is built is just great. Without counting the cinematographic pros that citizen kane has every other aspect was just great. To those who claim that they're cinephiles yet affirm that they got bored while watching this and fell asleep.... This film is much less slow than any Tarkovskij film, what would happen to them if they watched a Tarkovskij film? Like, they fall asleep at the opening credits?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An example of excellent visual storytelling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mysterious - art house classic. The idea of Citizen Kane is interesting in itself, but the presentation exceeds the idea. Citizen Kane perfectly presents flashbacks, witnessing Charles Foster Kane's childhood, his rise and fall from power, the more time passes through the film,the more depth is added, a circular structure. Citizen Kane is surrounded by a cloud of mystery, the mystery seemingly building up to something great. Citizen Kane is mostly told visually, doing so, better than words ever could. Citizen Kane is a rich experience, and all its detail adds up to what Welles is succeeding in telling you about themes of the movie: power, human frailty, the circumstances that make a mere man into something bigger, the men who shapes their own times, and the problems that men like this will have in life as they interact with normal mortals.Visually impressive, still to this day. It has plenty of exceedingly long takes, making it much more immersive. Citizen Kane was innovative, such as, it didn't go in for close ups on characters' faces to show emotion, Orson Welles allows the audience to choose what they want to watch within the frame. With this kind of filmmaking, it's very clear what the characters are thinking and feeling as it's being shown right in front of you, doing so, Orson Welles chose to give the audience more freedom - he respected the audiences' intelligence. Citizen Kane is one of the most effective films when it comes to film studies, as it's pretty much an entire film studies course in the space of 2 hours. Citizen Kane has a lot of visual symbolism, much of its visual symbolism has been for me quite enjoyable analysing. It doesn't depend on the visual symbolism, rather its visual storytelling, every shot is filled with all these little meaningful stylistic touches that add to the story, ''telling more than a thousand words.''Bernard Herrmann's score is in my opinion, not anything special, though it still fits the mystery and pace of Citizen Kane. Welles, himself, would often edit the film to fit the rhythm or length of Herrmann's compositions, which can be seen in such scenes as background music whilst Thompson reads the Thatcher papers is reminiscent of the slow unrelenting tick of a clock.Orson Welles perfectly portrays and captures the spirit of Charles Foster Kane, as a young man, and he even delivers a convincing performance as an old empty man. The rest of the cast are passable, as there are no other stand out performances than Orson Welles' character, Kane.Recommended for both film buffs and the mainstream movie goer, even people whom like classic theatre or great novels of high rank. The story's pace is pretty fast forward, though some scenes may feel slow compared to modern movies. Some may find it boring, a lot of mixed thoughts on it, from my friends, whom I've seen it with. I, myself love this movie, it has this mystery laying around it, where the end, at first viewing left me silent, thinking over it - I love such endings!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Absence That Negates The Whole</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead:Yes, if you don't understand that this movie is about William Randolph Hearst, in a very thinly veiled way, such that it didn't escape his notice, it will bore the crap out of you. It mirrors his life so well that the studio's legal team kibitzed eternally putting off releasing it. When they did, they all waited for the building to fall upon them. Welles himself said that Hearst knew it was about him. He relays that anecdote: about being in an elevator with Hearst, who steadfastly ignored him, with his back facing him. As his floor neared, Hearst involuntarily turned towards Orson and said,"Son, what was this Citizen Kane crap all about?" Welles said what I am going to say, it is about that verse from Mark about a man gaining the whole world yet losing his own soul? What was the point?" Orson said, he snorted disgustedly, and stormed out of the elevator. Rosebud: what does it mean? It is the name of the boy's sled, when he was loved, living with people caring for him. Remember what he is grasping when he says the word and dies? A snowy globe that hearkens us back to the beginning when he is taken away from his happiness to be trained as an industrialist. His entire life makes sense if you understand this scene. He lives in a palace, with a trophy wife, filling it with possessions from all over the entire world. He, in typical Kane fashion, calls it Xanadu.His badly singing, trophy wife is but another possession. The riddle of Kane is in this attempt to regain that lost love that is the ontological difference between happiness and unhappiness: the presence or absence of love. The lesson of Citizen Kane is that one can not materialize love by buying objects and then attempting to, like a vampire, suck existential value from these material goods. As the movie shows the ridiculous amount of crap he has stuffed in his house, you are seeing the exact mathematical amount of how unloved he feels. When he says Rosebud, and the globe rolls upon the floor, you now understand everything you are about to watch: his extorting of approval, popularity and praise from others. Jedidiah still cares for him even after he insisted he write the piece, praised it, then fired him. Never miss how Orson delineates him as a blockhead. His political pronouncements are always wrong, consistently. Beginning with his quixotic naiveté about Hitler, continuing through the story that he could have silenced but, stupidly, decided to fight and lose over, the man is not the brightest bulb in the box. The two themes are not unrelated: his lack of ontological reflection upon the forces that are whipping him forward, damaging himself and others, to stuff more ridiculous crap in his temple to that little, rejected boy with his sleigh. That is Kane, that is what the ending means: his entire life was a quest to become big enough that people would be forced to love him, whether they liked it or not. Yes, friends, the verse from Mark, Orson himself said was the message of this classic. Why should you watch it? Maybe because a whole way of human life is predicated upon it: Materialism. The tragic belief that one's lifestyle: house, car, clothes and travel, magically convey upon the person great existential value. The point of the movie is to show you an ontological failure; a man who never grasped the insanity of acquisition to acquire love that can never be bought, only freely given. Yes, I find it long also, it has many slow parts; I own it because it reminds me of a way of life I reject, indeed that my entire being is founded upon its negation. Like Barry Lyndon, the point of this classic is a cautionary tale: always be aware, as much as you can, of the forces driving your predilections or their slave you shall always be, my friends. When your heart stops, like mine will, it all belongs to another. We may take only our love and goodness with us.

		<shortDescription>Powerful drama, fast paced</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Citizen Kane is a great movie, a first of its kind to include a novelistic character arc, depth, scope and technical innovations that hadn't been so successfully directed previously, although given that hundreds of thousands of films were produced throughout the 20th Century, the claim that Kane is the "greatest movie of all time" is just glowing hyperbole.But is the film really good? Yep. Follows the story of an impoverished child that lucks out with a land deed that makes him a super-wealthy industrialist (a plutocrat, really) and owner of multiple newspapers, he's a media tycoon and philanthropist who's designs for nationwide (global?) power and influence are bought down by the sensationalistic media and personality politics that he himself had made a lions share of his fortune from.The acting is strong, every scene and sentence either moves the plot forward or develops character - if only Hollywood movies these days could follow these two concepts without digressing into pointless CGI "franchise" movies that infantalize their audience and dazzle them with computer rendered frames that the brain unconsciously recognizes as fake anyway, but besides all that, Kane is a movie about a seemingly real man, and an era: the American century.I don't subscribe to the notion of American exceptionalism, and am not actually American at all (even if I did live there, I wouldn't consider myself) but the film is really about the birth of a culturally, and economically new power apart from "the old country", with new values, new leaders and new forms of equality and mass media. The film also explores the inherent contradictions and hypocrisies of the new ruling class of the 20th century; Kane goes from being a genuinely useful idealist, to being an obscenely wealthy fool, trying to dignify the lot of the working class (his own social roots) by pushing a music retail clerk and mediocre stage singer to the level of stardom through his own great wealth and media influence. You can see parallels to today's society in every sequence of Citizen Kane, and its worth seeing more than once.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Citizen Kane (1941): Dir: Orson Welles / Cast: Orson Welles, Joseph Cotton, Everett Sloane, Dorothy Comingore, Agnes Moorehead: Portrait of a wasted life full of luxury opening with Charles Foster Kane who whispers the word "Rosebud." With that he dies releasing an ornament that crashes to the floor such as his life. During his life he had alienated himself from everyone, focusing on a political career. Those who knew him are interviewed examining the meaning of his final words. Speculations evaporate into flashbacks to show his brief childhood to his introduction into the world of politics. Directed by Orson Welles who was only twenty-five when he directed this film, and its impact would render it his masterpiece. He also takes to acting and flawlessly portrays Kane through his adult life and mirrors his frustration and longing for the one thing he missed. Outstanding supporting work by Joseph Cotton and Everett Sloane who portray friends of Kane's who also worked with him, and both with different results career wise. Dorothy Comingore plays his mistress who grows tired and depressed until her only option is to leave. Agnes Moorehead plays Kane's mother who reluctantly makes the decision along with his father that ultimately affects his entire life. Brilliantly constructed with astonishing imagery and Welles revealing the big payoff in the final shot. Score: 10 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Rosebud" marked the last words of Orson Welles' character in his debut motion picture Citizen Kane one of the best movies ever made. The movie stars Orson Welles as Charles Foster Kane a newspaper tycoon who recently passed away and a whole lot of reporters scramble to find out what the last words "Rosebud" really meant, not only that it also tells the major events that happened in his life. The movie stars Orson Welles in a superb performance as Kane a man who not only wanted to become a newspaper tycoon but also wanted to become the governor of New York state but unfortunately for him lost the election. The movie combines a lot of genres such as drama, romance, comedy, mystery and suspense. Writers Herman J. Mankiewicz and Orson Welles made a screenplay that was very suspenseful and interesting and the most important part was what Kane's last utterance "Rosebud" really meant. There was a lot of other good performances throughout Joseph Cotten (in his film debut), Agnes Moorehead, Dorothy Comingore, and especially the director, producer and star Orson Welles. the movie may seem a little confusing at times but it still is a great movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>before i watch citizen Kane i was expecting a complicated, boring and slow paced movie. nevertheless i wanted to watch it to see what is all the fuss about. and i was surprised that it was a well made movie and i understand why people calling it a masterpiece of all time. i watched it once and maybe there are somethings that i didn't pay attention to. but anyway, this is my review of the movie. keep in mind that English is not my first language, so i apologize in advance for any possible error. ..... when Kane was a kid his parents send him to city so he may be fortunate and wealthy and have a better life. he loved his mother and didn't want to go, but his mother chose that wealth is better than love for him. it made an impression on Kane. he for the rest of his life seeks love through wealth and fame. he tries to buy the love of people, friends, even his wives with money. he can't love, but wants to be loved. he lost millions of dollars trying to keep the newspaper running because he doesn't care about money, it doesn't mean anything to him. for him, it is a tool to buy something that he didn't have as a child. at the end of his life, his wife was the last person that could love him and when she left, there was nobody else. people didn't love him, his wives left him, he fired his (maybe only) friend and he realize that he lost everything he fought for in life. when he see the snow ball, it reminds him of the day he was playing and making snowman when he was a child. it reminds him a name, a name that he forgot for a long time, "rosebud", the sled he used to play with as a child. rosebud is the reminiscent of his childhood. the story is good, acting is good and the way of story telling is great. it was not boring or complicated for me, but i get it that for some people it may be boring. many people says that the movie has a slow pace but i disagree. the only problem i can think of is that it is hard to get attached to characters and i think that's why some people get bored. but i was interested in the story and Kane's character and followed the movie easily. citizen Kane is a great movie and i know i will watch it again some day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will not discuss whether this is the greatest film ever made or not. There is no greatest film. You either like a film or you don't. No one film is the supreme film, as there is no one book that is the best, no one song and so on.Citizen Kane is Orson Welles debut feature made in 1941. He was commissioned to make it by RKO features after he got some fame from the now infamous 1938 broadcast of the war of the worlds. He got the chance to develop his own script use his own actors and crew and had a lot of creative control and thus we got Citizen Kane.Citizen Kane is about a man: his life, his trials, his tribulations, his ups, his downs and finally his death. The movie opens with what is now one of the most iconic scenes in movie history. An aging Charles Foster Kane played by Orson welles himself lets slip a snowglobe as he utters his final words " Rosebud "From then on we are taken on a journey through his life. And we watch the talent of welles unfold. Maybe it is his career in radio and theatre but Welles can do one thing and that is tell a story. There is not one dull or uninteresting moment in the film. The story unfolds in a brilliant manner and you are completely sucked into the world of Charles Foster Kane that is so well created by Welles and portrayed by his hand picked crewWelles has created a fascinating character study in Charles Foster Kane. There have been so many great men and everyone has always tried to scratch away at the surface at try to reach the whole truth about what a man was. Welles tries to show that there is no one truth or no one answer to a man's life. Life is so vast and so varied that every man at one point is occupied in living so man different lives that it is impossible for anyone to gauge what one action or one word meant.The final monologue is filled with profundity. Even if parts of the movie seem aged (none did to me) that final monologue will always remain relevant as will the movie .And I am giving it a 10 not because I am another admirer of the emperor's new clothes. I could have given it an 8 or a 9 but now it has become cool to hate Citizen Kane. To protest against these people citizen Kane deserves a 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why I don't like this movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is critically acclaimed as the greatest movie of all time. In addition to critical opinions, it is ranked 33 in the top 250. I went into this film, fully expecting to be blown away by the acting, plot, storytelling, and music. I was none of these things. I have no complaints with the acting, and the story is told effectively through the use of flashback.The music is for the most part not bad, although it does not set the mood as effectively as the works of John Williams or Bernard Herrmann (Alfred Hitchcock), nor is it integral to the movie like the works of Danny Elfman (Tim Burton) or Enrico Morricone (Sergio Leone). One song in the middle of the film is supposed to be a composition written for Welles' character, and it is atrocious. I won't criticize the operatic parts, as they are intentionally sub par. All in all, the music is unremarkable.Where this movie really fails is the plot. It is the most boring movie I have ever seen. Many movies, such as "12 Angry Men," contain no action, yet rank among the greatest and most captivating movies ever made. This movie is not one of them. The plot drags at a snails pace, and not very interesting in the first place. A few things are well done, such as the slow reveal of Kane's first relationship, and the twist at the end with Rosebud is impressive, but hardly enough to save the movie.Many people call Citizen Kane timeless. I disagree. While the media still exercises considerable power today, the very way we access information has changed in the digital age. However, the death of newspapers does not kill this movie, as by that logic, any period piece would bore audiences. What kills this movie is how boring the plot is. I found myself not caring about 20 minutes into the movie. By the end of the movie, I cared even less. This movie is terrible, and though I speak against the widely accepted critical opinion of it, I am not afraid to say it because I truly believe that this movie ranks with the worst of them. I would rather watch Manos the Hands of Fate, because at least with that movie I can laugh at how bad it is. With Citizen Kane I can only cry.</fullReview>

It uses a lot of deep focus, which required a decent amount of skill and was an out-of-the-box thing to do. one indoor scene stands out particularly for its beauty and play with light. the only light coming into the room is natural sunlight streaming in to a dark, smoky room from small windows high on the wall. other scenes were shot from ground level, also an unusual way of filming. "Citizen Kane" is really different, really clever, and and excellent film to watch for those who appreciate more than just an interesting story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Citizen Kane, Rosebud and Little Big Horn</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have something to add to the various layers of meaning that Rosebud may harbour, that I don't think has yet been mentioned on this site. I recently learned that the Rosebud was the name of the main river of which the Little Big Horn was a tributary, and was also the scene of a battle between the Americans and the Sioux during which the American forces were routed. As a direct result of this they were not able to arrive in time to prevent the defeat of Custer's Ninth Cavalry at the battle of Greasy Grass. The subsequent massacre by the Sioux provoked outrage throughout America, leading to the destruction of the Sioux nation and, by inference, native American culture.Could this have something to do with the movie's theme about the loss of America's innocence through the allegorical figure of Kane? It seems likely that this was considered when choosing the name of Kane's sled, and adds, for me, yet another layer of meaning to this phenomenal piece of cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is my favorite film. Biblical flicks are in a category all its own.It's screenplay uses elements from every movie genre except sci-fi as its reaching beyond imagination. But in terms of imagery it takes a little bit of everything. The beginning plays as an early Hollywood horror story; darkness, fog; the later Hitchcock film Psycho brings to mind Kane's castle "Xandu" it's featureless house, other than its dark shape, looming in the moonlight. Don't touch it's cinematography; it'd be akin to making Gone With the Wind black and white.The ending left me a pleasant mishmash of emotions. It's a deliciously fragmented piece the outer manifestation of the story telling, Susan's obsession with puzzles and the gradual corruption of Kane's personality is pieced together by those he came in contact with. Neither are finished--but that's the the aspect of this masterpiece that sets it apart; Welles keeps his characters unperceptive of what made him tick. In his divulging the film's nagging question, Welles concludes its ending opposite of the style he had employed throughout--successfully drawing the "Rosebud" mystery away from the compilation of putting together by the characters then waving the answer in front his face--It's impact upon me was a jumble, none of it "lame": bowled over how the answer had indeed been provided albeit fleeting much earlier. It's a touch of sadness; for the reporter's quest remaining unsolved and those in contact with Kane never understood him. He was an enigma.Between creepy beginning and mind-blowing ending, poignant, touches of comedy, those in Kane's life (especially promoting his "singing" second wife) and the title character's slide; from champion of the people to absorption of his infallibility.Concerned over repeating myself and not describing it to the digress I want without spoiling it, I'm closing it by recommending While watching it (and please watch it; it'd be worth one's while) Keep those reminiscing about Kane as separate puzzle pieces while watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Theme through Music and Sound</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The theme of this film is supported through its use of music and sound: The self-centered attraction for money, power and materialism leads to a loss of childhood innocence, pollution of family, empty and shallow values, and an inevitable self-realization of retrospective regret. The opening scene begins with a darkening minor bass-horn which produces a cold, mysterious, and empty atmosphere. The viewer sees a mega-mansion in the background perched on top of a hill with a luminous light spilling out through an open window. As images of the mansion move closer and closer towards the window, the music crescendo's louder and louder and finally climaxes with a sudden bass/drum roll as the light turns off inside. The tension and release of the parallel music here suggests that something dramatic has, or is about to take place inside that room. It is a musical cue to what the viewer is about to uncover?that is, the light of the world's largest newspaper tycoon has just turned off, or died. Diegetic and non-diegetic music is used frequently throughout the film to help convey the rise of Kane's empire of selfishness, his attraction for money and power, his manipulation on public opinion, and the pollution of his family. A diegetic song written specifically to hail Kane as a great newspaper publisher is sung during a banquet party his staff throws for him. Here Kane is seen as the center of attention as he dances with a group of women who flower over him and sing praises to his name. This song expressly demonstrates the rise of Kane's egotism. Even earlier in the film during the news reel sequence, a tapestry of events from Kane's life is displayed with non-diegetic drums and pompous horns to help reflect Kane's smugness towards money and power. During a time-lapsed sequence over Kane eating breakfast with his first wife, both mickey-mousing and non-diegetic elements are used to heighten the disintegration of his first marriage. Fast-paced camera swipes (accompanied with the tingling of bells and strings) are mickey-moused with the progression of each scene?showing the further decay of their marriage each time. The non-diegetic music becomes more and more morose to enhance and foreshadow the inevitable divorce. Sound is also used to capture the empty and regretful life of Kane. During a particular scene with his second wife constructing a jigsaw puzzle, he engages her in a shallow conversation about not wanting to move to New York. As he walks through the immensely spacious halls of the mansion, their voices are heard deeply echoing off the empty and lonely walls?giving the impression of isolation. This diegetic sound is to reflect Kane's inner emptiness and loss of personal childhood innocence to the debauchery of materialism. Sound becomes dramatic and crucial in the scene where Kane's second wife leaves him. As he tears apart the materialized and wealthy room he has built for her, foley sounds are heard emphasizing the crashing of chairs and shelves, and the ripping of pillows and blankets. The sound increasing here reflects Kane's retrospective regret in all that he has lost and also that which was most dear to him. The intensity of these sounds then contrasts perfectly when he picks up the snow-globe?all sounds vanish. In the midst of silence, the viewer then hears a faint and muffled, "Rosebud", from Kane's mouth. The sound of this word resonates with the viewer; echoing forth Kane's long-lost childhood to when he was first taken from the innocence and youth of his home and forced into the scandalous and corrupt world of politics and media.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing like it....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When it comes to Citizen Kane, one question eclipses all others: Is it the best film ever made? The answer, for me anyway, is yes.Citizen Kane is still easily THE greatest films ever made. Its not 'one of', or 'the second', its the FINEST. I don't think any film will ever over-shadow it, either. Its one of the most famous, as it (successfully) broke every cinematic boundary in the book. It introduced countless innovations that are today a common part of film-making.The movie opens with an unforgettable image of a distant, fog-shrouded castle on a hill. It's a classic Gothic shot, and goes a long way towards establishing Citizen Kane's mood. We quickly learn that this place, called Xanadu, is the dwelling of America's Kubla Khan, Charles Foster Kane (Welles), a one-time newspaper magnate who could have become President if not for an ill-advised extramarital affair. Xanadu, in the words of the faux newsreel that gives a brief history of Kane's life, is the "costliest monument of a man to himself." Any resemblance to The Ranch, William Randolph Hearst's real-life San Simeon abode, is not coincidental.In the opening, Kane is dead, and utters the word 'rosebud' as he hunches over. His death, like his life, is a big news event, and the paper he owned, the New York Inquirer, is desperate to unearth the meaning of his cryptic last word. Is it a woman he bedded? A horse he bet on? A beloved pet? Some long-lost, unrequited love? The truth, which isn't revealed until the closing scene, represents one of the all-time greatest motion picture ironies, and leads us to believe that, on some level, Kane regretted not having led a simple, quiet life. A ten minuet newsreel follows this to exhibit his larger-than-life accomplishments.After this, reporters and the public in general, begin to investigate what he actually meant by 'rosebud'. The film dips into flashbacks (in chronology), to search for 'rosebud's significance. It also shows interviews with his loved (and loathed) ones, to see if they have any inkling to what it may mean.The movie is a visual masterpiece, a kaleidoscope of daring angles and breathtaking images that had never been attempted before, and has never been equaled since. Every image is depicted with incredible detail, and beauty.There's no doubt that Citizen Kane is far ahead of its time. Uncompromising, unsentimental drama of this sort was not in vogue during an era that was better known for titles like The Wizard of Oz, Gone with the Wind, and How Green Was My Valley (which beat out Kane for best picture).Not only is this film-making at its best, but motion picture archives and collections across the world would be poorer without copies of this film, which will forever be recognized as a defining example of American cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>CITIZEN KANE is the illustrative work of the creative genius and dynamic energy of child prodigy ORSON WELLES.I first saw this movie when I was 17 years old and since then I have seen it 40 times. even today it is equally fresh as it was ,when i first saw it . CITIZEN KANE is not just a movie , it is a collection of a large variety of innovative film making techniques . It is most appropriately ranked #1 by the AFI in top 100 greatest movies of allCITIZEN KANE is the story of a man named CHARLES FOSTER KANE which is , allegedly similar to the life of WILLIAM RANDOLF HEARST . the movie's story revolves around the mysterious identity of the word ROSEBUD ,which was the last word uttered by Kane . A reporter sets on to find the meaning of that word and in course of which he meets many people who knew Kane intimately and we come to know about Kane through a series of flashbacks ,with one of the most stunning endings Some of the film makings innovations seen in CITIZEN KANE are ,exuberent photography by GREG TOLAND , revolutionary use of light and shadow to match the mood of the movie , music brilliantly composed by BERNARD HERMANN ,method acting by ORSON WELLES which is clearly evident in the scene where Kane attacks his political opponent and also in the scene where Kane destroys his wife's bedroom CITIZEN KANE is a sacred piece of art and one the greatest films in the history of cinema</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film may have once been regarded the finest motion picture of all time but 72 years later, its still regarded as a great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been told that Citizen Kane has been regarded as the greatest black and white film and ALSO the greatest motion picture of all time, that is until 'Vertigo' surpassed it. My initial reaction to this statement was REALLY!?! Don't get me wrong; I have loved some black and white films most notably one of my favorite films of all time, '12 Angry Men' and also Alfred Hitchcock's 'Psycho' Checking the perfect Rotten Tomato rating convinced me to watch this film although there were mixed "Top Reviews" on IMDb. I enjoyed the start and found it extremely unique as it started with the death of Charles Foster Kane uttering his last word 'Rosebud'. I thought that was a great way to start and the mystery behind why he said it was definitely mysteriously and got me interested in the story, much like '12 Angry Men' did. However, to me, this film heavily suffers from poor pacing. At sometimes, the film seems to be speeding along brilliantly, with the plot and characters flowing through perfectly. At other times, the pacing is completely off and the film seems a bit of a torture to watch. I NEVER expected or wanted any action of any sort for this type of film as '12 Angry Men' did not and that was a spectacular masterpiece. However, the tone of the film just put me off as some flashback sequences dragged on a bit too long. What I can't understand about this film is how it STILL is regarded the "Second" greatest motion picture. I mean, back then, it would've been a revolutionary film with all the special editing and the camera work and the great acting but now??? I mean, to be honest, there are plenty of FAR SUPERIOR black and white pictures such as 'Cascablanca', '12 Angry Men', 'Psycho', 'Schindler's List' and so on. These films I listed keep you emotionally connected to the story more (or at least it did for me) and have far better characters and a plot.This isn't to say that I hated the film or found it extremely boring. Not quite true. I enjoyed the film as a whole but there are certain elements lacking from the film. One is, after a while the mystery behind the film starts to get away from people as the film at times goes onto focus on stuff that end up not really relating to Kane's last word. It also became extremely difficult to connect with 'Singer' aka Susan. I found her character, ENTIRELY annoying as she turned out to be one of the main parts to Kane's life. One thing I definitely loved about the film however, was that it perfectly illustrates how Charles' life completely changes when he falls for fame and power. The scene where he starts off in love with Emily and slowly shows shots and shots of his feelings toward her changing was superbly done. Overall, the film brilliantly illustrates how Kane's happy life changes when he falls for fame and power. *******MAIN SPOILER***********************I enjoyed at the end how 'Rosebud' to Charles meant that he could've the last of his years happily. That was a clever twist right there and I enjoyed that.Overall, I feel that this is NOT a must see film and those who absolutely love classic old films should see this and decide for yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Film Ever?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The BFI top 50 films list was dominated by one film for 50 years. That film, was "Citizen Kane". Any film that tops a critically acclaimed list, deserves a watch. I can say without a doubt that this film is one of the most compelling and stylishly executed motion pictures I have ever viewed.As for my title, "The Best Film Ever?", I truly believe if there is one film that rises above the others I have viewed it must be this one, there is something so unique and tidy about the way this film has been put together and shot, it is full of iconic shot's that when you watch them you will want to pause the film and just stop and stare with delight at the beauty of the camera work and the perfect acting that is being displayed within the shot.The plot of Citizen Kane consists of a young boy, Charles Foster Kane, who has been rejected by his parents and is given away to live with a rich, money grabbing politician who is very wealthy. Charles runs into this wealth and also becomes the head of a newspaper company named, "The Inquirer". Charles changes the whole system of the newspaper and how they fill their papers. Charles transforms the paper and makes it much more politically competitive with the other papers, this draws attention to the Inquirer as well as drawing attention to Charles himself. Charles then runs for governor and displays a powerful speech which consists of some tremendous acting and is surrounded by some iconic scenery which is lead by a large poster of Kane which stuck in my mind because of its wonderful vastness. Everything looks good for Kane until his affair, (so to speak), is discovered by an opposing governor candidate. When this story gets out, Kane's chances of becoming governor deteriorate and this starts Kane's spiral of self destruction and in time drives him into his grief hole which he calls "Xanadu". He goes to live there with his wife who he lost his chances of governor for and slowly becomes a more miserable weaker man.The second side of the plot is a lot shorter but is a key part of the film. It starts when there is a shot of Kane, (At this point we do not know who Kane is), drops a snow globe whilst delivering the words, "Rosebud", and then the snow globe rolls down some steps and smashes on the wood floor and Kane dies. Then after his death a newspaper journalist is sent around to talk to Kane's acquaintances to find out what rosebud could possibly mean, the conversation's between the journalist and Kane's acquaintances turn into flashbacks which structure the whole film wonderfully and create an entertaining unpredictable story that it would be almost impossible to appreciate if not enjoy immensely.My verdict on this film is pretty much summed up by the title, the film is structured unlike any other films in its time period and is assisted superbly by consistent, powerful and distinct acting that when viewed will impress anybody who is a lover of films and also appeals to people who are used to watching films that maybe are not so acclaimed, I am instructing you now, do not be hesitant to watch this film, it is almost impeccable and thoroughly entertaining."Whatever I do, I do because I love you", from me, Kane receives a 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cosmogony Several Layers Deep</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watch Kane every couple of years, each time with more films inside of me, with more references around the thing, and expect it will kind of crumble a little, seem a little more borrowed or less sharp, or basically not that big a deal. I do not hope, mind you, being an ardent Welles fan. I just think I will have outsmarted him this time around.I fail every time. Every time I come up with even more impressive insights, discover fresh corners I had not accounted for. Every time it makes my head spin this was at all possible or allowed to happen. It really is the work of genius and just so rich in every aspect.- dramatically, for instance the scene where young Kane is about to be handed over to the bank, where tables are turned at the last moment and turns out the stern mother is really the caring parent, something that ties in with the overarching sentiment that appearances can fool you and really mean nothing. This is perfect writing right here, complex characters, Kane of course above the others, a man who can go on a noble rhetoric about the workingman even as he plots war.- visually, goes without saying really and has been extensively documented elsewhere. - the structure above all, the image pieced together from many not entirely trustworthy testimonies, as the film- and storymakers inside the film keep pushing for better drama and better 'truth'.But all this has been celebrated a thousand times over, rightly so. The startling insight for me this go around was the staging of the opera, just two shots.One is clamor and commotion on stage as the camera pulls back to reveal the curtain has not yet lifted, then everyone freezes into place, lights wash into the space as the curtain lifts to the sound of applause, and choreographed with the first bars of the song the camera tracks up and above, across a multitude of strings leading up to the two stagehands overseeing the show. Later into the film we get the reverse shot, the mirror. Everyone freezes into place as before, but now we see the curtain lift, lights blaring directly in front of us, but the curtain lifts and we don't see an audience. Only pitch black darkness and the song going out to it.The astounding accomplishment is neither shot individually, even though both are perfectly crafted. It is how much of the world of the film is mapped between them (it would take a Tarkovksy to sustain more internal space between anchors).One anchor is puppetmasters in control of this image being staged, but not who we thought, not Kane, who watches impotently as part of the audience, not anyone important, only those two ordinary workers on the level of the gods. The reverse of this? Nothingness that contracts space of itself to create something out of nothing, something that fills the void and is light and song calling out.Between them we have a cosmogony several layers deep, each one generated by an image being staged to frame something out of nothing. It's worth puzzling over the many shots this ties into, all to do with projected light through the dark creating the world of the film.Something to meditate upon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's not much to say about "Citizen Kane" that hasn't already been said. I know there are people who don't understand why this film is considered to be one of the most brilliantly made films ever produced, but I propose the reason for that is this: the film and narrative techniques on display in "Kane" have become so integral to every film made since that they no longer seem special in Orson Welles' film when looked at from a 21st Century perspective. I encourage anyone still in doubt of this film's greatness to instead look at it from an historical perspective; just compare it to any other movie that also came out in 1941 and I think "Kane"'s uniqueness will be apparent. I don't think the film is without flaws. Welles' pacing can be slow at times, and I think the last quarter of the movie especially drags. The story itself isn't particularly interesting or even novel for its time, but one doesn't (or shouldn't) watch "Kane" for the originality of the story. Instead, pay attention to how the story is told and who's telling it. When the film is over, ask yourself this: can you say you've been given an objective account of Kane's story? Do you really know what happened to him? This is radical stuff for 1941. Can you imagine a movie being released at that time that didn't answer the questions it raised? The motivation that puts the entire world of the film in motion remains unresolved. That doesn't happen very often in films even now, let alone then.And if none of this is reason enough to watch "Citizen Kane," just watch it for the stunning cinematography and compositions. Virtually every frame is a work of art in itself.And if that isn't reason enough to watch it, then just watch it for Orson Welles' mesmerizing performance in the title role. Easily one of the ten best in cinema history.And if that isn't reason enough to watch it, you're on your own.Grade: A+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched Citizen Kane because it was a classic and everybody said it was one of those movies you have to see. I'll tell you a secret. You don't have to see it. It uses a very cheep device to provide suspense if you want to call it that, we are waiting to find out what Kane meant by his final word on his deathbed: "rosebud." The plot is thin tedious and the end was about the most anticlimactic a movie ending could be. I think it was summed up best in an episode of the TV series Family Guy, when Peter Griffin says, "It was his sled from when he was a kid. There I just saved you from two long, boob-less hours."

		<fullReview>I was disappointed. A work of art should be viewed as a whole. So, besides its ground-breaking techniques, which are brilliant, this film seems to me not to "get together". There is something over-ambitious in it, surpassing the actors' and (don't shoot) perhaps even Welles' possibilities at the time. The story is simple, the characters are sketchy and motivation-lacking, and the "Rosebud" search reminds me of the melodramatic search for the Immortal Beloved in Bernard Rose's film (lame, I know), but fortunately it remained a mystery. With all that hype about the "greatest film ever" (???), it's too easy to be disappointed about "Kane". And speaking of technical aspects, why not equally praise Griffith's "Intolerance" (1916)? Me, at least, I do so.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie for the real movie gurus</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is no doubt about it that Wells did groundbreaking stuff as far as how he filmed this movie, which adds support for many critics claiming this to be the best movie of all time. Both the story and acting are equally as enjoyable. So...why do so many people dislike Citizen Kane? Because there's no action and no killing. It's easy to see that many Americans want to see movies that are superficial with tons of action. These movies are certainly enjoyable to watch, but they're a dime a dozen. Many Americans also dislike black and white movies on the simple fact that they don't have color. ("Many" doesn't indicate a majority, just a statistically significant amount.) The last "drawback" that Citizen Kane possesses is that it is already highly acclaimed. People hear so much about this movie that what they expect is a completely unattainable level of greatness, and many people already know the significance of rosebud prior to seeing this movie for the first time. However, despite these "drawbacks" Citizen Kane still manages to hit the top ten on IMDb. As other reviewers advise, watch this movie for what it is. Don't expect action, killing, explosions, or CG effects. Expect filming ingenuity, great acting, and a great story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent, but rather boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found Citizen Kane to be rather boring. The story sort of ends where it begins and plays a back seat to the overbearing message the film is forcing on the viewer. The emotions didn't feel genuine or powerful enough to support that message and move me in any significant way.The time line felt sloppy. At some points, too slow. At others, too fast. The film climaxed after a "fast forward" of what seems like several decades. You have to appreciate the film's point of witnessing Kane's transformation from one person into another but the road to do so feels like it's full of potholes and shortcuts. I feel critic's praise for it's "revolutionary" accomplishments for the era it was produced in is well deserved but unfairly considered for the "Best Movie of All Time" title. I didn't find anything about Citizen Kane to be remarkable other than it's ability to stand out against other films of the era.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most influential film ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"What good is it for someone to gain the whole world, yet forfeit their soul?" When viewing this film, I immediately paralleled Mark 8:36 to Citizen Kane. Considered one of the greatest, if not the greatest, films of all time, Citizen Kane, which also revolutionized film cinematography, told truth about life that love cannot be gained by money. Assuredly, the film's remarkable excellences in every respect attest the addition of my perfect score to the already sky-high positive reviews of critics and audiences.Based on the newspaper publishing tycoon William Randolph Hearst, who also is credited for triggering the Spanish-American war, Citizen Kane begins with Kane's final, dying, "Rosebud." Inquisitively, a curious reporter by the name of Thompson hopes to solve the mystery around the word and its meaning by interrogating friends and family of Kane. During these interviews, Kane's life unfolds in flashbacks as we see him possessing, with high hopes, his rich guardian's failing newspaper, which he quickly expands into an empire of thirty-seven nationwide newspapers under his unique techniques. But he wanted more; he wanted to be loved by everyone, adored by everyone, a governor, a household name. He just could not be content with what he was; he had to be bigger.Without doubt, Orson Welles, the director, producer and screenwriter, also masterfully played this unique Kane, the rajah of the American society. As it was openly frowned upon during the Golden Age of films, little negative content appears Citizen Kane. Even though the plot revolves fairly around adultery, it is only mentioned slightly in newspaper headlines and characters' monologues. Also, young viewers may find the film boring as the message is told in a style that might be above their level.What if I said that "Rosebud" was his childhood sled? I revealed absolutely nothing about this unique, troubled life, as Thompson mentioned at the near the end, "Maybe Rosebud was something he couldn't get or lost. No, I don't think it explains anything. I don't think any word explains a man's life. No - I guess Rosebud is just a piece in a jigsaw puzzle - a missing piece." Kane, a man who wanted love on his own "terms," failed to understand in his "terms" that in receiving love, love needs to be given. With this deep and powerful message, this piece of art has been ingrained into history as the most influential film ever, and it will easily become a family favorite.</fullReview>

Every performance, camera angle, editing, everything is perfect. It really makes someone wonder how Welles did not win the "Best Director" oscar in 1941. Directors today can only wish to achieve what Welles did. Truly a magnificent study in greed and corruption that no one should miss.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film that helped define the cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If ever a film deserved to be seen in a darkened theater with others and without distraction, it is Citizen Kane. The first time I saw this film I was unprepared by excessive background information and the snap comments of the glib. It is a story about a man, who was very wealthy. That really is all one needs to know. If you enjoy films, take the time to see this one. Have fun using your imagination. Think of this man's life, think of your own and think of what the Director is trying to create. I envy you being able to see Citizen Kane for the first time. Rating - that is almost as inane as box office gross. Rating-priceless. One of the few great historical films that has grown with the years. Camera shots that set the standard and still others that have never been replicated. Enjoy. Be warned, if your attention span is short, your emotions somewhat shallow, your style impulsive, this is not your movie. This work places demands on the audience. It returns generously.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great film is rarely a simple film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am quite aware of the backlash that many IMDb members have made against "Citizen Kane". I suspect that these members feel angered that "Kane" is so often referred to as the best film ever made, and either they dismiss it from the start or (more likely) they watch it once, don't understand it and assume that if they didn't understand or enjoy anything on the first viewing then the movie must be boring, pointless and overrated."Citizen Kane" is my favorite film of all-time, in my opinion the best film ever made on this planet. But I didn't understand most of it the first time I saw it, and I found myself bored with the movie much of the time. When I rented it again over a year later, I ended up watching it four times in as many nights, each time gaining more insight, admiration and, yes, enjoyment. In all, I have watched "Kane" seven or eight times, and each viewing is more stimulating and fun than the last.One thing I have discovered about cinema is that the greatest movies are the ones which you don't understand completely or even at all the first time you see them. But there is something or some things in those films which you enjoy a great deal, things which lead you to give them another chance. "Citizen Kane" is a complex movie, in direction, storyline, characterization and symbolism. It's complexities also make it one of the most rewarding experiences known on celluloid.I know that dismissing those who have dispareged "Kane" as idiots would be counterproductive to getting them to see the film. Most (if not all) of them are not idiots and are in fact intelligent and perfectly capable of understanding and liking the film. To those people, I say give "Citizen Kane" another chance. In fact, give it two or three or however many chances necessary. You will be vastly enriched for it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, I understand that this is America, and everyone is entitled to their opinion, and many like to "rate" things, trying to figure out who is best, who is second best, etc... Well, yes Citizen Kane has been called #1 on many lists. However, these lists are made by professionals, and they look as much at technical issues as anything else. And they are just lists. Let me say it again, and this applies to everyone's lists, not just the critics' : they are just lists. The great directors, Welles included, do not (and did not) make films to beat out other directors on lists. This is not college football here. This is art. And, it is entertainment. The film has been around for 57 years, and every sort of person has seen it in every sort of way with many different intentions. Therefore, opinions will vary to such a degree that any sort of "absolute" ranking, comparing it to other films, should be looked at as mere fun, just something to give film lovers something to talk about. If you see this film and you love it, it may be because the plot intrigues you. It may be because you appreciate the innovation of the directing, or simply that you love old movies in black and white! "Greatness" is relative folks, and I hope you all at least enjoy yourselves a little bit as you make your lists.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>CITIZEN KANE MUST BE REMEMBERED IN PERSPECTIVE!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film was made in 1940 and released in 1941. This was before television... was a media, before jet planes were a mode of transportation. And the rocket ships described by Isaac Newton in the 1600s and Jules Verne in the 1800s were representred by Flash Grdon imitations. Accurate workable rockets were not to be even built until the 1950s and finally the moon in 1969. Orsen Wells had exploded onto the scene with his "War of the Worlds," Radio drama abut the invasion of Earth by the Martians in New Jersey. So vivid was the drama, and captivating, so real, that thousands called in while the "MercuryTheatre" production was still being aired, attesting to the invasion as actual fact. Thus when Orsen Wells followed that late 1930s production with "Citizen Kane" the expectation was great. However the people (especailly in the mass media of radio and film) were expecting to see a great work. Orsen Wells was skilled and produced a very professional and innovative work. However it is this writer's contention that the mood had been set for Wells not to fail. No one was to truly criticise. For as in the story of "The Emperor's New Clothes", a serious critic would have been seen as UNWISE, for not being able to see the fine quality of thread and workmanship. One must also consider and remember that Mr. Wells, himself, had a foreceful, compelling, overbearing and almost threatening persona with which to contend. One should keep in mind both this setting and the person of Orsen Wells when one reviews the work in Citizen Kane. Would an unknown have been criticised for having actors out of the lighting?? And yet Wells is praised for it, as "artwork."Perhaps if we look at the era and the man, we are now free to criticise and admit that, although a work of art, it was NOT the very best Hollywood ever produced. No, not even up to that time. That honor should have been a DeMille movie for the sheer grandeur. And if one is seeking a truly innovative director, why not Alfred Hitchcock of that same era (and beyond). Citizen Kane must be remembered in its narrow perspective.The current generation of film makers received their education from men and women of that Kane era. They should pause, reflect and yes, even perhaps critisize the great Orsen Wells production of Citizen Kane. It is to be remembed in its perspective moment of history as either great or not. But the best film ever???</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where do I begin?...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>and how do I end a review of this film? Well bear with me while I try.Why is Citizen Kane a great film and yet so hard to review? Because it is like a big ball of yarn with the ends of many threads sticking out. You can just yank on any thread, start writing, and go on forever. Let me start with its style, which is discussed in great detail in the late Roger Ebert's excellent commentary on the DVD of the film. Its unusual photography, editing, scene transitions, etc. are why it is shown in film school.For example, the lap dissolves in the scene with Joseph Cotten in the old-folks home were very unusual. The scene of Cotten talking dissolves into a flashback scene with Kane, and half-way through the dissolve, we see Cotton on the left side of the screen and the Kane flashback on the right side, and that is held for several seconds. It is a dissolve into a split screen by means of very clever lighting. The lights fade out on the right side of the Cotten scene, and they fade up on the right side of the Kane scene. That technique had never been done before, and I've seen it in only one or two movies made after that.Then there is the story, the theme of which seems to be uttered by the reporters near the end of the film, as they give up searching for the meaning of Kane's last word - "Rosebud". They say Kane was a man who, though one of the wealthiest men in the world ,lost everything he ever had, even though he died rich. And so the story we have been watching is, on the surface, just that. The final scene showing you Kane's possessions that are considered of no value by auditors being tossed into the flames of an incinerator - one happening to be a sled with the name "Rosebud" on it, the sled Kane was playing on the day he became a rich man - as a child through a quirk of fate.I used to be in the camp that believed that the snow globe was representational of Kane's nostalgia for his boyhood home and maybe for the sled. I no longer believe his attachment to the piece has anything to do with his pre-wealth youth. I think it reminds him of a time much later than that. That snow globe actually was a possession belonging to Susan Alexander before Kane ever met her, sitting on her dressing table in her small apartment. Kane picked up the globe during his rampage in her bedroom in Xanadu when she left him. Holding that globe abruptly put an end to his destruction of her bedroom. Why? I think it links back to the evening when they met and Alexander had no idea who he was. That night Charles Foster Kane was just a "schoolboy" who could wiggle his ears and do shadow puppets to impress a thoughtful and attractive young lady. This courtship was a period in their relationship that we can assume was not influenced by his money. For that one evening, he wasn't the richest man in the country. No other relationship that Kane had, once he was wrested from his sled as a child, began in that same manner. All the other people surrounding Kane as an adult were near him because of, or with full knowledge of, his wealth and power. Jed Leland was a friend from his college days. Mr. Bernstein was an employee. The first wife, who was met and courted on a buying tour of Europe, would know who Charles Foster Kane was when they met. Only Susan Alexander came into his life completely carefree of his wealth. And she brought with her that snow globe.While holding the snow globe as he lay dying, Kane isn't thinking about the cabin in Colorado or his sled - even if that is the scene depicted in the snow globe. (What an odd coincidence that she would own a snow globe with a cabin and sled in it when they met. That is a bigger "huh?" than who heard Kane's last words.) Kane is thinking about this very personal artifact that belonged to Susan Alexander, the woman who, in spite of a toothache, offered some kind assistance to a stranger one night long ago.Why does Kane whisper "Rosebud" on his death bead and not "Susan."? I don't know. Perhaps it is just where his mind wandered while reminiscing about that evening in a young woman's apartment when he was detoured from going to the warehouse that stored the artifacts of his youth.What are the other threads you could pull on and write paragraphs about? Kane's parents and why his mother did what she did, apparently never seeing her son again once she turned him over to be raised by bankers, somehow seeing this as an act of love. Then there is the issue of memory and how people are not what they seem to be - the apparent sycophant Mr. Bernstein seeming to have a great deal of wisdom and depth in his old age that you would not have foreseen when he was young - he talks about a girl he saw on a ferry 40 years before and how a day hasn't passed that he hasn't thought of her. How Kane liked being "the voice and defender of the masses" but maybe didn't like the idea that maybe someday those masses would organize and demand their rights, as Jed Leland had said on his way out of Kane's life. And on it goes.I'm sorry if this review is a bit disorganized, but "Citizen Kane" is not linear storytelling, or any other kind that I can identify with one word, yet it is storytelling at its best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Citizen Kane Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Citizen Kane is one of those films that you hear about a lot when studying film. After seeing the film, I can see why. I thought this film was great. Orson Wells does an awesome job telling a story through flashbacks. The dynamic between the characters is really cool as well. The acting, I thought, is really what shines about this film. Wells plays Kane himself, and no one could of done it better. Wells knew exactly how he wanted his loud, commanding chapter to be portrayed and he did exactly that. The editing is another great part of the film, flashbacks can be tricky but Wells does a graceful job in depicting it. The only criticism I would have is the dialog at many times seems like filler, as I was lost at time about what they were talking about, it seemed nonsensical. However, I sort of enjoy this aspect of movies sometimes, when the dialog is entertaining, which is true about this film. I would recommend it to anyone. It is truly a masterpiece in film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Citizen Kane</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Orson Welles, much like Alfred Hitchcock, is a fantastic director of horror, mysterious, and crime films. I've known of Orson Welles but have never seen any of his movies until this one and it definitely left me wanting to watch more of his films. This movie is a mystery-drama about news reporters trying to figure out what Charles Kane, a wealthy publisher's last words. The plot was well written and I found it to be entertaining to watch. I could not stop thinking and wanting to know what Kane's last words had meant, this keeps the viewers intrigued and not want to take their eyes off of the screen. It's said by many that this is the greatest movie ever; it is also said that it is extremely overrated. I found this movie to be very good especially given the time period it was made and I do think that people need to see this movie at least once in their life to get a feel of Welles' best works.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now I've heard about Citizen Kane for a long time. I never knew what the film was about even though it has been referenced to so many times in the media. The only thing I knew about it was the infamous "Rosebud" scene and that is it. Other then that everything else was a complete mystery to me. And after watching the movie I can safely say that it deserves all the recognition that it gets. What I simply love about this film is that it simply is going and discovering the life of Mister Kane. Just who he was and how he got to where he is. And the great symbolism in the film with the first and last scenes will make you wonder why you didn't think of that being one of the answers to the question, what is rosebud? Either way it is one film that everyone needs to see at least once in their lifetime. Because if you don't you'll be missing out on something amazing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Citizen Kane</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Citizen Kane is tremendous, to say the least. The film feels larger than life. Not just conceptually, not just in the sum of all its parts, but also through smaller things like sound design, camera movement, set design, lighting, moving performances and even tiny scraps of dialogue.When each component of a movie serves that movie so well, they can be forgotten. The final product seems to transcend equipment and technique, though they are obviously imperative to the film the audience ends up seeing.The sense of space conveyed by the film is incredible. The larger-than-life feeling that even strikes the audience plays well to the character of Charles Foster Kane, as well as to the "point" of the movie itself. The spaces within the movie get bigger and bigger as it goes on, and as Kane's life goes along and his riches grow. Those in the film who are searching for the meaning of Kane's last words are moving into bigger and bigger spaces, in the company of more and more important people, but getting no closer to the point. In many ways, this is how Kane's life itself is portrayed to feel. All of the money, statues, square footage in the world could not lead him to a meaning, to a sense of fulfillment. One scene in particular comes to mind in relation to this: a conversation between Kane and Susan in a parlor of their mansion. They need to shout across the room to one another, and their echoes show the audience how empty material pleasures can be.The performances in the movie are fantastic as well. Small and simple movements or expressions carry dialogue that seems small but feels quite heavy, even to those watching. This is the result of that rare combination of excellent writing acted out by just the right actor.In many of these "smaller" factors, Citizen Kane seems to have hit the lottery. Each aspect is great in its own right, and fits just perfectly with each other piece. There aren't many other movies like that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Great American Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why would I ever write any kind of review on CITIZEN KANE, a film that's been analyzed to death and is considered to film what Shakespeare is considered to literature? I actually have a good reason: in recent years, I've noticed more and more people seem to dislike the film, mostly because of its hype. Supposedly Ingmar Bergman called it boring. Now I happen to be a Bergman fan, but considering the dude made some pretty slow-paced movies, those are strong words! I can understand why many might feel let down by the story. The hype "Greatest Movie of All Time" implies that you are in for a great, sweeping GONE WITH THE WIND-style epic. Instead it's a smaller film about an unsavory character. It also focuses a lot on the newspaper business, which may not seem very relevant to modern audiences. My friend Zelda summed it up quite well: "I think that at this point, the film is more appreciated by directors than it is by general audiences. I know that what Orson Welles was doing with the camera, with angles, lighting, whatnot, was revolutionary - but I know this because I've been told this. As a plebeian when it comes to such things, those aspects don't stand out for me as much, and I understand they're big factors in what make that movie a classic. Instead what I have is a puzzle of a story, which, while interesting, is not compelling emotionally enough for me to place it in my top films list."This is a fair point, so here is what I propose. I will write a review about KANE where I will not ONCE mention the technical breakthroughs of the film. Forget about the cinematography, score, editing, etc. I will simply analyze the film's Story and why I feel that it is actually a very powerful and heartbreaking story.CITIZEN KANE can be summed up easily: it's the story of a man who can never get over having been rejected by his mother and is incapable of feeling love. This point might only be fully clear on repeat viewings. Mrs. Kane only has one scene in the movie, but we linger on her a bit, allowing her to dominate the scene. After that she is only mentioned in passing. Kane talks about her death on the same night that he meets Susan for the first time. We never know exactly how Kane feels about her, and what exactly he is thinking when he tears the room apart is left to our imaginations, but we feel the weight of it. We observe him cheat on one wife with the next and we're not told why. Yet when analyzing the facts, we do know why. We also observe him alienate his friends. On the surface this may seem to just be a petty drama, but only after we get the full story are we able to understand why this man so desperately needed to be loved.Kane remains elusive; he is ultimately the protagonist of the Story, but he is always a mystery to us, and he is portrayed both positively and negatively. This moral ambiguity applies to most of the supporting the characters as well. If you notice, we remain on a last-name basis with almost every character in the film: Kane, Leland, Bernstein, Thatcher, and Thompson. With Thompson it is taken a step further in that we never even see his face properly, making it clear that although we are following this reporter around, he is more a symbol than a character, and it is Kane's story that should be our focus. Developing the characters in this way makes them seem like regular people, occupying a story rather than starring in it.Finally, there's the issue of the ending. Rosebud is obviously a MacGuffin and perhaps people were expecting some sort of big reveal. The film has the confidence to end on a puzzle; Rosebud is revealed not in the style of a detective solving the case with a big "Aha!" gimmick, but as a subtle artifact that rewards us for paying attention and makes us think about how it fits in. Had the film ended in a different way, perhaps we wouldn't be talking about it today, but the fact that only moments after Rosebud is revealed it is then destroyed are perhaps the saddest moments of the story and what have caused the tale to resonate.I don't think any film deserves the title "greatest ever made" because that's obviously going to be subjective. Here it is has perhaps done more harm than good. If CITIZEN KANE were a novel, it would not be a great sweeping epic like WAR AND PEACE, which is perhaps what too many people expect. It would be a very short and quiet novel. It is about a person's life, but it only observes it rather than embellishes it. It is not a melodrama but a voyeuristic study. At the end of the film, we see Kane's entire lifetime reduced to boxes and boxes of scrap, and we are asked whether or not a man's life can be summed up so simply. Or maybe we know that such a collection of junk is all any of us will ever have.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Welles' masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well I finally watched it, the so-called "greatest movie of all time". Does it deserve the praise? Yes. Is it the greatest film of all time? I wouldn't go that far. Its eclipsed for me by other classics like Casablanca, Taxi Driver, The Godfather and The Shawshank Redemption. But Citizen Kane is absolutely a great film, telling the story of one of the most famous characters of cinema history.Citizen Kane opens, as we all know, with the passing of a titan. Whispering "Rosebud", Kane passes into the void and his snow globe shatters. Journalists desperately try to come up with a tribute that does not just retell his life but rather peels back the layers to expose the man within. With just the word "rosebud" to go off, journalist Jerry Thompson seeks out Kane's guardian, friend, co-worker, ex-wife and butler to conduct interviews that might reveal what "rosebud" means and that it might give a clue as to who Kane was. The film is shot in flashbacks with these interviews, a story technique I don't particularly care for but works essentially with the framing of the story and the mystery of Rosebud.Citizen Kane breathes on two superb aspects, the first being Gregg Toland's breathtaking cinematography. Welles and Toland also orchestrate one of the most widely used and effective tools ? shooting powerful characters from below and weak characters from above to diminish them. The only time this doesn't work is when in the final scenes, we can see Welles' prosthetic mask under his chin that would have been easier to hide with a different angle. Moreover, I am stunned by the fact that Citizen Kane contains some of the most perfect shots of all cinema history ? Kane walks past a mirror, reflecting himself countless times out; the way the camera zooms in Kane's speech but manages never to lose frame on that iconic Kane for Governor poster in the background; Thompson sits down to read an archive with the light beaming in from a small window ? I could just list them all. The last shot, a retreating camera over the clutter of Kane's estate, then the reveal of Rosebud's fate before a cut to black smoke spewing from his chimney is a masterpiece of reveal, camera-work and editing ? and even thought I've seen it a dozen times on Youtube clips, it sent chills through my entire body. The other aspect is Welles' magnetic performance as Kane. Welles himself was 25 when he made the movie ? which you would never believe because he carries gravitas of a man twice his age with ten times the life experience. There is only one scene in which Welles plays his own age, and he does it with a youthful glint in his eye, but in the later scenes he carries the same sort of powerful presence that we expect from esteemed actors like Sir Daniel Day- Lewis or Sir Ian McKellen. The makeup team does probably the finest work I've ever seen in a film, ever. Kane's rage is palpable, his drive profound, and during one scene his sense of loss is affecting by the void we feel in his performance. Welles captures so perfectly the emotionally hollow man that Kane was, always seeking approval from others because he grew up distant from his parents. In one very telling scene, his son waves excitedly and Kane responds with a polite salute rather than anything warmer.Citizen Kane's screenplay is a deserving representative of the film at the Oscars, with scenes like his disastrous run for Governor worthy of commendation in their own right. I could probably have done without most of the first twelve minutes, which is little more than an expository summary of the movie condensed for the paper's eulogy. It only sought to highlight also how skimmed over Kane's first wife was ? their marriage consists only of a few back-and-forth scenes at the dinner table. She and their young son vanish from the film and without the opening montage I'd never know why. The other problems I have with the film are just problems of a past era of film ? characters talk over each other, people hold phone conversations but don't pause long enough for the other person to speak, and people shout all the time because film was still in its early years. None of that is to take away from Orson Welles' masterful film. His performance is one for the ages and some of the techniques in making the film should be used to teach new recruits to the industry. However, the thing I found fascinating was that in the closing credits, Welles gives every actor their due but slides himself into the extended cast list. Whether he was being humble about his performance or something else entirely, I found it fascinating.Also, suck it Lisa ? there totally is a cane in Citizen Kane. He carries it on the street when he meets his second wife.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Citizen Kane is a beautiful film that reveals new treasures each time you watch it. The first time I watched it I didn't care much for the film or the characters but after about 10-15 viewings it's gotten to the point that the last 40 minutes have me on the verge of tears. The reason is that each time I watch it I learn more about the character and it becomes such a tragedy as you watch. The camera work in the film is so beautiful and based on the other films I've seen from before this film came out it seems that this was the first movie to make the camera itself a character. However no character in film history is more interesting than Kane. Every word he says seems to be a contradiction or spite until you realize that the whole time Kane was simply a puppet trying to grab hold of his own strings destroying himself in the process.</fullReview>

Instead of describing the film itself, if you find yourself watching this for the first time, try to realize how much your news outlets affect you today. The tail truly wags the dog, and has apparently been that way for quite a while.I can't remember verbatim how it's said in the film that basically - if he wants news to happen, he'll make it happen. Because he owns a paper. Sort of unbelievable to think about - and this is, I'm sure, not the first time any owner (or these day, "reporter") has thought that, and I'd bet money it won't be the last. Prophetic to say the least. There ARE "special effects" - the camera angles and the lighting that they play with are great - close-ups, etc. - you really get a sense of what they want you to "get" from the scenes, and it's so organically done that you can't help but applaud the artfulness of the director. This, along with the storyline - without a doubt, always a 10.</fullReview>

The film explores the darkness and depressiveness of humanity, and how money can't buy happiness.Most of the credit for this fantastic film should go to Orson Welles, as Wrote, Directed and Starred as Kane. The incredible talents of Welles, on and off the screen, really make the movie what it is. His acting is scarily good, the script is cleverly written and the direction is some of the greatest ever.Citizen Kane is truly a timeless Classic.

		<shortDescription>A Beautiful Portrait of a Tragic Character</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Citizen Kane has often been considered one of the best films ever made, and for good reason. The film uses complex and expert composition, camera work, and pioneered new techniques like deep focus, and elaborate camera movements. However, the most impressive part of Citizen Kane is the subtle meanings that can be taken from the composition, if viewed closely enough, it can drastically change a viewer's opinion of the characters. All the while using the life of William Randolph Hearst as a blueprint for the character and story.When discussing Citizen Kane there's a lot to talk about, some of which is more obvious than the rest. One compositional trick the film used was the use of low angle camera frames. This meaning the camera was below Kane quite often to imply power, this often helped reinforce that Kane was a man of great power. The use of camera angles did help reinforce that Kane was a man of power, but was most likely used more for leading audiences to show the duality of the character. Another obvious aspect is that of Deep Focus, and elaborate camera movements, both of which were groundbreaking at the time of release. Citizen Kane's most impressive achievement was that of Deep Focus, a method in which everything in the foreground and background is clearly in focus. Deep Focus was used effectively to show that Kane was important even in frames when he was seemingly trapped. Despite the fact that Kane was a powerful man he's consistently shown as being trapped, helping reinforce the duality of the character.Charles Foster Kane is besides his superficial facade a very tragic character, but it may take a few viewings to realize this. In multiple cases throughout the film composition implies a further meaning, most often the composition is made to make Kane look trapped. The two best examples of this are in the beginning with his parents, and at the midpoint of the film, when Kane is in Susan Alexander's room with Boss Gettys. An understandable question is why Kane shown as being trapped?The answer is given in the beginning, and throughout until the end "Rosebud." Rosebud has it's literal meaning, and the figurative meaning of a lost childhood. However, the film consistently shows the audience that Rosebud represents that Kane is a lonely character, looking for a love he was deprived of before he had a say in the matter. Multiple lines in the film reinforce this for instance when Kane says "A toast, Jedediah: to Love on my own terms. That's the only terms I've ever known." It would seem logical that Susan Alexander paralleled Rosebud, as their affair, is the only time Kane doesn't look lonely. Rosebud being Kane's lost innocence, and love, may have been filled by Susan Alexander, the best evidence of this is that Kane admits he's looking for Rosebud before he meets her, but is distracted by her, symbolizing that she represents the same thing Kane that Rosebud does. In the end however, Kane loses Rosebud again, and he loses Alexander as well. It's impossible to ignore the tragic look of an old lonely Kane who sits in an empty Xanadu, probably wishing he could give it all up for another life, one where he had Rosebud. Rosebud is also theorized to be a reference towards William Randolph Hearst. Film reviewer Gore Vidal theorized that Rosebud was Hearst's nickname for a private region of his mistress Marion Davies, other theories were that it was Hearst's nickname for his childhood bike, either way it seemed to connect to Hearst. It seems obvious that Citizen Kane is based on Hearst's life despite what Welles said. The evidence is that Xanadu is remarkably similar to Hearst Castle, both characters were media moguls who helped start wars, and both had mistresses.Regardless of whether or not Citizen Kane is based on Hearst's life it is still a great film full of meanings. It is so full of meanings, and elaborate compositions it's almost impossible to address all of them, but that's only a testament to the film's sheer quality. At the time the film changed the way filmmakers approached framing, and movement. It seems that still today few films have been so dense with literal, compositional, and figurative meanings as Citizen Kane did. It will forever remain a masterpiece of American Cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest films of all time - beautifully shot and directed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many critics and fans alike regard Citizen Kane as the greatest film of all time, and it's easy to see how that endearing reputation has befitted its audacious production for so many decades. In experiencing the film on Blu-ray (the 70th Anniversary Edition, to be exact), the film holds up magnificently well through the innovative and distinctive structure, make-up/visual effects, and lighting employed by Orson and his team all those years ago.Citizen Kane, of course, was the directorial debut of Orson Welles, whose booming and authoritative voice had made a him career in radio after co-founding the Mercury Theatre with John Houseman in 1937. By 1938, they created the Mercury Theatre on Air which would showcase their famous reading of the H.G. Wells classic, 'War of the Worlds,' a prank many took serious upon first hearing. Eventually, RKO Radio Pictures would grant Welles total freedom to make any picture he wanted; needless to say, Citizen Kane was born and became the darling it now is with both critics and fans around the world. While the picture did lose RKO money initially, the financial loss says nothing of its considerable contribution to cinema.The film is known for its incredibly poetic composition, deep focus, and nonlinear storytelling, which I must say, allows revisiting the picture to be a much more pleasurable experience since one is always trying to dissect all these wonderfully visual elements. Much of this credit should go to cinematographer Gregg Toland, whose use of 'deep focus,' a terrific technique whereby the back and foregrounds are equally in focus, became essential in giving Citizen Kane its unique and often-times deceptive appearance. Toland of course won the Academy Award for cinematography for William Wyler's 'Wuthering Heights' the year prior, and would subsequently assist Welles in making a picture that allowed the audience themselves to decide the importance of what was on screen without obvious dictation from the director or crew. So many of these incredible shots allow for plenty of clever effects and underlining of character foreshadowing as the story moves along.The acting is also a remarkable standout, in particular Joseph Cotton and Agnes Moorehead, both of whom were friends with Welles from his Mercury Theatre on the Air radio crew, as were most of the actors in the film, in fact. The latter however - the stunningly enigmatic Agnes Moorehead - is my favorite performance of the entire picture. There's such a restraint and composure to her character that goes unmatched by anyone else. Sadly, she has less screen time than her co-stars, but this of course makes her no less effective in my view. Her performance is so boldly pronounced that she alone is responsible for quickly hooking the audience into the story of young Charles Foster Kane; we cannot help but want to learn of what happens to this young man through seeing his mother portrayed so fearlessly in such an important context of the movie. Bernard Herrmann's music is also a grand addition to the picture, loaning its duties to all sorts of emotions - drama, comedy, suspense; he even supplies an original aria for one of Kane's opera- singing mistresses. It's a fantastic, widespread composition for which brings a lot of weight to Welles' vision. The Blu-ray of course is great and features the stunning, Academy Award-nominated documentary, The Battle for Citizen Kane, along with commentaries and other features. It's definitely worth upgrading from the DVD and I urge anyone who has yet to see this film to purchase it immediately.Citizen Kane is a fine example of how motion pictures can establish themselves as true art and what young filmmakers should focus on as an influence over their own productions. Let us not forget those who laid these tracks before us; they surely lead back to some magnificent places, don't they?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best movie of all times</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Citizen Kane is so far my favorite movie of all times. This movie has great acting, lighting, plot, and so much more. I first saw this movie around the beginning of the year 2015 with my dad. At first I also didn't understand what was happening with all of the time jumps, and stories. Once I saw it a couple of time, I got what was going on, and loved it. Citizen Kane has a lot of story behind the scenes. Orson Wells based the movie on a man named William Randolf Hearst. When the movie released, Hearst wanted Citizen Kane to be destroyed, and never seen by anyone because the movie pretty much tells about his entire life. There is so much more about what happened in between Hearst and Wells, but it is an amazing story. Citizen Kane is a perfect definition of an excellent movie. If you ask me, I say that everyone should see this movie. Citizen Kane isn't a movie for everyone though. If you're a big movie person, and willing to see any movie, than watch Citizen Kane.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can see why this movie is on the top of everyone's lists; I can't stop thinking about it! "Citizen Kane is rich with symbolism, layers upon layers of meaning and incredible cinematography. From Kane's death bed utterance to the final scene I was spellbound! I keep thinking about why Kane did what he did, who he was trying to replace with all the life size statues he brought back from Europe and what Kane's life might have looked like if his parents didn't send him packing for a neat $50,000 a year. My interpretation of Citizen Kane is this: the man, Charles Foster Kane seeks desperately to replace his mother who sent him away as a young boy but no amount of expensive statuary can replace the love he was denied as a child. His youth went up in smoke just as all his childhood treasures in the movie's final scene. A must see film, not only is the story thought provoking, the camera work, lighting and each frame from the film is a treasure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I think of perfect films I think of godfather, vertigo, psycho, Schneider's list etc. but comparing those films to citizen Kane is a crime. I watched this film when I was 13 and was bored to death, throughout the entire film I was wondering what all the hype was about, then I was wondering what rosebud meant, it was listed #1 on rotten tomatoes and I was confused, was it something I missed? I watched Steven spiel bergs masterpiece black and white film Schneider's list and I was mesmerized, I sat down and rematches the film for a second time, and liked it so much I watched it a third, almost a year later I have seen it almost 10 times. Why is Orion Welles considered one of the greatest directors in the world? I don't know either, but all I know is if anyone made Kane as their debut film today, they would within the likes of Charles Chaplin, Nolan, Spielberg, Hitchcock, Scorsese, Clint Eastwood even woody Allen. This film is my favorite movie ever made, and although Welles never made a movie this good again, he made this classic and for that I'm grateful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is it as Good at the Hype? Almost</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In all honesty, I went into this movie knowing about how people call it a film classic so I am not looking at this movie as if it was just released yesterday. One of favorite aspect of this movie was how they didn't just tell the story of Kane's life beginning to end as most movies do, the way Welles used Kane's last words "rosebud" as more of an object through which the rest of plot developed was very interesting. My biggest complaint with the film is that throughout the movie there are several key characters and while brilliantly acted, I never fully understood who they were. If I watched the film over again I would probably understand who everyone was but in my opinion it took something away from the story. These characters were very interesting and each had a different perspective on who Mr. Kane was, I feel that if I could distinguish his account from his best friend I think this would have added more to the experience for me.Another aspect I really enjoyed about the movie was the acting. Although as previously mentioned sometimes it was hard to distinguish who was who, but the performances were still really good. Orson Welles did an amazing job as the rich powerful, but never happy newspaper tycoon, Charles Foster Kane. I really enjoyed seeing how Mr. Kane reacted to money and wealth and how as he gotten older he looked at the world differently. Also Dorothy Comingore who played Susan Alexander Kane had a wonderful performance that really showed the emotional toll of living with Mr. Kane. The way her character developed really highlighted how Mr. Kane changed throughout the film and really added something to the movie.The only other problem I had with the movie is in some parts the movie was slow. This was not a huge part of the movie but some scenes seemed to drag on a little to long.In Conclusion, Is it 'The greatest in cinema history' as some have said? I don't think so. With that being said is it possible that I just didn't appreciate the movie fully. Probably. I think it was well directed, acted, and had an interesting story. I will definitely want to watch the movie again and maybe after a second viewing I will understand its full brilliance. Util then, I think this is a great movie that definitely made cinema history at the time and has only been getting more respected as time goes on. I would definitely recommend you see this move and make your own conclusion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Word to Describe a Man's Life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I was fourteen I saw two movies that cemented my love for classic films. One was John Ford's The Grapes of Wrath and the other was Citizen Kane, touted as the 'greatest movie of all time.' You can imagine how skeptical I was going into watching Kane with literally the highest praise you can give a movie hanging on it. However, I was not disappointed. In fact, I was blown away. I was glued to the screen the whole time, fascinated by the actors, the story, the gorgeous Gregg Toland cinematography. Like countless young film fans before me I suddenly had to see more. More movies by Orson Welles, more movies from before I was born, more movies with decades of praise under their belts. Unlike a lot of modern film fans, I don't bristle when Kane is referred to as the greatest movie of all time. I understand why it's called that and take no offense on behalf of films that are more personal favorites of mine to watch. It's difficult to compare movies when tastes are so subjective. Citizen Kane is called the greatest primarily due to its technical accomplishments and how influential it has been, on filmmakers as well as fans. I can certainly attest to the latter from my own experience as it was highly influential in turning me onto movies as more than something you pass the time with. It is a masterpiece of cinema and one of the greatest films of all time, if not THE greatest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I watched Citizen Kane, while I appreciated the technical advancements and its influence on film in general, and while I thought the film was fantastic, I didn't really believe it to be the film to end all films in the aspects of character, plot, and entertainment. However, recently I decided to re-watch a lot of "Classics" that I watched at a younger age. Movies like Gone with the Wind, Crash, Avatar, Vertigo, Rear Window, the movies I watched as a kid and liked (Except for Rear Window, for some odd reason) but I never considered the best. While I haven't gotten to the movies I just listed yet, I did manage to sit down and watched Orson Welles's masterpiece, Citizen Kane. And you know what? I finally got it.Everything about the movie made me feel something. There were scenes filled with energy, filled with emptiness, filled with tragedy, it really does take you through the full scope of such a successful man's life, and even though Charles Foster Kane himself can sometimes be arrogant, egotistical, and downright terrible, you don't feel justice when he fails. You feel sympathy. But why? Because in the end, through his ups and downs, he's a human being. He has emotions, he has flaws, he has likable traits, he's extremely fleshed out throughout the film, and while he may not be the most enjoyable, suave, or likable character, he certainly is one of the best in film history.Another thing I feel is worth discussing is the ending. Everybody knows it, thanks to Family Guy feeling it was humorous to spoil it for no other reason just to do so, as well as basically every review mentioning it. So don't go any further unless you already seen the film. So, throughout the film, news reporters are eager to find the meaning to a famous millionaire's final word, "Rosebud" (Which before anyone throws that plot-hole in my face, I just go with the theory that he said it loud enough for the nurse outside to hear). At first, they believe it's a girl, possibly one of the many that he's dated throughout his life. This is understandable, as the millionaire, Mr. Kane, is famous for being around women.However, in the end, Rosebud is not a woman, or anything anyone thought it would be. Rosebud was in fact, his childhood sled. Earlier in the film, we see Charles as a young boy, with his sled, which at this point, we don't know its name. Charles is taken away from his mother at a young age to get an education, leaving his sled, his home, and his childhood behind.His parents had sent Charles away to become rich, and leave behind his poverty in which he grew up in. However, as Charles dies, he looks into a snow-globe, and with his final word, he remembers a time in which he was truly happy. Sure, he became rich and famous, but it would be entirely possible that in the end, he would have been happier if they decided to just let him play in the snow.So in the final scene, you see the sled thrown into a fire, merely junk in everyone's eyes. It was an old sled to them, but to Charles Foster Kane, it symbolized loss of innocence, similar to Lord of the Flies, with the children becoming barbaric, mimicking the world they lived in, and by the end, they cry for the loss of their innocence, as instead of being shielded from the violence like the evacuation intended, they embraced it.Orson Welles is fantastic, displaying power and greed, but also bolstering an ego. He also did a good job depicting the different ages of his character, with his make-up helping as well. The other actors do a great job as well, and while some of them were a bit hammy, it definitely matched the personalities of the characters they were portraying.I could go on and on about what makes the film fantastic, the film is shot gorgeously, with both the camera-work and the sets matching the mood of the scene, the editing is extremely modern and keeps the film flowing at a good pace, and the film knows when music should be played, and when the scene should be silent, something a lot of films from the 30's and 40's fail at doing. But in the end, it would just be me reinstating how fantastic the film is, which I really don't think should be repeated, as I believe you get the picture by this point.So, is this my favorite film? Well, it's tough to say, but I think it's just barely worse than Lawrence of Arabia, though that may have been for the bird scene in Citizen Kane, which, like the car scene in Tarkovsky's Solaris, it felt like a fourth wall gimmick to me. But when I'm comparing a film to something like Lawrence of Arabia, it's hard to come up with favorites. I guess that's why I list off my favorites rather than usually picking one. But I'm getting off topic here. Citizen Kane is a powerhouse of a film, the type of film that doesn't happen often, but the type of film that not only inspires all to come, but still manages, among the clichés it creates and amount of people who have the film spoiled for them, to remain fresh and new to all who watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my new favorites</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had always admired Orson Welles but I'd never seen any of his films. I admired him because like myself he was an actor, magician and film director. I've always known that Citizen Kane was considered to be the greatest film of all time by many critics and yet, I still hadn't seen it. I finally got the opportunity to watch the film for the first time recently and it's climbed to become one of my favorites. Citizen Kane has themes as old as literature itself: love, ambition, corruption and the price of success to name a few. These themes are part of the human condition and some of my personal favorites, so the film strongly appealed to me. The most impressive asset of the film was Welles. In addition to directing and writing the film, he also starred in it. Considering that this was his first film and he was given complete creative control by RKO, it was monumental. The film's cinematography for its time was groundbreaking material, with camera shots that had never been seen before or had just been emerging, such as the use of deep focus so the audience looks at the whole scene. Knowing a little on Welles' personal life, one of the film's most interesting aspects was that in many ways Welles was Kane, gifted and a slave to his own hubris. The film portrays a life of riches as poor substitutes to love. All Kane ever wanted was to be loved like every human being, but he was stripped away from the moment he was taken away from his parents at a young age. He spends the rest of his life trying to relive that childlike wonder, which is what his sled is symbolic of. If he can't be happy, then he makes the lives of those around him miserable as well, such as pushing his second wife Susan towards an opera career that she never wanted. He spends his later years in Xandu, his own castle. He spends fortunes on statues, to the extent that they completely occupy his home and he even has doubles of the same ones. The only two possessions he cared about were his snow globe and his sled, which reminded him of the life he wanted to rekindle. This is filmmaking at its finest. Welles pushed the boundaries and made the film his way, with his people without RKO breathing down his neck. I believe the only criticism a person could give is that it is boring to them, which is a fair complaint considering the plethora of films that are out there today and how much more technologically advanced Hollywood has become since the early 40's. I feel as if ambitious or intellectual men will get the most fulfillment out of Citizen Kane. I personally give it a perfect rating.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great movie from finish to start to finish!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although Citizen Kane was intended to make fun of William Randolph Hearst and his lavish ways of living, the movie nevertheless shines. It has every element a classic film has: romance, mystery, adventure, and even a little bit of thriller/horror.Unlike many movies, I could feel the same emotions as the character. Because the acting is so well done (with maybe a few cheesy sections), Citizen Kane is very convincing.I admire how you can never see the faces of some of the characters. That was done on purpose to convey that these characters were not very important.The dialogue is very succinct and unique. No other movie could have such clever screenplay. Of course, "rosebud" is the most famous line out of the movie, but the way the characters respond to each other is irreplaceable.The flashback is very gradual so that it is not confusing. I am very fortunate that I don't have to waste energy trying to follow along.I find it interesting how Orson Welles tried some new filming techniques. He used camera angles to show dominance, deliberately put actors in danger, and made sets very detailed and elaborate. In fact, he was one of the few directors at the time to have a ceiling.Although the first time I saw Citizen Kane was in a high school videography class, I still felt like I was in a theater, enjoying the classics that some people never notice.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film truly deserves all it acclaim this is by far the best film ever made and I couldn't agree more. Here is a list chronicling just some of the reasons this film is undoubtedly a cinematic phenomenon.Kane- One of the most complex and intriguing protagonists in cinematic history. He is a egomaniac living in his own fantasy he created, he is distant and focused he was a child taken from innocence and normality and thrust into a corrupt world. He clings on to this innocence and what his life could have been to his death with the infamous "Rosebud". No one but Welles could have pulled this role off with his charisma, physical presence and the tone of mystery he engulfs Kane in, the scene where Kane looses it and destroys a room is haunting and Welles nails it subsequently creating one of cinemas greatest scenes in this spontaneous release of emotion from this typically distant and unemotional character.The cinematography- Greg Toland who had previously done the cinematography for the vast and beautiful grapes of wrath. He teamed up with Welles and together they crafted some of the most beautiful and innovative cinematography ever to hit cinema. The direction will leave you astounded.The script- No one expected much from the script since it was primarily written by a drunk out of work screenwriter (Herman J) and then edited and re wrote by a first time Theatre man (Orson Welles) to many's surprise the script utilised a new puzzle like narrative format loitered with character depth and subtle connections. The story is complex well developed and magnificent. The story also utilised the poetic device of "rosebud" a verbal representation of childhood loss and innocence. It not only deserved the Oscar it won for best script but it deserved many more.Those are the 3 main points on why citizen Kane is a cinematic masterpiece. I did not touch on the other things that are great about it the universal focus, the score and the editing and excluding why its a technical revolution in the medium of film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maybe it's because the newer generation aren't into the older films. Maybe it's because they aren't fans of black and white films. Maybe it's because they find it "dull" and "boring". The sad thing is: I am in the new generation. I've not met anyone my age (21) who enjoyed Citizen Kane or don't bother because it is "too old". A lot of people my age who use IMDb love this but we are in the minority. It really is sad.Citizen Kane is a tough film. It's tough because the main character, Charles Foster Kane, isn't really a very nice man. The viewer follows this mans amazing journey but also leads to some bleak and dark moments in his life. So it might be tough to watch 2 hours of Charles Foster Kane (played to perfection by Orson Welles) but don't give up. The acting is unforgettable from Welles, Dorothy Comingore, Joseph Cotten, Everett Sloane and especially William Alland as the reporter Jerry Thompson even though we never see his face. Terrific and innovative move from (also director) Welles.The cinematography is exquisite. Containing dark rooms and hallways and offices with beaming light soaring through the windows, it just looks lovely. The lightness (and darkness) play important roles as well in Citizen Kane. Many times actors faces (including Welles and Alland as previously mentioned) are covered in the darkness to show sometimes the corruption and lies a "picture perfect" businessman can be. Darkness dwells in all of us but we don't always see it. Along with the lovely cinematography is the creative and gorgeous camera shots. Welles utilises long takes and some wonderful crane shots which show us the larger than life characters in a larger than life world. Just look at Kane's mansion and you'll notice the dream-like castle he lives in. It's a masterpiece that almost wholeheartedly deserves the moniker: Greatest Film Ever Made. It's definitely not for everyone's taste. But it's a film that eventually got highly praised in terms of story, camera work, cinematography, acting and it's non-linear style. It's not my personal favourite but I can't say anything bad about this film (apart from the newsreel footage of Kane's life, I find it annoying). It will hopefully live on to entertain newer generations.Sean.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Throughout the late 19th and creeping into the 20th century, there were great men and powerful individuals. Some were discovered great after their death, others proclaimed it for themselves and a few were humble enough to accept the results of their labors. Here is " Citzen Kane " which many loyal fans claim was the finest movie ever made. I watched with avid interest reasoning it was a good film and a grand testimony to the late William Randolph Hearst. Despite his annoyance with it, Hearst tried unsuccessfully to have it destroyed. Within the length of this movie is the story of Charles Foster Kane (Orsen Wells) who with a sizable legacy rose from obscurity to the richest man in America. With the aid of his closest friend Jedediah Leland (Joseph Cotten) and the often irritated Mr. Bernstein (Everett Sloane) he gallivanted from one lively pursuit to another, having fun with his wealth often at the expense of others. Believing he is incapable of failure, he runs for Governor and attempts a high profile marriage. Despite power and position, Caine learns first hand there are some things money can't buy. The movie itself is a Black and White study in human nature and we should remember the adage, 'the bigger one gets in life, the smaller he becomes.' The magnificent cast includes Ray Collins, Dorothy Comingore and Agnes Moorehead, all of which earned the highest praise from the industry and audiences across the country. The result was the creation of a true Classic. ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite good &amp; hugely influential but not the best of all time in my opinion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you know anything at all about film criticism then you probably know that "Citizen Kane" is widely hailed as the greatest film of all time. However, I think I can safely say that this film's high stature is due more to it's enduring influence than to it's particular merits.Of course, I don't mean to imply that the film is poorly made, even by today's standards. Welles's direction can only be described as visionary. Combined with Gregg Toland's cinematography &amp; Robert Wise's editing, the film has a look that's light-years ahead of it's time. And let's not forget Bernard Herrmann's fine score.The story is an engrossing one. The enigmatic Charles Foster Kane's last word, "Rosebud", sets a reporter on a search to unearth the meaning of this cryptic final statement. We are whisked thru different periods in the man's life, piecing the puzzle together through the remembrances of others. The ending does not disappoint, elucidating the mystery with a subtlety rarely seen on the big screen.The acting is well-handled throughout, particularly Welles as he portrays Kane from age 25 to death with the help of ingenious makeup artists. I do wish, however, that a few of the other performances had been more subdued and less overtly theatrical.While I believe that there are later films that supercede "Citizen Kane" in terms of quality I will concede that there may be no more important film. Needless to say, this film is required viewing for anyone who purports to know anything at all about motion pictures.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Citizen Kane (according to the American Film Institute) is the greatest film ever made.I can assure any readers one thing: Citizen Kane is timeless. I am not simply following the crowd, as I thought one to many official movie reviewers were doing. I agree with them Citizen Kane lives up to the hype, just about.Citizen Kane is nearly perfect, and were it not for some small details in the second half of the film, it would be.Nearly everything perfect. The musical score, in particular, is the best I've ever seen. The film has charisma, charm. The acting is impeccable. The script fantastic. It's epic. And all done by a 25-year-old, which really gives it full marks.And especially for the time, it must have been incredible. The cinematography, the landmark qualities, everything was so original and new. But in the final half hour, deeper insight is necessary. We are left hanging on a thread, wondering especially after some incidents how the newsroom is going. We know little of Kane newspapers, though the dilemmas in his personal life are particularly well played out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everyone knows that "Citizen Kane" is the greatest movie ever made, and there's little I can say here that will add to what's already said. However, there is so much more to "Citizen Kane" than just a movie, no matter how superlative. "Citizen Kane" is nothing more than a priceless document in American history; in tracing the life and career of one man, Charles Foster Kane, Welles presents nothing less than the history of the United States from 1871 to 1941. The film is also a chilling example of the ability of a power-mad media mogul to manipulate public opinion. Citizen Kane could just as well be Citizen Turner or Citizen Murdoch. It's incredible how many careers were launched as a result of this film. Among the uniformly excellent supporting cast the performances that linger in my memory are Everett Sloane as Mr. Bernstein, Ray Collins as Boss Jim Getty, Paul Stewart as Raymond the Butler, and of course the legendary Agnes Moorehead as Kane's mother. The only flaw in an otherwise perfect work of art is the intentionally bad opera sequence, which goes on far too long. No wonder Susan Alexander Kane (Dorothy Comingore) attempted suicide. Who wouldn't, if they were forced to sing that drivel every night?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is possibly the best motion picture ever made! It holds you outside and keeps you inside at the same time. Made in 1941, and without the greatest cast, this film is telling the story of a newspaperman before and after his death.Talking about the cast: The movies three main female parts, played by Dorothy Comingore, Agnes Moorehead and Ruth Warrick, all playing a Kane, are doing unforgettable roles, and I wonder why none of them became real stars after this fantastic performance. The story is classical without being boring or "I've-seen-it-before-like". You will soon forget that this is a b/w-picture! You will find the colors inside!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What Film Making is Meant to Be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hate to hear people say that this movie is boring or that it isn't as great as everybody thinks. The fact of the matter is that this is a film made by following all the rules of film making. Not only is the acting superb, but each shot is carefully planned out. Character position and lighting goes from beyond showing peole what the film makers were able to do and instead shows deeper meanings. Height and screen position are used to dictate dominance etc...Welles was a genius who was able to work with people that helped to take the way he saw something in his mind and make it reality. Tolland's cinematography is unbelievable and the use of deep focus lighting is very effective. All of the actors give amazing performances especially Welles and Cotten. It should not be missed and it truly is the greatest movie of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A generation of movies that is lost</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have recently seen the movie Citizen Kane. I thought the movies was very good compare to many of the movies of today. I like the idea of putting three perspectives in the life of a person. At the beginning you have the death of Citizen kane and his final word "rosebud". Then it showed the media perspective of his life and who they thought he was. Then you have the perspective of his acquaintances who understood his personality in a different way. What other hidden information is the idea of a silent power. The power to control the human mind or to structure a social order. I notice this today by the media choosing what they considered to be important.Some people's comments about rosebud as just being the name of his snow board are just not seeing the picture. That word meant his hidden emotion. Deep inside he didn't have what he thought his destiny was supposed to be. Money couldn't buy his love for his family and used his wealth for revenge. So in my perspective, Citizen kane was never a man of wealth. In monetary terms he did loose most of his money; however, in what was truly important to him was lost ever since he moved away from the family farm. In that perspective money is not wealth, love and happiness to be with people that loved was wealth. Since, he was taken from it, everything was lost from there on. The newspaper was just a scapegoat to hide his inner feelings. His reactions toward his wife, the singer, was to give her what he didn't have and that was happiness. He wanted her to be extremely happy, because he felt that she is doing what she always wanted to do.The screeplay resemble the movie "21 Grams" and many other old and new movies. I like the way the movie started how Welles was able to mixed in different cultural perspectives in given us different ways of understand the persons life. Sometimes movies have hidden messages that are never found, because some people are to caught up in seeing things from their own perspective. I don't blame them for it because that is human nature and it is useful for our survival.I don't know much about lighting and special effects, but that doesn't limit me from understanding the films objective. Today movies are being done very quickly, so the movie industry could make more money. Citizen Kane was consider was a commercial bust, but if the person takes the dream and objective than this could shape the way the person thinks about the world. To me that is more important, then just having movies that have many sex scenes, bad acting, bad scripts, putting songs that don't go along with the movie, etc.Citizen kane has allowed directors to expand their talents and it is a movie that will be remember for along time. That is what makes myths, legends and Heros. Like Julious Caesar, he wasn't the firt emperor of rome; however, most people acquaint him to being the first emperor. His idea was the reason for the introduction of Augustus Caesar, his nephew Octavian. The same could be said about Citizen kane, orson wells ideas of the use of the camera for psychological purposes and the structure of the story is what made it remarkable. Ideas are what introduces inventions and inventions are introduce by a conglomerate of ideas.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The motion picture Citizen Kane is most recently being marketed in a two disc special edition from Warner Brothers.The one disc is of course Citizen Kane and the second disc is entitled,The Battle over Citizen Kane-Special Features.I would recommend if you are in the market for the movie get the two disc special edition.It is important to understand why or at least how come this movie is so highly thought of,the second disc will assist the would be viewer in determining what kind of a problem are we up against.I originally saw Citizen Kane somewhere around 1970-1971 and I did feel it was interesting, however what about when you cant put your finger on it but its still there? Thats somewhat how this film was then and this time around I know why.The film was in part about Orson Welles own life however much is as I was aware of upon the initial viewing many years ago about William Randolph Hearst.This area is why I recommend the special edition.Hearst is the one who said you send me the prose and I'll provide the war,this is not meant to excite it is meant to warn you as to what your up against.Hearst was a very dangerous and even frightening character because according to the information that was provided he may have contributed to the assassination of President McKinley.This special disc will provide enough material so that you find that when we talk about undue influence,propaganda,areas like creating your own stories just to increase circulation and very unseemly attributes,there was know one more powerful nor influential then Hearst.The idea of what all this influence means was virtually invented by Hearst and this is what I mean when to suggest that what is in fact reality is not the well spring of a Democracy but of a horse of a different color and that is the death of a democracy.There are no dreams only the pedalling of a system and its undue influence and Hearst was an important part of a lie that we are even today suffering the effects of.There is good reason why this film is thought of so highly because like some other films they tend to comment on reality without knowing just how justice in this heart and this mind sees what it has attempted to accomplish.The idea of influence is perhaps like the power of suggestion it electrifies the night air,it maybe the impostor we are looking for,I kid you not.In fact this type of a discourse has provided a underpinning to some of the twentieth centuries most serious calamities.The idea of false importance is of a worthy psychological look see as well as the problem that we are drawn to now take a look at-This film is smart and if such considerations are somewhere even if only on the shelf somewhere it might be worth viewing.These items are of course not mentioned lightly and indeed there consequences do not go away simply,they must be dealt with because this is a problem.In a manner of speaking the call is yours as to the purport of this two disc edition and the films place in film history.P.S. Do not take the idea about "rosebud" seriously,upon the initial viewing I seem to recall that rosebud was the name on his sled.This film is something of a satirical look at the life and times of William Randolph Hearst.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worthy of its high regard as one of the best films of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's incredible to see how masterfully Orson Welles, a Hollywood newcomer both in front of and behind the camera, has outclassed the directors of our time when it comes to composition, style, and symbolism. Few of the current crop of directors heralded as "great" - directors like James Cameron, Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, and David Lynch - can match the overall quality and message of Welles' single most influential film. In a time when films are valued for spectacle over quality, "Citizen Kane" is like a breath of fresh air."Citizen Kane" is more than the story of a newspaper magnate's rise and fall; it is a tale of what is ultimately important in a person's life. Despite the vast riches that Kane attains, he is far from happy. He is left with two failed marriages and few friends. At the close of his life, all he has left is his memories - and something called "Rosebud."Though Kane himself says "I don't think there's one word that can describe a man's life," that is in fact true of his life. "Rosebud" is what mattered to Kane in the end; it was the only thing that he truly wanted. Not in a literal sense, but instead what "Rosebud" stood for; a mystery masterfully concealed until the very end of the film.It is easy to see why film critics laud "Citizen Kane." It was revolutionary in its own time, a feat that few films can attest to. It's disuse of chronological storytelling and heavy use of frame composition for inferred messages can be compared only to some of director Quentin Tarantino's better efforts, where style is held almost above plot. Welles manages to do even Tarantino one better, elevating style and maintaining and engaging plot at the same time. It's easy to see why "Citizen Kane" gets its praise; I would admit to being one of its admirers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Citizen Kane...not many films can measure up to its level. This dramatic film portrays the life of one man: Charles Foster Kane, a ruthless newspaper man who leaves one word in his rememberance: Rosebud. The entire film looks into this man's life through the views of his closest friends and aquaintances. It also begins and ends with his death, and follows closely with the missing puzzle piece to his life, rosebud.This movie was far ahead of its time. It was the first film ever to use special effects, and most of it is unbeknownst to the viewer. The film is rich in symbolism to answer the questions of how and why something happens.To be perfectly honest, this seems to be a basic black and white film that in todays culture would be unattractive and boring. But it is much more than that. And the makeup was enthralling! They were able to make a 24 year old Orson Welles a some 70 year old man, and make it totally inconspicuous. Not many films, even today, can do that.This film was very exciting and worth many viewings, and is the epitome of all films, which is why so many other productions have followed in the footsteps of this one outstanding film: Citizen Kane.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Citizen Kane" is a film I find truly graceful. The story is portrayed so elegantly, so subtle and yet simple at the same time. Its message is not earth-shattering or prophetic - instead, all elements of the film are focused on the small, yet significant story of one man's search for love.The movie follows the life of Charles Foster Kane. It tells the story of his acquisition of his first newspaper and his rise to power, as well as his slow decay. But the film is not focused on events, or particular happenings. Each story aspect is a tool to develop and explore the character of Kane and his journey as a man locked into his own palace.The film's main theme, around which all aspects of the film revolve, can be summed up by the character Leland, college friend of Kane, after Kane's death: "All here really wanted in life was love". Ever he needs and demands love, but ever he shoves it away in his search. Although he is, in the public eye, a bold and charming figure, he is in reality a broken and bitter man attempting to replace his loss with public adoration and material wealth.The meaning of the word "rosebud" to which the many reporters are searching, I will not reveal here (despite its listing on IMDb as one of the most known movie spoilers of all time according to a recent poll), but I will say that its meaning is simple and yet explains further the theme of the film. The fact that it is explained to the audience but not to the cast is more tribute to the solitary nature of Kane."Citizen Kane" is not a movie you can watch passively. To get a full appreciation of the film you must take in each shot as an individual piece. There is a wealth of subtle symbolism pervading the film, portraying visually the emotions and conflicts of the characters that cannot always be read on their faces, while not detracting from the basic necessities of the story. Instead, its symbolism is focused in reality.Consider, for example, a scene depicting Kane, campaigning for an election. Here Kane is seen alone at a podium, a small figure against he backdrop of yet another depiction of Kane - a larger-than-life, intense being, nearly omniscient in his realm. Yet it is simple to ignore this scene without watching it critically - the backdrop is simply a campaign marketing tool, masking its true purpose, which is to contrast Kane the man with Kane the world-famous tycoon. Yet this is one of the more obvious examples of symbolism in the film.Yet the film is not perfect. I found the introductory and concluding scenes of the film rather self-indulgent and clumsy in its symbolism when compared the beautiful and subtle cinematography throughout the rest of the film. It is exaggerated and simple. Also, I am at a loss as to the meaning of a bird squawking extremely loudly in the middle of a conversation - it is extremely loud and disorienting, although I'm sure it has a purpose."Citizen Kane" is among the most critically acclaimed films of all time, and for good reason. The film tells a complex tale that does not cheat the audience through cheap characters or stale storytelling. It is easily one of the greatest films I have ever seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Think of it as a movie with the moral, money cannot buy happiness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Contains spoiler At first glance, Citizen Kane appears to be a biography about a rich man who achieves power and control through his business dealings, or in this case, through the operation of a chain of newspapers. At the time the movie came out, similarities were made between the movie and the life of William Randolph Hearst. For instance, when reporters down in Cuba stated that there was no war there, Kane stated `there will be war when I say there is war.' This was the actual position that Hearst took at the time. Whether Kane is modeled after the life of William Randolph Hearst or not, the resemblance is strong. Both men would sacrifice anything to write the news, and in some cases, they would make up the story so circulation could increase.The movie begins at the end of Charles Foster Kane's life. The opening scene shows a large castle in the background.. The camera pans the scene to show a couple of monkeys in a cage and two empty gondolas. It is a lonely setting. The castle remains in the background with one solitary light flickering in an upstairs window. The scene changes to a house within a snow globe. All of a sudden you see a pair of mustached lips, that whisper `Rosebud.' The hand holding on to the snow globe, drops it and the globe shatters in to small pieces on the ground. Charles Foster Kane's life has ended. Now begins the task of solving the mystery of who is `Rosebud'. At this point, the movie goes back and forth from present to past as reporters interview everyone who was close to Kane in an attempt to discover who Rosebud is.Through the use of news reels, Kane's life is shown from its beginning to his rise to power. As a child, Kane was given up by his mother so that he could live a better life. Kane moves away with his new guardian, a rich man named Mr. Thatcher (played by George Coulouris) Kane becomes a reckless young man who in time is expelled from several colleges and universities. Mr. Thatcher provides Kane with money and options to own a few gold mines, but Kane decided to go into the newspaper business because `it might be fun'. As the story continues, he marries a girl ( played by Dorthy Comingore) from a prominent wealthy family. It is interesting how the movie shows the progression from a young happy couple to a marriage of that is less loving. As you may suspect, Kane meets someone else. This proves to be a downfall for Kane. At the time he is running for Governor and everyone assumes that he will be elected. His opponent uncovers his involvement with the other woman and it becomes a scandal. Kane marries the other woman and appears to support her in her desire to sing. It is clear, however, that his support is not to encourage her, but is a way for him to exercise power over her.Orson Welles' portrayal of Kane helps us see him as a man who feels love for power and money. Although he has grown up in a poor family, Kane overcame poverty with a desire to have every thing. He only seems to be happy with money and having the people of his community under his control. That is probably why he was twice married and twice divorced. His wives were very different. One came from a wealthy well known family, the other came from a working class family. One was developing an independence from him, the other allowed herself to be controlled by him. Although the reviewer felt Kane would have done better if he had stayed with his first wife rather than marrying again, that would have gone against his nature.Joseph Cotten Played Jedediah Leland who is Kane's best friend .He was also an employee of Kane's newspaper. Shortly after Kane married his second wife, Leland found himself in the unpleasant position of writing about her debut as an opera singer. The performance, which was incredibly bad, Kane walked in to the office and found Leland passed out on the typewriter. A partially written review about Kane's wife was in the typewriter and a bottle of whiskey was nearby. Kane took Leland's review, and finished it. After that, Kane fired him. The movie leaves a lot of unanswered questions. Did Leland get drunk because he did not want to write the review? Was he struggling between having to be truthful or being loyal? The movie does not give all the answers, but lets the viewer fill in the gaps. What is interesting about this is that while Kane finished the review, he did not change its negative tone. This leaves us with another question. Was Leland fired because he got drunk ? Was he fired because of what he wrote about Susan? Or was he fired because Kane thought if he struggled with the decision of telling the truth or hurting a friend he could no longer report the news accurately?The reviewer gives this movie a 5 out of 5 star rating. It is filmed era after era making the viewer believe that the years are passing by in every scene. Other movies have `Flashbacks' in them, but they have not been as intriguing, as this one has been. It was interesting to follow the reporter who interviewed close friends of Kane to try to find out who or what `Rosebud' is. He never found out, but we did. When the workers were cleaning out Kane's possessions, they threw his stuff into a fire, one of those things was an old sled, with `Rosebud' printed on it.For a movie over 60 years old the cinematography was terrific. It was very well organized. When you think of Citizen Kane, don't just think of it as a regular movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply a classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Citizen Kane is considered to be one of the top movies of all time. Citizen Kane was directed, co-written, produced and stared in by George Orson Welles. Welles is most remembered for his role in this movie, his many talents and his radio broadcast that caused thousands to panic. At only 25, Welles made this movie. It was the first of it's kind with new and amazing camera and sound techniques. Though Welles acted in and directed in many other movies, Citizen Kane was and is the most famous. None had the same impact as this movie. Was it the story line? Was it the innovative techniques? Or was it the controversy it created? All of those things rolled into one made a classic. Citizen Kane was modeled after William Randolph Hearst, a famous publisher/politician at the time. Hearst went to Harvard but was expelled and still went on to run his fathers newspaper (The San-Francisco Examiner). Although this movie is based on Hearst's life, in the beginning it shows that he was adopted by the bank basically because the mother didn't want control of their gold mine anymore and also because the father was potentially abusive. This part of the movie is just for the stories sake and not a true example of what happened in Hearst's childhood. The movie does accurately follow the rest of Hearst's life though, plus or minus some things. From taking over the newspaper, to being a politician, to the construction of the Hearst Castle, the movie takes the viewer on a quick journey through Heart's life. The symbolism in the movie is very interesting. When the camera slowly approaches the Xanadu, it comes through the gate with a big iron `K' on it. Two important things are in that scene, but most people wouldn't notice those things unless they were really looking for them or were warned about them before hand. Also, Xanadu was built up on a hill, higher than anything else around it. Was that how Hearst was though? When the camera goes through those intimidating iron gates, the viewer may get the feeling like they are going somewhere they aren't supposed to be. The first scene of the movie seems like it is the most important. As Kane dies, he mumbles one last word, `Rosebud'. But what did that mean? That's what the rest of the movie is about. Reporters interview people that knew Kane to find out the meaning of rosebud. The people being interviewed have flashbacks which pretty much tell Kane's life story. The reporters never find out the meaning of rosebud, but we the viewers do. Rosebud was the name of a toy sled of Kane's. The viewer then has to decide for themselves what the sled meant to Kane.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>`Eh' at first, now my favorite.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Or at least one of my favorites. The very first viewing of Citizen Kane I didn't much care for. I didn't hate the movie, and it had its originality and it was definitely different than anything than I was used to. Maybe it's because at the time, I wasn't as into older films and the dramatic difference in film styles came as too much of a shock. Who knows. But a film widely considered by critics as one of the greatest films of all time had to have something going for it. I gave it a second chance and really liked it. In fact, I liked it enough to sit through both commentaries on the DVD.What I love most about Kane is its simplicity and it's relaxed pace: a story about one person who never did anything too terribly exciting in terms of fighting in a war or some grand action scene(s). By the end of the movie, a lot of modern film goers would argue that nothing happened throughout the length of its running time, but in reality, quite a bit has happened in the carefully planned and arranged narrative as we explore Charles Foster Kane's history and personality. The film spares no detail in addressing Charles as he grew up and matured--what he was and what he became, and yet it never lingers on any one era of his life too long. Mankiewicz and Welles spent just enough time in key places to communicate necessary points and move on, reaching each keypoint at its own comfortable pace . . . and, again, having grown up in a generation of epileptic cutting it did take me one full viewing to get used to entire scenes shot from one camera angle.I could go into detail on other landmark aspects that other reviewers, no doubt, have already covered - however, I don't see it necessary to repeat it all. Besides, if anyone is interested the DVD features two commentaries by authoritative sources, Peter Bogdanovich and Roger Ebert, both of whom do a better job than I could. I will, however, say that like other `old' films such as Hitchcock, I thoroughly enjoy seeing films like Kane because in the craft I can see the cornerstone of generations of films that followed. It's like reminiscing over an old photo-album.And being a film-music fan, I have to comment on Bernard Herrmann's first film score. While not my favorite, it deserved the Oscar nomination that it received. Very few composers have come onto the film-scoring world as strongly as Herrmann did with Kane, and very very few scores have the heart of Herrmann's Citizen Kane. From poking fun to at 'cliché' Opera to the depths of its leitmotif surrounding rosebud, this is a beautifully crafted score with one of the greatest ranges of sounds to contrast with the film's narrow subject matter.All in all, I love Citizen Kane because it utilizes all the techniques of its day (and even inventing quite a few) as tools to tell a story, but never does Kane lean on those tools to compensate for anything. It doesn't hide behind hours of boring Kung Fu or hundreds of CGI droids, it doesn't invent some unwelcomed quirkiness to be `artistic', nor does it spill blood and guts like there's no tomorrow. It tells its story, and the film is judged by the story it tells *like all films should be*</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is a great deal more than just TERRIFIC!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>first of all, saying Citizen Kane is the greatest movie of all time is one thing - but saying it's the greatest movie ever MADE is another. i believe it is the latter. let me explain. when you look at two watches, one may look on the outside better (like the Godfather compared to Kane), but HOW it was made, the tiny springs inside and such, is what makes it and rates it as the overall BEST. i too probably would enjoy watching the Godfather movies or Raging Bull more times than Kane, but Kane, on the inside, is the best movie ever MADE. and the fact that welles did all this as a first time director, AND that he acted in it incredibly, and that NO ONE did the camera angles he pulled off at that time, and so many other things, and that he influenced directors till this very day, dosen't benefit the argument of how great the movie is as a handicap, but rather it's just added-on to the mere fact that no movie has, in my opinion, equalled KANE. and for all those people who trip on the fact that the nurse could hear him 'whisper' rosebud in the closed-door room, 1. he whispered it, but at the same time you can hear his voice, so the whisper is sort of an effect adding drama to the fact that he indeed spoke the word softly, instead of whispering loudly, and 2. if you look at the room from further back, it is not enclosed, ie, there is no ceiling at all - it is a castle room, and as castle walls are very tall, the room is basically walled-in like a cubicle in an office, so the soft voice could have echoed and carried, and anything even sounding like the word(s) ROSEBUD, which he'd said before in front of all the servants (after breaking all the stuff in his wife's room), would be taken as that by the nurse, even if she'd hardly heard it at all. anyhow, this and TOUCH OF EVIL prove that O. Welles is and was and forever will be the greatest director, and also actor, of our, and all, time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>News on the March: Citizen Kane is One of the Two Greatest Movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Citizen Kane is a masterpiece! It is one of the two greatest movies of all time; the other being Lawrence of Arabia. Some things in this movie are phenomenal, and that's why I like this movie so much.One thing that amazed me, and not finding out until listening to Roger Ebert's commentary on the DVD, were the "optical illusions" as I call it. One that I like in particular is the scene in Mr. Thatcher's story, the one part in 1929, when Kane walks to a window, and is below it, but when he walks back to the table, he is seen taller than the windows. Wow!Another thing is the scene in Charles childhood, when the camera is showing Mr. Thatcher and Charles' parents talking. In the background, in the mirror, is Charles still throwing snow outside. That showed how long of a take that scene had. Wow, again!Another thing was, and not finding out until watching The Battle of Citizen Kane, that this movie was based a lot on William Hearst's life. And also that this was Orson Welle's first film. Wow, to the third power!And one last thing is that I like the ending very much, but I won't give it away. So, see it for yourself; you won't regret it! Rating: 4 out of 4</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rosebud, Xanadu and the Inquirer: worth seeing a hundred times</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the impressive surrealism of "Caligari" and the gross realism of "Potemkin," "Citizen Kane" remains a masterpiece of film history. Orson Welles, its 26-year-old creator, achieved a lot with his ensemble of fine character actors and actresses. Despite its age, there is still some touch of its near-to-sensational inventiveness to be felt, which is basically due to Gregg Toland's brilliant photography which combined low-key crime story lighting and grand melodrama camera craftsmanship. Art direction and special effects, too, are conducive to the whole. Although awarded only one Oscar, Welles established his reputation as a genius, and there is an ironic hint at his earlier "War of the Worlds" success when Kane warns a reporter in the beginning: "Don't believe everything you hear on the radio." Its working title being "American," the picture's original criticism of newspaper tycoon Hearst is worth more than a latterday footnote, although its omission seems to add to the timelessness of "Citizen Kane."Of the players, I still couldn't make out Edmund Cobb (as a reporter), who appeared as the bad guy in some 170 or more B westerns from 1930 to 1950, plus a couple of A's such as "Winchester '73" and "River of No Return." I did actually discern Alan Ladd this time, I think. - Welles does a good acting job, too, as does his favourite, Joseph Cotten ("The Magnificent Ambersons," "The Third Man"). Moorehead and Sloane of the Mercury Theatre stock company are wonderful, but Ray Collins' short performance as Jim Gettys, virtually reduced to his voice as he hardly mimes and moves, is outstanding to me. This is a pic worth seeing a hundred times, not least because of its humanistic message.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Cinematic Landmark</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No film has ever been voted as the greatest film of all time as often as Citizen Kane. Countless directors have been inspired by its pacing, cinematography, narrative, deep focus, and overall magnitude. Its the type of film that a person can watch hundreds of times in order to peel off it's layers. Citizen Kane is undoubtedly a cinematic landmark that should be remembered for centuries to come.Does this, however, make Citizen Kane the greatest film of all time? That's hard to say. Citizen Kane is not the type of film that appeals to the average audience. Its countless innovations can be endlessly studied, but it often lacks emotional appeal. Anyone who looks at Citizen Kane as an average film will probably see it as that, but those who have been told repeatedly that it is the greatest film of all time may pretend to like it in order to fit in with the other movie buffs.I don't say that Citizen Kane is overrated. I simply think that many people really don't see it for what it is; a bible of inventive techniques and a study of a hopelessly unhappy person. It can actually be difficult to pity Charles Foster Kane, because of his sheer ambiguity. We hear a lot of things about him, but they come from unreliable sources, and, in the end, it is difficult to put them together in order to understand some of the motivations of Charles Foster Kane.I also feel that many of Orson Welles other works are overshadowed immensely because of Citizen Kane. He created other forgotten masterpieces, but because so many critics and directors continually rate Kane as the greatest film of all time, many simply ignore the fact that a few of his other films may be equal in comparison.Citizen Kane is still a fascinating, compelling, and brilliant masterpiece that marked a huge advancement in cinema. Without it, we probably would not have many of the other great films that are considered masterpieces today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Masterpiece, simply said...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, this movie isn't recommended for nothing. Although I will agree from film critics, its the best film ever made for technical reasons. Which is wrong. This is a masterpiece for more humane reasons. Its because its the truth. No film can achieve more than that.Critics will tell you about the lighting, the cinematography, the sound, and camera angles and blah blah blah. Much of this has been analyzed over and over. True, this is an exceptional film because of those reasons.Yes, this is a very innovative film (of that time) and much of the critics analysis of the film has merit, but its much more than that. Welles had something so much for us with this film.Its about our truth. The meaning of our lives and the significant influences that make our lives complete or in this case incomplete.* SPOILERS *Kane's life was the latter. Incomplete. The last words out of his dying mouth. "Rosebud". The sled he owned as a little boy. All of the wealth, influence, success, and friends he had in his lonely nonexistent life. His very last words of that life was "Rosebud". An insignificant toy he owned when he was a child. All he owned, bought, or controled in his adult life had no influence in his adult life. That truth about Kane's life is no surprise and is very sad. Little wonder that this didn't make a dent in the Oscar selections that year. It takes years for people (and critics) to appreciate what that means to all of us.My grandpa died when I was fifteen. My grandpa was a farmer his whole life. He raised crops from fertilization to full grown life. Crop season meant everything to him at the time. I went to visit him on his deathbed with my father, mother and my sister. My grandpa had the clearest blue eyes you have ever seen, but on this day they were dull, cold, and fading. He was rambling about death coming to take him and that he was at peace with it. At the time he was barely coherent and couldn't recognize anyone around him. I was very sad.He looked at me suddenly and those cold eyes lite up and and he said "Stephen". I went to him and told him that I loved him. He seemed to be at peace with that. Two days later he left us.At the age of 15 I was very sad. Now, at the age of 34, I understand my grandfather. All of the crops his raised meant very little to him at that time. It was his family and friends that meant the most to him.It meant the most to Kane at his deathbed as well. The only difference was he had only a sled when he was a little child. That is very sad. That is what Orson Welles was trying to tell us.I will bet you every single dollar that Bill Gates (our Citizen Kane of our time) makes that none of it will matter at his deathbed. I only pray that he is intelligent enough to know what really matters in his life.Orson Welles made a film that is universal in its appeal. I hope everyone sees it and appreciates it for how sad it is.We can all learn from it.That is why this is a great masterpiece of our and any other time.Film students learn the techniques that make the critics love it. Film lovers and realists appreciate it for the humanitarian ideals it suggests.Grandpa. Rest in peace and I'll see you soon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Orson Welles debut film, maybe greatest ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Citizen Kane is revered as a cinematic masterpiece, it's been voted as the AFI'S #1 American Film of all time, Orson Welles has been called a genius. This stuff, we all know. However, I have heard and read SO MANY opinions about WHY this movie ISN'T great or even good. In fact I cringed as I read that some one called it "sucky". I think there is a lot about this picture that people need to realize in order to appreciate it a bit more. One of the great complaints about this film is that it's not entertaining, I think it is, but let's also remember that their is NO requirement for films to be entertaining (not everything must be a crowd-pleaser). The simple fact is, Orson Welles ushered along techniques in film that have set the tone for most filmmakers since (much like D.W. Griffith in 1915). But it's not just camera work. It's context as well. The way Kane's story is told. I'd be interested to know how many people that have said Citizen Kane was not good, that might agree that "The Usual Suspects" is one of the great movies of the past ten years. They are told with the same storytelling tools. Simply put, Welles did things that just weren't done prior to Kane. Not only that, but he based it on William Randolph Hearst. He took on the most powerful man in America of the time. And he fought to have it seen through even after Hearst threatened the entire Hollywood studio system. The greatness of this film is not only what is on the screen, but the story behind it as well. The truth is, Orson Welles was making an American classic when he was only 25 years old. What were the rest of us doing at 25?If you're interested in the battle between Hearst and Welles for Citizen Kane, check out "RKO 281".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'What was Citizen Kane about, Dad', I asked my father, who was busily consuming his pasta at the dinner table. 'It was about showing that beyond all the Hollywood schmaltz, there were still people with production values', he replied. I sat silent mystified, wondering why he hadn't just given me a straight answer, and then went off to watch this mystic 'masterpiece' of 1941. An hour into the film, I began to understand what my father meant, for, watching you don't really see the story of a business tycoon, but more of the product made by a man with a vision. Orson Welles, as well as creating what was basically a new genre- a biopic, raised the bar of quality to new heights with this movie. The variety of camera shot increased, the voiceover was created, and the idea of having character perspectives instead of just a straight story was finally created.It isn't actually a very exciting movie on the surface, however. The story does not have the zip of something like Raging Bull (the life of Boxer Jake La Motta), or of course, Schindler's list, which needs no introduction. Yet while 'Kane' is perhaps not the best Popcorn entertainment, it is essential viewing if you want to learn about the invention of modern cinema.I love this not because it puts a smile on my face, but because gives me an extra perspective when I watch the movies of today. This is just about as near to perfection as you will get</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE GREATEST FILM OF ALL TIME!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Citizen Kane(1941) has not only endured the test time but the early negative criticisms to become the #1 film in cinema history. There are three things that make the movie enduring. First, the complex nature of the title character. Second, the amazing technical innovations that changed the face of cinema. Third, the ability to make people from generation to generation give nothing but admiration for this classic.Citizen Kane was not the first choice for Orson Welles. He originally planned to do a film adaptation of Joesph Conrad's Heart of Darkness that ended up falling through. Before this film, Welles was known for his infamous broadcast of The War of the Worlds. Orson Welles is one of the few artists to succeed in everly level of visual art and communications. He was heavly influenced by John Ford which helped him in making Citizen Kane. Because of his anti Hollywood atittude, Welles like a few others would be beloved by members of the French New Wave during the late 1950's.The film is slightly based on the career of William Randolph Hearst, although some portrayal of the older Kane seems to be based on Joe Kennedy, JFK's father. Its about a man who goes from being an idealistic crusader to a bitter and corrupt old man. An amazing fact is that Welles had absolute control in making Citizen Kane(a rarity then as in now). The film's expressionistic look with the use of shadows and weird angles helped begin the era of Film Noir. It was both Citizen Kane and The Maltese Falcon(done by first timers John Huston &amp; Orson Welles) that helped create one of the greatest periods in movie history.The film begins with Kane's death as the story looks back at his life. A reporter is assigned to discover the meaning of Kane's last word. The first flashback shows Kane as a young boy and the event that would have an effect on him for the rest of his life. It goes from his time with his caretaker to inheriting a fortune to opening a newspaper company. The second flashback looks at the early and idealistic period of Charles Foster Kane.The fourth flashback focuses on Charles Foster Kane's first marriage, his political ambition/disgrace, and his failed marriage. This flashback also reveals the affair that ruined his political career and first marriage. The next flashback shows his second marriage with Susan Alexander as well as her opera career, firing of Jed Leland, and the construction of Xanadu. The film climaxes with Kane's loniness and yearning to return to his days of innocence. The reporter comes to the conclusion that there is no conclusion to the meaning of Charles Foster Kane.There are four remarkable sequences in Citizen Kane. One, the opening scene. Two, the passage of time scene where the distance between Charles Kane and his wife widen. Three, the opera scenes with Susan Alexander. Four, the closing scene.Citizen Kane was co-written by Herman J. Mankiewich and Orson Welles. The direction helps carry the story along. William Randolph Hearst hatred the film and tried to have it destroyed. It didn't help that Hollywood resented Welles for being a genius and an upstart. Citizen Kane(1941) and The Trial(1963) were the only films in which Orson Welles had complete artistic control.Citizen Kane is a great film that was cheated out of many Oscars including Best Picture. The director had used the John Ford/John Wayne vehicle Stagecoach(1939) as an inspiration for his feature debut. In fact, Welles had watched Stagecoach about forty times during the making of the film. The cast and crew were members of Welle's Mercury Theatre. The insertion of Kane into footage with famous world leaders is nothing short of brilliant.Orson Welles does a balancing act of being selfish and sympathetic. Orson Succeed under the three hat role of director, writer, and producer. Joesph Cotten is super as Jed Leland in his portrayal of a hurt and betrayed man. The themes of friendship and betrayal would appear in films like The Third Man(1949), and Touch of Evil(1958). An early cameo is made by Hollywood legend Alan Ladd.The ten greatest films of all time are 1.Citizen Kane(1941), 2.The Wild Bunch(1969), 3.City Lights(1931), 4.Battleship Potemkin(1925), 5.Raging Bull(1980), 6.The Godfather(1972), 7.Vertigo(1958), 8.Eight &amp; a Half(1963), 9.Seven Samurai(1954), and 10.The Searchers(1956). Its fitting that the Film Noir period began with Citizen Kane in 1941 and ended with Touch of Evil in 1958. The film editor was West Side Story director Robert Wise. Welles had hurt his hands during the filming of the destruction of his second wife's room. The somber music was done by future Alfred Hitchcock collaborator, Bernard Hermann.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is rightly regard as one of, if not the, best film ever made. After wanting to see Citizen Kane for a few years now, I finally did but one day ago.What makes this film so good is that it is thoroughly enjoyable. Why, you may well ask and how can a film that is essentially so actionless and talky be so enjoyable? Well, let me tell you:Welles gives one of the all time great performances in film as Charlie Kane, as he plays him right from the age of 25 up to his death many decades later. Welles, a man in his mid twenties at the time is believable and compelling to watch as his character progresses through the years, swinging from likeable rogue to controlling old man to the pitiful, unsatisfied man he was before his death.The cinematography is truly astonishing. This film may look like so many others now but that's only because it invented the techniques, still used in cinema today. From the ground breaking miniature photography to the expert editing, this film is a beautiful sight to behold.Finally, the wonderful structuring of the plot shines through as the film remains easy to watch as well as mentally stimulating throughout. The end is a true piece of perfect cinema history as we, the viewer, discover what rosebud was all along and how it plagued Kane's life so powerfully through the events of the movie.In all, see this film and form you're own opinion about it because this is one of the most important movies there is, and you really should have seen it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Citizen Kane (CK) is considered the archetypal art film, even by many of its biggest fans. But at the time it was made many of the "arty" techniques it employs so effortlessly were new and innovative uses of sound and high-tech visual effects. What Orson Welles (the 25 year old boy genius who wrote, directed, and stars in the movie) achieved in CK was the realization of cinema as multi - media capable of imparting rapid cognition. We do not actually meet protagonist Charles Foster Kane (played by Welles) until half an hour into the movie, yet by that time we pretty much know (one version) of his life story.Every scene, every line of dialogue, contributes to the whole yet we are left pretty much at the beginning (despite the famous surprise end) when the movie ends. But you have the sense of having been on a long insightful journey.Citizen Kane is almost 60 years old, yet is still considered one of the (if not the) greatest films ever made. This reviewer scoffed at the idea at college and has searched for more perfect films but has to admit that it remains fresh and terrific. Why? Because, like good fiction, CK takes you into a world that is almost real and through a tale that spans the ages. It is still a masterwork.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are many films that could justifiably be considered the best movie of all time. Arguments could be made for Casablanca, The Godfather, It's a Wonderful Life or many others. All have their strong points, but none combine excellent detail with innovative narrative, characterization and story line quite like Citizen Kane does. This film is a delight that has withstood the test of time. While not particularly emotionally engaging, Citizen Kane is very intellectually satisfying. The symbolism of the picture is not difficult to decipher, but the themes, ideas and content of the movie demand contemplation. It's hard to watch this picture without looking inward and asking questions like what really brings happiness? Charles Foster Kane's life starts off promisingly enough. He creates a powerful media empire, but his idealistic enthusiasm soon gives way to cynicism and loneliness. Despite his power and his abundance of possessions, contentment eludes him. He doesn't realize what he is truly searching for until it is too late to recapture what he has lost. Told in non-linear narrative, the viewer learns about Kane's life through a series of flashbacks that occur through the eyes of various characters. This is a brilliant picture that's worthy of multiple viewings.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While I haven't seen enough of the AFI's top 100 to agree or disagree with it's decision to call it the number 1 movie of all time, I can say that I thoroughly enjoyed Citizen Kane.First, the screenplay was fabulous. Welles's and Mankewiecz's work is a wonderful depiction of a man abandoned at an early age who simply looks for love to fill a void in his life. To tie it all together using "rosebud," a symbol of Kane's lost innocence, was absolutely brilliant. The script never lost me for a second and it kept me fascinated to see each facet of Kane's personality and psyche come out.I would like to silence the naysayers who speak negatively about the acting by saying that Citizen Kane was the first movie ever done by the majority of the main characters, including Welles himself. While I do agree that the acting is not amazing, the script certainly makes up for it.One characteristic of a great movie is the fact that it has done something that no movie has done before. With its cinematography, Citizen Kane has done just that. Toland's use of depth and shadows in the movie was revolutionary, and surprisingly effective. It is also interesting to note that in the movie, the more powerful characters, like Kane, look down on the camera, while the weaker ones, like Susan, look up towards it.Citizen Kane is a fine movie that deserves all the critical acclaim and controversy it has received.

		<shortDescription>A vanguard motion picture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Probably the most unfortunate thing that ever happened to ?Citizen Kane' was that it found itself atop the AFI top film list. Now, no one can simply enjoy the film. Everyone feels compelled to scrutinize it and make a decision about its greatness. Asking whether ?Citizen Kane' is the best film of the century is like asking if Marilyn Monroe was the most beautiful woman. It depends on whom you ask.?Citizen Kane' is not the most entertaining film I've ever seen, but it is certainly one of the most important. It is a vanguard motion picture and a gargantuan achievement for Orson Welles. If you consider the fact that Welles was a 24 year old Hollywood outsider who had only done radio and theater when he landed the contract for this film, you begin to appreciate what a big deal it was. This was during a time when a few studios controlled every film that was made. How many 24 year old actor/directors can you name today, even in a world where independents abound?The story is based on the life of William Randolph Hearst. Writer Herman Mankiewicz had an up-close look at Hearst as he had been an occasional house guest at the Hearst mansion. The similarities were striking, right down to the paramour whose career Hearst promoted, who loved to do jigsaw puzzles. The fact that this film was released at all is a marvel in itself. Hearst went on a personal campaign to crush the film and enlisted every powerful friend he had to stop it. Louis B. Mayer offered RKO $800,000 to destroy the print. John D. Rockefeller ordered the Radio City premier cancelled. All of Hearst's newspapers were forbidden to mention the film. Hollywood was uniformly against it and Welles was branded an insolent maverick. The film was snubbed by the Academy. It was nominated for 9 Oscars and won only best screenplay. The film turned out to be a commercial failure, losing $150,000. With all the forces stacked against it, we are lucky to be having this best film debate at all.The story has a simple moral; that money and power can't buy happiness. We see Kane's progress from a happy child, to an idealistic young journalist intent on helping the common man, and finally to a bitter and angry old man whose innocence has slipped from him. One of the most effective scenes that illustrated this was the two minute overlay of breakfast conversations with his wife. It starts with cooing lovers and progresses through increasing levels of discord. It ends in silence with the two reading separate newspapers, her disdain for him subtly indicated by her choice of the hated Chronicle as her newspaper.What is so remarkable about this film is the filmmaking. Director after director has pointed to some aspect of this film as having influenced them. The use of shadows and various perspective shots was not unprecedented in 1941, but never before had they been used with so much dramatic impact. What was unprecedented was that ?Citizen Kane' was the first film ever to depart from the strict narrative format, which moves forward chronologically. The film starts at the end and jumps around in time based upon the perspective of the person who is telling their story about Kane. So the next time you see a flashback, remember it started here. The makeup was revolutionary. Welles often went through four hours or more of makeup to be properly aged for each scene. The film also launched a number of brilliant careers. Besides Welles, Joseph Cotton and Agnes Moorehead went on to long and prominent film careers.If ?Citizen Kane' is not the best film of the century it is certainly one of them. Its influence on a generation of filmmakers cannot be ignored in the equation. People who watch this film and ask, `What's the big deal?' are comparing it with modern films that have borrowed from this film's techniques and undergone 60 years of evolution. It's like going back to Kitty Hawk and saying, `What's the big deal, the flight only lasted a few seconds.'There is only one rating to give to a film of such monumental importance. It is the consummate 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Something for everyone to love!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What can one say that hasn't already been said about this movie? It's brilliance is trumpeted by better than I for years before and to come. And yet, here's my two cents. "Citizen Kane" is a perfect film. There's amazing camera work and editing techniques (not the first to use them, but the first film to use all of them in one film to artistic success), fantastic acting (they are acting 'on the line' or 'in the moment', and they are not over-the-top as was common at the time), a terrific story (made all the better by it's factual basis), and characters are ones that we care about (ibid). The frame is filled with small details that add to the scenes. The language and vocabulary are ones that remind us of the beauty that English can achieve, calling up mental images that are left un-painted on the screen but burn brightly in our minds. The lighting is evocative, but not overly moody. In short, everything works. The message is one of simplicity (be a human first, a collector and achiever second), yet is subtly delivered that you could easily watch this movie for the characters, the story, the action, the dialogue, or whatever you wanted to. That is the genius of this film - there is something for everyone to love in it, and it does it so successfully that it's difficult imagining anyone walking out of the theatre saying 'I can make better films than that.'</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK - I have not lived. I am now 22 years old, and yesterday I watched Citizen Kane for the first time. My reward for the ?2.50 video rental price? A lesson in film-making excellence.Orson Welles is considered by many to have been an outstanding figure in Cinema History. I can't disagree.From the beginning, a dark, brooding mood contradicts the beauty of the snow-scene and the majesty of Xanadu. From then on, the direction never fails to be anything less than clever. Kane's darker side is seen more than once, but is depicted especially well when his shadow engulfs Susan, his wife.And engulf is what he does. His need for acceptance and love is painfully clear, as is the realisation that he cannot give it. Shaped by an unhappy, disfunctional childhood, the way he tries to demand love is by smothering the lives of the people closest to him. He wants the love of 'the people' too, but succeeds only in generating as much hatred as he does admiration. And is it admiration, or pity?In the trailer to the film, Orson Welles asks the audience to judge whether Kane is a hero or a scoundrel - or both. I still can't decide. Any film that answers a question so clearly and yet leaves it totally unanswered is worth it's salt. Yet to still have a positive impact, 60 years later, on a generation content to feed on 'post-film sludge' - desensitised to Hollywood's insistence on 'spoon-feeding' - simply demands acclaim.I wouldn't say that its my favourite film, but seeing it placed in virtually every Film Poll's Top 5 list, I now know exactly why.Orson - you the man!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A phenomenal story about a man who had everything, except for his youth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a true masterpiece about a man who had everything and yet nothing. A bit Fitzgerald; in which it does come from the same era of "the lost generation." Citizen Kane depicts an era of mass civilization and a very materialistic America.But this movie has a bit more of Holden Caufield in it. As we know, Holden, is a depressed young man, who tries to find his path to follow in life. So he goes to the Big Apple; searching and failing. Then he realizes that his path is "youth." He wants to be "The Catcher in the Rye," and capture the youth from falling toward a world where civilization is corrupt.Citizen Kane depicts a man who has utterly everything and can get anything. In a way they exaggerate Kane's wealth, in order to show that even a man who has everything cannot be happy, without security. This man is an unhappy man, who's material life encompasses him. He can't enjoy what he can have, because he can have everything."I don't believe any word can describe a man's life." This is ironic; because the word "Rosebuds" symbolizes Kane's life. A man who is at his deathbed, grabs everything that had meaning in his life. Kane recognizes this, when he holds the snow-paperweight. It takes him back to one winter day, that would inevitably change his life. The one day where he loses his innocence and his pure sight; once he is introduced with a life with money (after he is taken custody to stock market pirate).I can see how people can see this movie as boring, this movie was a bit long-winded, but it is surely not a bad movie. There was a reason to say everything, and indirectly allows you to appreciate the strong relationships any individual has with there family and friends. For those who ONLY like action packed/visual effect movies, you have no idea what youa re missing out on.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The #1 film ever made? Sure. Why not?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The A.F.I. list came out not too long ago, and so everyone clamored to see what the number one film ever made was. Of course emotions were high, as well as tempers. Of course different people were rooting for different films, as to be expected. I remember the exact moment when I saw the list. It is actually in the latest issue of Newsweek magazine. Right there, in black and white, in the number one slot... "Citizen Kane."I had never seen "Citizen Kane", actually, and the list prompted me to do so. When I saw the film itself, I was shocked. Here was a slight film, understated, and very simple, really, that had obviously rocked critics everywhere, that had done the impossible. Here is a first-time filmmaker trying something new, experimenting, if you will, and he ended up making what is considered the greatest film ever produced in America.I wasn't disappointed. Welles' performance, as well as all of the others, were right on the money, the script was remarkable, and Gregg Toland's camera work took everything I thought to be reality, crumpled it up, and threw it away, never to be rediscovered.I really see little reason to review "Citizen Kane" as a film. That has been done enough times, goodness knows. What I do see fit to do is recommend it. The average viewer will be bored, of course, because there is no action, no real adventure to be found. But there is drama, especially for any who see film as film, not so much as a story. There is suspense, I think, so many times, simply because of a camera move or a well-timed change in placement. This is film as film, not as anything else. Absolutely do not miss.**** out of ****.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Widely regarded as the greatest film of all time by film lovers, but not by movie-goers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I saw "Citizen Kane" was in a Film Theory class where none of the film's finer points escape the notice of class or teacher. From factors which include history of the period in which the story is told, camera techniques, and most importantly the ground-breaking work done on the film, by then novice filmmaker Orson Welles.With the background story and attention to detail that a film class can illuminate for you, "Citizen Kane" can be an entertaining film to watch a number of times, as the camera angles and tricks employed are still interesting and appealing. What makes them more intriguing is to find out how unconventional they were at the time, and immediately recognize how truly commonplace they remain over fifty years later. It's hard for someone of my generation to appreciate unaided the finer qualities of this, the most stunning feature debut of all time.It's probably equally difficult for any feature filmmaker to not compare their first work to "Citizen Kane", and wonder how it measures up. The truth is, most directors can enjoy a far more popular reception of their film quite easily in comparison, as "Citizen Kane" was not received well due to the glaringly obvious portrayal and insult to media mogul William Randolph Hearst. While widely regarded as the finest film ever made this century, it lost the Best Picture Oscar to "How Green Was My Valley", which also goes to show how the Academy can often miss the mark completely.The truth is, "Citizen Kane" is a film lover's film. If you are not impressed by or aware of the technical details like lighting, editing, angles, tricks and bold innovations, you probably won't like it. There are other classic films that are perhaps more simplistic, which require not one iota of background explanation to understand, appreciate and enjoy the film. These are widely regarded as popular classics of a timeless nature, of which "Kane" doesn't seem to be.In an interesting and ironic twist in reflection of the film today, "Citizen Kane" will always remain a colourless, unaltered masterpiece much to the chagrin of William Randolph Hearst emulator Ted Turner. Turner's attempts to have it colourized were met with failure as contract specifications as laid out by the late Orson Welles clearly prohibit any such action or tampering with the film. For those of you who feel they will never watch it because it's not in colour, that's fine. We don't need you and you wouldn't like it anyway.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly a Cinematic Work of Art</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The AFI named this the number one American film of all time. This honor is truly deserving. With a powerful script and and fantastic aesthetics, Orson Welles is able to weave his greatest masterpiece. An anonymous reporter delves through the past of newspaper tycoon Charles Foster Kane in order to find the significance of his dying word: Rosebud. Through a series of flashbacks, we learn that one word is only one puzzle piece in a larger picture, unable to describe an entire life. Cimematographer Gregg Toland uses sequence shots and deep focus in a way never before imagined, in order to tell a story through long takes and few cuts, a feat never before accomplished with such success. The end result is a must-see American classic, where we truly see one man's whole life go up in smoke...literally.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>ORSON WELLES WAS A YOUNG LAD OF 25 WHEN HE STARTED WORKING ON "CITIZEN KANE". MANY CRITICS HAVE FELT THAT THIS FILM IS THE BEST FILM EVER MADE. IT IS HARD TO SAY WHAT IS THE BEST FILM EVER MADE...IT DEPENDS ON ONE'S POINT OF VIEW - AND THAT POINT OF VIEW HAS BEEN SHARED BY MANY WHEN IT COMES TO REVIEWING THIS FILM. THE STORY BEGINS, OR RATHER IS THE END OF AN ERA, FOR CHARLES FOSTER KANE (WELLES). HE REPEATEDLY WHISPERS "ROSEBUD". WE DO NOT FIND OUT UNTIL AT THE END OF THE MOVIE WHO HE IS REFERRING TO. THE BEST SCENE IN KANE, I THINK, IS WHEN HE IS WATCHING HIS WIFE SING AN OPERATIC SOLO FROM A BALCONY THEATRE BOOTH. SHE SINGS SO HORRIBLY AND THE AUDIENCE GIVES HER SOME MINIMAL APPLAUSE. THREE SECONDS LATER, KANE STARTS TO SLOWLY CLAP AND THEN CLAP SO LOUDLY THAT THE AUDIENCE CLAPS ALONG WITH HIM - A SIGN OF HIS POWER AS A NEWSPAPER TYCOON. THE MOVIE GAINED MUCH PUBLICITY LATER ON, ESPECIALLY WHEN RANDOLPH HEARST STARTED TO DENOUNCE IT. I THINK IT IS A LANDMARK FILM IN TERMS OF THE ACTING, SCREENPLAY, AND BRILLIANT BLACK AND WHITE CINEMATOGRAPHY. AND WHY NOT FILM IT IN BLACK AND WHITE? KANE'S LIFE WAS DARK AND DREARY ANYWAY.

		<shortDescription>More than just a chilling tale...(The Composition of a Masterpiece)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The genius of this film is often only felt by the audience from the more external understanding of the mere sequence of events that take place. Now, that's an aspect of the film worthy of praise, as Kane *did* win Best Screenplay in 1941, and the script is, indeed extremely tight. (Does anyone else marvel at the line "New York, Chicago, and Washington, maybe?" uttered by Jim Kane towards the beginning? You of course realize this maps out Kane's entire life...New York Enquirer, Chicago Opera House, and a failed political career? Not bad, eh?) But the more subtle genius of the film is it's use of triangular construction and frame composition. Oh, my gushing is taking up too much space. But, my god, the use of shadows and angles should be paid attention to! The way the aural ambience of each scene differs and morphs echoes Welles' radio background, and should be paid attention to! He used processed backgrounds for *In-Room* shots, just to pack in the right amount of information, and frame it up how it wanted. He shoots the speakers in shadowed obscurity and has them come into the light right on the key line. The cockatoo that begins the Butler's account of Susan leaving him is purely expressionist film-making! The form cuts that make the film's skewed chronology move along seamlessly! Oh, for god sakes, watch the man work, people. This is how it's done.</fullReview>

Then, I start seeking it, the history of it, even the big point of conclusion and interpretation insides this film!! Anyway, time passes. The Generation flies. I can't lie to fully enjoying this film. But I get the huge essence after watching Citizen Kane. The essence that probably found the meaning itself, as a time going away. I think it's superb legacy, the reminder to all film industry. Maybe, we doesn't care too much at that time, but finally time has reveal itself. That's why I think how wonderful it was Orson Welles vision. I know the Orson Welles himself has died even before I was born. But, can you believe that twenty four years old Orson Welles makes a landmark of the motion picture. I can only said, it's a landmark of storytelling. Amazing storytelling that endured beyond the generations. As a "rosebud" itself, Charles Foster Kane legacy highlights that finally changes peoples argument about him. As a life, human and the film evolution. I said, it's wonderful film making. Beautiful in many ways, I only just can't live at that time!!</fullReview>

Then we see the history of his life and everything he encountered throughout it.The acting is magnificent. Especially coming from Orson Welles who in my opinion gave one of the best performances ever put on screen. But every other actor offers something great to the movie and not a single one of the main actors did a weak job acting. They all gave strong performances.Wells direction is terrific and he is able to use basic elements to craft something truly brilliant with this picture. His work behind the camera is immaculate and it brings the viewer into a truly special experience.This movie is engaging from the very first scene. Some people may not like the talk heavy dialogue but if you like slow paced movies (which I usually do) then it shouldn't bother you.This movie has stood the test of time. It has aged well and it shows no sign of losing popularity. Is it one of my favorite movies of all time? No, but the reason it gets a 10/10 is because of its impact on cinema and how much it contributed to it. The only American film which comes close to topping this masterpiece is "The Godfather".</fullReview>

It is a pioneer in film and one of the greatest story lines and characters ever captured in cinema history. It has gone down as one of the greats for good reason. It is well written, acted, directed, filmed, and deserving of more Oscars than it won. It's two hour run time suits it perfectly, and unless you're an action film crazed personality, you'll most likely find yourself very intrigued. Great film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simple... But powerful!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So I decided to write a review because I saw lot of people do wrong to this movie and others being a little unrealistic. The following is purely my opinion on the movie. I'll try not to go into much detail about the movie itself. Let's just think first when this movie was made, 1941. The story starts with Charles Foster Kane ( The protagonist. ) dying and breathing out his last words which were "Rosebud". So, from the beginning of the movie there's an enigma, what is "Rosebud"? A journalist who'll write an article about the death of Kane tries to find the meaning of this word. So, with a lot of flashbacks and a flawless storytelling process we get to know who Kane was, where'd he come from. He's nature, he's good characteristics and his bad characteristics. We get a taste of how his life progressed. What I liked about Citizen Kane except from it's mystery and simplicity is how well we got to know our protagonist. By the end of this movie you may or may not understand what was the meaning of "Rosebud". I just have to suggest one thing, try and watch it. If you like it, you'll watch it again. If you don't, give it an another try and if you still don't like it then you never will. It's one of this movies that passed the test of time and still matter because in it's core, it's a movie about a human being. It was a classic "must-see in your lifetime" movies that really lived up to their hype!</fullReview>

But his life isn't interesting at any point and certain scenes drag on. There is nothing to keep the viewer gripped to the story. OK, there are a few nice camera techniques, but wake up folks!

		<shortDescription>The story of a boy who lost his sled</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Citizen Kane is a great film?the greatest of all time. Not by a long shot. It's a fantastical "boy's handbook" on how to obtain power and influence people with an attendant cautionary voice preaching throughout that such a road often leads to an end of the line tragedy: a soulless, emotional void and the regret of love lost. The reductive moral in operation here being, guess what?! "Money isn't everything." The grand mystery of Kane's one word deathbed utterance of "Rosebud," is the great man's heart-rending memory of a sled he cherished during his poor rural boyhood. The characters in this film are nothing more than paper cut-out stereotypes: the driven entrepreneur and policy maker, the blue blood, society wife, the low class blonde floozy. Joseph Cotton as Jedediah Leland, Kane's long time friend/nemesis, is the stand in for Kane's unrealized alter ego and conscience. A maudlin Victorian sentimentality keynotes the entire saga.The storyline purportedly is based on the life of William Randolph Hearst and plot elements can certainly be linked to Hearst. Hearst reportedly reviled Welles' pictorialization of him as public and private man. It has recently come to light that Hearst's wrath had a much more tantalizing and intimate genesis. "Rosebud," some sources claim was Heart's affectionate reference to the genitalia of his longtime mistress, Marion Davies and this appellation was known only to Hollywood insiders and Hearst and Davies alone. Welles had the audacity to undress this secret before the world and Hearst was furious at Welles' prank. "Rosebud," over time has indeed become an esoteric buzzword. Welles, it can be said, was a man with a determined vision, one that would not be contradicted or subject to compromise or concession. While this tenacity served him admirably, gifting him with a cinematic eye that enabled him to engender his films with creative lighting and camera angles, his talent for storytelling was compromised by an antique, naive worldview so blatant here in Citizen Kane. Orson Welles was a much better actor than filmmaker as his performances in "The Third Man," "The Stranger," and "Touch of Evil" bears out. Orson Welles' greatest creation was the legend of his own genius.</fullReview>

Some very intelligent, very film savvy people that I know are not fans of the film and they are right in their complaints: It IS too long, a bit dry, not exciting, and so it goes...But I love it. The cinematography and shooting techniques (as you've probably heard before) changed filmmaking and survive even to this day. The dialog seems silly at first blush, but when I hear what the characters are ACTUALLY saying, it is heartbreaking "You'll hate it in Chicago, the wind comes right off that lake..." really means "Don't leave, you're the last one left that loved Charlie and Mr. Kane." The acting is still good even by today's standards. If you can get past the screeching voice of Mrs. Kane the 2nd, you'll find that she's very capable. Welles is like a pot left to slow boil with occasional eruptions and Joseph Cotton handles his role with an admirable mix of humor and sadness.I come back to this movie time and time again and it doesn't disappoint. I won't try to change anyone's mind about it because as I said, the critiques are sound, but I'm glad this movie exists.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best Film Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you ever are in Californina, USA, go and visit Hearst Castle, which ones were built by William Hearst, the Newsman, who stood as a model for the leading character in the film. Than you get an even deeper understanding of all the levels Orson Wells tried to show/act out in the film.The story is fascinating how a man can be driven by things happening in his childhood, which of course probably is a speculation. the only person who would know is William Hearst himself and his is dead. But also Orson Wells extraordinary way of reflecting the inner and outer of the leading character is amazing! This is of course also one of the films you can see many times both for discovering new levels and also for enjoying what you know will happens already from the beginning.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kane falls down in second half</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's difficult criticizing a movie that's hailed as the greatest movie of all time. From the standpoint of cinematography, it might just deserve all the accolades that have been heaped upon it all these years. But my specific bone to pick with Citizen Kane is a story line that kind of runs out of gas. Orson Welles said that 'Kane' was not specifically about William Randolph Hearst but represents a sort of composite portrait of the rise and fall of a prominent American in the public eye. But one can see clearly that Welles had it in for Hearst. So much of the first half of the movie (up until the midpoint) is reminiscent of Hearst. And indeed it is the most compelling part of the picture. Up until half-way through Kane we feel that Welles is really being fair to his Kane-Hearst character who's depicted as charming but also capable of acts of megalomania. It's this multi-dimensional portrait throughout the first half that really grips our attention. Plot wise the stakes are raised until Kane's thunderous fall from grace when he's caught in a "love nest" with the "singer". This is the setup for the second half of Act 2 of the script leading to the 'point of no return' when Kane flips out after his second wife leaves him.Welles was faced with a big problem in the second half of his script?what to do with main character? The first half is so believable because it is based on the events of a real person's life. But when Welles looked to Hearst for inspiration for the second half of his movie, there really were few compelling conflicts LEFT for him to latch on to. In real life, Hearst continued to publish his newspaper, was sort of a recluse who didn't reveal much about his private life and did NOT have a bad relationship with the woman who he was involved with (in contrast to the relationship between the fictional Susan Alexander and Charles Foster Kane). So what did Welles do? He decided to create a false portrait of Hearst, a veritable straw man, which he could easily shoot down. Welles, the Hollywood 'progressive' now went into battle as the standard bearer, slaying the 'reactionary' Hearst. Kane-Hearst loses his charm and basically becomes almost completely unlikable in the second half of the movie. Welles grafts a 'character flaw' on to Kane-Hearst based on a man named McCormick, a Chicago heir who promoted the singing career of his no-talent mistress which is reflected in the Susan Alexander Kane story arc. By falsely depicting Kane-Hearst as a violent man obsessed with trivial pursuits, we no longer see a character who is multi-faceted. This is Welles deceiving himself that he's 'better' than William Randolph Hearst (despite Welles's disingenuous claims that the character was not really based on Hearst.)Citizen Kane is really the harbinger of things to come for Orson Welles's career?a career that ran the gamut from profound inspiration to adolescent narcissism. Technically Citizen Kane was probably the greatest film ever made and full of sensational performances. But at the same time Welles's elitist point of view and simple inability to follow through to complete a story full of great promise diminishes the overall impact of an American classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Technique Fails to Hide Dull Subject</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Citizen Kane is one of the great technical milestones in the history of film. It is also a rather dull film that fails to involve the viewer on any but a technical level. The innovative cinematography far outshines the ordinary subject matter and the viewer is never viscerally engaged. The movie is cold and slow. 1. The first flaw is Kane. The whole film is built around an examination of the life of this character, but he is neither very important nor very interesting. William Randolph Hearst, the inspiration for Kane, is a minor historical figure in retrospect, as even the movie makes clear. Comparisions to Kubla Khan and talk of an "empire upon an empire" ring hollow. Kane has some influence but no real power. He fails to secure high office. He pumps for the Spanish-American War but opposes American entry into World War I. In each case, the decision for war is made by others. Thirty-seven newspapers and a radio station is hardly an empire and Kane lacks even the muscle to put a singer over with a skeptical public.Nor is Kane an out-sized and fascinating character such as General Patton in the movie "Patton". Kane says early in the movie that he might have been great without money, but we see nothing to indicate that this assessment reflects anything but blind ego. It is only his inherited wealth which props him up at all. He is a failure as a politician. He is a failure as a businessman. He is a failure in his personal life. He is surrounded by talentless sycophants.2. Kane is never put into the context of his times. This is a major failing of the movie. What do we actually learn about the United States from the 1890's to 1941. Race is swept utterly under the rug. The only black faces to be seen are stereotypical servants and musicians. What about the social issues of the time? Did Kane support prohibition? Did he favor immigration? Oppose lynching? What about women's rights? We find out nothing about his views, other that in some way his political collapse set back the cause of reform, apparently because he ran against "corruption".3. The script leaves critical areas of Kane's life and character blank and unexplored. He becomes a father. The movie does not show us his response to the birth of a son, nor what sort of dreams and hopes he invests in the boy. We never see how he reacts to his son's death or the impact this tragedy has on him. The birth and death of an only child should be pivotal and life-altering events. They are thrown away in this movie.4. The acting is in and out. Agnes Moorehead, Ray Collins, Ruth Warrick, and Paul Stewart are excellent in small parts. Others, such as Erskine Sanford, overact. Everett Sloane is convincing as an old man. Joseph Cotton is not, and is poorly made up. Dorothy Comingore is strident and off-putting as Susan. Welles himself is often striking, but is undercut by poor makeup in some later scenes. Neither the characters, not the acting, except for Welles, linger in the memory.5. The character of Kane is pretty well-sketched in halfway or two- thirds of the way through the movie. We know all we are going to know or perhaps care to know, but the movie lumbers on, with Kane sinking from merely arrogant to grotesque. The transition from the bright, promising, if perhaps unexceptional, young man, to the bizarre old recluse in a marble palace is shown, but not explained, and frankly, I thought the scenes at Xanadu were over-the-top.All in all, a masterpiece of technique that deserves credit for striving for a more adult spin than most movies of its era, but a movie, which, ironically, has dated more than the less ambitious, accomplished, or artistic, rivals from that era.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>collecting, collecting, collecting...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love to watch this film over and over again and every time I see something new, challenging and interesting. A film, which can be called a touchstone of film making in Hollywood,chock full visually and contently. Nearly every detail and every word is chosen exactly and the form backs up the content accurately, that is why it is an perfect example of formalist film making. In fact a simple story, rise and fall of a man, is told but with every possibility of the medium. All that wide angles, black and white shadows, surrealist shots reminding German expressionism, lighting and beautiful deep-focus cinematography using the field depth to its limits (arranging all the visual elements in a meaningful way) serve to the content and creates meaning. There is not much to say on its brilliant form, it is really something for its time. And when we come to the plot, the story is very well structured and told in flash-backs and from different point of views. From psychoanalitic point of view, all film is about separation of Kane from his mother in small ages and his effort to fill that "lack" through his life. He collects many things through his life in order to fulfill his life and forget the big loss of his mother. He struggles with his symbolic father ,whom separated him from his mother, all his life and he leads his life missing the feeling of the "unity" in other words "wholeness" with his mother. In fact feeling of wholeness can never be gained in adult life and that's why he collects, collects and goes on until his death but of course he never succeeds to fell that unity again. A house full of stuff from every corner of the world can't fill his lack. That feeling finds body in fantasy objects like Rosebud, his sled, which we see it in his hands in their separation scene with his mother. In other words Rosebud is his "object a" (fantasy object) that fills his loss. We may say that Rosebud is the symbol of his lack of his mother. Also through his life he never gets successful with women and dies alone and his last word is Rosebud, which is very meaningful. I highly recommend it whomever hasn't watched it yet. It is indeed a classic, watching is great pleasure and a different experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Citizen Kane is considered by most to be the best motion picture ever made, for those who see it, it still inspires awe. If the people who believe this are talking about the spectacular views and innovative camera angles, then yes, I agree, but otherwise, I could have done without seeing this movie. The simple plot line consists of a man on his deathbed, his final word, Rosebud. This man, Charles Foster Kane was a huge newspaper tycoon, who everyone either loved or hated. As a memorial to him, a mini-motion picture is made depicting his life, but it is missing something. The creators decide to throw in his final word, telling the audience what it meant. Only problem is, as they talk to everyone who was ever close to Kane, his manager, Mr. Bernstien (Everett Sloane), his friend Jedediah Leland (Joseph Cotten), and his second wife Susan Alexander Kane (Dorothy Comingore), no one can help, no one knows what or who Rosebud is. Eventually the audience finds out, but the characters in the movie never do. Like I said, this is an excellent movie if you are talking about how Orson Welles filmed it. He used new ways of getting a shot, like in the beginning of the movie where the audience sees the nurse come in to Kane's bedroom threw the shards of broken glass on the floor. Or when light in Kane's bedroom is on, and then when he dies it fades out. A really good technique Welles uses while filming was zooming in and out. A great example of this is at the beginning of the movie when the camera is on the NO TRESPASSING sign on the front gate of Xanadu, after you see that shot, Orson zooms into everything on the grounds, then finally up to Kane's bedroom. Kudos to Orson Welles. Not only did he star in `Citizen Kane,' but he also produced, directed, and helped write the screenplay. Unfortunately, that's where all the compliments stop and the criticism begins. Like the acting, everyone, for the most part, played his or her roles very casually. It didn't seem like there was too much emotion going on in any one role. When emotion did surface, it felt overdone and over exaggerated, like when Mrs. Susan Alexander Kane is yelling at her husband, her voice is too shrill for my ears and made me want to stop listening. If you were looking for a movie that has a lot of emotional value, `Citizen Kane,' would not be it. However, if you were looking for a movie that is ahead of its time visually, you would be pleased as to what you would find in `Citizen Kane.' All in all I would give this movie 6 out of 10 stars based only on Orson Welles excellent camera techniques.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What, you haven't heard enough already?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's clearly no secret by now that Citizen Kane is considered to be a pretty good movie. It's also no secret that it is considered to be the greatest film of all time by more people than any other film. Probably the only thing that is left to be said about Citizen Kane is peoples' opinions, and that's what I'm gonna give you, my opinion. (spoilers) I've seen Citizen Kane several times now, and I still learn something new about it every time I see it. I've come to the conclusion that this film is so highly acclaimed because of the sheer brilliance of the direction, as well as the excellent acting. This isn't exactly an original idea, but when I say that, I mean that the story of the film itself was nothing particularly groundbreaking. In extremely simplified form, it's about a newspaper mogul who basically runs himself and his newspaper into the ground because of his incredible stubbornness. He spends his life of wealth cluttering his ridiculously huge house with meaningless junk, making it impossible for him to find the one meaningful thing in his life, Rosebud. I think that Kane's loss of Rosebud represents his fall from innocence, and the story of Citizen Kane is unbelievably well presented. Citizen Kane is literally an encyclopedia of film technique, because every single shot in the film is completely packed with visual information that goes far beyond just pointing at the action to show what's happening. However, it's not the fact that Orson Welles utilized these techniques or the idea that he created or invented them, because nearly all of these techniques can be seen in films that came before Citizen Kane. The amazing thing here is that there are dozens and dozens of those techniques that can be found in various earlier films, but EVERYTHING is here, and there is so much going on and it is presented so carefully and with such a calculated result that its style dwarfs anything seen before or since.Citizen Kane is not a movie that is likely to thrill or keep an audience on the edge of their seats, especially a modern audience. It is definitely a drama, and it does move fairly slowly at many points, but it is such an amazing thing to watch if you know what to look for. The first time I saw it, I was bored out of my skull. But as I read and learned more and more about it, I realized what things symbolize in the film and I learned about angles and distance and character position and frame composition, which has made me come to realize more and more why it is considered to be the greatest American film ever made. Watch it more than once, because no one can see all that there is to see in Citizen Kane after just one viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"There's only one person that decides what I'm gonna do and that's me"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From a personal viewpoint I would cast my vote for "Rashomon" as the greatest film ever made, but I am more than happy for a procession of critics to hand this picture the ultimate accolade.There are all the usual things you could claim about what makes this movie so special: innovative direction, ceilings on sets, etc., etc. What always makes me sit up more than anything is Ray Collins breaking the fourth wall near the beginning. Perhaps, like it's director-writer-star, this is more a film you can admire than love. While the film is purported based on William Randolph Hurst (someone I once knew had a theory that the lead character's initials were a subliminal advert for a fast food chain when spelt backwards), it is interesting to note how the obnoxious, domineering, excessive, lonely Kane is played by the allegedly obnoxious, domineering... Orson Welles.But what makes Citizen Kane an ideal choice for the finest movie is that while embraced by the critical fraternity, it is almost exclusively a mainstream film. The directorial "tricks" are dealt with in an understated manner (though the panning shot under a neon sign and through a skylight was obviously so well savoured it's repeated twice, once in reverse) so that they never distract. Just like any other standard movie of the era, this one has romance, drama and song and dance routines. Okay, so many of these may be shot through with more depth than normal, and the circular, fragmented nature of the plot is not what audiences were expecting. But essentially this is not an esoteric work, but something for the masses. Even the psychology behind Kane - and this is my only real criticism - is overstated, almost spoon-feed where interpretation would do. However, this also fits in perfectly with the production's study of excess, the (now obvious, sadly) matte paintings that make up a huge mansion.Ultimately, of course, this is a film that is asking questions. Away from the dark vignettes, where men hit women and cheat on their wives, we have the revelation of Rosebud. The film asks the question "what is a man?" and then delivers the perfect resolution. Then the finale gives us the biggest surprise of all - no, not Rosebud, but the roll call of all the actors in the film that had never been in a motion picture before. The shock of seeing a procession of extremely competent actors that had only just made their debut is stunning. Was this really only 1941?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Lesson In Filmmaking!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to admit when I first saw Citizen Kane in a film class in college, I did not like it. Years later, I soon discovered that it was not the film. It was the instructor who prejudiced my opinion. Now, after several attempts at filmmaking, I realized that this is a true classic. I understand the reason George Lucas, Steven Speilberg and others use this as a blueprint in making films. This is a technical masterpiece!!! The first of it's kind!!Some people have a problem with this film. Maybe it's just because they don't know the history of film. Or maybe they don't consider this movie as fast pace as today's big-budget Hollywood productions. Or they simply do not like this film.But one has to remember, this film was made in 1941. At the time, Wells encountered a lot of scandal and setbacks while making what this movie. But he endured and successfuly completed what the world now knows as "Citizen Kane".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Greatest Artistic Achievement of the Century</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you never heard of "Citizen Kane", you know nothing about motion picture history. If you didn't like "Citizen Kane", you know nothing about art. This is one of the very few moments in the history of art that a man reached the status of an unreachable genius. The camera movements, the screenplay, the soundtrack, the editing, the characters and the cinematography can never be described by words, only by the heavenly experience of watching the film. The young Orson Welles presents, on every aspect of his masterpiece, maturity and intelligence, combined with unforgettable performances of the whole cast and crew, specially Joseph Cotten. Even though "Citizen Kane" has harmed his further career, because of the low rentals, the RKO greed and William Randolph Hearst personal "vendetta", the next generations learn how to worship Orson Welles, and remark him as one of the genius of mankind. This is a film by a maverick, in a genious way that only a maverick can be, viewing the human soul not just good, neither just bad, like Hollywood and its current filmakers tend to view and show it today.</fullReview>

I suppose that in the era when this film was made, there was some good reason for supposing audiences would be enthralled to learn the inner goings-on for a famous and powerful man such as Kane. Those days are gone and I must report that everyone I know considers this film a dinosaur and utterly lacking in both plausibility and attractiveness. The very last thing I will do is to sit around attempting to learn the wheres and why-fores about a completely fictional person who I couldn't care less about. Kane was an unimportant nothing, in my book, be he fictional or the representation of someone real. The supposedly enthralling "Rosebud" clue was almost an insult to my intelligence - an obvious gimmick to hook the viewer. And in the end, it was nothing more than a cheap sham. For this film era, might I recommend a good Charlie Chan film?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just before Susan leaves, she tells Charles that he doesn't love her, he just wants her to love him. This is such a powerful statement, as it essentially sums up the way Charles Kane relates to everyone else. There is a scene where a drunk Jedediah confronts Kane in a similar fashion, chiding the way Charles puts himself on a pedestal when associating himself to other people.Charles is selfish, but almost as a defence mechanism. His parents, having sent him away as a young boy, left him to cope with a deep sense of abandonment. He seeks to fill that void with the admiration of others, but on his own terms. Instead of giving of himself, he wants people to love him in exchange for things or rights or privileges - in essence, he wants to purchase love and loyalty. He is not willing to offer love in return. If his own parents could abandon him, what is there to stop anyone else from doing the same?He falls for Susan one fateful night, because she enjoys him for who he is, unaware of his wealth and influence. Their relationship fizzles, however, as he constantly tries to buy her affection by forcing on her a childhood dream of hers to be a singer. His wealth and influence is great enough to make her a relative success, but her lack of talent, combined with critical derision, sours the dream. She wants out, but Charles forces the issue by building her opera houses across the country. All Susan wants is the fun, caring Charles she met that first night, not the man using his status to purchase her love. She feels no different than the many statues he has set up around their enormous, vacuous palace.Charles ends up driving Susan away because of his inability to love and his incessant need for control. It is the same control he imposes upon everyone else in his life, as a way to manage his own anxiety. He puts up walls to prevent anyone else from hurting him. When Susan leaves him, he comes across a snow globe in her room that reminds him of his childhood home - the last place he truly felt whole. "Rosebud," that final utterance, is the object to which he pins his last true sense of innocence - something he has been searching for ever since.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just as much an American classic as "Huck Finn" or "The Great Gatsby"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is "Citizen Kane" the greatest film ever made? On a technical level, it may as well be. Its at least the most groundbreaking film ever made. On a storytelling level, its an amazing achievement itself in that Orson Welles used such avant-garde techniques yet maintained a liner and engrossing story. Its a film full of contradictions and works perfectly because of them. Its over-the-top yet subtle, experimental yet entirely accessible, quickly paced yet requiring of patience. Its considered the greatest film because of how it incorporates all these trademarks into one collective whole and the fact it basically reinvented the rules on how to make a movie. This must be credited to both Gregg Toland's cinematography (probably the best ever for a film) and Robert Wise's editing as much as Orson Welles' direction. This is probably the first film that could be considered so visually dense it required multiple viewings.Oddly enough, in spite of the vast array of technical advances introduced in this film, its the story that one remembers. The tale of a newspaper tycoon manages to be just as much an American classic as "Huck Finn" or "The Great Gatsby". Welles is so often praised as a director, its easy to overlook the fact he was an accomplished actor also. Because of his multi-layered performance, Kane is a sympathetic individual instead of a cold hearted capitalist stock character. The screenplay by Herman J. Mankiewicz is so superb many argue he deserves as much credit as Welles. The hype on this one is really deserved. Even though its not my personal favorite (not even mine for Welles, that'd be "Touch of Evil"), it really may as well be the greatest film of all time. Entirely beyond criticism. (10/10)</fullReview>

The Smithsonian article is fascinating in regards to the movie but the woman - Rosebud Yellow Robe - is even more fascinating. I hope some producer reads this and does some research on her leading to a feature film about her beginnings and long life. The rich Native American culture of South Dakota encompasses the tragic history of all of the original inhabitants of this continent and would make for an epic film.

		<fullReview>Charles Foster Kane (Welles), newspaper giant and billionaire, dies alone in his huge domain Xanadu. His last word, "Rosebud", sends news reporters and investigators on a hunt to uncover his complex past and unravel the dying legend's words."Citizen Kane", by then first-time film director Orson Welles (then in his twenties with acclaimed radio and theater work under his belt), is still stunning and fresh today, despite containing many elements of film which we today take for granted, but were unheard of at the time. In 1941, the multiple flash-back structure, complex visual vocabulary - including angles that are still less than orthodox - and scope were truly revolutionary. What remains is an almost exhaustive film class in one movie.Orson Welles imbues the grand-standing and often vulgar Kane with undeniable charisma. His presence in his own films would soon prove to be one of their most enduring strengths: think of his jovial Falstaff in Chimes at Midnight, his repulsive Quinlan in Touch of Evil and his simmering Othello in his adaptation of Shakespeare's play. Welles's would be a career of superb roles and cameo, and Kane is no exception. As his wounded best friend, Joseph Cotten holds his own with panache and emotion, and all the supporting turns are fine, amplified by the then novel overlapping naturalistic dialogue to make this one of the most alive films of all time.Citizen Kane also marked a turning point in talkies, where they ceased to be neatly illustrated plays or books and became something else: something that is meant to work primarily on a screen. Whereas classics of the silent and later were defined by frames (like a painting) or dialogue (like a novel or play), Citizen Kane is defined by movement and editing, juxtapositions of moments and images, duration of frames and nature of cuts. It was the first film, and to this day one of the very few films to fully make use of the complete film-making arsenal. that it is endlessly entertaining as a story (kudos to screenwriter Mankiewitz) is the icing on an extremely alluring cake."Citizen Kane" often grabs the number 1 spot in critic polls, and for all its technical and artistic excellence, its entertaining nature makes it easy to appreciate throughout the ages, something a Kubrick or a Tarkovskyhave never achieved despite their brilliance.hands down one of the best films of all time!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film should be number one............</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>as it's probably the best and most intelligent script ever written and it's splendidly and brilliantly directed and acted.If you're looking for pure entertainment, you won't find it here. CITIZEN KANE is a thinking person's entertainment that touches on many aspects of morality and the lack thereof. Imagine a hybrid of "The Prince" and "All The King's Men" and you have something of the ideas at the core of CITIZEN KANE (yes, this predates Robert Penn Warren's masterpiece). That message is that power, be it monetary or political, corrupts AND destroys. That money buys the best of everything except that which is truly worthwhile. That an ego, left unchecked, will turn on itself. That loneliness is too often self-imposed. It is a story of a man's self-destruction - of how his desire to have everything and control everything ultimately results in his having nothing except his money and regrets. These were new and profound subjects for mass entertainment.CITIZEN KANE is cinematic brilliance. It stands, arguably, at the summit of American cinema. As for me, I don't know if it's the best movie ever made. I do know that there are a few movies that are just as good but I know of none that are better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why is it so low?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>According to the AFI, Sight and Sound, and several other top polls, this is the greatest film ever made. According to the users of IMDb, it is the 16th greatest film ever made. WTF! Can you honestly say the "Lord of the Rings" films are better?! "The Shawshank Redemption?!" "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly?!" Honestly people! It influenced and entire generation of filmmakers. It is so copied and so used as a textbook more than any of the above mentioned films are. I urge everyone reading this review to vote this to the top it belongs. It is a blemish to IMDb that it is so low. Let us show some general appreciation to Welles and to cinema. Get it higher on the list!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Love the aspect that you are memorized with the storyline. Only reason I didn't give it a 10 was some movies I just enjoyed more. They weren't better made but just more enjoyable. His mastery of the story is quite evident by his use of various techniques of story telling. you don't know exactly how he intends to direct us but you sure want to go there. When he says Rosebud, you are forever hooked on what the notion that you are guessing on how he will lead us and why he said Rosebud in the first place. The story is so engrossing and it does become timeless for all generations. I love the feel and texture of this film. I wish some film producers would learn that the price of the film doesn't make it better but on how you convey your idea's. Orsen Welles has such a great mastery of what needs to be said in a story - Bottom line, it a great movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERS Every person has their own little list of famous films which they haven't seen. Films which are legendary and which cause looks of shock by friends if you admit to your ignorance. Your friends look at you with a look of surprise, and ever so slight disdain, if you confess your guilty little lie that you've never seen this piece of cinematic history. Whether it be "Godfather Part II" or "Star Wars", these films are often well loved by those who consider themselves to be film enthusiasts.One film which constantly appears on the embarrassing list belonging to individuals is Orson Welles' "Citizen Kane". Written, directed, produced and staring that one genius of an individual, "Citizen Kane" is often named in polls as one of the greatest films of all time. This in itself though can cause problems for the every day viewer. Whilst it is not difficult to see why so many people rave about the film, it's constant hype and the praise laid upon it, means that the Kane newcomer always enters with expectations of an almost planetary size. "Citizen Kane" is a wonderful film and yet another fitting tribute for cinema's most important individual (Welles), but by putting so much pressure on an audience to be dazzled, the films enthusiasts are doing the film more damage than good.Orson Welles plays Charles Foster Kane. Taken away from his parents at a young age, Kane grows up into a rebellious rogue who inherits an enormous fortune. Taking over a failing newspaper, Kane sets about making a name for himself.Told through flashbacks, the life of Kane is certainly an interesting one. A man who appears to have it all, yet always possesses an underlying unhappiness, Orson Welles presents Kane as a man we feel more pity for than any other emotion.In perhaps his second finest performance, personal choice going for his relatively short role in 1949's "The Third Man, Welles presents an emotionally varied Kane who appears to be at his happiest when lavished with love and attention. This rich, almost childlike, individual forever insists on getting his own way, whilst others around him grow to dislike, and in some cases resent, him. With his superb script and outstanding direction, Welles brings passion to the role and deserved more than just an Oscar nomination for his performance.As we experience Kane's life through flashback, we obviously witness all those people who matter to him at one point or another. The supporting cast, led by Joseph Cotten and Dorothy Comingore, is exquisite in it's performance as it helps to make the film more than just the Orson Welles show. Cotten in particular, accredited at the end of the film with an "introducing", is superb as Kane's old friend Jebediah Leland, a man who grows to dislike Kane's increasingly flexible morality. Keeping a copy of Kane's original mission statement for the paper, Cotten's character slowly collapses in on himself as he gives way to alcohol, cigars and Kane's imaginative views on journalism. Always keeping the character alive, Cotten never stops working hard for Welles and obviously proved a success since he once again worked with Welles in "The Third Man".All in all, "Citizen Kane" is a superb film. Worthy of the praise people heap upon it, the film's method of story telling is brilliant, and keeps the audience entertained from start to finish. The problem though remains that whether worthy of praise or not, this film is not going to be for everybody. Released over sixty years ago, it is not going to appeal to the majority of younger generations. This, added to the absolutely humongous amount of admiration that the film receives, is going to lead to some individuals feeling disappointed by their expectations. "Citizen Kane" is one of the greatest films of all time, but to prevent younger generations from finding it over-hyped, we need to cease our praise and simply let them watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Typical "rise and fall" crap. Orson Wells made such a shambles here that one is tempted to believe Danny Devito would have made a better go of it. The "Santa With Muscles" equivalent of the 1940s, sans the only redeeming feature, Hulk. The acting was atrocious, the story dull, and the action scenes decidedly lacking. The fact that this film possessed contained some of the more innovative special effects to plague the filming industry (Such as a mono-colour scheme) did little to relieve its monotony. And honestly, who didn't expect the ending? It's no wonder that Orson Welles never found work again. The brief appearance he made in "Ed Wood" was more than excessive for a man who didn't breathe at the time of its production. Citizen Kane? More like Citizen Pain!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No wonder this movie gets so high ratings</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Made in 1941, this movie is a classic and has been called the best movie ever made. That is not bad considering it was made by a 29 year old, Orson Welles. For some reason I have always put this movie aside, because people have been telling me that it is a deep movie and not to be viewed without concentration. So therefore I have always put it off, but finally I put it in the DVD player. Let me tell you, it really is a great movie. Or should I say fantastic movie? We follow Charles Foster Kane, from childhood, to his deathbed. The death scene starts the movie and you hear Kane say the word `Rosebud' and that is what the movie is about, trying to find out what he meant by it. Orson is a master at setting the scene, how the camera works, the setting etc. But I won't tell you more about this because this movie is an experience in itself. I rate this movie 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rosebud **Spoilers Herein**</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**SPOILERS HEREIN** You have been warned.The sled is not the answer, and Citizen Kane knows it. Yet almost all of the film is told in flashback to discover what Charles Foster Kane's last words meant. The sled was `rosebud,' and finding this out in that last scene is nothing short of satisfying. A sixty year old sled cannot explain a man's life or answer and any lingering questions about him, and yet knowing that Rosebud was his childhood sled is one of the most satisfying `answers' to a mystery in cinematic history. Charles Foster Kane's entire life is told in a flashback through a journalists eyes (we're always looking through his eyes because we always see his back). Through a newsreel, there is the Kane who `spoke for the common man' yet had the largest estate in America. Through his bank-owning guardian Thatcher, there is the Kane who squandered his fortune for a small newspaper and started those despicable tabloids. Through his best friend Leland, there is the Kane who wrote a dubious Declaration of Principles and went against everything it stood for years later, and who chose his mistress over his political career. Through his admiring assistant Bernstein, there is the Kane who entertained millions, and who wrote Leland's bad review for Susan Alexander (`sure, everyone knows that story'). Through Susan Alexander, there is the Kane who made shadow figures on the wall but never gave her anything she really cared about. There is the Kane through Thomson, the journalist, who says: `You know, in a way, I kinda feel sorry for the man.' Kane was always a man who people couldn't quite figure out. He was a man who saw what he wanted and knew how to get it. But it is obvious, through Orson Welles' superb acting, that Kane wants something more than just material goods or power. He is never seen admiring one of his statues or gazing at one of his paintings. Mainly, he wants love. He cannot truly love so he wants double the love for himself. He creates his own love, only to learn that love cannot be created. He creates a political appearance, so that people may hate the opposition and love him. He even creates an operatic career out of his second wife, so that people may love what he has produced. This is the Kane that the people around him could sense. Leland, Susan, even Thomson, all saw the Charles Foster Kane who had lost almost everything he had, and just could not fathom that love too could be lost. Then there is the Kane who is alone. Even though all of his life is told in flashback and all of the events were witnessed by someone, there are intimate scenes in which a man is revealed who was surrounded by people and yet died alone. There is the boy playing outside in the snow while his parents determine his future. There is the Kane (his face hidden in shadow) clapping longer than anyone else for Susan's performance. There are the many Kanes reflected through parallel mirrors. There is the Kane letting out all his anger and he destroys Susan's room and his mistakes. There is the Kane who utters `Rosebud' before he drops the wintry ball and dies. Rosebud? Bernstein seems to think it was something that he remembered and wished he had from a long time ago. Leland thinks it was something he lost. Thomson thinks both: `He got everything he wanted, and then lost it. Maybe Rosebud was something he couldn't get, or something he lost. Anyway, I don't think it would have explained everything. I don't think any word can explain a man's life. No, I guess Rosebud is just a piece in a jigsaw puzzle... a missing piece.' The sled is what young Charlie Kane loves and plays with in the snow, and also uses in a feeble attempt to escape from Thatcher. The sled is what Charlie was reminded of when Thatcher tried to give him a new sled for Christmas. The sled is a satisfying `ending' for reasons that are hard to put into words. The sled is the core of the stunted development of Kane's private life. It is the symbol of hope, innocence, longing and security. It is the origin and a reminder of a time before greatness. It's a `what if.' But when Charles Kane dies, for him, Rosebud is love.My grade: 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great work of poetic art</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Citizen Kane" is a very mature film. And you have to participate, as a viewer, to get into this one. For example, the use of short lenses with everything in focus (background, foreground, etc) forces you to choose for yourself what you think is more relevent in the frame. Welles and Tolland never impose their vision on you. It also gives way to overlapping dialogues, which was unheard of back then, and still is rarely seen in standard Hollywood movies. Same thing with the editing. Welles seldom cuts in talking scenes, instead he just keeps long takes rolling, therefore, once again as a viewer, you have to participate and focus on what you think is more important in the scene, rather than have the habitual overuse of separate talking heads forcing you to see one actor and not all of them. In "Kane", you can witness all the characters' reaction to the events. Sometime Welles will cut only at the very end of a dialogue for dramatic emphasize. Then, there is the structure of the film. Everyone seems to think they knew the real Charles Foster Kane. But nobody really ever knows everything about another person. That's both the beauty and the tragedy of any human life. But by giving us first of all the death of the main subject with his final and famous dying word, Welles is using a gimmick to allow us to witness different recollections by the people who think they knew him best. But the bottom line is, all they can do is give us a rendering of different events and can never get at the heart of the man. And that's why no one really knows about Rosebud. "Kane" never had a huge budget but it made a wise use of special effects that don't call attention to them like "The matrix" does, for example. That gave a grand look to the picture. But you never realize it as you're watching the film. There would be a lot more to say about this wonderful work of art, but it would take years to match all that has been written about "Citizen Kane" and a lot of people explain the film a lot better that I can. I'm just asking the potential viewers of Orson Welles film to use a little intelligence while viewing it. It's a piece of poetry. Even Jack Kerouac was flabergasted by the poetic aspects of it. It gave new meaning and exploded boudaries for cinema. So to call this film dated, to me is like saying that Beethoven's fifth symphony isn't worth listening to because it's been made so long ago. Time doesn't have an effect on true works of art except to keep them alive and aging well, like a good bottle of wine.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There is no greatest movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Much of the dismissal of the quality of Citizen Kane comes about because of several factors:1) There is a disconnect between what critics expect of a movie and what general audiences expect of a movie. To say that CK is entertaining is simply an opinion - no more, no less. Our opinions on films can be researched and refined or raw and personal. To claim that one is better than the other is arrogance, but we do it because of some sort of instinctual belief that "everybody should think the way I do." This is not the case, however, and there is going to be backlash when Kane isn't the movie that people expect. It is not entertaining in the traditional sense. It's hard to get attached to the characters unless you really want to, and the story (the life of a media titan) isn't something that naturally appeals to everyone. It's a movie you have to work at liking.2) CK is astoundingly technically accomplished and years ahead of its time. When you compare it to the standard movies of the day, you can see how much film instinct Welles had and how revolutionary the film was. However, most people today don't have an expert grasp of the intricacies of making movies, and most don't care about things like lighting, blocking, and camera placement. Most people go for story and characters and see movies as passive entertainment. They don't want to focus on extraneous things like short/long shots. And they shouldn't be chided for wanting a movie to be simple to understand - most people watch movies as entertainment, not as a hobby, and breadth of film knowledge shouldn't be a requrement for doing so.3) CK is defended extraordinarily heavy by often-arrogant film-buffs who imply that the only people that should judge a movie's quality are the people that study the movies. This is a dangerous and stupid position. IMDB is set up so that EVERYONE gets an opportunity to share their opinions. I'm not a big fan of Godfather (boooring) but I understand that my opinion is only one of millions and therefore not all that important. Film geeks want their opinion to matter more, but the truth is that it really doesn't. This bothers them, because they've spent so much time loving movies only to watch their vote get cancelled out by a 12-year-old that rates the Princess Diaries as a 10. Guess what? That movie was made for 12-year-olds, and CK was made for people who like to watch movies that are mental exercises.4) The dangerous title of "Greatest Movie Ever Made." Movie-watching is too personal to ever apply that title to anything. Yes, we can all agree that certain movies are better than others, and the majority can be expected to make an opinion on how people in general view a certain movie. But to call a movie "The Greatest Movie Ever Made" is implying that everyone should feel that way. Everyone will not feel that way.So a good many people hate Citizen Kane. That's their right. Film-going shouldn't require an initiation and entrance exam. IMDb is the sum of popular opinions, and CK-lovers just aren't going to get everyone to love such an dense, complex film. Some people don't look for that in movies, and they are no more wrong than you are for wanting it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A really good movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Charles Foster Kane was a boy, his mother sent him away from his home in Colorado to live with a banker in New York. His mother was the owner of the Colorado gold mine and wanted her son to grow up somewhere nice. As a young man, Charles was kicked out of almost every prestigious college, including Harvard. When Charles turned twenty one, his mother had orders that he would take full ownership of his mother's fortune. When he got full ownership of his wealth, he bought the New York Inquirer newspaper. He turned it into the most unique paper of its time and he began taking over many other papers in other states until he had the most circulation.Many people think that this is the story of William Randolph Hurst who ran the New York journal at the same time when the movie was in production. There are many similarities between William Randolph Hurst and Charles Foster Kane, but the truth is this is a fictional story of a fictional character.This particular movie is the most intriguing film that I have seen. The script was written for radio broadcast and soon became a motion picture and some of the dialog stayed the same. The way that the film starts out is unique because the main character dies then summarizes his life. The main plot is to figure out what the meaning of Charles Foster Kane's last word `rosebud', meant. What was also intriguing was the lighting, in some scenes there would be very bright light, and other scenes so dark you could barely see the characters face. The acting was surprisingly good because all the co-stars had never acted before in their lives.The film was delightfully funny, sad, and dramatic. You could almost feel the characters emotions. Orson Welles was a genius when he put together this film that he stared in and also directed. It will probably be one of the greatest films that I will see in my life-time, and was one of the greatest films of its time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>`Citizen Kane' would be more widely loved, perhaps, if it did not begin with a lengthy newsreel account of Kane's life. (Actually, it begins with the death scene, and I know there are some who find THIS bizarre and off-putting. But I doubt that's what turns people off.) While this is the only part of the film that could be described as dull, I suspect that some viewers don't bother to watch any further, expecting more of the same dated vulgarity. But a newsreel is a newsreel. Everyone knew they were vulgar and intolerably pompous, even when they were being made - ESPECIALLY when they were being made - and it's just this vulgarity and pomposity that the rest of the film undermines, in the lively account that follows of what Kane's life was REALLY like. After the newsreel it's one great scene after another. `Citizen Kane' is anything but worthy stodge.But presenting us with the newsreel, mind you, was a good tactic. Forget the `Rosebud' thing. The real story is that of the reporter who researches above and beyond the call of duty, cross-examining witness after witness, in search of enough `human interest' detail to make more sense of Kane's life than the newsreel did - and he can never find quite enough. The amazing thing is that Welles plays perfectly fair. He hides from us the identity of `Rosebud', but nothing else; and in playing Kane he makes no effort to conceal what Kane is thinks or feels. Yet we share the reporter's perplexity at the end. Welles performed one of the world's great conjuring tricks when he told us every important detail EXCEPT the identity of `Rosebud', and then sprung that information on us, as well, to see if it made a difference. See for yourself if it does.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Citizen Kane is the perfect film. The story is so detailed, yet told magnificently in just two hours. The meaning of the word Rosebud is something that makes you think about your own life, and what the meaning of love means to you. Charles Foster Kane (Orson Welles) is a nasty, greedy old man who wants nothing in this world but to please himself. The fact that he can't love anyone is a wonderful touch to the already wonderfully filmed movie. I've seen this movie four times on video, and I'll see it again and again. ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>?And imho those years 1915-1955 were the most entertaining in movie history too. I've never called myself or written down that I'm a film "reviewer": unless you get paid for it by someone else and it's your job title the internet is generally the place to simply pass comments about this, that or the other. There's more than enough reviewers out there in the world anyway, and critics or snickerers too. I dislike passing bad comments on anything because 99% of the films ever made took some effort and brainwork even if I didn't personally approve of it. I could never "review" Kane, passing some paltry comments on such a monumental film is hard enough, but over the last 40 years I've now seen it so many times think it's high time I gave my opinion too.Disjointed story told by disparate people at different times of boy growing up to be ruthless newspaper magnate who is used to getting his own way with everything and everyone, and a newspaper reporter trying to find out what he meant by his dying word. So: It's relentlessly inventive and near perfect in every department, script, acting, production-direction, camera-work, sets, costumes etc, with the available technology they had at the time presenting a movie that still looks fresh as a daisy to someone who doesn't. A nitrate-gleaming black and white production, with no colour, cgi cartoonery, swearing, relevance to ordinary peoples' lives, sex or violence for enlightened modern audience tastes (but containing some analogue cartoonery for those who need the fix) ? it's the lack of these absolute essentials that most people today can't forgive in Kane. And the plot isn't incomprehensible and no one grunts through their parts like today. On the other side are people who think that after all the decades this has now been proved to be the unbeatable ultimate in cinematic art, and all other films are simply also-rans with Kane in its somewhat traditional role of being unassailable. Both sets are wrong of course - it's all personal taste and nothing lasts forever, even criticism isn't static. However, Kane is set in the amber of the Golden Age of the movies and is to me the best movie from that celebrated era. Indubitably. Again however, if I could only take one film with me to watch on a desert island this isn't it.Far from being mediocre the end ties everything up beautifully, and it helps make poignant sense of the previous two riveting hours. Unlike the vast majority of films, come good, bad or indifferent criticism it'll still be here after we're all gone so let's hear it for Good Old Citizen Kane!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>..in my book, and I have a big book of films. I first saw Kane in the mid 90's and had already acquired a distinct taste in films. The Cohen Brothers, Taratino, Lee, Lynch, these were my favorite directors in the early 90's, and WHAMMM, here comes Welles.This film gave me goosebumps within the first few minutes. The cinematography is by far some of the best I have ever seen, and the suspense leading up to one single word is amazing. The way the story is told is delightful, and Welles just steals the show. There are so many camera tricks in this film I had seen before though, and it was all in the films by the directors I have just mentioned. One of my favorite things Welles does with the film is how he took out floors to film different angles of himself to look powerful, while most other people in the film are shot from above to seem lower than him. I never realized the influence this film had on other filmmakers, and still see it today in several films.I can only imagine the excitement and buzz around it when it first came out. It was good for me going into the film knowing of the Hearst family and the true basis behind the films characters. Get this film, make some popcorn, and sit back and enjoy the amazing Citizen Kane... Rosebud.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An American Colossus and the People Around Him</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are now 810 comments on this, possibly the greatest of all American films (if not all films). This review is about an issue I always think about - how horrific was Kane to his country, his associates, and his intimates?Kane's personality is that of a man desperate to try to hold onto the affections of everyone who encounters him. He has had little real family life (as his mother - Agnes Moorehead - makes the blunder of taking him away from a somewhat drunken father - Harry Shannon - and giving his upbringing to a cold banker - George Coulouris). Kane understands what love is, but he has no way of concentrating his idea of it - he is uncertain if he is going to lose the affections of everyone.If he had been brought up properly he would have been able to do things more stably. Instead he keeps switching personality depending on whom he meets. He is the breezy young newspaper owner who is determined to shake up the fusty paper he bought (to the delight of Joseph Cotton and Everett Sloan, but to the dismay of old time editor Erskine Sanford). He is the crusading liberal in the face of banker Coulouris (as a way of evening scores, and of reminding the banker of how most of the public saw the rich in 1898). He is the young lover to his first wife (Ruth Warwick), but they grow apart. Frequently it is suggested that his first wife Emily was harmless. What is ignored is she's an anti-Semitic bigot about his close associate Bernstein (Sloan). Hardly a harmless type. She also is not very supportive about his political hopes.The most interesting problems about Kane's personal choices for popularity and love is the "Alexander" problems. He meets Susan (Dorothy Comingore) by sheer accident, and the simplest things breaks the ice between them. But Susan does not stop the affair, and it becomes the "Achilles' Heel" of Kane's run for Governor of New York. Boss Gettys reveals the relations of Kane and Susan, destroying the former's political career and his marriage. But nobody ever notes the following:1) Kane was committed to political reform - to end the power of a crooked Boss. Emily's selfishness or anger in not sticking to Charles helps this crook retain power. It's hardly edifying conduct. 2) The public willingly drops supporting Kane in the election - their amusement enhanced by the scandal. But they too are saying they support a crooked Boss and his system. 3) Getty does tell off Kane about his pig-handedness, but this does not explain away his own willingness to use partial extortion (he offered to sit on the story of the love affair if Kane "discovered" he was too sick to continue running for Governor - the election is only a few days off!). Actually, despite Ray Collins' splendid handling of the role, Gettys is not an admirable character.The scandal also affects Kane's friendship with Jed Leland (Cotton). Cotton has already been suspicious when the Enquirer hires away the staff of the Chronicle in 1897. Bernstein makes a cynical comment that these writers can change their opinions to match their new owner's. Leland is not sure (but they don't change Kane's political opinions). When Leland hears about Kane's affair, he becomes a drinker, and he insists on working in Chicago - away from Kane and New York City. Kane really wanted him to remain. Later, when Susan tries to be an opera singer Leland begins a negative review (that Kane finishes). Kane does fire Leland, but tries to give him a large severance check (which Leland rips up). Susan is a small harpy screaming about Leland's review, and refusing to consider Leland a friend of Kane's ("Friends don't do that!!", she screams). Kane was ripped apart by these two. Keep in mind, he did not have to marry Susan after the scandal broke - but he did make her his wife. It does not satisfy her. As for Leland, his father died a bankrupt suicide when Kane helped him out. He is certainly an ingrate.Susan is always denying that she wanted to be an opera singer. Certainly she lacks the voice or talent. But that does not prevent her from continuing a singing career once she divorces Kane. Who's actually lying here?Gradually the attempts to be all things to all people to keep their love just fails. Kane (at the start) is labeled a Communist by Thatcher at a Congressional hearing, and some spokesman at Union Square (addressing a labor rally) calls him - after a moment of spaced, uncertain waiting, a "Fascist". Everyone calls him or looks at him as what they want to look at him as. What did he do wrong? He revolutionized newspapers. He helped promote the Spanish American War, and the Panama Canal. He helped elect Teddy Roosevelt in 1904. He stood for reform of political government in New York State in 1916. He also stood against the entry into World War I (a point many people to this day feel we should have avoided). He built an opera house in Chicago. His empire shrunk a bit in the Depression, but most remained in tact. His art collecting was outlandish, but it saved many precious items from destruction in World War II. And while he did AT FIRST support the fascist and Nazi leadership (as many prominent leaders and social figures did through 1936 or so), he later denounced them. Actually, Kane turns out to be a pretty useful citizen of the U.S. for his times, not such an ogre.Can a case be made that this flawed man deserved to be respected? Yes. Bernstein was right - and remains the only friend of his who was faithful to the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Does it deserve to be acknowledged? Yes. Best Film ever Made? No.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm gonna be brutally honest here. I didn't exactly like this film. After years of hearing how it was by far "the greatest film ever made" perhaps it's expectations were too high. How can any film possibly meet expectations when expectations are nothing lower than perfection? With the knowledge that this film is universally considered the best ever made, there is no way it could possibly meet that bar especially for someone who rarely agrees with such massive popular agreement. Many scenes were enjoyable, and many were boring, but maybe I didn't "get it" or maybe I didn't want to.A large problem with this film has nothing to do with the media but the people who love it. Professors who adore it, critics who dissect and people who say they love it to sound smart and artistic. No film can possibly survive after 60 years in those conditions.You can shoot me for saying this, but the acting was overdone, and the film was very dark physically. Normally I don't mind that but in some scenes I wasn't able to make out the emotions and faces of the characters. I understand that this film was a massive undertaking as far as films that do creative things such as camera angles, mixed up narratives and things of that nature, but that does not mean its the best one out there. It served as a good first stepping stone but talented film makers have gone a long way since then.People seem so eager to praise it they forget that there are also many problems with it and that in some instances, it's greatest assets are it's greatest liabilities. While it had character development I was hoping for more, although I enjoyed the fact that the audience would have to insert their own opinions about Mr. Kane in attempt to understand him. Despite this, I wasn't that interested in this man's life or the people surrounding him, and in such a character driven film, concentrated around one man, that is a very large problem.Maybe I'm too saturated in the sugar-coated world of Hollywood but I was expecting more from this film. Many scenes were boring, and a movie can be the best ever made, but if half of its boring, whats the point? Maybe upon a second viewing I will appreciate it more. Does it deserve to be acknowledged for technical and narrative innovations? Yes. Best film ever made? No.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"a total bore" as Ingmar Bergman once said</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Citizen Kane' is the story of a fictional character named Charles Foster Kane and how was his life and career. He was loved and hated, and did many things while he was alive. Charles is a millionaire newspaper tycoon, and while at first his dreams were noble,in the end, the only thing that matters to him is to be more and more powerful. The story is shown through flashbacks, and most of the story goes around a newspaper reporter seeking to solve the mystery of the newspaper magnate's dying word: "Rosebud."I know that I am going to be hated and bashed to say my real opinion, but I cannot lie: I expected this movie to be so much better then it actually is! I was bored for the first 30 minutes and I think that if my boyfriend didn't want to watch this movie, I probably wouldn't have finished it. The excitement of it comes from the reporter seeking to solve the mystery of Kane's last word "Rosebud" and that's it!I like classic films and I enjoy a lot to watch biographies, and if Charles Foster Kane were a real person, I would be much more interested to know about his life.A pro about this film, is the fact that is considered one of the most innovative works in the history of movies, and I can understand why: It really makes you feel like Foster Kane existed for real.In general, I just find this movie overrated, but hey, you know what? Maybe it works for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You need to take a film class in order to understand it's greatness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I rented and watched Citizen Cain, I actually fell asleep. This was shortly after AFI listed it as the #1 movie of all time a few years ago. I didn't understand the movie at all and I certainly didn't understand why it was #1.Now I realize how ignorant I was.Last year, I took a course in college on Film (I'm working on being a film director myself). Citizen Cain was a topic that the professor brought to us early in the semester. This would be my second time viewing the movie. But by this time, I had a basic understanding of film history, shots, camera angles, script writing, etc.You see, you have to understand what movies were like before Citizen Cain, and after. Citizen Cain was a revolutionary movie in terms of edition, camera angles, and story. It was also ahead of its time.Let's start with story. The movie starts with his death. The entire story is told through interviews and flashbacks by everyone who was involved with Cain. Unlike other movies with a linear narrative, this movie required you to think and put all the pieces together.Another big thing was the way light and dark was used. High and low camera angles were used to the extreme. I can't point out every single one but you could ask a film expert point them out.Another big thing was that the movie was pretty much a satire of William Randolph Hearst, the newspaper mogul. I recommend watching the movie "RKO 281" with Liev Schreiber and James Cromwell so you'll know what I'm talking about.Sadly, the movie failed at the box office. It wasn't until years later when critics saw the movie and realized how great it was.So if you saw Citizen Cain and didn't get it, I don't blame you. I didn't get it the first time either. It's largely due to the fact that the movie is so old, so there's a large generation gap. Also, you need to know a bit of film history, what happened during the making of this film, and how this film influenced virtually every film make after.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Citizen Kane...the genius of all movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It starts at the ending and then makes its way from the beginning to the end through multiple viewpoints. Not a very odd concept in 2003, but in 1941, when `Citizen Kane' was made, this was a very rare and not well thought of way to make a movie.`Citizen Kane' appeared to be very ahead of its time with the structure of the story to the lighting effects/shadowing used throughout it.`Citizen Kane' is the story of a small boy that is taken away from his parents (with the permission of his mother) by a businessman and the story of his life after that.Growing up with his birth parents, he didn't really have a lot going for him except the love of his parents. Yet, when he grew up with his new `family' he had the chance to inherit many different things, yet he chose a small newspaper, called the Inquirer.Among the millions of dollars he was already worth, his newspaper started to become big and the movie portrays his adventures in relationships with him and with others throughout his life.When the director (Orson Wells.also the man character of the movie) and creators of `Citizen Kane' were making the film, they almost wanted to give up because they though no one would want to watch the movie, nor would they like it. Yet, in reality, `Citizen Kane' became known as the best movie in history and the influence of every movie today.The movie is very unique in many ways and it's uniqueness pays off in the end.You may be skeptical of the power and influence of this movie during the first half, but as long as you pay attention and put thought into the movie, it comes out as one of the best movies you've ever seen.Once you've watched this movie, you'll have an entirely different perspective on movies and when you get out of them in general.`Citizen Kane' is a bizarre, though provoking movie that some may not like, but as long as you're someone with the ability to think for yourself, you should thoroughly enjoy this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mind-boggling cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As one of film's great masterpieces, Citizen Kane re-tells the life of Charles Foster Kane (Orson Welles) as journalists try to uncover the meaning of his final remark. During the Hollywood contract era, Orson Welles decided to assemble his own cast and produced, directed, co-wrote and starred in Citizen Kane. It is perhaps the fullest singular effort ever made by a filmmaker. Orson Welles is so revered for his directing genius that many seem to forget his raw acting ability. Sure, Orson Welles is a name most movie-lovers know as a director, but it is mind-boggling to see him act because it is shocking, and downright frightening, to think that one man could direct and act so well at the same time. If "Casablanca" is the definitive example of the best of Hollywood, Citizen Kane is the definition of the best of DIY independent film. The life of Charles Kane is loosely based off of the life of newspaper tycoon William Randolph Hearst. The story is told with an ulterior feeling of utter madness, which seems contradictory to the colossal levels of success of Kane's enterprises and the beauty of his wife. On the surface, Kane has all a man could ever strive for. But Kane's true emotional reality is subtly written on his face throughout the film. It doesn't make sense until the very end. It is the fact that nothing adds up for most of the movie that gives Citizen Kane it's radiance and allure. Beneath all of the success, there is something deeply wrong with Kane. Welles gives hints in flashbacks to his past. Kane's parents sold him to a boarding school as a child. His only human connection, the last salvage of his soul, was his last happy memory as a child with Rosebud, his sled, on the day he was sold. "Rosebud" is the last thing he says before he dies. No one knows what it could mean, and reporters try to figure it out only to come to the conclusion that it would be insignificant anyway, which is actually true. It is amazing how unimportant the meaning of Rosebud is to the plot, and how important it is to his being. This juxtaposition, which is not revealed until the very end, completes the personal investment in the film because in the end everyone's own personal sentiments that they hold on to really only matter to them. Rosebud is so meaningless, yet so meaningful. The events leading to the shell of a man that appears throughout most of the movie are not shown by Welles. He lets the mind travel on Kane's dehumanization, which creates a more personal connection towards the film. Almost everyone has had to experience major personal vampires that work to drain their life's vitality, and Kane's controlled him and haunted him everywhere he went. All he really wanted was to feel human again, and no cavalcade of wealth or grudge against the world could save him.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So Citizen kane is regarded as one of the best films of all time. Whilst it is good, it is certainly not worthy of this title. Everything that made it so special, I've already seen in countless films. Of course it is terribly unfair to compare Citizen Kane in this fashion, but considering its influence over modern cinema, it is difficult not to do this. But this isn't just restricted to modern-day films. Citizen Kane's narrative structure is repeated just three years later in Double Indemnity. Furthermore, Kane is a very unlikeable character. I wasn't interested in his character arc or journey. Read my full review here: http://goo.gl/Bp2KmM</fullReview>

He refused to be bullied into printing what others wanted him to print. money didn't matter as long the right thing was talked about and there is just something noble bout that part. it shows a man willing to stand up for what he believes in.

		<fullReview>I came across this old film in the bargain bin at my local pound store and couldn't believe I hadn't heard of it before?OK, only kidding. Let's face it: you'd have had to have spent your entire life living in a hermetically sealed bubble to not know about Orson Welles' debut film, which is almost universally hailed as the greatest movie of all time. It's an interesting ? and divisive ? title for any film to be saddled with, that World's Greatest Movie tag. Imagine being branded something as modest as the world's greatest commis chef, or world's greatest dishwasher, and see how quickly people would start trying to bring you down from your lofty perch. There seems to be a lot of people wanting to know what's so great about Kane, mostly because every groundbreaking film-making technique generally ? and to a degree, mistakenly ? attributed to Kane, now forms the core of every film school's Big Book of Movie-Making, thereby blunting Kane's once industry-changing impact. The film deserves recognition because of its place in history, no doubt about it. But is it any good? Well, yes, actually. Citizen Kane provides the audience with an intelligent, insightful and sophisticated character study of an egotistical megalomaniac and delivers, in almost every shot, something meaningful that contributes to our understanding of Kane. A rich vein of irony runs through the film. For example, the photograph in the opening newsreel of Kane with his son and smiling wife below the newspaper headline announcing his nomination for Senator is taken the moment before his wife reveals to him she knows about his mistress. Kane's political aspirations die within an hour of that jubilant photograph being taken. Welles doesn't bother to point that out, crediting the audience with enough intelligence to not require a guiding hand.I doubt whether any Hollywood film prior to this one had penetrated so deep or so vividly beneath the surface of its character. As the film progresses, Kane's material wealth grows in direct correlation to the loss of his personal relationships, until he is alone in a vast, monolithic castle on a hill. In the first half of the picture the character of Kane is permanently surrounded by others, but as his political aspirations fade and his personal shortcomings come to the fore, his figure either becomes smaller or he occupies the screen alone.Perhaps Welles the actor is one of the film's biggest liabilities: his acting is unconvincing at times. Welles himself felt he tended to over-intellectualise when he acted, and I think he was right. Whatever the reason, he doesn't always inhabit the character the way he should to be totally convincing. Joseph Cotten, one of Welles' Mercury Theatre players also making his debut, gives probably one of the most convincing performances, while Dorothy Comingore as the hapless songbird who becomes Welles' second wife, becomes so shrill towards the end that you begin to wonder why he would want to keep her around.Is it the greatest film ever made? I don't know. A lot of people ridicule the idea, but many of them are of a younger generation, and fail to come up with a realistic alternative. It's pretty good though, I know that, and is easily superior to anything else Hollywood was putting out back then. It makes you wonder how much more Welles might have achieved if Hollywood hadn't been so intimidated by his precocious exuberance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On the DVD cover it writes that the classical story of power and the press. I don't agree with this since the later part of the movie focused too much on the love development between Kane and the singer. It may be right to say that Mr. Kane was so concerned about power and control that he also wanted to prove something in her distorted love with the singer. Love was not about the feeling between man and woman, but a kind of tool and platform to demonstrate something and manipulate the social relations. Mr. Kane's failure was not because of loss of power but due of reasoning. Further again, the role of press was not clearly developed, and I would rather classify this movie into a love story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Proof of Welles' Genius</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a great deal of talk of Citizen Kane's technical achievement, and so there should be. In 1941, this film broke ground that still marvels today, and arguably is the earliest (famous) example of non-linear story telling. The cinematography is absolutely perfect and the near endless list of famous shots (my favourite being the infinite images in the hall of mirrors) make this movie watchable without even trying to understand it.But above all, Citizen Kane is a wonderful story - a great tale of a man with everything who really has nothing. This movie is perfect story-telling and a great American tragedy.Kane needs to be seen over and over again. I defy anyone to watch it and accurately predict what scene comes next. But still, it flows well and never comes across as disjointed. I have seen itabout 9 times now - each time I pick up more and enjoy the film more. Orson Welles was an absolute genius and Citizen Kane is proof enough. **** out of ****.</fullReview>

Orson Wells packs each scene with visual and sound effects, which grab the viewer and stimulate the imagination.This is a character study meant to stimulate the intellect, not the emotions.This is a great movie and certainly was one of the most daring movies ever made in its time.As an aside: I saw this in film studies 18 years ago (egads, am I getting old!) and it's stunning on the big screen.</fullReview>

I have to admit that when I first saw the movie I was a little disappointed because I had just watched AFI's top 100 and when they voted it to be the number one American movie of all times I was expecting a little more. After I watched it again a couple of months later I starting realizing the true beauty of this film. What amazes me about Citizen Kane and other "old" movies is how they got their points across without using any profanity. The scene that sticks out to me is the one at the breakfast table showing how the marriage between Kane and his first wife started out fine but the relationship got worse and worse as time moved on. Citizen Kane does not top my list as the best movie of all times but it is in my top ten. I am 23, and many people my age don't like to watch "old" movies but this is a movie that I would recommend to anyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still Great After 75 Years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like most anyone who has watched this movie over the last fifty years or so, I was introduced to it by a great number of people proclaiming it to be the greatest movie of all time. So at the age of fourteen, I got it from the library, popped it in, and had my understanding of film changed forever.I do not consider this the greatest movie of all time. But it is the most important movie of all time. It is arguable that film should be divided into two eras: the pre-Citizen Kane era and the post-Citizen Kane era. There are enough revolutionary techniques and ideas to make a film lover's head spin. But one thing a lot of people overlook is just how good this movie is on its own right.The best way I can describe it is a film version of an acclaimed twenty-century novel. There is sharp symbolism, highly developed characters, a somber mood, and nuanced discussions about broken dreams and the human condition.If you're a fan of those types of stories, you will enjoy Citizen Kane. If you're not, you may not, but do yourself a favor and watch it anyway. Just like every literate adult should have already read The Great Gatsby and Of Mice and Men, every filmwatching should have already seen this movie. If you have not, I suggest you take care of that.Me? I adore The Great Gatsby, like Of Mice and Men, and will watch this film over and over again. It concerns a reporter trying to track down the meaning of the last word of the famous media Tycoon Charles Foster Kane. Along the way, he talks to various people who knew Kane and gets many different sides of the story. He ends up not finding out the meaning of that last word, but we, the viewers, do.Now, I'm not gonna spoil what Rosebud is- this despite the fact that it has basically become shorthand for 'spoiled twist'- but I will say that it fits with the themes of the movie quite nicely. This is the right way to do a twist. One thing many directors and screenwriters forget is that twists are not merely supposed to be shocking; they are supposed to add to the story in a fundamental way. Most good stories I've seen get this. All bad stories I've heard do not. It is a fundamental and simple concept, so I have to wonder how so many directors and screenwriters miss it.Speaking of directors and screenwriters, for this film, they are one in the same. Mr. Orson Welles fills both roles and acts in the titular role, pulling off the most astounding triple play in movie history. Any triple play is incredible in this industry, but doing it in one of the greatest films of all time: that's impressive.There is a scene midway through the film where Kane walks through a hall of mirrors. It stuck in my mind, and it sticks in the minds of almost everyone who watches this movie. I cannot think of a better example of the power of visual storytelling. An amateur filmmaker would have just had Kane ramble off his emotions. But Welles, taking advantage of his medium, crafted one of the most haunting and memorable scenes in cinematic history. If you have a friend who won't shut up about how books are better than movies, show them this film and point out this scene.One thing that surprises many inexperienced filmwatchers is how this film only won one Oscar. Yes, a film said by many to be the greatest of all time only received the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay. Best Director? How Green Was My Valley. Best Cinematography? How Green Was My Valley. Best Art Direction? How Green Was My Valley. Best Picture? How Green Was My Valley.Now, How Green Was My Valley is not a bad film. I suggest you watch it if you have nothing better to do. But it's no Citizen Kane. I doubt many of you have heard of it.Oddly enough, this was not simply a case of poor decision making, though you could find much of that if you look in the annals of past Oscars. Media mogul William Randolph Hearst believed this film to be about him in all but name (very arguable) and said it was a negative portrayal (eh) that misrepresented him (definitely not). He could not get all copies of the movie destroyed or anything like that, but he did fight it at every turn, and he is likely the main reason why the film did not get more Oscars.Ironically enough, William Randolph Hearst's name is one that has somewhat been eroded by the passage of time. The only thing many people in my generation know about him is that he likely inspired this movie. So it turns out that the film he fought against ended up giving him a form of immortality.Kane is one of the most complicated characters in all of film, and more importantly, all his complexities mean something. Nothing feels like it's there just to make the character more complex. The result is a brilliantly textured story, one that can be loved even by people who aren't typically into this type of arc.This film does not only feel revolutionary, it feels alive. In fact, I'd go so far as to say it is the first film to feel truly, cinematically alive. There were great films made before it; among them are Gone With the Wind and The Wizard of Oz and King Kong. But those films were merely sweeping, brilliant stories put on film. This is a unique, cinematic experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Orson Wells has done it again and pulled off a magnificent film Citzen Kane! This film is full of great thrill and suspense. Filled with great energy, Citizen Kane is simply well written and everyone who worked on the making of this film deserves applause. This Lighting and Cinematography is what i liked the most. The flash backs of Kane's life is great also. Understanding the Dieing words "Rosebud" is the mystery of the film and it builds great mystery. I liked how Orson Wells played Mr. Kane in the film and also directed the film. To anyone who enjoys a great classic i would definitely recommend this film to all. I would also recommend buying this film.Bravo!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was absolutely incredible every time I watch a movie that is this old I am shocked to find how ahead of its time it really was. Orson Welles in this film was incredible his presence always looms throughout the whole film even though he is dead. I love how a lot of the movie involves flashbacks of Charles Foster Kane's life. The constant unknowing of his final words tends to drive you crazy throughout the whole film. And at the end when you find out what "rosebud" means your happily contempt with what it means. The visuals in this movie are great its very transcendent of the atmosphere. But my question is how did they hear Kane say "rosebud" when there was no one in the room with him?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Orson Welles' great movie (justifiably called a masterpiece) is loaded with so many complex details that it is hard to sort them all out and make any one main point about it. But I think if we talk about the subject matter, or one of the most obvious sources of inspiration behind it, we can be a bit clearer and more direct.Mostly, I feel the film itself talks around who Hearst really was. When I was in film school, a professor expounded upon the gimmick of Rosebud, as the hook that keeps the viewer going till the end of the story. But I think the real-life William Randolph Hearst, then still alive and known to all in the western hemisphere, was the true gimmick. Welles picked someone more well known than God to parody, knowing this thinly veiled spoof would at least appeal to the news tycoon's detractors, as well as those fascinated by his extravagant lifestyle. Not to mention his sordid relationship with his mistress.It would be the same today if Oliver Stone made a film about Rupert Murdoch. We wouldn't expect it to be a documentary necessarily. But we would expect it to be about power and control over the media. And about a flawed human being.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very solid movie with some mystery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings from Lithuania."Citizen Kane" (1941) isn't the best or most important movie ever made in my opinion. As there one word cannot explain man's life, one movie can not influence flow of cinema itself. That said "Citizen Kane" is a very good picture, while it's opening ~17 min are nothing short of brilliant and next 40 min are superb, the movie felt short a bit during the end, with to much being focused on "the singer" rather on Kane's life itself. There are some truly brilliant camera shoots in this movie, which i suppose was one of the first camera tricks at the time. Acting is very good, especially by Orson Welles - he should have won Oscar for Best Actor in a Leading Role. Script is great and directing is also a tip notch, that is why this movie barely drags.Overall, "Citizen Kane" is a very good movie about with some mystery. I kinda guest the meaning of this word during the end, and last scenes confirmed my guess - it is a good mystery but maybe a bit over-hyped (no spoilers). This movie definitely worth seeing once (even as i'm watching for the first time just now in 2015).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Without subtitles I thought that Charles Foster Kane had said "frostbite". In the opening minute I almost thought I was watching a horror movie, the way the cinematographer went from one scene to another, aided by the fact that Xanadu looked haunted.The trivia for "Citizen Kane" was some of the most interesting trivia I've ever read. Orson Welles wrote and acted the character of Charles Foster Kane superbly well, and I suppose also did well directing himself. If this movie does anything, it is displaying yellow journalism and corrupted almost-politicians. Only Charles Foster Kane would think it "fun" to run a newspaper. At times Kane appears to be the man he wants people to think he is: a loving, kind, honest man, who would fit better than any other eligible man as the governor. Thanks to his friends, we brutally discover the true man underneath the layer of fake skin: a selfish, heartless man who only has one true goal in life: success, which he believes will also bring him happiness. But success cannot buy happiness, which he seemingly doesn't find out until his final dying moments.This movie was definitely not one of my "Great Movies", as it was Ebert's. As interesting as this movie was, the thing that nagged at my mind the most was the fact that, if he died when he was alone, how does anyone know what his final words were? Somehow, amazingly, this thought apparently never did occur to Welles or any of the other cast, crew, or producers until after it was released, whereas it occurred to me within ten minutes, as I'm sure it did to many other viewers. Did Ebert himself miss this fact, even after hundreds of viewings, or somehow shrug it off, even after doing an audio commentary on it? Perhaps I can see how he shrugged it off, considering I have done the same on other movies I've enjoyed, though the problems were less obvious and less important to the plot.This movie seems almost documentary-style, first giving us a summary of his life, then going back and addressing each plot point in more detail. The movie's strong points were the directing, characterization, and cinematography, and Welles' acting, although the other actors were quite disappointing. The movie was interesting and fun to watch, and the mystery kept us intrigued, although it was not quite what I was expecting. Charles Foster Kane was a very entertainingly arrogant character, and quite an incredible debut for Orson Welles. The end reveal is fascinating and meaningful in itself.My Official Score: 89.5/100</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After "Back to the Future" and "To Kill a Mockingbird", this is my third favourite film of all time. Only 25 years old at the time that it was made, Orson Welles made one of the greatest films of all time. There are not many actors or directors whom I would describe as artists but, in my view, Welles was one of his generation's two greatest artists in the filmmaking sphere, the other being Laurence Olivier. His skills as a director have been much praised over the course of the last 74 years but I want to focus on his skills as an actor first of all. As Charles Foster Kane, Welles is simply magnificent. Through the various flashbacks, we learn about the different sides of the man's character and he excels at playing all of them. Welles plays Kane over a period of more than 50 years and does so with a great deal more passion and gravitas than many actors of comparable age are capable of.The newsreel footage in the first ten minutes is crucial to our understanding of Kane as it not only places his life in chronological order but it gives us insight into the manner in which he is viewed by the public. The former is significant given the film's format of flashbacks while the latter allows us to contrast the public man with the private man. As shown by his genuinely and deeply meant Declaration of Principles and his confrontation with Thatcher, Kane's motives are pure at the beginning of his journalistic career but he becomes more and more ruthless in his pursuit of power as the years and decades pass by. This is best seen in the recollections of Jed Leland, the closest thing that he had a friend. Leland tells the intrepid journalist Jerry Thompson that he did not think that Kane loved anyone except for himself and his mother. The obvious implication from that statement is that Kane married his first wife Emily Norton as she is the niece of the US President. He comes to neglect her but this pales in comparison to the emotional abuse which he inflicts on his second wife Susan Alexander, which eventually leads her to attempt suicide. In spite of Kane's myriad flaws, I felt pity for him as his actions meant that he was left with no one to care about him. He made a fortune but money cannot buy happiness, as is portrayed in the film in an almost Dickensian way. This is best illustrated by the fact that his dying thoughts are of his boyhood sleigh Rosebud. On his deathbed, he recalls the last time in his life that he was truly happy, playing in the snow outside his mother's boarding house. For Kane, the sleigh represents perfect happiness and his own conception of Elysium. Its simplicity serves as a wonderful contrast to the cold opulence of the 49,000 acre estate of Xanadu, which becomes something of a prison to him in his last years. The sleigh's destruction in the film's final scene represents the death of Kane's dream of achieving happiness.Welles and his co-writer Herman J. Mankiewicz gave all of the best bits to the actor-director himself but our understanding of Kane would be nothing without the supporting characters. The most important of these is perhaps Jed Leland, played very well by Welles' close friend Joseph Cotten. He is most effective as the elderly Leland in the flashback scenes and the scene in which Leland, while very drunk, tells Kane exactly what he thinks of him after he loses the gubernatorial election. Leland remains constant throughout the film and this provides another fantastic contrast, this time to Kane himself. If you look carefully, you can also spot Cotten as one of the journalists shrouded in darkness after the newsreel has been played. Dorothy Comingore is excellent as Susan Alexander, a well meaning but not terribly bright or talented young woman whose life is gradually destroyed by Kane. He had something to prove in building the opera house for her and does not allow her to stop singing because he would be too embarrassing for him, not caring at all about the affect that the humiliation is having on her. The rest of the cast is very strong as well, particularly Everett Sloane as the ever loyal Mr Bernstein, George Coulouris as Walter Parks Thatcher, Ruth Warrick as Emily Norton Kane, Ray Collins as Jim Gettys, William Alland as Jerry Thompson and Paul Stewart as Kane's callous butler Raymond. The most interesting of the minor characters is Kane's mother Mary, played wonderfully by Agnes Moorehead.The manner in which the film was shot was absolutely innovative in its time and it still looks beautiful. Welles and the cinematographer Gregg Toland pioneered the technique of deep focus for the silver screen in which every part of the frame is in focus simultaneously. This is perhaps best illustrated by the scene in which Mary Kane makes Thatcher her son's legal guardian while the young Kane can be seen playing in the background. What makes it even more impressive is that most of this scene is shot in a single take, as are numerous other scenes in the film. Another very impressively shot scene is the party scene in which Kane celebrates coaxing the Daily Chronicle's best journalists to defect to the Inquirer after six years of trying. this scene involves Kane and numerous chorus girls singing and dancing in the background while Leland and Bernstein have a private conversation in the foreground. At several points, we see Kane reflected in the window on the other side of them. This must have been a logistical nightmare for Welles to shoot but he did it brilliantly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really love a good film with a nice set of flashback story telling, and this one is it! Straight from the beginning we are thrown into a deep story about a group of people trying to get to the bottom of a rich mans last utterance, and the director takes the viewer through a flashback joy ride. This film incorporated great camera angles of the ceiling , lighting techniques and quick jump shots, which is largely part of the reason why this film was so groundbreaking: in that all of the elements of editing and cinematography that are seen in Citizen Kane had never really been put together in the same film before. Another thing that i truly enjoyed with this film was that the flashback story telling came from multiple narrators and not just a single one, which again was something that had never really been done prior to this film.</fullReview>

It's amazingly put together, it has a great story, it's got great acting, great directing, and it's all around perfect. No wonder this is often listed as the best film ever made. Charles Foster Kane (Orson Wells) is a publishing tycoon who dies and his last words are Rosebud. A group of reporters try to find out what he meant by this. Most of the movie is told in flashback form when the reporters interview people. It follows Kane's life as a child to when his second wife left him when he was an old man. The film follows his life beautifully and although I'm not being new or original everyone should see this movie. It is just incredible.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A masterpiece about a man who is obsessed with himself and his earnings and his pride.It's about a man and his Rosebud, and the rosebud symbolises so much than we can even understand.Citizen Kane is a fictional character mind you, yet is done so realistically by Orson Welles.This was the greatest off beat film in 1941 coz when more films were on war related issues or thrillers this was on a person a megalomaniacal self obsessed and an eccentric character. This was a film made by a man who for the first ever in the Hollywood history was given complete control by studios and asked to make any film he wanted. Orson Welles made this film, a masterpiece. Orson is extremely passionate and has a great visual there are no close ups or no heavy background score yet there is an inherent tension created just with lighting and the expression.Wow, a man who is so near yet so far far far away. It symbolises a lot in this film. Charles Foster Kane walks in his final stages and what has he got is nothing. Just before this shot, he holds a piece and says "Rosebud" which were his last dying words. The film begins with people trying to know, media trying to know what is Rosebud, the last dying words of Charles Foster Kane.It means so much, it means blossom, it means innocence, it means serenity and all is lost. At the end when Leland says "All he wanted out of life was love". And Charles after being whatever he was, has lost it. Its subtly symbolic, technically by far the greatest and characteristically, enigmatic and unforgettable. You just can't have so many good things in one from a first time director, but Orson, the guy made an unmistakable masterpiece that has stood the test of time and even 70 years, it's Blu Ray seems great and the sales speak for themselves what a film this is. A 5/5 for one of my favorite films and intact I have seen it so many times and yet I keep learning so much. This reminds me of one thing "Character, Character, Character. The characteristics of characters drive the emotion of the cinema, great characters make great cinema".I still can't get enough of this film. Will revisit this film time and again for sure.Two things, that were technically far more superior than most movies in 1940's was lighting and sound. Cinematography is something where so much can be learnt from this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Even After Seventy Years, Welles' Debut Film is Still a Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What else can be said about CITIZEN KANE that hasn't been already said? Some viewers describe it as the greatest movie of all time; others consider it rubbish. Produced by the wunderkind of the classical Hollywood era, the film incorporates most of the Mercury Theater cast who had spent most of their time working with Welles in New York.Thematically speaking, it is an incredibly daring film for its time, in that it attacked precisely those forces of capitalism that drove the Hollywood studios. Like Charles Foster Kane (Orson Welles), the studios enjoyed a monopoly over the production and distribution of their products; and could distribute whatever forms of propaganda they wished. If we accept that CITIZEN KANE is in part based on the life of William Randolph Hearst, then the link between Hollywood and the newspapers becomes more pronounced, as Susan Alexander Kane (Dorothy Comingore), the would-be opera star who fails on her debut, is a fictional representation of Hearst's belle Marion Davies, who had an equally distinguished Hollywood career.Welles' satire of the shallowness of capitalism is chiefly communicated through the interaction between Kane and his closest associate Jedediah Leland (Joseph Cotten), who works closely with Kane on improving the circulation of the "New York Inquirer," but soon realizes how Kane's judgment changes almost daily. The list of "principles" that Kane sets forth, when taking over the newspaper, become lost as the tycoon becomes more and more obsessive in his desire for power. In an important sequence, Kane opens an envelope sent by Leland, and finds the principles crumpled up inside, together with a torn check. Money, it seems, cannot buy everything.What sets CITIZEN KANE apart from other movies is the complexity of its visual score. Gregg Toland's deep-focus photography is just magical, especially in the scenes taking place at Xanadu (Kane's residence), where the sheer size and scope of the property has been emphasized. There are some memorable shots - notably the image of Kane as reflected in a hall of mirrors, suggesting that nothing exists beneath the surface. Welles and Toland also achieve some memorable sequences shot from the floor upwards looking at the characters - a strategy that not only emphasizes their sheer size (and domination of the frame), but reinforces the film's major theme of the desire for power. Such shots are contrasted with the shots at the end, where the camera tracks backwards, focusing on Kane's possessions which become smaller and smaller and more and more insignificant as the shot continues. The film subsequently cuts to a shot of Xanadu with flames coming out of the chimney, emphasizing the total destruction of Kane's world.The experience of watching CITIZEN KANE demands our attention; every sequence, it seems, is carefully structured, with a precise concern for lighting and scenic design. The cast are just brilliant; every actor, it seems, has been ideally cast for their roles. This is the kind of film that can be watched again and again; on each viewing, it seems, something new can be discovered.</fullReview>

The technicalities do support it's status as one of the greats, pioneering those never before seen shots or sequences like the first and last shots, the use of peculiar angles of the cameras, decent effort at age make up, and the use of non linear back and forth story flow styling. But I do agree with those voices that say that the story is entire empty, it does not offer you anything. For me, it's better even the one in The Wolf of Wall Street of even The Great Gatsby, for extreme comparisons. I now have a suspicion that this movie's story is the one to blame as a subliminal campaign that downgrade the moral of the American people due to focusing on the notion that it's okay to get divorced twice as long as you're rich or the sort.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is a prime example of the difference between film critics and film watchers. Whilst there is no doubt that the script, acting, cinematography, direction etc are first rate, it's actually rather boring. It's worth watching once, to see what all the hype is about, but it just doesn't have that entertainment value. I'm probably alone in this view, but if it came out now it'd most likely bomb at the cinema because it's just not watchable enough, particularly for today's audiences who only really want to see modern stars they know or special effects and loud explosions ! Maybe my rating of 3 is a bit harsh, but I'm a great lover of 30s and 40s films, and if you hold this up against, say, The Adventures of Robin Hood, Gone with the Wind, or Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, it just doesn't have that X factor. I'd be the first to admit it's a landmark film, but too many critics still hold a candle up to this film as the ultimate movie experience, but I'm sorry... it's not !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Newspaper tycoon Charles Foster Kane (Orson Welles) is dead in his palatial estate. His last word is "Rosebud" and reporters investigate what could it possibly mean to spice up his obituary newsreel. First they contact a drunken Susan Alexander Kane (Dorothy Comingore) who was Kane's dance hall girl second wife. There is Walter Parks Thatcher recollection of Kane's childhood and beyond as he first became his guardian and then became his biggest target. Jedediah Leland (Joseph Cotten) was his partner in the newspaper business. Emily Monroe Norton Kane (Ruth Warrick) is his first wife who died in a car crash with their son.This is a technically superior movie. The scale is grand in its ambition. It's a character loosely based on newspaper mogul William Randolph Hearst. Almost all of the movie is one flashback after another which does take away some of the immediacy from the movie. It also clouds the character in second hand recollections. Despite that and the movie starts with a highlight reel of his life, the story remains fascinating.</fullReview>

The same can be said for only a small handful of special movies, but Citizen Kane is definitely on the list. In the first twenty minutes we see a documentary presented on the life of Charles Foster Kane, and when the documentary has finished we pan over to a dark room full of reporters. There is smoke in the air highlighted by small square windows, and the actors are silhouetted as they pass by creating an almost star burst like effect. Kane's control over these small details is what keeps the film interesting and the viewer interested in watching what visual nuances will be captured next.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A cold and lonely lovely work of art?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is easy to see why some people wonder how Citizen Kane appears first or at least in the top five on all-time great movie lists. It lacks so many things that we like about movies. It has very little action and there are few if any characters that are likable or for whom we feel anything. There is nobody we worry about or cheer for. The storyline is also minimal and the final revelation prosaic rather than genuinely meaningful. The word "Rosebud" was a McGuffin and just a rather contrived excuse for doing a fragmented biographical piece on a newspaper tycoon. The film has been lauded for its cinematography, innovative direction, stylization and perhaps its soundtrack both in terms of music and sound effects. However, for many it becomes a case of the director packing too many tricks into a film rather than using them only when they truly add to the meaning or impact of certain scenes. Hitchcock loved having a subjective camera search for its protagonists as in the start of "Psycho" but Hitch knew when to say when with his cinematography techniques. Lastly, I can understand that some would say that by the constant over-rating "Kane" over the past seven decades, it has led to a blindly uncontested acceptance of its greatness. Few would dare to call the Mona Lisa an over-rated painting of a renaissance woman who just wouldn't say cheese.Perhaps the thing that is most unappealing to some is the lack of warmth or charm. Is it just too clinical? Is it the product of a mind that had little or no real empathy with the rest of the human race - somewhat like Kane who campaigned for the rights of the people without the slightest hint of understanding their point of view?Now for the nevertheless. Nevertheless, I can understand why some people still see "Kane" as a landmark film that should be acknowledged as a turning point in film making. It does have scenes that remain astonishing even by today's standards. It is a demanding film which requires adult concentration much as symphonic music needs us to fully engage with it. It is not a pop song. And there is no doubt that those who like "Kane" do really like it and are not just playing at being aficionados. There is something that touches those who like or even love "Kane" that is personal and perhaps difficult to define. I just wonder whether in fifty years' time, after the 20th century people like me are gone and perhaps the myth and mystique surrounding "Citizen Kane" has faded, will it still be considered anywhere near the top ten all-time great movies. Will its rather mysterious hold on many people persist? I am pretty sure that few in the 1940's on first viewing would have predicted that it would still be considered top five in 2014.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The structure of "Citizen Kane" is circular, adding more depth every time it passes over the life. The movie opens with newsreel obituary footage that briefs us on the life and times of Charles Foster Kane; this footage, with its portentous narration, is Welles' bemused nod in the direction of the "March of Time" newsreels then being produced by another media mogul, Henry Luce. They provide a map of Kane's trajectory, and it will keep us oriented as the screenplay skips around in time, piecing together the memories of those who knew him.Curious about Kane's dying word, "rosebud," the newsreel editor assigns Thompson, a reporter, to find out what it meant. Thompson triggers every flashback, yet his face is never seen. He questions Kane's alcoholic mistress, his ailing old friend, his rich associate and the other witnesses, while the movie loops through time. But it remains elusive: By flashing back through the eyes of many witnesses, Welles and Mankiewicz created an emotional chronology set free from time.Along with the personal story is the history of a period. "Citizen Kane" covers the rise of the penny press the Hearst-supported Spanish-American War, the birth of radio, the power of political machines, the rise of fascism, the growth of celebrity journalism. A newsreel subtitle reads: "1895 to 1941. All of these years he covered, many of these he was." The screenplay by Mankiewicz and Welles (which got an Oscar, the only one Welles ever won) is densely constructed and covers an amazing amount of ground, including a sequence showing Kane inventing the popular press; a record of his marriage, from early bliss to the famous montage of increasingly chilly breakfasts; the story of his courtship of Susan Alexander and her disastrous opera career, and his decline into the remote master of Xanadu."Citizen Kane" knows the sled is not the answer. It explains what Rosebud is, but not what Rosebud means. The film's construction shows how our lives, after we are gone, survive only in the memories of others, and those memories butt up against the walls we erect and the roles we play. There is the Kane who made shadow figures with his fingers, and the Kane who hated the traction trust; the Kane who chose his mistress over his marriage and political career, the Kane who entertained millions, the Kane who died alone.There is a master image in "Citizen Kane" you might easily miss. A man always seems the same size to himself, because he does not stand where we stand to look at him.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Citizen Kane is a brilliant movie with an extremely well written storyline with an outstanding cast that all follow through with their performances.Orson Welles obviously made this movie the beautiful piece of film making it is,as the star,director,writer and producer,and his performance is of course the best of the whole movie.The movie was also a very interesting "biography" inside the life of Charles Foster Kane,he is a fictional character but Orson Welles performance really brings him to life,although he is apparently loosely based on a real person.All in all,Citizen Kane is a fantastic movie that will forever be remembered as one of the greatest movies ever made,and surely should not be missed by any moviegoers.After the death of a well known publishing tycoon Charles Foster Kane (Orson Welles),a group of news reporters struggle to find out why his last word was 'rosebud'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's generally regarded by those qualified to judge greatness in cinema that this is the one at the very pinnacle.The very top of the heap.The BEST movie in the history of cinema.My take? I will give it credit for being a great film.It is unique from all other films from it's time period.It not only tells us a captivating story,it is visually mesmerizing to boot.At the same time,is it my favorite film? No,that title goes elsewhere for me.There is a difference between large groups of experts determining what is great in cinema,and individual taste.I will buy what the grouped together experts say.On the grand scale,this is probably the best film ever made.My personal favorite film probably wouldn't come close in the eyes of those experts,but I wouldn't trade it.All that being said,may I say,nicely done Mr. Welles.Nicely done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Classic Story Of Power And The Press.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Citizen Kane is the motion picture which, since its release, has been widely regarded by almost all critics, filmmakers &amp; even many viewers around the world as the greatest film of all time. And although I agree to some extent that, purely on a technical scale, this might be the most influential picture ever made but based solely on its plot &amp; story, there are far better examples in cinema than this one.Still, there is no denying that Citizen Kane is a boldly crafted feature which not only defied all the typical methods of filmmaking that were in use at its time of production but also ended up completely rewriting the manuals of filmmaking in the process. The film tells the story of a publishing tycoon whose death makes news reporters scramble around to discover the meaning of his final utterance.While there is a lot to take in here, the best part of Citizen Kane remains its stupefying cinematography &amp; the overall structure of its narration while the worst was, in simple words &amp; in just my opinion, an insufferable boring story. So boring that it took me 6 unsuccessful attempts to finish it. But once it accomplished that, the end result was surprisingly better than what I was expecting from it.The film presents an unusual portrayal of a larger than life character told through different people &amp; is wonderfully assisted by its carefully crafted screenplay, innovative sharp focus photography, non-linear narration, inventive use of make-up, sound &amp; transition effects, splendid score &amp; a strong central performance by Orson Welles in front as well as behind the camera.On an overall scale, Citizen Kane is arguably the most experimental cinema of its era that has somehow managed to stand the test of time and is certainly one of world cinema's highly influential &amp; important works whose significance to the film medium is simply as mysterious &amp; profound as the symbolism behind the word, "Rosebud".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Certainly a classic, but over-hyped for my tastes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The elegance and production quality of this film are absolutely stunning and flawless for the time. The plot and storyline, however, left much to be desired to me, as they were slow developing and not as exciting as I had hoped. The extensive length of the movie also hindered how I felt about the overall quality of the film. My negative criticisms of the film aside, I do still believe that this film is deserving of the high praise and prestige that it receives and is known for. Overall this movie was an excellent masterpiece that was well designed, put together, and thought out, unfortunately, it was just not to my tastes and I could not enjoy it like most people did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Rise and Fall of a Newspaper Tycoon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lauded as America's greatest motion picture of all time, Orson Welles succeeded in utilizing advanced techniques in cinematography, storytelling, and especially lighting and camera angles. Citizen Kane represents the pinnacle of Welles's film-making career despite the surrounding controversy during its time of release. The film had parallels between the eponymous character, Charles Foster Kane, and William Randolph Hearst, who was an American newspaper magnate. Welles combined innovative techniques of deep focus shots along with a kaleidoscope of angles. Different types of angles were utilized in order for the audience to deepen their understanding of each character. Despite the film's confusing newsreel sequence, Welles succeeds in utilizing unique camera angles and advanced cinematography in a perfect manner.Released in 1941, the film became subject of controversy for the brutal portrait of Hearst's life. Citizen Kane also revolutionized how cinematography, a non-linear storyline, and a kaleidoscope of angles were used effectively. The famous eerily opening featuring a shot of the eponymous character's (Orson Welles) mansion, Xanadu. The camera depicts a foggy and murky atmosphere with a deep focus shot of Xanadu atop of the hill. The scene then cuts to a room with a dying Kane, holding a snow globe as he mutters "Rosebud." The camera focuses on the globe as it rolled out of his left hand and broke.Welles employs different a non-linear storytelling which features the death of the main character in the beginning of the movie. As the news unfolds of his death, the famous newsreel sequence unfolds on screen. It presents a brief of narrative events in roughly the same order as the movie as a whole. The editing of the sequence was well-done as the narrator of the newsreel points out that "Kane helped to change the world, but Kane's world now is history. The great yellow journalist himself lived to be history. Outlived his power to make it?" Reporter Jerry Thompson (William Alland) was determined to find out the meaning of Kane's last word "Rosebud." He was assigned to discuss with Kane's former associates in an attempt to uncover the meaning of Rosebud. Different camera angles allow the audience to understand the character emotions and tensions within a scene. For example, there was a scene that involves using a low-angle technique when Kane was having a discussion with his friend, Jedediah Leland (Joseph Cotten). He confronts him after his defeat in the election for governor against Jim W. Gettys (Ray Collins). In the office, where the discussion took place; Leland commented that "(Kane doesn't) care about anything except (himself)." As Kane walks closer to the camera, Leland said to him, "You just want to persuade people that you love 'em so much that they ought to love you back. Only you want love on your own terms." The low angle emphasizes Leland trying to assure his moral superiority to Kane.Citizen Kane made advances in cinematographic advances. Cinematographer Gregg Toland made a significant contribution to the style of the film through the use of deep focus. It refers to having everything within the frame, even the background, focused at the same time. There is a famous scene, involving Kane's mother, Mary Kane (Agnes Moorehead), having a conversation with his father, Jim Kane (Harry Shannon). Deep focus shot was effective in depicting the Kane family, discussing with Walter Parks Thatcher at the table. She figured out that she was given a stock in order to be given ownership of the Colorado Lode, a working gold mine. She signed an agreement to transfer $50,000 per year given to both to her and her husband. Charles Kane eventually owned all possessions by the time he reached the age of 25. The deep focus shot allowed the background which is inside Mary Kane's boarding house to be focused. We see Kane's parents signing the agreement and the distance of a young Kane outside, playing in the snow.In spite of the movie's age and its confusing opening sequence, Citizen Kane has attained its status as "the greatest film ever made." The American Film Institute has ranked the film number 1 in the first top- 100 ranking in 1998. Using deep focus shots allow the characters' emotions to be understood through Gregg Toland's extensive use of back-lighting. What matters is to understand Charles Kane's ruthless rise of acquiring wealth, as he enters the newspaper business. The difficulty to interpret Kane's life has become apparent as reporters attempted to decipher his last word "Rosebud." This word was a clue that Kane was not just a mere symbol of his public accomplishments. Who, really, was Charles Foster Kane?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At the peak of the debt bubble last decade, David Siegel, CEO and owner of the world's largest time share developer, leveraged his already leveraged fortune to build America's largest house. Dubbed un-ironically "Versailles," the 90,000 square-foot monstrosity started to take root in the Florida Everglades. When the bubble popped, so did Siegel's fortune and family, and the home, half-finished, went to foreclosure.Remarkably, documentarian Lauren Greenfield captured the rise and fall of this modern day Xanadu--gaudy enough to make Donald Trump blush--in "Queen of Versailles" (2012), which took top directing honors at the Sundance Film Festival. The comparisons it begs to Orson Welles' "Citizen Kane" (1941), itself an untouchable fortress, are inescapable. Like Charles Foster Kane (Welles), Siegel used the scalability of market capitalism to accumulate unwieldy millions and then sought to sequester it, and himself, in a monument down in that state that Civilized people consider barely worthy of citizenship. And so each of these two men was first among their equals--but not quite even equal himself.We watch Kane and Siegel grow fat, hubristic, and surly while they lose their wealth, reputation and family. But Kane has been remembered for 72 years, whereas Siegel will soon be forgotten. Why did we care so much to decipher Kane's Rosebud while we couldn't care less about Siegel's? Is it that Kane's life's work was vindicating our core value of freedom of the press, whereas Siegel's was indulging our ego, groupthink, and materialism with the thought that we could and should own a second home?To see that it isn't, return to the news room debate that follows the screening of an obit of Kane at the beginning of that film. The editors query: What matters more?: What he did or who he was? Our quest as citizen journalists--proxied by Jerry Thompson (William Alland), whose back is almost always to the camera--resolves that the answer is the latter. To write the definitive Kane obit, we need to know who this love interest Rosebud is, Thompson presumes. We discover Rosebud was no woman, but rather the symbol of the last moment of fun, family and autonomy in Kane's life.Money wrecks all that, and Kane's last-ditch effort to wreck the wrecker by tearing his love nest to tatters is too little, too late. Greenfield's film, on the other hand, never gives us a sympathetic, pre-wealth Siegel whom we might root for, or at least be curious about. We know only what he did, rather than who he was, and so it is mostly with schadenfreude that we witness his implosion.Queen of Versailles isn't the only current release inviting parallels to Welles' chef d'oeuvre. Carl Deal and Tia Lessin's "Citizen Koch" (forthcoming 2013) digs into the funding of the modern Republican Party by plutocrats, including the Koch brothers. The doc is set against the backdrop of the aptly captioned Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, 559 U.S. 310 (2010), which held that citizens do not lose their First Amendment protections merely because they channel their voice through corporations. Indeed, was Kane's constitutionally-protected yellow journalism any nobler than the Hillary Clinton hit job cooked up by Citizens United?What these films and this case share in common is the question of what we may and should do with accumulated wealth. Ironically, that's a question that newspaper moguls have to worry less and less about these days. Just visit Sam Simeon, whose 90,000 square feet Siegel was likely trying to best. William Randolph Hearst's real-life Xanadu, overlooking the Pacific from its perch on the bluffs just north of San Luis Obispo, stands as a monument to the value that could once be extracted by controlling mass media. Perhaps motivated by Welles' film, the Hearst Corporation secured a more sympathetic legacy for Hearst Castle than Kane did for Xanadu by donating it to the state of California to be used as a state park. We'll see whether the ongoing decline of print journalism will force the corporation (which also owns various non-print traditional and new media assets) to sell the grounds near the Castle that, according to a state park tour guide in 2010, it still owns.The less newspaper publishers have to worry about what to do with wealth, the more we newspaper readers have to worry about where to get the news. Part of the answer will be finding it ourselves, as citizen journalists. Traditional media, from CNN (iReport) to the TriBeCa Film Festival (Vine competition categories), will try to channel and co-opt that trend, but they can't put this genie back in the bottle. And so technology, which globalized us in the 20th century, will re-localize us after all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Citizen Kane" (1941) Was Reviewed On IMDb Site 1,063 Times As Of March 17, 2013, And Here Is Review #1,064....Just What The World Needs! ------------- I'm a movie actor (SAG-AFTRA accredited), a movie history teacher and scholar, and I've written 95 movie reviews posted on the IMDb.Com site as of today (St. Patrick's Day 2013....March 17, 2013 to any who don't know about St. Patrick and his famous anniversary day!).I printed out my list of 95 movie review titles written for and posted on IMDb.Com, and noticed "Citizen Kane" (1941) was not included.I supply the following movie review to make up for this oversight, and promise to review other famous and worthy classic movies in the future....my current 3/17/2013 movie review list of 95 movies includes many unknown and even a few unworthy movies, and it seems ironic and a shame movies of importance like "Citizen Kane" (1941) are not included.About "Citizen Kane" (1941).....Orson Welles was famously a self-promoter and opportunist of high skills and great gifts, and the widely accepted reputation of his movie "Citizen Kane" (1941) as "the greatest movie ever made" is due at least in part to his drum-beating, showmanship efforts over the decades to give the movie that label.In fact, "Citizen Kane" (1941) is a tabloid type celebrity scandal story worthy of "The National Inquirer" tabloid newspaper and/or scandal magazine (the publication appeared in both forms over the many profitable decades it operated).William Randolph Hearst (in the not too well disguised fictional persona of "Charles Foster Kane") is taken to task for having a pretty blonde unmarried ex-chorus girl mistress (Marion Davies named "Susan Alexander" in the movie), for living a life of profligate extravagance obviously both immoral and ridiculous, and for getting away with it all.....for living a life into advanced old age where he passes away, finally, in the care of uniformed nurses on duty at one of his mansions certainly as big as one of the Pope's summer palaces or any of French King Louis XIV's residential retreats.In short, "Citizen Kane" (1941) "dishes the dirt" and wades through sleeze, sleeze, sleeze, all sanitized by the fact the sleeze is perpetrated by a person of wealth and power, a captain of industry of the sort demonized widely and often in the 1941 world then very much in love with Socialism and the philosophy of "sharing the wealth," meaning robbing the rich and spreading assets of rich around for the "poor" to share and enjoy."Rich bad guys" were very much in vogue in pre-WWII 1941 in the USA as targets for politicians and the media (the "New Deal" and Huey Long's "Share The Wealth" hustles were two of many examples of the times.....Upton Sinclair's California "EPIC"....an initialism standing for "End Poverty In California" was yet another of fame in the 1930's...)."Citizen Kane" (1941) was a movie about a bad USA rich guy....tabloid stuff for sure.It was presented using tried and true 1920's German art movie techniques of proved value...extreme close-ups, distorted angles, unusual and rarely used techniques of framing and scene changes."The Third Man" (1949) is the other movie of fame and honor Orson Welles made while still a handsome young man (middle 30's in 1949), and it also used eccentric and honored German art film techniques to portray post WWII Vienna, Austria as the dark world of "Harry Lime," the villain (another villain) Welles portrayed in "The Third Man" (1949).....BTW, Welles was "the third man" referred to in the movie title, even though he was not officially given status as first billed movie star in "The Third Man" (1949)....Joseph Cotton was the "official" head movie star in that movie."Citizen Kane" (1941) became a media event due to the efforts of Orson Welles to make it so, and his efforts continued decades after "Citizen Kane" (1941) was released, and quickly forgotten by most people.The retrospective (and in ways probably revisionist) history about the movie details....over the decades following 1941...tales of Louis B. Mayer offering almost one million dollars to burn the original negative before the movie is released, tales of the "battle" between then 76 year old Hearst and then 25 year old Welles), and blow-by-blow tales of how the movie "almost never made it to the theaters" and was "disappeared" after a brief release...Welles became a movie star starting with "Citizen Kane" (1941), married Rita Hayworth, and was a mainstream Hollywood "player" during the 1940's and 1950's until his bad health and old age arrived early ended a not bad 20 year career in movies during which he was seen often on USA and world movie house screens.He even became a player in the world of television, which displaced Hollywood movies by 1960.......who can forget the Orson Welles "Paul Masson Wine" TV ads promising the world that Masson wines would never reach wine customers "before it's time"? "Citizen Kane" (1941) was and is an OK black and white movie hard to enjoy the first time through which became a long range media event, and still is.It is much more important as a media event and example of promotion and pop-scholarship than it is or was as a movie which stands on its own feet.10 stars for "Citizen Kane" (1941) for it's place in "the big picture"......not the same as 10 stars for being a good movie, pure and simple."Citizen Kane" (1941) was never "pure and simple." Thank you for reading the 1,064th movie review posted on WWW.IMDb.Com for "Citizen Kane" (1941). I am grateful.------------- Written by Tex (David) Allen, SAG-AFTRA accredited movie actor, movie scholar and movie history teacher, and movie reviewer.Email Tex at TexAlleN@Rocketmal.Com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A complete movie - compelling and engrossing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Citizen Kane (1941), the first feature film direct by Orson Welles, is considered to be one of the best American drama movies. The film stars Orson Welles playing Charles Foster Kane, a character loosely based on the life of William Randolph Hearst. The movie opens with a shot of Xanadu ? the castle Kane has built for his second wife. As the camera begins to zoom in on the castle, one observes the mansion to be desolate and in need of repair. We then observe a close-up of Kane dying, as he utters his last word "Rosebud". After we learn of Charles Kane through a newsreel detailing his life, an investigative reporter, Jerry Thompson (William Alland), is assigned the task of augmenting the biographic story by trying to determine what Kane meant when he stated "Rosebud". Through interviews with Kane's ex-wife, business partners, and other associates, Kane's life comes to life for Thompson, but the meaning of Rosebud remains elusive.Welles uses flashback techniques to present the biographical story of Charles Kane. Working with Gregg Toland as Cinematographer, Welles creates one of the best movies for both content and form. While the reporter is one of the main characters in the film, we rarely see his face, but instead we mostly observe his silhouette. A variety of camera lens angles and depth of focus are used to create the mood of the scenes. Welles is brilliant in his direction, writing, and blocking of characters. With a run time of 119 minutes, Citizen Kane is completely engrossing, and one of the best movies this reviewer has observed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A movie of epic proportions is how I would describe Citizen Kane. I have watched this film a couple of times, expecting not to like it as much as I would. Being a movie that gets a lot of hype with its title as 'the greatest movie of all time,' I can clearly see why. Is it the greatest of movie of all time? I don't know and that is up to your opinion, but all I can say is that I try not to watch films with those impressions influencing my expectations. Although what I can say is that I greatly appreciate this film and I can accept the praise and I feel it is one of the best films I have ever watched.Despite being from the 40's, this movie somehow feels fresh to me, even today in this day and age! The way that this story is told feels so intrinsic. The movie begins with an introduction of the whole story that really took me off guard at first, but then I realized it didn't tell the human aspects of the story that was to follow and this is one of the most unique introductions in a movie I have ever seen. You think you know the whole story from this mini-documentary styled intro, but this is still a jigsaw puzzle that still needs to be solved by the people who know Kane personally to fill in most of the blanks, especially the mystery of 'Rosebud.' Kane was a powerful figure, but a character who also had a sense of humanity and through this, it's easy to feel a connection to Kane. As we delve into the human aspect of the film, we become more and more immersed with the story and it is a very human story, in my opinion. This to me is what makes the movie effective.And what also astounds about the story is that it feels complete and it did not need to have anything else added to enhance or add further drama to the story. You would think a movie that tries to tell a story of a man's life young to old would feel rushed, but at this running time, it feels like you know the guy! Never have I seen such character development this good and fleshed out on film. And to top it all off, the makeup looks very realistic, along with Orson Welle's acting, which perfectly pulls it off for his different ages throughout the movie.And that is only a few of the great aspects of this film. The great cinematography techniques in the movie have definitely made me more analytical and aware of these intricacies in film. Not only is the story filled with ambition, but you can see it in the beautiful visuals. From Kane's huge, but sparse mansion to scenes utilizing chiaroscuro, you can see the influence it had on films today. From starring and also directing this film, you can see from watching the film the amount of ambition that Orson Welles poured out into this epic.After watching Citizen Kane, I cannot help but feel like there has been a transition from me being a casual movie watcher to a serious film buff. With its simple, but grandiose story, its breathtaking visuals and even the music that perfectly compliments every scene, this movie has become a timeless beauty that ages like fine wine.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How to watch a movie like Citizen Kane? To the film itself!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How to watch a movie like Citizen Kane? It's supposed to be the best film ever made according to the most prestigious poll in the world, for decades in a row, only recently being surpassed by Vertigo. It seems to me that there are potentially two major factors related to this fact, that might bias and distort our judgment of the film itself, our naked experience of it so to speak. The first one is the most obvious: either a fear of being excluded from the cinema in-crowd, or otherwise just being overwhelmed by all those respectable opinions of all those respectable critics who surely must know what they're talking about, or just plain unintelligent herd-mentality, might cause you to think that this film is much better than it actually is. There is also a less obvious possibility: the fact that this film is so highly revered might cause you to think that you are only bullied into thinking that it is so great, and that you start to think that the only way of preserving your authenticity is to denounce it or to greet it with a lukewarm response. Personally, I know I'm susceptible to both distortions, both based upon the a priori fact of 'Kane' being canonized as it is. A fact that, in these cases of distortion, will determine your opinion of the film, regardless of whether or not you have actually seen it. A fact that may very well blind you completely to "die Sache selbst". I think that a phenomenological reduction is in order here. A commitment to completely shut out the knowledge of Kane having the reputation that it has, while watching it. Only then are you perhaps able to actually see the film, let alone judge it. But this is no easy task. In fact it is an impossible task. Therefore, it would seem to follow that it is impossible to watch it. That may be true strictly speaking, but of course not all things are as black and white as the film itself. It is all a matter of degree and a matter of at least trying, or perhaps not of trying, but of letting go, much like 'trying' to sleep cannot be successful when it is literally a matter of trying. But if that is what you shouldn't do, then what should you do? I think that you should let yourself be immersed by the film, let it touch you if it gives itself to you and let it fail to touch you if it tries too hard, if it pulls on your heart like it were only a puppet on a string. All in all, it is your heart that provides you with the most reliable compass. That is not to say that your heart should be opposed to your mind and that if it would 'merely' blow your mind it wouldn't be good enough. Again, things aren't as black and white.But enough about all the preparations. To the film itself! Was I touched by the film? Yes I was. In fact at times I was touched deeply by it, more than I remembered from the last time. Especially by some of the scenes with Kane's wife in the opera house and the scenes in Xanadu, where the true nature of their relationship was revealed. But is Kane a manipulative film? Yes it is. I think that Orson Welles perhaps suffered from many of the same faults as Kane himself, like Leland said: "You don't care about anything except you. You just want to persuade people that you love 'em so much that they ought to love you back. Only you want love on your own terms. Something to be played your way, according to your rules." Citizen Kane is a film that self-consciously wants to be loved. No, it demands to be loved, to be taken before anything else. Very, very hard work went into the making of it to ensure this. It avoids extremities and one-sidedness so as not to exclude any viewers. It includes beautiful and innovative shots in order to appeal to critics and formalist, but mostly not so obvious as to become elitist. It tries to be deep, profound and mysterious and takes itself dead-serious. There was one scene that didn't touch me as much this time, even if it did before, and that was the Rosebud scene at the beginning: it was so intensely self-serious that for a fraction of a second it went over the top for me and became almost comical, like a self-parody (and the fake mustache didn't really help there). But mostly the film is absolutely perfect in terms of editing, narrative and dramatic development, composition, cinematography and an undefinable feel of greatness and precision permeating almost every shot that can only be the product of extremely hard labor and loads of talent. There were also less than perfect qualities, such as the somewhat slower development of the middle part, the acting that varied from great to constructed, even from Welles himself. Also the atmosphere is strange: mostly the film smells like newspapers, money and power-grabbing. Of course that is what the film is about, but as an atmosphere that is normally not really a virtue. Still, this dry and somewhat suffocating atmosphere becomes part of the tragedy of the film, just like the fact that the film is just as manipulative as Citizen Kane himself, becomes part of that tragedy and actually deepens it. Just by not succeeding to create a beautiful atmosphere, the film tragically makes us wish to be released from it and makes us yearn for something lost. Just by the fact that it tries to manipulate us, tries to pull our strings too hard, and fails to touch our hearts because of it, the film becomes the very deadness and emptiness that sends chills down our spine, from the top of our heads, straight to our hearts. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Greatest Movie Ever Made? Debatable. Deserves to be Recognized? Absolutely!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Orson Welles' Citizen Kane is reputed to be the greatest movie of all time. Roger Ebert calls it his number one favorite and it is believed to have revolutionized the world of cinema, as it was known during its time. That sort of compliment carries more weight and depth than many realize. While I would not go so far as to call Citizen Kane the greatest movie ever made, it cannot be denied that it is a work of extreme ambition which defied conventional standards and deserves to be recognized and respected for its brilliance. It's my belief that few understand the courage that was needed to stand against up William Randolph Hearst, a very influential figure in American media and politics, whose ambition, like Orson Welles, knew no bounds. After learning about the unflattering portrayal of him in first feature film of the 24-year-old Welles, Hearst went out of his way to ensure that the production never saw the light of day. To my great relief, he did not succeed. The great potential of Welles became known during his time at the Mercury Theater. Although he was a newcomer to the film industry, he was granted total control of his signature work and had many of his theatrical colleagues to assist him. Even a novice at filmmaking sorely lacking in experience can go far with a good editor and director of photography. Welles took all the credit, but it's more than likely that without the luxury of cinematographer Gregg Toland and young editor Robert Wise, Citizen Kane would not be as praised as it is today. A portrait of William Randolph Hearst's life, Citizen Kane follows the events of Charles Foster Kane's death. Reporter Jerry Thompson is tasked with uncovering the meaning of Kane's dying word "Rosebud". Was Kane a good man, an egotistical tyrant, or a sympathetic tragic figure? Thompson interviews everyone who was close to Kane, providing the audience the opportunity to examine the titular character through their perspectives. Deprived of a normal childhood, Kane attended and failed in a number of schools before gaining control of the sensational newspaper The New York Inquirer and eventually entering politics. A man of noble intentions, he degraded into a megalomaniac over time, leaving him empty and alone in the end. The meaning of "Rosebud" remains a mystery to the characters in the movie but not to the audience, as a sled from his youth, the only time when Kane was ever truly happy, is burned with the rest of his forgotten treasures. Citizen Kane can be considered a textbook of cinematic techniques. Even if you are not impressed by the collection of memorable and well developed characters or the means by which the story is told, from a technical standpoint the film is groundbreaking, with atmospheric and environmental effects used to convey the plot and the brilliant use of cinematography to capture all the emotion and mystery through the use of varied angles and darkness. All in all, simply impossible not to appreciate!How unfortunate it is that Citizen Kane received a negative critical reception upon its release and failed to win all but one Oscar (Best Writing, Original Screenplay) out of its nine nominations. Orson Welles was a born artist who lost everything as Kane did and spent the rest of his life trying to live up to the promise shown in his magnum opus. His career declined, but his legacy will forever stand as a testament to one man's creative vision and the steps he was willing to take to fight for his dreams. There are those who claim that Citizen Kane is overrated. Is that so? Perhaps. But regardless, there is much to be admired for avid filmmakers and anyone else who enjoys a thought-provoking narrative experience. One thing I can say with certainty is that the efforts of Orson Welles were not in vain.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I tried hating this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw Citizen Kane, I hated it. Why? Because it was called The Greatest American Film of All Time. The first time I saw it, I was 12 years old, and I didn't even care about the movie. I just watched the movie and pointed out all the reasons why this movie sucked. To me, Citizen Kane was The Worst American Film of All Time. Then I saw the film again when I was like 16, and it was a little better. I then saw it the following year, and then I finally understood why it was called the greatest. After that third viewing, I finally had that appreciation for it that most film buffs have. There are many things that make this film the greatest. First of all, the cinematography is jaw dropping. This movie is so beautiful to look at; it almost brings a tear to my eye. The shadows, the angles, the camera movements, everything is just perfect. This may be the main reason why this film is considered to be the best, but there are other reasons too. Another great thing is the acting. This isn't typical 1940s acting; this is stuff that could still win Oscars today. The acting is so good, and the writing is so realistic, that it keeps you hooked from beginning to end. In fact, that's what made me love this movie. The story of Charles Foster Kane is just fascinating, and it's really interesting to see his story told through various flashbacks. The last thing that makes this movie so incredible is the impact it had. When this movie came out, it didn't do too well. In fact, it was like a cult movie years after its release. The film was based on the life of William Randolph Hearst, and he wasn't too pleased with what Welles was showing about his life (like his affair). Hearst wanted to have every print of this film destroyed, but Welles fought for it, and the rest is history. This really pushed the boundaries of freedom in cinema, and just knowing that makes it so much better. What I find very remarkable about this movie is legendary filmmaker, Orson Welles. This was his first movie, he was only 26 years old, and he wrote, directed, and starred in it. The man was a genius, and a true inspiration. Even if you don't want to admit this is the best movie ever made, that's fine. Even if you don't think it's the best, I don't think you can say it's a bad movie. Don't look at it as the best movie, just look at it as a movie, and maybe you'll appreciate it more. Greatest Movie of All Time? Yeah, it's kind of hard not to like it?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deserves to be a great film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you see a 50 years old film and still find the cinematography and other film making techniques to be compelling than just imagine the impact it would have over the audience in those times. From the start I found it to be a visual treat. Over the first few minutes it runs as if you are sitting in a local train and which stops at different stations and you get to know the glimpses of your journey. Such is the great editing which is used in the starting.The story telling manner was completely unorthodox and has blown my mind. What is more important to note is the character of Charles Kane. The film has depicted his character in such a way that the audience is in a confused state as to what truly was his nature. I like films which make people guessing and thinking when they leave the Cinema Hall. The acting of the director himself was awesome and other characters also performed very nicely. In all, this is a film which will leave you thinking about it all the time obviously making you guess the different aspects of the story. Any cinema lover is sure to enjoy this.PROS: The story of the film is brilliantly written and the character of Charles Kane has been analyzed with full depth. What is more compelling to me is that analysis of the character done in the film is from the point of the view of the director and the writer. But it also leaves space for the audience to make their own version of this character. Such great is its depiction. No doubt that the cinematography and editing are at their best. To understand how great the techniques are, you have to get out of the world of films that we are living in currently. Only than one can truly understand what is great. Orson has given the best acting in the film as the lead character. The only other one whom I would compare here would be Francois Truffaut and his acting in the film Day for Night. The progress of the story, the depth of the nature of the important characters and their part in the film are satisfying to the maximum level.CONS:In the middle however I got drifted away a little from the film but that might be because I was carrying too much of expectation from the film and was expecting it to be as compelling as The Bicycle Thief but I understand that both of them are of a different genre. And maybe we should never carry too much expectation because when we do so than our mind makes us to find faults in the act we are going to perform. But the pleasing editing again took me into the film.MESSAGE: "Truth is bitter." VERDICT: "A must watch film for all lovers of cinema."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Rosebud" leaves its indelible traces</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When RKO Radio Pictures gave young radio celebrity Orson Welles the opportunity to work on two pictures of his own little did they know that these two projects nearly would cause the company to go bankrupt. "Citizen Kane" was one of those films where the then 25 year old director and star Orson Welles pulled every possible trick from the books to make an impression, yet - while immediately critically acclaimed - nobody wanted to see the result. By now however the movie's profound influence in American film making is undisputed. And there's a lot one should know about it.For one as far as the technical side is concerned: Welles shot in deep focus (front and back are both in focus at the same time), used subtle optical illusions, framed his scenes brilliantly, pioneered with invisible wipes, worked with models combined with sets and matte drawings, cleverly placed cameras to force strange angles, even moved furniture there and back again while in a scene, played with mirrors, shots that emphasized size and grandeur or dwarfed a person - the list goes on and on. "Citizen Kane" however is also all about acting, as there's no moment when the viewer doesn't buy Kane's age whenever he is seen - be it in is early twenties or on his deathbed decades later. The character's body language and mannerisms are believable throughout, and when we get to the final reel and finally learn the secret we feel that we really have the key to understand that person. Ah yes, speaking about "rosebud"... That's the third point that needs mentioning: The depth of the story. It's core was inspired by tycoon Randolph Hearst, whose media outlets promptly boycotted the film in reaction, Hearst even wanted to buy the film in order to destroy it... Ah, Welles apparently was on to something! But there's of course a lot of fiction as well in "Citizen Kane" thanks to screenwriter Herman Mankiewicz, and so "rosebud" leaves its indelible traces in everyone who ever tried to get to the bottom of the mystery.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The more I've learned about this film, the more I've enjoyed it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you see this movie without any advance knowledge, it's a good story with good acting. But the more I've learned about its background and history, the more fascinating it's become.Orson Welles (OW) was only 25, famous for his radio acting group, but with no previous movie experience when given carte blanche to make a film completely on his own with all editing at his discretion. OW and the writer Herb Mankiewicz (HM) discussed using several notable contemporary characters (e.g., Howard Hughs) as take-offs for the main character to be portrayed in flashbacks. They settled on newspaper tycoon William Randolph Hearst, possibly because HM had been friends with Hearst &amp; his mistress, movie star Marion Davies, until HM's always getting drunk at their parties led to their excluding him (which ticked off HM).The film's principal character of "Charles Foster Kane" (CFK) is an amalgam of fantasy plus some features of Hearst as well as others, (including OW's huge ego, OW's huge temper, OW's being orphaned and brought up by a non-relative). CFK's promotion of his 2nd wife, "Susan Alexander," as an opera star was based very closely on the otherwise unrelated actions of a (real life) contemporary Chicago tycoon, Harold McCormick, with his 2nd wife.When Hearst learned of CFK's resemblance to him, he ordered his publishing empire (28 metropolitan USA newspapers + many radio stations) to make NO mention, carry NO advertising AT ALL of this film. That quashed its reception in the USA in all but a few metro areas. It was only after 1955, when RKO sold its film library to TV, that "Citizen Kane" ("CK") began being widely seen and appreciated. French "New Wave" directors were also extolling "CK's" innovative greatness."CK" made a number of breakthroughs. Previously: -- film narratives had been told sequentially and from only one point of view. In "CK", CFK dies at the beginning and the rest of the film is a series of flashbacks; a reporter seeks out CFK's life and several characters give contrasting views; -- cinematography had filmed scenes in residences horizontally, as if viewing a theater set; CK's cinematographer excavated holes in the floor to make some shots from unique levels; -- a dining table was incrementally lengthened in repeated scenes of CFK with his 1st wife to enhance the growing distance between them; -- plus many, many other innovations.Probably due to Hearst's restrictive measures against the film, "CK" did not make money for RKO. Since its resurgence, many experts have called it the greatest American film ever (or, sometimes, greatest film ever).I saw it several months ago in a KU faculty alum film series and, just again, in another monthly film series. While it was enjoyable the first time, it became more so the second time because I knew and attended to more.For those interested in these areas, I highly commend the Wikipedia article on "Citizen Kane" (as well as theirs on "Orson Welles"). Wiki's article on "CK" (IMO) seems fairly balanced (while some books/articles on "CK" are not) -- &amp; as a bonus, you'll learn which part of whose anatomy that "Rosebud" was a euphemism for!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Orson Welles himself noted that he personally thought "Rosebud" itself to be a cheap gimmick (his words not mine).This movie as another reviewer up there has already noted, is grossly and unfairly placed up on high by so called movie "critics" or worst still, "experts".How such a drab but passable piece of work could pass for "the greatest film ever made" is almost so questionable that if one does not question this, one is surely just a trainee film geek and not a seasoned person of the world, and most importantly of the movies.The movies are for the people, and NONE of them suggest for a second that they even like this dull mediocre piece of black and white slush.The scenes are appallingly shot and the actors are not screen giants or dramatically entertaining, but because this film is black and white and because it verges on costume drama and because Orson Welles spoke with a near British accent, American film societies (nearly of them now dead, like the arguments for this film) "chose" this, as if these high and mighty people can choose a boring dull slush job like this to be and I am serious: "THE GREATEST FILM EVER MADE" But nobody's favourite. Question that if you will, why the masses didn't ever choose it, but why film snobs choose it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly one of the deserved classics of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How to understand a legend, and the man within. Thats the enterprise that drives Citizen Kane, a mission of layers that begins and ends with Xanadu, and Rosebud. At first we get the newsreel account, facts and knowledge but its a mean rendition, notes that point but say little. And so the process begins of unwrapping mystery from memory, the search for Rosebud. Xanadu says as much as the final revelation though, stately pleasure dome never finished. Coleridge never finished Khubla Khan to his satisfaction, his committal to verse on an opium dream interrupted by a guest and left to inadequate completion, and here Xanadu is a symbol of Kane and his own quest for dream interrupted. Even as the film unwraps the man through memory and its branches, in the end understanding can only be limited, the man who resides ultimately within his own mind is only understandable to himself. Which is not to say that the film is oblique, on the contrary it is a fine, scalpel slicing dissection of a man, his rise and fall, his companions and works. Orson Welles gives a towering performance as the title role, from a young turk beaming with energy and arrogance, to crusader then to stubbornness, unerring commitment to himself above all things sowing his downfall. For all the character's flaws Welles brings sympathy and tragedy to the role, in bringing clarity and perfect nuance to every stage he conveys to the audience a deeper understanding than what is said by mere words or events and thusly provokes sympathy even when one would perhaps like to dismiss him. The cast around aid the journey well, the exasperation of George Coulouris as Kane's guardian and fluster of Erskine Sanford as a traditional newspaper owner usurped by new practice make for wry amusement in the early stages, Ruth Warrick handling with great subtlety the first shifts towards downfall as Kane's first wife, Dorothy Comingore (though histrionic in places) deeply affecting as his simple, honest and lovable second. And best of all Joseph Cotten as an old friend bearing the greatest insight and hardest fall. With such performances and finely judged writing its a classic tale of corruption, greed and the peril of relentless drive. But underneath it all the search for a man within a legend. And one of the greatest things the film does is not just highlight futility but cast doubt on the very search. Its in the cinematography, the use of light and shadow. In general terms the superb work of Gregg Toland gives the film an often shadowy mood suggesting depth even when the actors aren't at work, but whats really interesting is the refusal to give face to the journalist pursuing the story, only those he speaks to, only what is relevant to Kane himself. In shrouding the journalist and his masters particularly in shadow and dark a great gulf is established between the world of Kane and his contemporaries and those who seek to unfurl said world. If Kane's wives and companions are at a remove from him, the seekers after truth are removed even from them, impossibly far away from deeper insight. Which gives the film dual interest to me, the mind, how it seals itself off and the impossibility of knowledge. Perhaps Citizen Kane is not the best examination focused as it is on a fairly classical story, but its certainly one of the very most accomplished and entertaining. One of my favorites so far of the established canon of cinema, and hugely recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although wealth is often associated with success and, consequently, happiness, reality often proves otherwise. Being a billionaire may equal to being lonesome and unhappy. A lot of examples show clearly that being ultra-rich can mean being ultra-sorrowful.The cinema production that memorably depicts an absorbing story where wealth cannot fill the puzzle of human personality (rosebud) occurs to be CITIZEN KANE, the first feature film (film ? clef) by Orson Welles. Based upon the true life story of newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst, the movie offers a wide range of cinematic thrill and psychological development, which make it a key production at multiple levels. And indeed, it appears challenging to review such a film, the CULT FILM that so many great film critics and scholars have already analyzed before. Certain modesty is needed. Yet, every single viewer is able to add something new that others have not seen before. I could experience that when seeing the film on the big screen lately on the occasion of its recent 70th birthday with other people. The exchange of viewpoints occurred to be a true exchange of perceptions. Let me address some points underneath where I will combine our impressions with some widely acclaimed opinions.When viewing Welles' movie, one's attention is directed towards the main character not through the traditionally linear storyline but through a flashback and other flashbacks within. We are led to know the newspaper magnate Charles Foster Kane (Orson Welles) who dies in his vast dreamlike estate Xanadu, an oasis of his mind and wealthy life, and whose last, mysterious, absorbing word is 'ROSEBUD.' May he remain mystery, an enigma? Is his caution sign 'No trespassing' powerful enough? Or may anyone dare go deeper... Flashbacks, narrators and the attempts led by newsreel reporter Jerry Thompson (William Alland) help us get to know the man who has won so much, who impersonated the American dream, yet who is tormented by something mysterious - a man in the endless search for something that could make his life bright. Although so many people are around him, he finds himself alone... Despite some criticism, the portrayal of Orson Welles is truly special and sophisticated.All the supporting characters (the cast rather new to the motion picture industry of the time) are genuine, we empathize with most of them, they are the people whom Kane encountered in his life and whom reporter Thompson questions. However, after longer inspection, we realize that they are/were nothing but background, more to say, aims by which Mr Kane gains success. They appear to be shadows that slowly disappear from his selfish mind: the two women seemingly loved by the magnate, his wives Emily (Ruth Warrick) and Susan (Dorothy Comingore), his political rival Jim Gettys (Ray Collins), his friend and first reporter on the paper "The Inquirer" Jed Leland (Joseph Cotten) and the loyal friend and employee Mr Bernstein (Everett Sloane). All are gone at the face of selfish loneliness...Beautiful exemplification of falsely directed personal success and selfish desires that manipulate and affect a person/people in the capitalist world. It also refers to the deception of politics. Where are the working men he seemingly cared for? Where are his rivals he challenged? What remains are cold statues and enormous halls. Can he prove anything to himself at the face of death --- this genuine, inevitable, merciless fate? The thought provoking content goes with brilliant artistry and cinematography's innovations. Great camera work in the large interiors, Gregg Toland's cinematography boasting of deep focus shots (where everything is in sharp focus), and Maurice Seiderman's make-up appear to be stunning. Among the most memorable scenes, let me name just two: the thrilling action in Kane's conversations with his wife Emily and the atmospheric gloom in Thompson's visit at Bernstein. The way Xanadu's interiors are shot, the use of light and shadows leave a lasting impact in viewers, too. In such moments, the mystery of man nicely goes with the mystery of images. The music by Bernard Herrmann with his effective "Breakfast Montage" and the wit in the parody of vocal coaching supply the movie with the artistic/entertaining merit.It is important to note that CITIZEN KANE is the double work by Orson Welles. In how much he was appreciated by many film scholars, let me quote the French New Wave filmmaker Jean Luc-Godard who said: "Everyone will always owe him everything." Welles, as an actor, beautifully portrays a man whose will and whose heart are the supreme driving forces, yet who does everything with consideration of himself. There is no doubt that he makes a lasting impression in the role. As a director, the views were quite diverse. Although we can agree that his stylish direction indeed helps the film considerably, certain criticism occurred on the topic of Welles' collaboration with Herman Mankiewicz on the screenplay. The criticism was also the result of proclaiming CITIZEN KANE officially the greatest film ever made. There is no doubt that such a fake expression will meet reproach. Some eminent people criticized Welles' film as "an all-American triumph of style over substance" (according to Ray Carney) or as a 'total bore' made by Welles, the 'infinitely overrated filmmaker.' (according to Ingmar Bergman). All things considered, it would be an unforgivable condensation to say that CITIZEN KANE is merely a historic movie. It is much more...if not directly, it addresses the core of individual/social views on success and means of achieving it; it shakes the self-view of people and interpersonal relations; it brings to light the personal disasters hidden in the world-acclaimed maxim: 'the end justifies the means.' People as means and wealth as the end? Yet, what stands for this 'wealth?' Things that say nothing, statues that feel nothing and...the merciless visitor that takes all? Then, the childhood memory, even if shortened of something, occurs a simple, redeeming relief...And what were our impressions after seeing the film? It inspired thinking and feeling.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not going to tell you anything about this movie... yet, but what I will do is give you a short history of my opinion of the movies I've experienced and loved, and why I rate them as I do, so that when I do actually give my opinion on CK, you will have some idea about the context and weight of my words...The first movie that really got me hooked on cinema was Fantasia. I was just a child, but I'd never seen anything so wonderful and artistic. It was an incredibly moving experience, even for a 6 year old. I love it still, and always will.The next movie that rocked me to my core was 2001:A Space Odyssey. I was only 12 in 1968, but it affected me like nothing else to that time. Back then you could buy a ticket and sit in a theater all day if you liked... and that's exactly what I did (watched it 3 times in a row)! One of the most influential movies of all time, and an instant classic... cinema as high art. Astounding!Then along came 1972...I was not old enough to appreciate the true Genius of The Godfather at the time. I think I must have been a bit put off by the violence, but I knew it was outstanding anyway. I did however get rocked again at the age of 22 by The Deer Hunter. It chilled me to the bone and broke my heart. Christopher Walken's Nick haunts me to this day. I don't rewatch this movie often. It is just too painful, but it remains one of my all time favorites. A GIANT among films!Up to this point in my life (22) I was beginning to be aware of a movie called Citizen Kane that was often said to be the best movie ever made. I also became aware of another such old timey movie called Casablanca with similar accolades. Unfortunately (or perhaps fortunately... hard to say), I did not see either movie until I was in my mid thirties. Thankfully though, I finally did...I'll say it right now... I am not a great fan of Casablanca. It's a classic, yes. It's an excellent movie, yes... but the greatest off all time?! Not to me. I find it dated, stiff, and unconvincing. I can never suspend my disbelief that Bogart and Bergman actually loved each other. Without that, the movie simply falls apart for me. Oh well...and that leaves CITIZEN KANE... I simply cannot get my head around the fact that a 25 year old directed/starred in/wrote this movie. It is just not possible! This level of depth is always reserved for seasoned artists of the highest caliber, not young men just a couple years out of college! Unfortunately for Welles, he made CK so early in his career that it may have destroyed him as an artist... CK is that good! He gained tons of weight and made Paul Masson commercials (while drunk?) saying such things as "We make no wine before it's time..." How sadly ironic...Citizen Kane is the one true ring, the "Ring That Binds Them"! I hope I can live long enough to experience it's cinematic equal, but I doubt I will. If you have never seen it, you are indeed lucky... and you must do two things immediately...Go out and buy a lottery ticket...then go out and find a copy of the best movie ever made, and watch it.There is no way you can lose! :-)</fullReview>

I have had more enjoyment watching a Monogram programmer, with all it's static photography and stock music score. At least some of those films filled their time slots with something lively, even though it would be considered illogical or contrived. There must be a reason some people revere this film.

		<shortDescription>An Influential Film for an Essential Movie Collection</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A great classic influences those following classics that result from ground-breaking collaboration of writing, acting, direction, and production. Anyone who studies cinema history understands that Citizen Kane should always be mentioned as an essential, influential work. You'll never, ever see it remade. No one would dare try to make it better, because they can't. Some call it dated, yet it was made in 1941. Even today, it will knock the pants off most films that are hammered out by the studios and independent companies, alike. Citizen Kane is as influential and controversial today as it was even before its release. There was uproar when the owner of Hearst newspapers attempted to sabotage the production of Citizen Kane after discovering that Kane, the main character, was based on Hearst. Today, there is debate on whether the film should be considered a classic. A number of people call Citizen Kane "overrated." If you agree, that's fine, because I'm not about to dissuade you. But there are also people who don't like more current classics like "Shawshank Redemption," "Schindler's List," or "2001: A Space Odyssey." They claim that these films (and a number of others on the IMDb Top 250) "put you to sleep." Or, they beg to ask, "What's the point?" The point is that so many more people feel it's classic, rather than crap.The pacing of Citizen Kane is quite deliberate, in order to peel back the many clues needed to answer the mystery of the last words made by Charles Foster Kane, a recluse newspaper magnate in the mansion that sits among darkness and decay, similar to his very legacy. An investigative reporter is given the task to discover the meaning of "Rosebud," exhaled in a whisper of Kane's final breath. I enjoyed how the mystery of Rosebud unfolded, especially with regard to the film's surprising climax. All of those characters left behind to (oft-times, begrudgingly) give their accounts of how Kane influenced their lives, as Kane's quest for fairness succumbed to his thirst for power. The style of storytelling was ground-breaking in its time, as Kane's persona emerged through the performance of Orson Welles and the Mercury Players, who helped put together a fitting, brilliant, and outstanding ending. Make sure to spot Nat King Cole's film debut, playing the piano at the night club.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Charles Foster Kane's dying words announcing the birth of Modern cinema ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a vast and gloomy property, you're welcomed by a sign as cold as the cloudy night sky, 'NO TRESPASSING' dominated by a big "K" atop the door gate. The atmosphere is like getting ready to mourn the life that is gasping its last breaths, and then in one of the many rooms that populate the manor, a mouth covered by a big brushy mustache whispers "Rosebud" in a solemn echo. A life has gone, and a big snow globe falls to the ground and shatters in thousands of pieces. A man is dead, a masterpiece is born. "Rosebud." How can you define a life, a man or anything that carries so much contradictory and complex interpretations, in one word? The attempt to understand a figure as larger-than-life as Charles Foster Kane, the press magnate, through his dying word is not only the mystery that "Citizen Kane" tries to solve, in a Utopian effort, but also the greatest cinematic secret ever created. I know this superlative has been overused ad nausea to describe Orson Welles' masterpiece to a point the movie that currently thrones over the American Film Institute's Top 100 became the epitome of cinematic greatness, but this is not without reasons.What strikes the most when you watch "Citizen Kane" is the way the movie exudes a modernity that gets more palpable after each viewing. The film tries to understand the man that embodies the American Dream in its most appealing and appalling aspects. A man who, as a child, was torn away from his family to be precociously raised in manhood, until becoming the ruler of one of the most influent newspapers in America, as an idealist and social oriented figure first, before being alienated by his own egomania. Never has a character study, literally, challenged our intelligence in such a thrilling way. If the movie is not the first one to use non-linear narrative, it sure is the one that transcended the entertaining value of flashbacks.This is the first element that is remembered when we evoke "Citizen Kane", the way the journalist, interestingly seen in shadows like making one with the audience, interviews some protagonists of Kane's life : the surrogate father, Mr. Thatcher, his banker, Kane's best friend, his ex-second wife and his butler, each one of them giving a particular insight on Kane's personality, sometimes idealistic, a bully, a mix of contradictions that maintains the enigma more than it solves it. The editing that swings between crucial parts of Kane's life using so many artistic cuts and masterful ellipses is the key element on "Citizen Kane"' newness, but not the part of the technical achievement.The modernity on which relies the general appreciation of "Citizen Kane" is so omnipresent that if I didn't want to take the movie's greatness for granted, I would say that Orson Welles tried every new trick he could, turning the film into some kind of arty experimentation. But this is a critic I used with another milestone film, Jean-Luc Godard's "Breathless" where I thought the absence of a story distracted from the directorial accomplishment. For "Citizen Kane", it works, the uses of deep focus is never gratuitous, like in this memorable shot where Mary Kane signs the papers while you can see, young Charlie Kane sledding in the snow, foreshadowing, the end of his innocent days. The delightfully elliptic editing showing the downfall of Kane's marriage, as he and his wife get more and more distant, the use of shadows, close-ups, and this never-ending feeling of irony, like this moment where the camera dramatically rises over the opera's curtain to show two workmen express their appreciation of Susan's singing talent, the extraordinary make-up transcended by the acting talent of Orson Welles, and even Joseph Cotton to play other characters, the innovation technique in "Citizen Kane" could be a subject for a long thesis. Let's just say that it paved the way for modern cinema like "The Birth of a Nation" did during the silent era. Now, is this the only reason that can explain why "the movie is so great, is such a big deal"? I think the story contributed to more than 50%. "Citizen Kane" is about understanding a man whose ambition exceeded the limits of his functions. He didn't want to inform, but to be loved, to rule America with his own visions, to be the one who'll say to people what and how to think, prophesying the current media totalitarian monopoly even in democracies. And this is only one element of a vast psychological jigsaw puzzle whose central piece is still 'Rosebud'. There's no particular strategy when you solve a jigsaw puzzle, but the journalist follows the most usual one, assembling the common elements, and then joining them together.Why such a need for love? Maybe the loss of his mother is the Oedipian driver that inspired him to get more in touch in people? Maybe his failure in politics transferred his blind ambition on Susan, the second wife? Or maybe money and power, corrupt the purest souls, and the more powerful, and richer you get, the more detestable becomes the idea of being criticized. In the last appearance of Charles Foster Kane with many reflect mirrors the multidimensionality of a man who still intrigues and fascinates now. And in one of the all-time greatest performances, Welles embodies Kane as the precocious genius who's to cinema what Kane tried to be for America.The movie wasn't successful, but time did it justice, "Citizen Kane"s is now part of American Culture like Mark Twain or Jazz music, and one of the most iconic films ever with these scenes forever graved in our memories, "Rosebud", the 'New on the March' reel, the dance scene, Xanadou, "I'm Charles Foster Kane!", and of course that immortal ending that gives the clue about the one true thing that was "Rosebud", as the most valuable and irreplaceable part of any man's life ..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably the Greatest Film Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw this film I blown away. It was the first older film I ever saw and thought, "simply amazing!" It really turned me on to the classics and opened my mind to the concept that in terms of how great a movie is it doesn't matter when the film was made. Orson Welles was only twenty six when he made "Citizen Kane"(1941)! Some men will spend there wholes lives trying to create a movie as amazing as this and most will fail yet Welles hit this one out of the park at such a young age! On top of that it was Welles first film ever made! The success might be credited to that Welles was given full creative control of the film by RKO Pictures. The use of sound in this film is unreal, and it seems like every scene can be deconstructed to find 100 different meanings behind every characters action and the objects/places that surround them. This Film ? clef uses exceptionally peculiar narrative and direction to tell you the story of Charles Foster Kane. Starting from Kane's last words, going to a news real, then jumping between the interviews of reporter Jerry Thompson to the flashbacks of the ones he questioned. All this accompanied by daring and creative cinematography and amazing acting by Orson Welles and his crew solidify this piece as cinema gold. Don't get me wrong this is in no way my favorite film but I'd think even a person who despised this film would have a hard time saying it wasn't the greatest film known to man. For this I give it 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now, I can understand why Orson Welles and Citizen Kane gets so much praise. Citizen Kane is immediately engaging beginning with Kane's death. Welles tells the story of Kane through an unconventional and innovative narrative that flows easily as Kane's story unfolds. Citizen Kane is clearly one of the most praised films due to Welles himself. Aside from the amazing script, Welles is a very talented actor. Welles is completely believable as Kane at 25 as he is at 80. Welles is also responsible for an innovative and inspiring directorial effort. Each scene is beautiful and the camera movements are very fluid.Citizen Kane has at least a thousand amazing little things that make the film what it is. I would highly recommend this film to anyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can honestly find no fault with Citizen Kane. Not a second of film wasted. Overflowing with brilliant music, acting, writing, cinematography, editing, sets, pretty much everything a movie can excel at. And the best part is that it forever changed movies for the betterThe movie tells the story of a man trying to figure out the meaning of a very famous newspaper tycoon's last word. As he interviews the many people who knew Charles Kane, we get to see the life of the most fascinating movie characters of all time. The story is unfolded in a way that the audience becomes completely entranced in his life. We also want to hang on every word in order to know what Rosebud is. Every frame of this movie is filled with innovation. Orson Welles gives us every kind of edit, camera angle, and movement to convey the feeling he wants to give. He effortlessly switches from a feeling of doom, to very happy and joyous scenes, to really sad scenes very effectively. Bernard Herrman's score also helps lots in creating the mood. I'd even say it's his most under-appreciated score.Everybody in the movie gave strong performances, and just about all the actors deserved Oscars. This is also one of those rare movies where every character, major and minor, is completely interesting. You could probably write an essay about everybody that appears on screen.I could probably go on forever about how great this work of art is, but I think I'll stop here since its brilliance has already been covered a gajillion and two times. I recommend this to anybody who loves film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outstanding cinema - a story of a man who has it all only to lose it all</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had to see this film? Why? Because it was hailed as 'one of the greatest films ever' etc etc. Also seeing it in 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, I was very eager to check out this film, and not really knowing anything about it.And it is truly a masterpiece. From the first fifteen minutes, I thought I was going to watch a film that was indeed told like a short film shown back in those times, only to be surprised when the audience got out of their seats. The first fifteen minutes is a summary of Charles Foster Kane that shows his life experience and eventually his death.What I had no idea was how many references the cartoon the Simpsons have made to this film - I honestly had no idea it was from this film. Well I'm glad I know now. What is truly gripping about this film is that it starts off with a poor boy who strikes it gold and eventually takes over a newspaper business, and has his soul turned into one of greed and possession; a man that many of the characters in the film who have known him claim him to be a man who is incapable of giving love, but wants to be loved on his own terms.Then you have the mystery of his last dying words 'rosebud' that you discover at the end what this mystery thing is. And it all makes sense that this was something he has treasured and is incapable of getting it back. I'm not going to reveal it but the metaphor is pretty much something many of us may think of later in life.I loved how the story was told - with it's flashbacks and insights into this character from a perspective of each person who knew him. It's almost like a detective sort of story only we aren't looking for crimes, but more rather the crimes he has done to the heart of the people around him, and in turn his own.Finally I am glad to have seen this and to realise why this is hailed as classic. Orwon Welles is just terrific as Kane and gives a performance that will surely be remembered as one of the most magnificent in cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitely NOT the best movie ever...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll keep this review brief. I'll simply explain why this movie that has been hailed as the best movie ever is not in my opinion: 1) I felt nothing for the main character. I didn't care whether he lived or died, if he was successful or failed. I simply could not identify or empathize with him.2) In line with number one, the movie as a whole did nothing to me emotionally. After watching it I didn't feel sad, happy or really any emotion at all and I certainly didn't want the story to continue which is one of the most important aspects of a great movie...you simply don't want it to end.Now I'd be to first to admit that my opinion might be somewhat biased due to the fact that I had seen the movie listed as the best movie of all time according to the AFI's 100 top movies of all time. I've noticed that when someone tells me that a movie is excellent before I see it, it usually never lives up to the hype but great movies actually do live up to the hype. Good example would be Titanic.I'll end my review here. I just challenge someone, anyone to simply list out why the reasons why this is the best movie of all time and please don't tell me how it revolutionized cinematography, if that's the case, the first movie ever made should be the best movie of all time. Story has to count for something and the end of the day, the story of Citizen Kane was just down right boring.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The All Time Top Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Orson Welles first feature film -- which he directed, produced, and co-wrote, as well as playing the title role -- proved to be his most important and influential work, a ground- breaking drama loosely based on the life of William Randolph Hearst which is frequently cited as the finest American film ever made. Aging newspaper magnate Charles Foster Kane (Orson Welles) dies in his sprawling Florida estate after uttering a single, enigmatic final word -- "Rosebud" -- and newsreel producer Rawlston (Phil Van Zandt) sends reporter Jerry Thompson (William Alland) out with the assignment of uncovering the meaning behind the great man's dying thought. As Thompson interviews Kane's friends, family, and associates, we learn the facts of Kane's eventful and ultimately tragic life: his abandonment by his parents (Agnes Moorehead and Harry Shannon) after he becomes the heir to a silver mine; his angry conflicts with his guardian, master financier Walter Parks Thatcher (George Coulouris); his impulsive decision that "it would be fun to run a newspaper" with the help of school chum Jedediah Leland (Joseph Cotten) and loyal assistant Mr. Bernstein (Everett Sloane); his rise from scandal sheet publisher to the owner of America's largest and most influential newspaper chain; his marriage to socially prominent Emily Norton (Ruth Warrick), whose uncle is the President of the United States; Kane's ambitious bid for public office, which is dashed along with his marriage when his opponent, corrupt political boss Jim Gettys (Ray Collins), reveals that Kane is having an affair with aspiring vocalist Susan Alexander (Dorothy Comingore); Kane's vain attempts to promote second wife Alexander as an opera star; and his final, self-imposed exile to a massive and never-completed pleasure palace called Xanadu. While Citizen Kane was a film full of distinguished debuts -- along with Welles, it was the first feature for Joseph Cotten, Everett Sloane, Ray Collins, Agnes Moorehead, and Ruth Warrick -- the only Academy Award it received was for Best Original Screenplay, for which Welles shared credit with veteran screenwriter Herman Mankiewicz. Widely considered the greatest American movie ever made, Orson Welles's film debut reinvented Hollywood conventions of story-telling and visual structure, suggesting the essential mystery of a person's inner self and inspiring countless filmmakers with its technical accomplishments. Already famous for his work in radio and theater, 24-year-old Welles was given complete creative freedom when RKO Pictures signed him in 1939. Co-authored with Herman J. Mankiewicz, the Kane screenplay dispensed with linear biographical narrative in favor of flashbacks recounting Kane's life from several points of view, ostensibly to solve the puzzle of Kane's deathbed utterance. Collaborating with cinematographer Gregg Toland, Welles used specially constructed sets to compose the film through a number of long takes in deep focus and high-contrast black-and-white, creating meaning through the juxtaposition of multiple actions and characters in a single take rather than through numerous edits. While the imagery and the carefully choreographed soundtrack provide clues to Kane's nature as he ages from innocent boy to corrupt magnate, he ultimately remains an enigmatic figment of memory. Kane's real-life model, however, was no mystery; newspaper baron William Randolph Hearst tried to suppress what he considered an unflattering portrait of himself. While RKO rejected an offer to reimburse their costs in exchange for burning the negatives, Citizen Kane's release was hindered by Hearst's campaign against it. Though non-Hearst papers recognized it as a vanguard work, and it was nominated for nine Oscars (four for Welles himself), Kane was not a popular hit. Despite the film's artistic approbation and subsequent wide-ranging influence, from 1940s film noir to the French New Wave to American film school grads, Welles never again had creative control in Hollywood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly a Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The drama mystery Citizen Kane is directed by Orson Welles and stars Orson Welles, Joseph Cotten, and Dorothy Comingore. The film takes place in 1941 with flashbacks from as far back as the late eighteen hundreds.The film starts out with Charles Foster Kane (Welles) dieing in his castle with his last words being rose bud. At a news station a reporter is assigned to find out why Kane said those as his last words so he goes to everyone that Kane knew to find out. He discovers how at an early age Kane was taken away from his family to become a big success, how in his early twenties he began to run a newspaper, how as he got older he became one of the most powerful men in the country. The reporter learns about Kane's two marriages and divorces and how he also ran to become governor. This film is about the ups and downs of a life of an extremely wealthy man, and has one of the greatest morals of any film ever.The screenplay for this film was absolutely brilliant. It is extremely intriguing how it was set up as a mystery to discover the meaning behind Kane's final words rose bud but in doing so the audience discovers the life of Kane. The characters were all extremely elaborate and realistic and the film was entertaining the whole way through. The moral is great and films these days do not have morals anymore, which is why I don't really like them as much as the ones back in the day.Welles's direction was stunning. The camera movements were absolutely outstanding, few films direction can compare with this ones. It is extremely difficult to be the lead actor and director which is why I give extreme props to Mr. Welles. One of my favorite scenes in the film is when he is making his speech to the people when he is running for governor because I really like him, but then I also like when towards the end he is destroying some of his things it really makes me able to feel the pain he is going through. Also I believe the opening scene in the film where Kane dies is one of the most iconic scenes in film history.The acting for this film is as well wonderful. Orson Welles gave the performance of a lifetime, letting me love him when he is supposed to be loved and hate him when he is supposed to be hated. Everyone else in the supporting cast such as Cotten and Comingore did a fine job, but nothing award worthy. Welles really carried the film, if he did a poor job this film would not be widely regarded as the best film ever made.The score for this film is also legendary. It really adds another layer to the film making the emotions sink in even deeper. The film is known for its revolutionary sound and again I can think of few films that use sound as well as this one.Overall I give this film a 10/10 because it is perfect in every way. I would recommend this film to anyone who wants to see great quality in a film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked this movie quite a bit. The movie starts of with an almost horrific tone. The first scene is more dark and ominous than Frankenstein. The cinematography in the movie was really interesting and used effects that I haven't seen in other movies from that time period. For instance, the movie used a lot of really low and really high camera angles, which were pretty cool. I also liked, during the scene when Thatcher was speaking to Kane's parents, how you could see Kane through the window outside playing. It was really cool because you could see how happy he was with his life the way he had it, while at the same time people were planning what would turn out to be an empty, unhappy life. I also thought that how the plot moved forward by jumping around in time through flashbacks was really cool. Everything in the film; the lighting, camera work, music, and overall atmosphere came together to make the story seem epic, which helped make the film really impacting. As depressing a movie as it is, it's really great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Rosebud by any other name?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After almost 70 years, only 38 of them during my lifetime, I decided to watch and review the legendary Citizen Kane. Orson Welles directed this classic in 1941 starring himself in the lead role of Charles Foster Kane. The film began with Kane's death in the palatial Zanadu estate he had created for himself. The final word in his last breath "Rosebud" would become the catalyst for the story line going back through Kane's life to determine the significance of the word and some purpose to how he lived his life. In the early 1940's the world was coming out of a brutal war and still recovering from the depression. The story, when taken in this context is telling the story that wealth and financial extravagance does not equal fulfillment. Kane's influence and financial status could not gain him the one thing he lost as a child; love and acceptance. Agnes Moorehead portrayed Mary Kane, Charles mother, who gave her son to the care of a Financial Adviser, Walter Thatcher (George Coulouris) who would also oversee Kane's trust. Charles Kane being plucked from his simple childhood and placed into the care of a person who considered him a commodity produces a theme of a rich child trying to right the world and gain love. In the era this movie was produced, the concept of gaining great wealth, especially as a child, would have seemed quite incredible. The fallen child star stories were not publicized at that time so the idea that wealth and influence can scar a person at that early age would not have been as prevalent. Welles took this theme and created a concept that simple family life with the love and attention of those closest was the best way to provide fulfillment to a child. Much in the same way that modern day superhero stories like Ironman and Batman portray people of great wealth and influence trying to right the wrongs in the world, Kane tries to use his wealth, newspaper, and political savvy to change the world. Unfortunately, he does this from a skewed perspective and does not turn the reflection on himself and the choices he made in relationships and in business. Kane's marriage to Susan Alexander (Dorothy Comingore) underscored the concept that money could build relationships and gain him companionship. He purchased singing lessons, promoted her singing abilities, and even build an opera house for her to perform. Still, his search for love failed as he tried to buy her affections. In the end, when she did leave him, it broke him and seemed to make him realize that the one thing he longed for was kept out of reach simply because he didn't know how to love. When looking at the era, the message for me seemed to take on a new meaning. Today, the theme doesn't seem terribly unique and the grandeur of the sets is not to be compared to current day CGI. Still, there is a haunting message that has resonated due to Welles' telling of the story. The careful placement of mirrors when Kane is walking through Zanadu and harsh lighting techniques utilized as he nears the end of his life, give perspective to what Welles was trying to say all along, that money can't buy love. As I watched this movie, the beautiful direction and cinematography really moved me as an artist. I not only understood what Welles was trying to say but could appreciate the careful and intricate way he said it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is considered one of the best movies ever?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Citizen Kane' is often regarded as one of the all time greatest films. But is it all that great? Of course, that is very subjective, but for me the answer is no. Considering all the hype around this movie, I expected something far better. That said, the movie isn't bad and it's an important film. Directed by and starring Orson Welles as the title character (a wealthy newspaper publisher whose life is the subject of the motion picture), it is a movie with many innovations.For example, Orson Welles (who was an unproved director at the time) was given the choice to develop his own story, select his own cast/crew and was given final cut privilege. The screenplay, however, was developed with the help of Herman Mankiewicz. This film created a new style of film-making by studying various forms of movie making and combining them all into one. The advanced cinematography is notorious in many levels: the extended use of deep focus, the peculiar way how low-angle shots were made, the use of an optical printer whenever a deep focus was not possible, the special effects, the nice scenarios, the in-camera effects and flashbacks, etc. Even the ending is different compared with other films. Ya see, after the words "The End", the following text appears: «Most of the principal actors in "CITIZEN KANE" are new to motion pictures. The Mercury Theatre is proud to introduce them».The plot is a "roman ? clef" that examines the life and legacy of Charles Foster Kane. It starts with this death, which causes great impact around the world. Kane's story is narrated principally through numerous flashbacks, from his childhood in poverty until adulthood (with money and power, as well as all the negative consequences it carries). The Xanadu estate is fictional, but in real life a city named Xanadu exists. The cast is interesting. Orson Welles is great as Charles Foster Kane, Buddy Swan as Kane when he was 8 years old and Paul Stewart as Raymond. It was nice to see Paul Stewart in this, too bad that only happens in the final part of the movie. Paul Stewart starred some years later in 'The Window' as the character Joe Kellerson. I think that this movie starts off interesting but then it becomes boring and loses its interest. There were also things I didn't properly understand, such as all the "Rosebud" talking.To conclude my review, I liked the cinematography but the plot and the movie itself were not quite what I expected.</fullReview>

I could go on for an hour about the camera work, the acting, the angles, lighting and dialog but that has been done ad nauseum. Simply put, this movie achieves a level of quality and depth that few films have ever come close to. Welles is at the height of his genius and his acting is amazing.

		<fullReview>"Citizen Kane" is truly fantastic. It is understandable why film critics often cite this as the best movie of all time. The way the story is told is particularly interesting. The story is a mesh of other people's point of view. It makes Kane's life a sort of puzzle that the audience tries to piece together. Kane is a very complicated and enigmatic man so the puzzle seems to be a never-ending one. I am not quite sure if Kane being based on a real life person (the famed publisher: Hearst) adds or detracts from the story. It is definitely worth mentioning though.Orson Welles' direction takes us on a never-ending cinematic roller-coaster. It seems as if every technique in the book is crammed together. If you want a lesson in direction, watch this movie. Welles also works actively with both the foreground and background, creating a rich scene. All layers of this film remain in focus and a lack of cuts showcases just how fluid the camera is. Low-angle shots often make ceilings the backdrop. This is a rather strange and unique technique that is nonetheless interesting.The cinematography is excellent but it is really the story that sticks with you. Kane realizes in the end that he became everything he set out not to be. "Citizen Kane" shows us the evolution of childhood innocence to the sobering reality that experience leaves you with. Whether or not Kane is a monster is for you to decide.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great American Work of Art</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Citizen Kane {dir Orson Welles, 1941}****/****Orson Welles's Citizen Kane has been heralded far and wide as the greatest film ever made. It tops lists released by such reputable establishments as Sight and Sound Magazine and the American Film Institute. Are these showers of praise justified? Who is to say really. The power of Kane lies not with it stature as "best" anything. It is simply a great American work of art, a cornerstone of popular culture and cinematic craft, a landmark and a classic film. Do not allow those highfalutin descriptions in anyway discourage you from seeing the film. Contrary to what some believe, the film is more than an exercise of style over substance. It is a groundbreaking technical exercise and a sparkling entertainment. That delicate balance between art can best be attributed to producer/writer/director/star Orson Welles, who in his first film uses every visual trick he and cinematographer Gregg Toland can muster (at one point Welles even resorts to making shadow puppets). All the craftsmanship in the world would never be able to take the place of an intriguing story. Welles and his co-writer Herman J. Mankiewicz constructed a doozy, a fascinating portrait of a man of almost mythical power. This is the rare film to explore the personality of a tycoon like Kane. Both the performance and the character are wonderfully fleshed out. Charles Foster Kane is charming, tyrannical, lovable, loathsome, yet always distant and enigmatic. That last trait, Kane as an enigma, is a stroke of genius on the film's part. For all the details the film gives us regarding Kane's life, it never supposes that we can draw any final conclusions about the man and his motives. In his portrait of an American dream gone wrong, Welles leaves us with a startling fact: No one man's life can be reduced and crystallized into two hours worth of celluloid. Welles is at once seems to capture a wide breadth of human experience, while also acknowledging that the scenes before as a merely a small part of the whole. But what a joy these small parts are. We are treated to watching Kane's rise and fall beginning as a dashing young turk signing his well-intentioned Declaration of Principles, to a megalomaniacal recluse, living alone in his castle full of useless treasures. Kane's descent is brilliantly visualized. He is consistently shot from a low angle, yet this seemingly dominating stature is increasingly put into a more ironic context. We watch his power wither into desperation.Yet, even in the end, the film never loses Welles's winking sense of humor. With the final reveal of the origin of the term "Rosebud" (the film's central MacGuffin, as Hitchcock would call it) one can imagine Welles (the consummate magician) exclaiming "Taa-daa!" with a grand theatrical gesture of the hand. For with this film, Welles establishes himself as the masterful magician of light and shadow. Yet despite all of the light Welles brings, Kane remains a figure of mystery, and a fascinating character. It is that central element of fascination that keeps so many film goers returning to Citizen Kane again and again. That may not be "best", but its not far off.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It is not the ninth wonder of the world</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Citizen Kane is in all the lists of the bests, according to many critics and audiences also, it is the greatest film of all time, because probably, technically or in other words, in terms of direction, it progressed cinema. However, I believe that it should be evaluated as a film, I mean above style, content and story. Citizen Kane is a good classic, yes its direction was beyond its time by far, but nothing more. It is an interesting biography of a newspaper businessman, an interesting work, but nothing more. And as I see, critics love this film more than us, because as said, they try to evaluate it in a objective way, it promoted cinema, so a masterpiece. Orson Welles's not only Citizen Kane was beyond its time, there are some other examples, especially, the story editing of Kane is beyond its time, brilliant (the story telling method used in the movie is not similar with any movie you have ever seen, from a picture projector, Kane's life is summarized!), but generally, as a film, it is just good, a plain movie. By the way, the people who see it the greatest don't explain why it is the greatest. Because, they cannot find any reason? The film is stylish visually and in contrast with a lot of people, I forget rosebud completely while watching the movie, because it swept me away. It is not the ninth wonder of the world. The eight wonder of the world was King Kong movie and almost it was in adventure genre. I am very happy that this is not 1st in IMDb Top 250.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Citizen Kane review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie gives the feeling of being thoroughly designed and structured. In a number of situations such meticulous fore thought suffocates a film, having no space for the cast to breathe. But Orsen Welles (director), with his great skill and actor ability, smoothly side-steps this trap. By creating characters which are inconsistent, but yet interesting, Welles gives the gifted cast roles to elaborate on and run with. The dialog, sometimes first-person and sometimes voice-over, is humorous, convincing, clever and well-structured. Plus the plot of the movie never gets lost at any point. In addition, the script is exactly to the point saying what needs to be said. A further neat point is that sentences tend to overlap as people argue and struggle to get their point across, just like in real life. Orson Welles' Citizen Kane is a movie of recommendation and will never disappoint.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Is this the greatest film of all time? No, but it is certainly one of the greatest, an audacious film debut for boy genius Welles. In fact, Welles perhaps goes a little overboard with his showy camera angles and juxtapositioning of lights and shadows. This is such a groundbreaking film, however, that he can be forgiven for his excesses. Toland's magnificent deep-focus cinematography adds to the visual elegance of the film. Welles does fine in the title role, although he was never a great actor. Cotten is terrific as one of Kane's friends, particularly in his scenes as an old man. Despite all its greatness, however, it is a film to be admired rather than loved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A parable for Our Time...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One need only look around at the unbelievable number of boneheads on illegally monopolized cable "news" channels to draw some very clear parallels between the "Kane" of Old and you-know-who of New. Orson Welles may or may not have been sounding a warning back in 1941, but hindsight would certainly suggest as much. Granted, the monopolization of "The Fourth Estate" may be almost incidental to the goings-on in CITIZEN KANE, but it's there and clearly delineated. Illiteracy has skyrocketed in this country over the past four decades, going hand in hand (not uncoincidentally) with the rise of television viewing- and, by controlling television (as per George Orwell), we've seen- and continue to see- the "re-imagining" of History. It's proving difficult to shake the parasites loose, too, because they've so entrenched themselves in the guts of the mass media that their eventual (but inevitable) departure will leave a gaping hole in our national psyche. The end result of 40 years of two-faced Politics (and complicit lying by the boneheads who've bowed and scraped for so long at the feet of they mastas that they no longer know how to stand upright) leaves one feeling more than a little left out in the cold. Never trust them again- no matter what means they use to try to reach you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>KANE is a movie of Shakespearian beauty and depth. Its beauty is an intelligible one; I must humbly admit it took me several viewings, much reflection, etc.,to be able to taste it. KANE is like STALKER, like AMBERSONS, etc.?it teaches us that the first impression is crap, is nothing. What should I say about its impressive style, where everything is needed, necessary, useful, functional. There's nothing better; each shot is absolutely functional, each device is needed ,and required by the story. Nothing is formalistic, empty. It is the very opposite of Tarantino, who is made entirely of abundant unnecessary tricks and devices and stylistic gizmo's. The boss picked by Welles to be portrayed in KANE is uninteresting; Kane is of perennial importance. I know no other movie more richly and subtly thought and, in a superior sense, crafted. Missing KANE is missing what is best in cinema. This movie will never be equaled. What heartbreaking beauty! Mme. Kael defined KANE as an exuberant, muckraking attack on an archetypal economic baron;this is prettily vague. Anyway, taken with the necessary qualifications, Mme. Kael's definition is blatantly false and misconstrued. If Hearst would have been other than an economic leader, a boss, he would have felt flattered by Welles' portrayal?to such a degree is Welles' approach purely Shakespearian in vigor ,health, richness and concision. (One might nonetheless argue that Mme. Kael spoke about exuberance; she did, but I do not think that she meant the Shakespeareian one!) .In KANE, the wonders are of all kinds. There is no other movie equally rich, dense and stylistically exemplary and flawless. Each frame, each angle has a character of inner necessity and truth. KANE is not a pamphlet against a capitalist boss. It is an impressionistic, cognitively mature take on the human heart and its meanderings. The vitriol of Hollywoodian indiscretions is what has already perished, vanished. Welles went undoubtedly much, much beyond that. It is even less a myth; it is poetry and realism. A strictly functional style. The style, the morphology are strictly subordinated to their function. (The opposite example, the textbook example of style over content is GODFATHER.)In KANE, one has as much content as he has style; the content is always served by the style.And what performances!What a superior wit!What a pure, unblemished art!This is realism; this is superlative realism. The richest representation of life, in cinema, that I am aware of. Balzac would not have written this script better. Some lines gave chills to Averty. A better thing will never be written. This Shakespearian dramatic edge has nothing to do with the supposed pamphlet. The best thing made in cinema's art till now. To give trite epithets to Welles' directing would mean being vulgar. Centuries will pass, cultures will succeed one another?KANE will endure. In each generation, a small elite is able to taste KANE; be a part of it!I did not like it the first time; even less I understood it. I only began to feel it, on the second viewing, after many years. Kane was cinema's great shot at the noblest poetry. Kane has more to do with Shakespeare, than with any real?life businessman. It's sad many perceive in it but the most exterior appeal?the satire.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"It isn't enough to tell us what a man did, you've got to tell us who he was"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Citizen Kane ? one of the most acclaimed features of motion picture industry. Today, it's perhaps the most beloved film of those within the industry itself, topping the Sight and Sound directors' and critics' poll as well as AFI's 100 years, 100 movies list. But as with many a great and pioneering feature film it is also surrounded by a great deal of myth and misconception.For me, the biggest misattribution regarding Citizen Kane is that it was highly innovative ? a revolution in film history. It isn't ? it's really more of a return to form. Many of the things that make Citizen Kane stand out actually hark back to the silent era. Perhaps this is not surprising given Orson Welles' unique position ? a talented young man who had already proved himself in several other fields, hastily teaching himself the basics of film-making and then putting together a very individual yet finely crafted picture. Given all this, it makes sense that Welles is in many ways like those early pioneers of film who were creating cinematic styles for the first time without previous generation of filmmakers to be influenced by.Take first of all Welles' independence. Welles is now looked back on as the ultimate director's director, bucking the studio system and controlling every aspect of production. This however was a freedom enjoyed by many silent directors, before the studios had consolidated their power, and the film-making process was a lot quicker and simpler. However, Welles' evasion of studio influence was significant, coming as it did at a time when the studio system was at the height of its dominance.Now let's look at Welles' style as a director. The first thing that hits you when you start watching Kane is the rhythm ? first how we home smoothly and eerily in upon the Kane mansion, how the images dovetail into one other, and then the startling change of pace with the "News On The March" segment. Ironically, even though it's a good mock-up of a straightforward newsreel, this is actually one of the most tightly constructed and cinematic sequences in the entire film. It's not just a rhythmic editing pattern, but each shot "agrees" with the one before and after it, the pace and style of the movement in each shot gives a consistent flow to the whole thing. This sense of rhythm harks back to earliest days of film ? Melies is probably the first to use it, and Griffith and Eisenstein developed it, but an overt sense of rhythm declined with the coming of sound, with a few notable exceptions such as Busby Berkely musicals and Disney cartoons. What is really great in Kane is how the pace of the picture is carried through into Orson Welles' acting ? you can see he is totally sensitive to the rhythm of his own work with every move he makes.In a similar vein, Citizen Kane also represents a return of expressionism in film, that is the externalisation of ideas and feelings through technique and symbolism. Not that expressionism ever totally died out, but Kane is constantly and overtly expressionistic, almost as much as the silent films of Murnau and Hitchcock, with moody lighting in sombre scenes, high and low angles, massive distances between characters to demonstrate emotional detachment, the pelting rain when we first encounter the middle-aged Susan Alexander and so forth. Of course this is another reason why Kane is a director's favourite ? touches like this are the chances for directors to express themselves and create something more than simply shooting a script. All this is sometimes a little overdone in Kane ? often the hallmark of a young director ? and the continual dollying in and out on headlines and ridiculously low angles can get a bit tiresome. Welles was to direct with more subtlety in his later features.One area in which Citizen Kane does seem to be genuinely revolutionary, and perhaps the area in which it had the most influence, is in its creation of the modern biopic. Granted, it's perhaps not a true biopic because Kane is a fictional character (albeit one based on real figures), but the structure of revealing his story ? beginning with the public image of the person at the end of their life, then telling their true story, warts and all, as a flashback, humanising them in the process ? was the basis for Lawrence of Arabia, Gandhi and virtually every other biopic of the last forty years. It's often stated that Welles was ahead of his time, and it was a long time before Citizen Kane's influence could be felt. One director/writer team however, were more on the ball ? Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger's The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp (1943) bears many similarities to Kane, taking a distant, un-heroic figure and turning him into a real and sympathetic person.Citizen Kane is still in itself a unique and captivating picture, very clearly the product of someone who was never classically trained ? as it were ? in film-making but who had a natural feel for it all the same. It's not a perfect film, as some have claimed, but it's a satisfying, well crafted (not to forget brilliantly acted) piece of cinema, well deserving of praise and attention.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Short Intoduction on How to Watch Citizen Kane</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is considered by many to be the greatest film ever made. Maybe you've already heard that. It stands atop the AFI (American Film Institute) top 100 movies list, which is a list of American and English language films. More importantly, it stands atop Sight and Sound's list, which is sponsored by the BFI (British Film Institute) but includes critics and directors from all over the world and is all inclusive. So, with such credentials it is a little intimidating to watch for the first time. The best way, perhaps, is to forget that you're supposed to get something out of the experience and just sit back and enjoy watching one of the old classics.Much, much has been written about this movie. Perhaps too much to the point where some people actually avoid it like the plague. But forget about any of the hype when watching it. If you're not fortunate enough to be close to a revival house, then do some of the things you do when watching any other movie. Pop some popcorn, get a box of jujube's or cracker jacks. Keep within your usual routine because this is just another movie. Enjoy Gregg Toland's startling cinematography without trying to analyze it. Many people have stated that the first time they saw Citizen Kane they were disappointed. That's a shame, because it really is entertaining, and much of the fun is the way Welles and Toland tell us the story.This movie was one of the first movies I ever purchased for my brand new Betamax (age giveaway) which was also the first time I saw it. Luckily I wasn't burdened by a lot of film theory. I had heard that this film was good. I was amazed by it, and it is one of those experiences I credit for becoming a film junkie (some of the others being North by Northwest, Seven Samurai, The African Queen, The Wizard of Oz, Contempt, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, Bringing Up Baby, etc.). So, to review: 1. Keep Ordinary Routines Intact; 2. Sit Back; 3. Relax; 4. Don't Be Troubled By It's Monumental Reputation and; 5. Most Importantly Remember That It's Only A Movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The great directors of today still steal from Welles' masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**** out of **** starsWhen I finally watched Kane for the very first time a few weeks back, it fiercely occurred to me how much has been honorably stolen from this enigmatic masterpiece. Take the flashback scene of little boy Kane in the snow, for instance; the overlapping dialouge and Gregg Toland's deep-focus cinematography reminded me of an ingredient Spielberg has used time and time again (Minority Report, Schindler's List). Welles' nod to the classic "March of Time" newsreels in the beginning of the film, brought to mind the pseudo-documentary stylings of Oliver Stone's JFK and Nixon. Scorcese is there too; the jagged scene shifting and pacing. Moments of stillness and silence prompted me to think of Coppolla's Godfather films. Citizen Kane remains the number one film of all time because of these homages. Newer films that are also bathed in genius will never dethrone this predecessor, because all the wonderful artistry they contain has already been consummated in Kane.Welles, being only 25 at the time of this film's creation, is flooring. The little boy to salty-old-man passage of Charles Foster Kane's lifetime, along with his strange and extensive friendships and romances, are experiences that should seemingly be understood by a man much older than Orson was in 1941. Simply put, an artist ahead of his time made a movie ahead of it's time, and the aftershocks of Kane's greatness are still felt today.I believe those of us that expected Rosebud to become something specific or tangible or touchable, missed the heartbeat of Citizen Kane. Rosebud is Kane's soul, his lost innocence, his antiquated beauty. Rosebud is in all of us, or once was. What Welles did was tell a story about the human condition; the dream of something blindingly pure that is in all of us. He used film-making as a megaphone to scream and whisper to our exceedingly similar human sensibilities. Sometimes it's hard to comprehend the megaphone, but that's what makes Kane so great. Orson Welles understood, at his very young age, that all of us can often feel very alone, and that we need something sacred to rely on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Hugely Boastful Celebration of Style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Citizen Kane is a film that has a lot of unprecedented stylistic freedom in terms of the time in which it was made, and that would of course cause an impact upon release. Orson Welles worked in radio and theatre. He was not practiced in film. This was his first. But all the imagination and passion he had in creating images on radio and in his mind were depicted as ambitiously as they could be in Citizen Kane. It begins with a news reel, then with a scene with several men wherein we never see their faces, but their silhouettes. We see points of view from inside a snow dome and cranking in on us through solid objects like windows and screens and people. Kane has something a lot of movies, even great ones, don't have, and that's raw vision. Raw vision is great, because it's entirely personal.The problem is that Welles made such an overwhelming effort to announce his presence both in front of the camera and behind it that the film's story is of secondary importance, subordinated by his main concern which is how differently it is told. I speak objectively, I believe, as I did not live during a generation that was so directly impacted by the film's revisioning of cinema. I am accustomed to films by directors who did and in turn managed to heavily influence mine. I find its widely hailed position as the #1 greatest movie of all time to be the most grandiose excess of praise of which I can readily think. There are many scores of movies from the 1940s that hold up much better over time. That is not to say that Kane is corny or archaic by today's standards but that the vulnerability of unused audiences to being blindsided by its style and ambition is much less perceptible. I must not be in such a small group who sees the tremendous self-importance and braggadocio exclusively exuded by Welles.Are you not the biggest ham in the world if you make a film debut as a writer/director who casts himself in the role of extremely rich tycoon Charles Foster Kane who dies in his gaping mammoth mansion Xanadu, before which uttering his last word which reporters and producers obsess over trying to understand?Welles is extraordinarily smug and narcissistic, but he does very much know himself, because Kane is really not so much written with William Randolph Hearst in mind as he is with Welles himself in mind, and his life came to eerily resemble Kane's.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being relatively young, my real interest in great films began only a couple of years ago, and ever since my interest sprouted, I have heard the title "Citizen Kane" thrown around as the greatest movie ever made. Is it really? I had to find out."Kane" opens as newspaper tycoon Charles Kane utters his last word "Rosebud," dropping a snow globe on to the floor. This cryptic death launches an investigation by a young reporter into what "rosebud" is. As the reporter travels around and interviews significant people in Charlie's life, we find out more and more about the man through flashbacks of the interviewees. There's an air of mystery all throughout the film, being that we know no more than the reporter.The performances in "Kane" are all stellar, especially Orson Welles's memorable turn as Kane himself.He rules the picture with his commanding and realistic performance. The acting is also well showcased by an extraordinary achievement in cinematography. Though the film is not done in color, the background and lighting provides more emotion and mystery than almost any color film to date.So, is "Citizen Kane" the greatest film of all time? I'm not sure, but it's certainly one of my favorites. It's a tremendous story of love, lust, power, corruption, greed, and rosebud. Still, what really makes this film stand out is that Welles cleverly gives us hints to the truth of the mystery of the film all throughout, and the "twist" ending is sure to send chills down your spine. See it for the acting, see it for the technical aspects, or see it to see if it really is the greatest of all time. Just see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the early '70s Citizen Kane became the darling of some NYU film addict class instructors for reasons that defy logic. They wrote papers and articles and that caused a lot of shallow folks to come aboard on the film. However closely examined the movie is greatly overrated. The script is not really one of Herman J. Mankiewicz's best works, albeit Mankiewicz was a superb screenwriter. (Dinner at Eight, Wizard of Oz, Pride of the Yankees, etc)The "groundbreaking" camera angles, for example, that are credited to Orson Welles (who was only 25 when he produce-directed it) should really be credited to Gregg Toland the DP on the film. However, Toland, it should be noted, was a student of the early German silent screen where many of the "groundbreaking" camera angles could be seen two decades before Citizen Kane. In fact, before Toland invited Welles over to his home to teach him the camera and how it's used (days before primary shooting) Welles scarcely knew which end of the camera took light.</fullReview>

But the other day I saw it on sale in HMV so I got it and there's only one word to describe it; wow! Everything about the film is magnificent, the cinematography is as inspirational as that in Once Upon a Time in the West, Welles acting as Kane is superb and that one question on everyones mind, what is rosebud? The mysterious opening scene slowly panning into Kane's mansion is one of the most famous scenes in history, Kane dropping his globe and uttering that last word "rosebud." The movie shows how this man turns from a young and rich media superstar to an aging, bloated divorcée who - in the film's most powerful scene - tears down his room finally realizing that money means nothing without love or friendship. The message it sends is so clear and beautiful that I would completely agree that Citizen Kane is one of the greatest films ever made. I was expecting to see a pretentious ,boring film and ended up finding my true love, Citizen Kane is the movie to end all movies.Verdict: An absolute must see, if you want some of the most moving and powerful two hours of your life, watch Citizen Kane</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Young Man's Audacious, Precocious and Fully Realized Cinematic Vision</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Laying claim to being the greatest movie ever made is bound to attract extensive essays from cineastes dismantling the film every which way ad infinitum. Suffice it to say that Orson Welles' first-time effort as a filmmaker remains an astonishing and often unparalleled work. Only 25 years old at the time, he provides an audacious vision in which all the parts of this 1941 masterpiece fit perfectly together with a furious precision. Moreover, there is a consistently precocious tone throughout that a more veteran director could not possibly capture, and this is what makes the film truly unique. It manifests itself in several complementary ways, whether it's the groundbreaking deep-focus cinematography of Gregg Toland, or the propulsive editing by Welles and future director Robert Wise, or the involving whodunit quality of Welles' and Herman Mankiewicz's sharp screenplay, or the meaty performances of a then-unknown cast of stage actors. The beauty of the film comes from the simple fact that no single component dominates the other.The result is as cohesive a vision as has likely been seen on screen and one that Welles was never able to recapture for the rest of his life no matter how hard he tried. The film examines the life of a William Randolph Hearst doppelganger named Charles Foster Kane, a newspaper publisher who has amassed a fortune and more than a few enemies. The plot revolves around the mysterious utterance of "Rosebud" as Kane's dying words and how an investigative reporter interviews the people in Kane's life to find out the hidden meaning of that word. The interviews provide the means for selective flashbacks to his lonely childhood, his beginnings as a yellow journalist in building a publishing empire with closest confidante Jedidiah Leland, his first marriage to wealthy socialite Emily Norton, his scandal-laden run for governor, his obsession in turning second wife Susan Alexander into a world-class opera singer, and his sad decline at his isolated mountaintop estate, Xanadu.The film combines a first-rate detective story with a classic tragedy about wealth and power and the inevitable ruin that comes from Kane's unrelenting self-absorption. It is startling how convincing Welles is as an aging magnate, and his naturally larger-than-life persona fits nicely into the Shakespearean contours of the character. The cast consists entirely of his Mercury Theater troupe with Joseph Cotten a particular standout as Leland. I always found Dorothy Comingore a bit too cartoonish as Susan, the character inspired by real-life movie star Marion Davies, Hearst's long-time mistress, but more subtle turns by Agnes Moorehead as Kane's mother and Ruth Warrick as Emily more than compensate.The 60th Anniversary, two-disc DVD set has enough material to please Kane aficionados beginning with two separate but equally valuable commentary tracks, one by director and Welles confidante Peter Bogdanovich and the other by film critic Roger Ebert. Bogdanovich is more academic in his approach even though he had the personal relationship with Welles, while Ebert can barely contain his enthusiasm with each scene he describes. The first disc also contains the original trailer, a brief newsreel of the film's New York premiere and three sections of intriguing material focusing on the production, post-production and the press book. The second disc contains a fascinating 1996 documentary feature, "The Battle Over Citizen Kane", which focuses on Hearst's attempts to ruin the film. To put it mildly, this DVD set reflects essential viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many say this is the greatest film of all time. I don't know. It's such a personal comment that I don't believe even a modest consensus can be reached. That said, there is no disputing that this is one of the most influential projects ever done. Having read some books about Orson Welles, I still don't understand, other than having as strong a personality as is possible, how he had the film knowledge and vision that went into this masterpiece, on his first try. There are hundreds of stunning shots. The camera and what it does is enough to carry the film. The editing take us from place to place in a heartbeat. the characters are pithy and interesting, especially Kane. Then there's the William Randolph Hearst thing that is going on in the background. We see power; we see power corrupting. We see love of self contrasted with love of others. We see the oppressive cloud of loneliness descend upon the powerful. Wealth versus happiness. Which is, of course, the overriding theme. If anyone doubts the effectiveness of black and white cinematography, just watch five minutes of this film. More can be done with a few shadows than a full palette of colors.I first saw this film in college. We had a new student union which had a nice little theater in it. I had heard of the film, but this was pre-rental, pre VCR, so if one were to see such a film, you had to simply wait. Even television tended to avoid this as too artsy. I sat at the screening. There were a couple of football players in the audience (I could tell by their jackets). I remember being mystified and confused and wanting to see the film again. It took about five years until it showed up on television and, even though there were about 60 commercials, I still enjoyed it. When I got my first VCR, it was the first movie I rented. What a trip. Anyway, as we left the theater, one of the football players said to the other, "Well that was the biggest pile of crap I've ever seen." This just reaffirmed that it was a great film. I'm sure that most average film-goers are not willing to put in the effort to get the most out of this film. That's their prerogative. I've often hated pretentious films that others have clucked their tongues about. If you look at my reviews of movies like "Attack of the Crab Monsters" you will see I am not a film snob, but this is one great movie and I hope everyone gets to see it before they go down that last hill in that little red sled.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Rosebud..." A single word that will echo throughout the history of the motion picture and beyond. No film deserves more credit to the craft of film-making than Kane. Its ideas and groundbreaking achievements were so revolutionary that much of its majesty wasn't fully realized for over a generation. Time manipulation rip roars back and forth, up and down, diagonally and horizontally, like a thousand puzzle pieces scattered over the floor, until by the end of the film everything fits together to create a masterpiece.Kane is a picture of insane genius. It was not potentially realized for its time and is eerily modern for today. This is a film that not only stands the test of time but grows with it.Amateur to novice movie goers will not be able to fully appreciate the innovative film language it created. Many disregard it because they believe that a film from over a half century ago could not possibly relate to them or be entertaining or (just because the 'snobby' film scholars view it as one of the greatest) they don't want to like it to go against their view of the critical consensus of being out of touch with the general public. If someone told me to see this film because it was the greatest I would be inadvertently critical of it myself. My advise for anyone seeing this film for the first time would be to keep an open mind before viewing. You have probably heard from various publications, scholars etc. that this is one of the greatest if not the greatest film of all time. See this film to discover what it means to you personally.The joy of viewing a legendary film is to discover its greatness according to your own terms.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This IsThe Most Important Film Ever Made, And Here's Why</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Arguably the greatest of American films, Orson Welles's 1941 masterpiece, made when he was only 26. Plot: Citizen Kane still unfurls like a dream and carries the viewer along the mysterious currents of time and memory to reach a mature (if ambiguous) conclusion: people are the sum of their contradictions, and can't be known easily. Welles plays newspaper magnate Charles Foster Kane, taken from his mother as a boy and made the ward of a rich industrialist. The result is that every well-meaning or tyrannical or self-destructive move he makes for the rest of his life appears in some way to be a reaction to that deeply wounding event. And in the end when everyone suspects that "Rosebud" is something Kane wanted and never had, or something he had lost along with everything else, the irony is there, as they give up by saying that a man's life cannot be described in one word. Even though "Rosebud" is the very name of the sleigh he had as a boy when he lived with his mother as a boy, and is the only thing he took with him, "Rosebud" was always in his mind reminding of the event as he made moves through his life that would react to this deeply wounding event. And the scene of the men burning "Rosebud" in the fire is breathtraking, leading you to the conclusion that the answer they were looking for to Kane's life was right there but destroyed by choice as it was for Kane. THe movie is breathtaking and may not be or be the best movie in history, it's your choice, i personally think that it is at the top, if not, the top. But I personally love Vertigo, read my review for Vertigo also, it has so many ingredients to project what we call the best picture in cinematic history, while Citizen Kane falls short to me, somewhere, although I can't place my finger on it and what it's missing. I think it's just the genre and how Vertigo's thrilling aspects interest me, but this is undoubtedly the most important film in all of history, rent, or better yet, buy the two-disc set, featuring an amazing documentary on disc two, which was nominated in 1995, for best documentary, by the Academy. And then you will understand this review completely, thank you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wells has fooled the public again or not? Wells is a brilliant director and actor. In this movie, he has masterly used a movie plot to weave a puzzle. The answer to the puzzle is revealed at the end of the movie. You either catch the answer to the mystery of Rosebud, or you are left an idiot as so many others apparently have who have reviewed this movie on this site. Rosebud is mentioned throughout the movie and it is only logical to find out what Rosebud is. TO UNDERSTAND CITIZEN KANE.. FIND OUT WHAT ROSEBUD IS!!!!Rosebud is magic, innocense, and power. Without Rosebud, this movie is perhaps a flop.. and this, is what Wells did-to you the viewer.. you the public.. because.. Wells is.. a mysterious (War of the Worlds) artist.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the movie has so much depth that you have to swim up for air</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Citizen KaneThe camera passes over a NO TRESPASSING sign into a dark landscape where it doesn't belong, full of ominous statues and iron bars. Then, up rises before the camera a dark and looming castle, and only one light is lit, until it flickers and goes out. The only life in this giant monument of man is a feeble old man holding an old snow globe. He whispers with his last breath, `Rosebud', and then dies. Out of his limp hand falls his snow globe to where it shatters on the marble floor.With these opening shots, these pieces of art, the whole movie of Citizen Kane was laid out before the audience without them even knowing it. Orson Welles (Director, Producer, Charles Foster Kane) paints beautiful pictures with the camera that are so deep that you'll have to swim up for air. The lighting, the photography, the writing, it all comes together in this masterpiece to create so much depth and meaning. The genius of this film deserves much reflection to see a window into its full meaning. At second a glance, all of its mystery is still not seen, just like Charles Foster Kane's life in the film. Even if you fail to see most of his visual metaphors, just the taste of Welles' wonder is rewarding enough.Each set of the movie, (the spiral stair that symbolizes Kane's destruction, the long table separating Kane and his first wife much like the growing distance in their relationship, the large rooms Kane and his second wife lived in that symbolized their boredom and hollowness inside) captures the mood that it set out to accomplish. The lighting also expresses moods with shadows swallowing up Kane while he's going through a dark time, or making a large silhouette when he was on top of the world. And Mr. Welles achieved all of this visual mastery while experimenting with new, revolutionary techniques in lighting and photography, making this film truly unique and beautiful.And what would a film be without the actors who play in it. They were all very real in the parts that they played, but none of the acting was very show stopping. The believability in the characters was all there when they delivered lines like, `Everything was [Kane's] idea, except for my leaving him.', or, `That's why [Kane] went into politics. We weren't enough, he wanted all the voters to love him too.', but the movie didn't call for any one character to carry the movie. It didn't need to. All the aspects of the film, the lighting, photography, editing, sets, acting, they came together and worked as a team to create Orson's masterpiece. This is a true testament to Orson Welles' great direction of `Citizen Kane'.`Citizen Kane' was original like all great creations are. It played to its strengths in technique and Orson was able to blend all aspects of the film beautifully, like an artist mixing paint. Each stroke of his brush was calculated and meaningful. My IQ raised a few points just from watching the movie. Concentration was needed to stay focused on the screen though, so I gave this film an A-, and recommend that it be hung in an art gallery rather then on a movie shelf.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wealthy, passive rich man shows no true colors other than green.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Looked at by a younger crowd, certain special effects shown in "Citizen Kane" are next to nothing. If it is looked at by a somewhat different view, and acceptance of the time period, its classic aspect shows through. Beginning and ending at the final scene, the movie explores themes of: love, loneliness, greed, and an outspoken man from the perspectives of those around him.The intensity of the piece is displayed with a single word and shown in its significance at Xanadu, Kane's mansion, lonely and unfinished. Married, yet still alone, Kane may be perceived as a man who just had a lot of money, with no real place to put it. Truth being that Kane's wealth overlooks the longing for compassion. By giving away bought material, and longing for actual feeling in return, Kane finds himself in near desperation.The movie shows a boys with anticipating potential, turned suddenly and against his will into a man with little talents other than stealing coworkers and accepting a bad reputation. After ridiculously spontaneous engagements, and empty friendships, Kane is even more reduced to an unfinished Xanadu and impartial servants. "Citizen Kane" is a man who claimed himself to be an American. With all the profits and capitalism and uneducated spending, it's a perfect title.Loosely based on the life of William Randolph Hearst, "Citizen Kane" is a good motion picture that wouldn't be a waste of time to see. On a scale of one to ten (ten being the best) "Citizen Kane" rates an eight. High in wealth and low in social standings, Charles Kane is viewed from many angels: by the camera, and by viewers.</fullReview>

Film techniques were pioneered that can be viewed over and over without losing their spectacle or artistry. The film was obviously ahead of its time, not well received or understood in it's initial release. Over time, the appreciation and impact of this film has grown and grown.

		<fullReview>The negative reviews here are symptoms of the age: Value as measured by the capacity to entertain, or more broadly, value as measured by utility. But Citizen Kane is not about entertainment or utility; it's about art, a profound exploration of the human condition. The negative reviews say everything about the reviewers and nothing about Citizen Kane; namely, they're a testament to their poor taste and overall flawed aesthetic judgment. It's funny that they think that they're being somehow revolutionary with these reviews when in fact they merely reveal their own common, plebian tastes. Notice the movies one of the negative reviewers lists: The Godfather, Schindler's List, Memento, Psycho, It's a Wonderful Life - all classics save one - the common denominator being that they all contain either loud crashes, loud blasts, screaming, speed, physical assaults etc. etc. This is totally consistent with the modern pop-sensibility which has no taste for anything quiet, though it's precisely in the softest whispers of our lives where the deepest profundity is found. Such a person, of course, would have no use for such quiet, slow moving classics as Persona, Wild Strawberries, The Seventh Seal, or Elvira Madigan - but would certainly consider the nihilistic likes of Kill Bill to be an instant masterpiece. (Quentin Tarantino: The most overrated director around. Nothing but a cheap, pandering nihilist. A friend of mine recently asserted that Pulp Fiction is the most important film of the '90s. This is true only as far as Pulp Fiction serves as a diagnostic tool for the physician of culture: It says everything about the 90s and little about the actual merits of Pulp Fiction)."The shallow mind is concerned only with utility." -Aristotle</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*POSSIBLE SPOLIERS*From day one, everyone hears all of the hype of this particular movie. "Classic" is the word alot of people use to describe it, and that word usually scares me away from a film as that usually goes hand and hand with "boring", i mean, the bulk of classics are good films, don't get me wrong, but, i don't usually go out of my way to see them because they just move so slow, some of the techniques aren't as interesting as they were back in the day and the stories themselves can become very easily dated. This movie doesn't do any of that, in fact, even though it's 62 years old now, it still has an incredibly modern feel to it.There is in fact only one flaw that i have noticed, and that is at the very begining where they are showing shots of the outside of his manor and it is quite apperent that there are backdrops, but, you must remember that this was on a super tight budget over 6 decads ago. Besides that, the film is flawless. It tells the story of a man who was able to haev an extrodinary life and still not be able to be happy with it. This film is the kind of movie that inspires people to become film makers, as it uplifts without being cheesy, shocks without swearing or bloog or gore and speaks volumes of a man's life without truly telling all there is to tell about him. Citizen Kane is absolutely amazing, go see it if you haven't already, i'm pretty sure you won't get bored, even you film snobs that visit this website.11/10</fullReview>

Meanwhile the upper 1% who live in Xanadu profit. As someone else here stated "William Randolph Hurst is long forgotten, but this movie still stands as an artistic landmark, an island in a sea of mediocre movies of its time". It just shows how commonly easy it is to bend a mind. A must see, like a must read book such as 1984, Fahrenheit 451. The strongest point of this movie is in Kane's bias against other aristocrats and most notably his self-destructive tendencies that we all share. Great story.

		<fullReview>Many times people just look at the plot of movies to determine if a movie is "great" or "classic". I will admit, Citizen Kane was not the most exciting movie, nor was its plot fascinating to say the least, but there are other things that makes this movie one of the most influential in history of films. Orson Wells is an innovative director. He took "Cinematography" (the shots used to make a movie) to a whole different level. Before Citizen Kane, movies had the generic still shots and other bland camera angles. Wells used close-ups, various camera angles, and he even cut a hole in a floor to get a shot of Kane that looked up at him (most likely to make him look bigger and more powerful). So, maybe the next time you go see a movie, you can look at the Cinematography and how directors influence how you see things in a movie, and then you can appreciate what Wells did for Cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Courageous, powerful, smashing, sharp, passionate, dark, terrific, epic, visionary, tough, grand, brassy, emotional, and flawless. Orson Welles' Citizen Kane is a cinematic masterpiece of editing, montage, acting, story-line, music, cinematography, and directing. It is a milestone in motion picture history and Welles directed, co-wrote, and starred in it at the age of 25. Story's plot covers a man's ascent into the corrupt world of politics and the greed that lies in the newspaper industry. Then story shifts to the lost of his friends and love of his life. It is the unraveling story of a banal and self-absorbed man that has lost his beloved "Rosebud." That in itself is an intriguing mystery and pretext that will keep you guessing up until the final haunting scene in the movie. Those low shots and high shots and the astonishing black and white cinematography with striking blackness gives the film a touch of surrealism. The script is powerfully written and all the actors do a wonderful job. Hailed as the first modern sound film, Citizen Kane is the work of a visionary filmmaker that will be loved and treasured for years to come.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One thing you need to tell yourself whenever you watched a hyped up movie is never to expect too much. One is almost always disappointed. So having watched the #1 billed movie with a more or less open mind here is what I have to say.Its a fantastic movie as far as the cinematography and non-linear narrative goes. The camera angles and black and white shades are the best I have ever seen. The last time I was impressed with the camerawork was "The Matrix". The narrative is very well done with the initial brief montage followed up by different perspectives of Kane as we go on. I did get briefly bored towards the middle of the movie when it looked like all we were going to be served up is a tycoon's story in detail. But the narrative really took off with Jed Leland's interview and manages to describe a man with as much accomplishment as one can expect in two hours. The remarkable thing is that one gets the feeling that one has known Kane for twenty years with just two hours of watching the movie. There is no tawdry sentimentalism either. It manages to comment on society and the press without getting too preachy either.Altogether a very good movie. But is certainly not #1 on my list. I find "American Beauty" to be much better (not in cinematography). Dont know if I missed something remarkable about this movie. Most probably a very good movie for a student of cinema with its cinematography, non linear narrative and for potraying a man incisively and dispassionately on film reel.</fullReview>

But as for #1 movie of all-time, well...if you are an average viewer and not a distinguished critic, "Citizen Kane" probably won't live up to the hype.P.S.

		<fullReview>I don't have any clear, rational reason why I think this is a great movie - I simply love it. Good enough reason for myself.Being an adolescent, you'd expect me to love a more modern film and hate ones like "Citizen Kane," now 61 years old. But there's just something about this film that I love. Perhaps it's the great direction, great acting, and many classic scenes. Orson Welles was the best.There is a certain quality inherent in these old 1930's and 1940's classics. The combination of a real focus on acting, as well as a certain attraction for the old black-and-white color of filming - in essence, a feeling of datedness - that makes these films such a joy to experience. "Citizen Kane" is my favorite among these classics.Such classic scenes in the movie include the opening "Rosebud" death scene of Mr. Kane, the proceeding reel-clip on his life, as well as the ending. But there is much more within the film.All in all, a film for the ages. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For all of those who feel The Godfather is the greatest movie ever, give yourself a knock on the head with a blackjack. If it wasn't for Orson Welles lavish and sometimes eccentric film, none of the conventions used in this film would have ever been utilized elsewhere. Citizen Kane not only changed the face of Hollywood with a story that encapsulated a grand story into two hours, it also helped usher in a whole new perspective of looking at film, discovering different forms which never would have been conceived. Not only was the story engrossing, the technical aspects of the film proved to be a cut above the rest, still looking contemporary in this world of split second edits and explosions. No film has ever captured a self actualized person like Kane, a man who has everything and can do virtually anything he wanted. In a way, it is a telling tale of our current media ills, allowing one person or one organization to own too much, creating his own slant on the news for his own wishes. It's a shame Welles had to wait so long before receiving acclaim for this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Film. Here Are the Ways in Which It's Great.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pauline Kael said that Citizen Kane "is a masterpiece, but a shallow masterpiece." It's not hard to see her point. The script by Herman Mankiewicz is extremely clever, packed with enough witty lines to fill a book of quotes and structured as an innovative set of (often out of sequence) flashbacks, but Kane himself is something of a cartoon, an idealistic young man who eventually reveals himself as an opportunist, a stock theatrical type. As a story, Kane is heavy on the irony, light on the deeper emotions.But Kane is great in two areas: acting and technique. The former is supplied by one of the greatest casts ever put together in a film: Orson Welles (in his best big screen performance), Joseph Cotten, Agnes Moorehead, Ruth Warrick, Dorothy Comingore, and a uniformally terrific set of supporting players. The latter is supplied by Director Welles and Cinematographer Greg Toland, who enjoy equal credits at the end of the film. This suggests that the technique is highly visual, which it is. The film is an unsurpassed visual experience; few modern movies even come close. Welles and Toland invented film noir and few directors or cinematographers have done it as well. (Bernardo Bertolucci and Ridley Scott have probably come closest.)Even better, the technique informs the story. The warring shots of Welles and Cotten, interspersed throughout the flashback sequences, tell far more about their relationship than words could convey. The widely-praised sequence around the breakfast table, which encapsulates the progress of Kane's first marriage into about 2-3 minutes, is a spectacular example of technique relating story, but so are the chorus girl sequence, the Declaration of Principles sequence, and the deservedly famous sequence where Kane trashes Susan's room after she's left him. (The last was done in single takes, since Welles essentially destroyed the set as it was being shot.)Bottom line: If you aren't fascinated by cinematic technique, you quite probably will enjoy Kane for the sheer cleverness of the story. But if you're the kind of person who watches a film with an eye toward innovative ways of telling a story, this film may be a revelatory experience. And be sure to watch the DVD version, with alternate soundtracks by both Roger Ebert and Peter Bogdonavich that explain the technique in great detail.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Easily one of the top 10 movies of all time. In my humble estimation, it is a landmark in film history and a brilliant portrayal of a controlling megalomaniac. Given it's depth and range, it's hard to believe Orson Welles was a mere 25 years old at the time. The acting is first-rate all the way, and the writing (Mankiewicz) is superb.No gratuitous sex or violence...it's not needed.Guess we could all learn a few things from this movie...and it gets the point across with preaching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is this movie all that it has been built up to be?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Walking in to see Citizen Kane, I had nothing but high expectations for this film and perhaps a little skepticism. Almost all of what I had heard about this movie from everyone whom I discussed it with is that it tops almost all the "Best movie of all time" charts. How could this be that this movie is at the top of all these lists when I can't even answer with the same answer every time I'm asked, "What's my favorite movie?" However, while watching Citizen Kane, which the name alone sometimes gives me chills, I began to realize what all the fuss is about. That a movie made in the fifties could have such shocking images and such great filming techniques that preceded its time and still fifty years later can still shock an audience is truly a great feat. After just beginning my first film studies course and just finishing my first real reading analyzing film techniques I, scene after scene, minute after minute, saw all the effective techniques that were explained in the chapter as guidelines in order to make a film that will impact and have a subconscious long lasting impact on the viewers. Thus I had to ask after leaving the film which came first the books on film techniques or Citizen Kane?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Citizen Kane isn't just some ordinary film. Produced and directed in the 1940's, Citizen Kane can very well be considered one of the greatest films ever made. The film begins with the appearance of being a search for `rosebud', but ends up following one man's life through his triumphs and tribulations. Each flashback and memoir adds another dimension to Kane's developing character. At times, the audience cheers for the underdog, while at others, one can't help but wonder how a man could be so stubborn. Overall, this depressing but complex movie is amazingly directed. The acting is excellent, and the plot moves along smoothly. One must come without any expectations, in order to get the most out of this movie. Who knows? Citizen Kane may very well convince even the most skeptical audience of its brilliance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a classis American film, Orson Wells' Citizen Kane helped form the foundation of American cinema. I thought it was brilliant. I was intrigued from beginning to end. The newsreel beginning and various flashbacks provided the audience with brief glimpses into the life of a complex character, Charles Foster Kane. The retrospective angle of the movie adds to the mystery of Kane, who was misunderstood throughout his life, and after his death. This movie was extremely well-crafted and amazing to watch. The directorial style and camera work, in addition to the great acting, made this film a work of art.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Truely Classic Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Citizen Kane is an excellent example of great hollywood cinema. I had always wanted to see it, but actually had no idea what it was about before watching it. It was very different than I had expected. I guess the underlying meaning is that you can have all of the money and be surrounded by possessions and people, and still be the loneliest person around. Kane owned newspapers, had wives, `friends' and a huge castle with all of the riches from Europe, but couldn't find happiness. With all of his wealth, he became self absorbed, and believed he could buy love and people. Because of this, he lost everything. I thought that the story line about Rosebud was interesting, and was a great way to show this man's life in a way people could understand. I think my favorite scene in the movie is when Kane and his wife are sitting at the table, first as newleweds, and then it shows how their relationship changes over time. I thought it was sad, but a pretty real view of marriages, and the strain that a workaholic can put on relationships.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have no idea why this film is disliked so much by the previous people, who have commented. OK the movie doesn't include the white house being blown to smitheriens or a light sabre battle but it does tell a story, and that story is told remarkably well. If you come to this film expecting it to be on a par with the no brain blockbusters of today then you will be dissapointed. This film tells a story about a man and how his life has affected everyone around him. He is a man that cannot give love but he has to be loved. It is just a great film that requires you to think and observe. Orson Welles was a genius who was so underused and underated in his lifetime that it is only correct that this should start to be rectified. Pity it wasn't done earlier, so he could have made more films. Another great film is Touch of Evil.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliance from the master of cinema, Orson Welles</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Citizen Kane is said to be the greatest film ever made. I haven't seen all of the films ever made in the world; therefore I couldn't make a decision, but if the greatest film is out there, and even slightly resembles Kane, it is nothing short of sheer brilliance. The intense Orson Welles, the mastermind of the film, was a perfectionist; and it showed. He did not confine his film to the limits of the period it was made in and it helped to revolutionize the film industry with Kane. The lighting, editing and cinematography were all basically new to the world. Based on this, it shocked the film industry into being the greatest film ever created. The main factor that sets Citizen Kane apart from other films as being brilliant is the lighting. Welles manipulated the lighting so that it wasn't just another causality of a motion picture, but served as symbolism and emotion. Also, he used the type of lighting more often used in theater productions. For example, every reporter conveyed in the film was filmed in shadow, regardless of the natural lighting in the scene. This showed that Welles pictured all reporters as one like being: they had no personality of their own and were only focused on unearthing the meaning of Kane's final word, 'Rosebud'. This view of Welles', actually, was very apropos, considering that Welles and the film were hounded by the media as a result of the Hearst scandal. Also, Kane's elaborate mansion, Xanadu, was also filmed in shadow. This symbolized that Xanadu was a product of Kane's dark obsession with greed and his quest for power and acceptance. The lighting in this film heightened effect of various characters and objects throughtout the film and made the message of the film more visual to the audience. Another aspect that made this film revolutionary was the editing. Orson Welles was the first director/screenwriter to use the effect of flashbacks, so the film was not in chronological order, as the case with others of its period. For example, the film started with Kane uttering `Rosebud' and slumping over in death. Basically, the entire film was composed of a series of flashbacks. The reporters interviewed all of the integral people in Kane's life and each person reflected back on their most important experiences with him. The various people traced back from his happy and poor childhood to his cold and lonely death. Another aspect of the editing used in the film was to show the passage of time between scenes and how it affected the principle characters in it. For example, when Kane and his first wife, Emily, were sitting at the breakfast table, they began with sitting very close to each other and acting very warmly towards each other. The scenes were formatted in a montage, in which Kane and Emily sat farther and farther apart (and acted estranged) as time progressed. Also, when Susan Alexander, Kane's second wife, was feeling alone in their loveless marriage, she began to do a jigsaw puzzle. Again, a montage was composed of her gradually doing the puzzle and a cut to the clock and so on, until the puzzle was completed. Citizen Kane also expressed revolutionary cinematography. Orson Welles and the rest of the staff went beyond any other film with the techniques they used to create Kane. For example, Welles dug a hole in the floor in order to create a low angle in the shot. This gave the characters an order of power and also caused the studio to furnish the sets with ceilings. They had to do this because the low angles exposed the ceilings in the shots, and all of the sets built in the forties did not have ceilings. Also, it was filmed in deep focus photography. Films of that era usually focused upon the main object in a shot, and the background was out of focus. In Citizen Kane, Everything, including the background, was in focus, causing the scene to have greater depth and the audience to be able to see what the characters are doing in the background. So is Citizen Kane the best film ever created? I am not the world's biggest film buff, but I do know that it is incomparable to anything that I have ever seen before. It is truly original, and that is what makes it so incredibly brilliant. One main factor makes Citizen Kane regarded as the greatest film ever made? and that factor is Orson Welles. He was the mastermind behind a film that changed the face of cinema as we know it. Besides being remembered as the greatest film ever made, Kane is also remembered for the word `Rosebud'. What did Welles want that word to signify? Happiness cannot be bought. As you watch the movie, you will figure out what it means for yourself and also expand your mind for having watching such brilliance. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>CITIZEN KANE is the fascinating story of a man who becomes the most powerful man in the world. He doesn't run a Government or an Army. He is a media mogul. And he truly runs the world. The films opening is a close-up on a NO TRESPASSING sign, and that's the closing shot. KANE opens with a mesmorizing sequence in which the title character dies, muttering only one word. The rest of the story is told in quasi-flashback. A man wants to find out what Kane meant by his dying words. So he interviews various people close to Kane and more of the man is unveiled. (Impossibly Samll Spoiler!)He started out as an idealist and was corrupted (Spoiler Ends.). Orson Welles plays the title character and plays him wonderfully. Another actor who show up here are Joseph Cotton. There are many others (Especially Kane's Mistress.) who are splendid, but unfortunately I can't recall their names. The cinematography is marvelous. There is not plot whatsoever. It's simply the sutdy of one man. And a great film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An All-Time Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Citizen Kane was one of the first movies that really caught people's attention in Hollywood. Orson Welles, the 25 year-old boy that wanted to be a legend, impressed everyone with this wonderfully made film. No one believed he could do it, and even after he finished it, there was trouble to release it. But after all, Welles got his well-earned fame and fortune. The movie talks about a man, and how having the world at his feet, he loses his soul and everything that could ever make him happy. But above all, there's Rosebud, that will keep you with your eyes open through the entire film. I even had to watch the last scene a couple of times to really understand the whole point of the movie. This is really how movies should be made, and I would strongly recommend it to anyone who appreciates good-old quality films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Do we all think it is the greatest motion picture?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A brilliant cast, with Joseph Cotten serving brilliantly as the right hand man of Welles. In turn, Orson Welles in his most famous role, or perhaps one of the most famous characters in all of Hollywood's history. Screenplay of Academy Award calibre was penned by the leading man and the director.RKO studios, although doomed against the fatale of other Hollywood competition, was so confident about the picture that it was released with the promotional tagline "Everyone's talking about it!" And although RKO became defunct, not every studio goes down with nine Astaire-Rogers films, let alone "Citizen Kane".Indeed people are still talking about the film with good reason. But ask the typical teenager about my age the most famous film ever made and they're more likely to come out with "The Wizard of Oz" or "Gone With the Wind". That is, if they don't come out with "American Beauty" or "The Sixth Sense" first. In 1941, "Citizen Kane" received its accolades, but Orson Welles was an ignored and underrated Tinseltown figure, which justifies "The Third Man" never being nominated best picture. "How Green Was My Valley" may have been the winner of the coveted Best Picture that year, but it didn't take out the number one spot on the AFI's controversial list, and it wouldn't take the Oscar today if the Awards occurred again. The underlying problem is that even "Citizen Kane" itself may have been blown too much out of proportion for its own good. As a fourteen year old, I am more inclined to pick the AFI's number 98th listed film on the Top 100 "Bringing Up Baby" as my favourite film of the 1930s and 1940s."Citizen Kane's" theme is certainly a powerful, compelling and thought provoking one. The idea that death comes at a moment of dissatisfaction probably rings true for humans, the idea of never finding what is lost and never understanding fully exactly what was lost is all probably true as well. And if "Citizen Kane" is that good, why is there such a problem with it being stated as the best film ever made?The underlying answer is likely to be that mainstream audience, and the fewer who indulge in classic film, cannot take heavy, intense drama as easily screwball comedy. As I would classify myself as one of those people, I would never leave "Citizen Kane" off my personal greatest films list, but I could never speak of it as the best movie of all time.Film professionals may state "Kane" is without a doubt the best movie ever made, but more people would be able to recognise the tune "Over the Rainbow" than understand the irony if someone dropped dead smashing a crystal ball uttering "Rosebud".Rating: 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although Kane did not top my personal list (it lost a photo finish to Casablanca), it is easy for me to see how it tops so many others. Although its technical aspects have long since been surpassed, you must remember that, like any great piece of art, Kane cannot be removed from its place in time. It is not terribly difficult to create a fake Picasso, for example, but the original has value because of the vision of the artist, not the brush strokes themselves. Welles was certainly not lacking in vison for Kane. What further separates Kane from the pack is its strong acting and great tragedy; that of a man that achieved great wealth, power, and fame, was destroyed by it and on his deathbed yearns for the simple life of his youth that was later denied to him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why Kane IS #1</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Consider the films deservedly named #1 and #2 in the AFI Top 100. #2 is "Casablanca," the epitome of classic Hollywood craftsmanship. No more entertaining film exists or is ever likely to. Anyone who watches the first three minutes is held captivated until the end credits roll. But #1 belongs to the film that, more than any other, challenged the Hollywood standards #2 epitomizes, and blasted open the possibilities of moving picture storytelling. "Citizen Kane" is an awesome film, but it cannot be enjoyed in the same effortless way as "Casablanca." It is brash and strident, and in its determination to be original it sometimes goes a bit too far. It is not a highly-polished gem like "Casablanca." Pathbreakers like Welles are not prim, meticulous artisans. They take wild chances; they make us uncomfortable; they sometimes go too far so everyone else can go far enough.</fullReview>

What a twenty five year old kane did was truly monumental, If not for anything else, visually he advanced film 40 years in one stroke. no other film of it's day can compare to it's cinematic genuis. his use of deep focus, lighting and incredible editing is truly groundbreaking. the film is a study in filmmaking from a guy who had never made a film before. Welles film was to much for the audiences of his day. I frankly don't think the audiences of his day was sophisticated enough to understand what they were seeing. And of course the behind attempts by Wiliam Randolph Hearst to destroy the film are well documented. I grew up admiring a lot of film makers use of the camera, after seeing Kane I realized he used it first to create images unlike any before. In my opinion kane will alway's be the greatest film ever made because it took film to a place it had never been. Filmmakers are still trying to catch up.</fullReview>

When has a film ever been banned by another individual ...in this case I would be talking about William Randolph Hearst. Hearst life was on display here and he knew it..he hated Welles for doing what he did and this led to a limited release. There are few films ever attacking greed, there has yet to be a movie attacking Michael Eisner or Ruppert Murdoch because they are larger then life figures that provide goodness such as Mickey Mouse and the Superbowl. What I mean to illustrate is that this film shows what emptiness exists when we place material possession above all else. The storyline is excellent and the technics used are great. To make this movie really hit home if you ever have the chance to visit Hearst Castle in San Simeon California you will really understand the man this movie is about.</fullReview>

Citizen Kane remains today perhaps the most important film of all time to film-makers. They look to see what they can do. Until Citizen Kane, every previous film looked the same. When Citizen Kane came, it changed the film world forever. Not even Titanic would appear as an inferior and insufficient comparison. Titanic is nowhere in the realms of Orson Welles.

		<fullReview>This is an absolutely breathtaking masterpiece. It is masterfully crafted, culminating to a magnificently heart wrenching end. The acting in this film is absolutely amazing. Orson Welles transforms just as Kane does throughout the film. Every shot means something, there is nothing wasted, and no filler whatsoever. The dialogue is dramatic and meaningful. In other films that attempt to do the same thing that this film does fall flat in several categories. There tends to be overacting, long, boring dramatic shots, and overpowering soundtracks. Citizen Kane falls to none of these ailments. The shots are beautiful, the actors do not over do it, while still being completely dedicated to their roles. There are long shots, but the editing it tight and fluid. This is a must see if you have not seen it. One of the best films ever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly An Amazing Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hate to agree with the pretentious, boring film students who basically worship their copy of Citizen Kane (and rebuke every other classic or new film) I used to go to school with, but this is truly one of the greatest films ever made. I've watched it a handful of times and it never fails to stun me.Everything about this movie is perfect, it'd be a waste of time to list all the characteristics of this film that make it the legend it is- but I'm just gonna waste a little. Welles was so gifted. The cinematography is beautiful the whole way through. Fantastic use of lights and shadows. He was so artistic with his techniques, every scene was planned down to each detail. And the variety! Wow, so many different techniques with Welles' touch on them. His style is like visual candy, and every shot is sweet.All performances were excellent! Amazing they all came from the same place, and this was the first film for all of them. I was especially blown away by Welles, of course, considering he created one of the most iconic characters in film history. His performance was spectacular, from 25 year old Kane to old Kane, brilliant. The make-up applied to age the characters was so impressive. It looked better than some of the make-up work I see these days even. The character development was impeccable. The script was great. Good dialog, never lags, was always interesting. The non-chronological format was expertly executed, the transitions passing through years, transitions from flashback to present- seamless every time.There is nothing about this movie that I don't like. Such a monumental achievement, it's such a shame that Orson Welles had so many problems with the film industry. Can't imagine what he'd have left behind had the studios let him have total control. Anyway, obviously I strongly recommend this film and love having it in my own collection.10/10 Bye love you</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The missing piece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Who is Charles Foster Kane? Is he a Communist? A Fascist? An American? The "No Trespassing" sign that we see at the beginning of the movie tries to warn us. Yes, throughout the movie we will get different narrations which describe Mr. Kane; but will we go over the fence and will we really understand who Mr. Kane is? The unseen reporter (Mr.Thompson, shot in darkness) seeks the last great news: Rosebud! Is Rosebud the missing piece? Will it explain everything? Mr. Kane, the great man, by pronouncing this word just before dying returns to his childhood, the childhood stolen by a banker. Charles Foster Kane comes back to a piece of wood that meant the only real moments of happiness in his life. "If the headline is big enough, it makes the news big enough" tells us Welles/Kane; and the news is big but the unseen reporter cannot solve the riddle. At the end of the movie the missing piece of the jigsaw puzzle seems to be Mr. Kane himself; we get his story from several (unreliable) narrators but we don't feel to have trespass the Kane's barrier. Orson Welles (director, producer and main actor) delivers a masterpiece through an extensive use of dissolves, deep focuses and flashbacks. Music and sounds give rhythm to the film and Welles' outstanding acting completes the picture (by the way, Di Caprio's best performances certainly took a lot from Mr. Kane). Citizen Kane remains up-to-date after more than 70 years and will be immortal; it is strongly recommend watching it more than once to appreciate all the techniques used by Orson Welles and cinematographer Gregg Toland.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Hollywood at its finest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>CITIZEN KANE is one of those films that often makes critics' top ten lists of the greatest films ever made, and has built quite a reputation as such over the 70+ years since it was released. It's also one of those films that people might be familiar with, but may not have seen. And until now, I hadn't actually seen it myself. So, does it live up to its reputation? Yes, it mostly does. The story, if somebody out there doesn't know, is about Charles Foster Kane, who is taken from his parents at a young age to live with a powerful businessman and, once he comes of age, takes over control of a newspaper. Over the course of his life, which is recounted almost entirely in flashback, you see a transition from an idealistic, principled young man to a reclusive shell of his former self. I thought it was a very well-written, well-shot film that gives a very balanced portrayal of a polarizing figure. All of the performances were excellent, especially Orson Welles, who was the brainchild behind this film. I also took notice of the incredible camera-work and cinematography which made effective use of light, shadow and space as well as some really sharp camera angles which provide visual insight into power dynamics that are an integral part of the story. However the most important aspect seems to have been a man who desperately wants love and approval, but doesn't know how to get it except by trying to buy it. It is this single part of Kane that makes him a compelling character, despite being such an enigma otherwise. There was also the film's central nagging question of what his final word, "rosebud," meant. I thought that the answer, which is revealed in the film's final moments, was a bit underwhelming but extremely effective as a narrative-driving device. Overall, this is a classic film that deserves to be seen by all, if for no other reason than that it is an important part of film history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rightfully Called The Greatest Film of All Time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just what makes a great movie? One that is sure to stand the test of time and take your breath away? It must have: a compelling script, strong development and chemistry in the plot and between the characters, excitement, emotionally-connecting, great camera tricks/computer enhancements, great sets and costumes, and has a strong message. Very few films possess all of these traits and Citizen Kane was the first one to do so. The make-up is flawless, the camera tricks are sheer genius and unrepeatable, astonishing acting, and you feel just about every kind of emotion possible. Citizen Kane has been raved as being the greatest film of all time more than any other movie. If Casablanca or The Godfather outrank it in a list, Citizen Kane is right behind them. Everybody that disagrees with this not being THE best will certainly think it was great to say the least. Citizen Kane follows the rise and fall of a controversial newspaper tycoon with reporters trying find the meaning of his dying word: "Rosebud." At the very end, you find out what Rosebud is and it explains nothing. Orson Welles leaves it up to you to figure out why Rosebud is so meaningful and how it is always relevant. Kane wanted people to love him and wanted various things to make himself happy. The richer he grew, the less happy he became. Rosebud symbolizes the last period of his life where he was ever truly and shows that money cannot buy happiness. Money not buying happiness is a subject that has always been talked about and will always be talked about. But Welles executes it in such a way that is sure to have a lasting impact on the viewer. Sure the movie possesses everything positive about a movie, but the way the message is delivered makes it more than a just a piece of cinema. No other movie has ever been flawlessly made with a strong delivery of an important life lesson.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best and The Most Important Film Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>10/10 With no doubt, THE BEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME! This film has everything, the directing is pure perfection and has influenced many movies, so I consider this too, the most important film ever made. The acting is incredible, and the writing is everything that you can expect. The angles are pretty amazing and very audacious for that time, so as the cinematography.Beside all those good points, what elevates this film is the meaning behind of all the story, the most important thing of your life, isn't the money or how rich you are, it is your childhood, inocence and the happy times that you enjoyed with your family and friends, Kane almost had the world, but not the most important thing in life, LOVE!</fullReview>

I have studied this one in school and watched it a dozen or more times and for the life of me I can't understand why it remains in the number one spot of all American movies ever made. The only explanation I can come up with is that people are afraid of change and new things and nostalgically cling to the days that were once so simple that this movie stood out in comparison.

		<shortDescription>A Masterwork of Directing, Writing, Editing, and Cinematography</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I cannot find adjectives that describe the film in a proper tremendous way. Some of the best directing, cinematography, and editing of all-time, Welles' imagination is the force that makes Citizen Kane fly over any other inferior picture when it often takes the crown as the greatest film ever made. This is the way movies should be made. The filmmaking of 1941 is unmatched and my guess will continue to be. Welles is a genius and his mise-en-scene could be studied for years. Citizen Kane is smarter than most of the audience members who've seen it since the release. The journalistic side of Citizen Kane is also something that makes it shine as something special, the film feels like (and quite literally is) a reporter researching a story on Kane, each person he interviews is like a different paragraph in the news story. The profound message revealed in the closing 60 seconds is brilliant, true, and simple, that we never know the whole story to a person, personal complexes are the ultimate form of privacy and mystery.Orson Welles had to have been bitten by a hyperactive insect in order to successfully put himself in the central role of lead actor, director, and writer. Though solid in the acting department, his masterwork in the other departments are monumental. He must have envisioned the film as he penned each scene. His direction is electrified with bouncing energy while telling the tricky story, allowing the audience to find sympathy with Kane as a character.Grade: A+Rating: 10.5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It Is A Great Film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Orson Welles both directed and starred in this classic film, regarded by many as the greatest film ever made, which is a claim I have some sympathy with, though it isn't my choice. Still, this is a masterpiece, brilliantly weaving its narrative in flashback, as a group of reporters try to make sense out of wealthy Newspaper tycoon Charles Foster Kane's last words, "Rosebud", and interview the surviving people who knew him, like his best friend and colleague Jedediah Leland(memorably played by Joseph Cotton), his ex-wife Susan Alexander(played by Dorothy Comingore) and butler(played by Paul Stewart) who claims to have heard Kane say the famous word. What's most remarkable about this film is how innovative and fresh it still is, directed with energy and style that hasn't aged a bit. Script is brilliant, both funny and insightful, with lots of witty and quotable dialogue. Direction is atmospheric and fast-paced, with an effective use of shadows and looming camera angles that present Kane as a towering giant who overshadowed everyone, yet had a most tragic life, despite his wealth.An all-time classic not to be missed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know if there is such a thing as a "perfect" movie, but this comes as close as anything I have ever seen. I recently re-watched Citizen Kane for the first time since high school. I don't know why it took me so long to watch it again, probably because the first time I saw it I was a little underwhelmed. I'll just chalk that up to immaturity though, this is most certainly one of the best films I've ever seen. Students of film history can tell you all about the innovative camera techniques and such that make this film very important. I prefer to just focus on the actual experience of watching it. First of all, every scene (and I truly do mean every scene) is absolutely visually stunning. You could pretty much take any individual frame and hang it in a gallery, it is that meticulously put together. Aside from that, it's just a great story. I don't usually find biopics about "great men" very compelling, as they have a tendency to elevate people to this almost god-like, larger-than-life status that causes me to just become disconnected and not care at all about the main character. Citizen Kane does precisely the opposite, it takes a "great man" in the eyes of society and brings him down to a human level. Ultimately Kane is just like everyone else, a man in search of lasting happiness that proves more elusive than it seems it should. If you haven't seen Citizen Kane, or even if it's been a long time, then go watch it as soon as possible. You certainly will not regret it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Citizen Kane', Written, Directed &amp; Acted by the late Orson Welles, is something so magical &amp; poetic, it defines Cinema. I Have NEVER seen a film as good as 'Citizen Kane' since 'The Shawshank Redemption'. 'Citizen Kane' Synopsis: Following the death of a publishing tycoon, news reporters scramble to discover the meaning of his final utterance.'Citizen Kane' is about The Great American Dream. The Protagonist, Charles Foster Kane, is one of the few people who achieve greatness on Celluloid. He lives his dream, rises above the normal commoner &amp; even sees through The Great Depression. The Protagonist defines ambition, greed &amp; one-man-ship. Its a supremely well-written character, that also explores emotions &amp; has his share of outbursts. Orson Welles is at his greatest high as far as creativity &amp; imagination are concerned. He delivers a story so compelling &amp; magnetic, it's hard not to be stunned by his work. His Screenplay is flawless &amp; utterly amazing. Every Sequence, Every Character, is magnificently written. His Direction can be described as a Study. He handles this Epic Human Tale, astoundingly. And as far as his Performance goes as Charles Foster Kane, he's impeccable. His performance elevates Charles Foster Kane to perfection. On the whole, 'Citizen Kane' is Cinema At Its FINEST!

		<shortDescription>If Carlsberg did movies... 97%</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here it is - the Mac Daddy, the Big Kahuna, the movie to end all movies. For fifty uninterrupted years, this was widely considered the greatest movie of all time which is mighty praise indeed for any film. There are many articles and opinion pieces in various media by people smarter or better informed than I (including this very site, I imagine) extolling the virtues of this movie but personally, I believe they are discussing the film's legacy rather than its value as entertainment which is understandable, given the film's age. But can any film, even one with such standing as this, ever really live up to the overwhelming hype of being the world's greatest movie? The film opens amid the crumbling, isolated estate of Xanadu - the vast home of reclusive media tycoon Charles Foster Kane (Orson Welles) who lays dying on his death-bed. Dropping a snow globe and uttering the word "rosebud", Kane dies and sparks a media frenzy over the meaning of his final word. Journalist Jerry Thompson (William Adland) takes up the story, speaking in turn with those who knew Kane in an effort to solve the riddle: his former wife Susan Alexander (Dorothy Comingore) who's scraping a living as a lounge singer, the manager of Kane's media empire Mr Bernstein (Everett Sloane) and Kane's one-time best friend Jedediah Leland (Joseph Cotten). He even gains access to the unpublished memoirs of banker and Kane's former financial guardian Walter Thatcher (George Coulouris) but Thompson continues to draw blanks, pouring over the details of Kane's life which is told in flashback.In the nine and a bit years I've been writing about films on this website, I have yet to come across a film that I couldn't find some fault with even if I was nitpicking in some cases. Not so now - "Citizen Kane" is as flawless a film as I've witnessed. Story-telling is both gripping and innovative, covering everything from the loss of innocence, the struggle for redemption and the corrupting twin evils of money and power. Performances are also of an exceptional standard led by the incomparable Welles, who also co-wrote and directed this masterpiece. And what direction it is - this movie is full of genuinely brilliant moments and scenes, shot with real awareness of the look Welles wanted. It feels less like a movie and more like a moving tapestry, painted by artists more skilled than maybe even they realised. Welles' experience in radio also gives the film's sound a real boost and while his time on stage also allows the film to be daring and bold with its lighting. Even the title card allows no room for compromise - it's bold, stark and fills the screen from top to bottom, not unlike Kane himself.That "Citizen Kane" is one of the more important films in history is, for me, beyond question. But is it truly the greatest? That will depend on the viewer's perspective but for me, this felt like something of an awakening. I cannot remember a film that made me open my eyes to the medium in a way I never had before, the realisation that film could be used for something greater than mere explosions, war propaganda and hokey westerns. Even today, "Citizen Kane" remains the ultimate movie-going experience - other than the endless references to it in "The Simpsons", I had no prior exposure to this film and yet it gripped me from the off. It is a simply epic picture - maybe not in terms of scale with thousands of extras or a world-threatening plot but in terms of a man's life, his place in history and what we leave behind when we're gone. At the end, I was stood like Kane in his own opera house and wildly applauding what I'd witnessed which was nothing short of history being made. What a film, what an experience.</fullReview>

When the movie's widely hailed as the greatest ever made and infiltrated your culture for the past seventy years and influenced nearly every movie you've ever seen, it's hard to say much that hasn't been said. Overall, it's a great film and certainly worth seeing. But at the same time, it's not for everybody. I think a film for everybody must be action packed, but at the same time slowly paced. It must be mainstream, and at the same time art house. It must be a horror, western, sci-fi, porno etc, and at the same time evoke all senses, yet leave people comfortable. I think most people are afraid to say bad things about Citizen Kane. It is a very well made movie, but I found it boring a times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Addressing Current Expectations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 2012 writing a Review of Kane is a lose-lose effort. So many Critics and Film Scholars have exalted this excellent Experiment that almost anything said here has been said there. So addressing the current Expectations of watching this Today might have some Relevance.There is a strange closed Cynical modern Perception and some in the audience absolutely hate this Film. Probably because They have been told so Loudly and Affirmatively that this is either the greatest Film ever made or one of the greatest and therefore it is a huge Letdown. It could hardly live up to the Anticipation and Expectations. Especially when it so Off-Beat and Avant Garde and was the first to use Techniques that have become so common as to be pedestrian. There is that matter of Taste. It is not for Everyone. But must be Respected, if not liked, for its place in the Evolution of the Art form. It changed the very Thinking about what to do with the Palette and how to hold the Brush and Broke the Boundaries and shed the shackles of the those who Painted with Film.One would have to, and this is the Framework for most Ancient on the Fringe Films, understand Cinema Chronology. The Paradigm of the Picture industry and the Historical body of work at the Time of Release, and the general Anticipated Acceptance of what was then being Offered for Consumption. One could even say it is a Stand Alone Film.In 1941 there was Nothing Like this at all. The Style was as New as anything that came before. Think Jackson Pollock. Or any other breakthrough Artistic Form. Movie fans Today have to accept that most of the Awe about Citizen Kane has been a Progression of Appreciation for the Audacious and Anti Establishment use of the Tools of the Cinema that were always there but arranged in Anarchy and that spun a New Direction and Citizen Kane changed the Language of Film Making.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the greatest film of all time. Well god help films. If all films were like this, I can tell you now that I would have no interest in them what so ever. "Citizen Kane" is out of print, well at least it should've been.I'm not going to lie, I did enjoy the first 30 minutes, the first 10 which explained Kane's life in a nutshell held up very well even for today's standards. It seemed fast, it seemed interesting and i seriously thought that this could be a really great film! Then we were introduced to Kane the child, a bit of back-story (well actually a lot of back-story) and then we got to Kane being a newspaper mogul, starting out and it was about here that I thought, this must only have half an hour left. It actually had an hour and a half left, I had been watching it for 30 minutes. I stuck with it and I don't think I've ever had a night that long in my life! It's only a 2 hour film but it felt like it was four, and I'm really not exaggerating here! It was so boring! I think I nearly dropped off in some moments, I don't really care about this man who had success and then lost it all because I've seen it all before but in a much more interesting way! I know this film is as old as the hills but we're in the 21st century now, and so I have to compare to the standard of films we get now! I watched "The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button" the same day as this, a film that's almost 3 hours long and I had no problem with the length because it didn't feel that long at all. In the same way it tells of a man's life, but it's interesting! So the boredom factor is my biggest problem with this. The story was nothing I've not seen before as I said. But, I suppose the directing was impressive. Particularly in the opening 10 minutes and in some scenes I noticed some eccentric camera moves for the 1940's. but on the whole, the camera was as static as most film noir.This is all I have to say on this. I think it's over-rated, over-long and over-here! Maybe it has some hidden meaning, but that's wasted on me. Just because a film has flashbacks doesn't make it the greatest film ever. What the hell is rosebud anyway!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How to Watch Citizen Kane</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warning: spoilersThe first time I watched _Citizen Kane_, the movie seemed to aim for psychological depth in its treatment of Kane, but several of the supporting characters were exaggeratedly silly in a way now appropriate for a TV sitcom. The apparent inconsistencies resolve when one realizes that _Kane_, of course, is a hit job on William Randolph Hearst, and that the depiction of Hearst and his lover are as over the top as the actions of the lesser characters. Heart's sin, apparently, was being an unrepentant capitalist and occupying media space that Welles thought would be better allocated to progressive voices. Whatever Welles' motivation, he was willing to trash anyone to get to his target. Hearst's lover, Marion Davies, was starring in films before she met Hearst. I suppose Davies' only sin was being near Hearst, but Welles turns her into a talentless vacuum to accentuate Kane's utter narcissism. The documentary _Movie Moguls_ claims that 'Rosebud' was Hearst's pet name for Marion's private part. This would explain why Rosebud appears in the movie as a sled, something for Kane to ride. It also puts a different slant on the final scene, where Rosebud is committed to the flames.Welles gave his cinematographer the freedom to revive the expressionist lighting of the more experimental films of the silent era. This gives the visual aspects of _Kane_ a powerful role in presenting the film's themes. How to light a film isn't the big lesson from _Kane_. Orson Welles was freezing, personalizing and polarizing his target long before Saul Alinsky. _Citizen Kane_ showed filmmakers how to go for the jugular.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not a big fan of Citizen Kane, it's just one of those films like The Dark Knight, where everyone says it's the greatest film ever and then you go see it with high expectations only to be disappointed. But is Citizen Kane a terrible film? Well that will all depend on what you are looking for in a film. If you are looking for a movie that makes you feel good, has a good story, and likable characters than Citizen Kane is not your movie. The movie is a Film Noir with elements of both realism and formalism that make the story dull and confusing. It is very depressing and hard to get into, and Kane, the character is a total a**h***.However for those of you who are studying film making, you need to watch this movie. Citizen Kane is what is known as a text-book film, it is long and boring but every shot in the film is perfect and these are all techniques that every inspiring film maker should watch and study. Films schools will make you watch this film anyway so why not get a head start right now. Meanwhile I'll just sit here and wait until you are done.(2 hours and 30 minutes later)Finished!? See what I mean about the story. It's dreadful, depressing, and it makes me want to kill Charles Kane... Again. But what makes this film very disappointing for me is the ending. Although well photographed it tells you that all along Kane's last words "Rosebud," was in reference to his sled... Are you kidding me! I had to sit here for two and a half hours watching this only to learn that the guy was talking about his freak-en' sled! Oh well, I guess I can't complain too much, it is Citizen Kane after all, the movie that made Billy Wilder movies awesome by creating a new genre of film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie shares, with Casablanca and The Third Man, the dubious distinction of being one of the most overrated in the history of cinema. It is also not entirely clear why the Orson Welles myth should persist until today. Kane's existential progress is presented superficially, without a coherent framework. His achievements and failures are portrayed choppily, more in the form of sound bites than analytically. Technically, the movie seems rather amateurish: Welles hectors rather than explains; the diction and delivery of most characters sounds stilted and unnatural; it is often difficult to find out who is talking, as most of the male voices sound the same and the characters turn their backs to the audience, and/or hide under wide-brimmed hats. One could go on. The fortuitous discovery of a goldmine on the property of a lower middle class housewife stretches credibility. Trying to discover the meaning of one word (the film's rather trivial leitmotiv) seems hardly worth the time and effort involved. An altogether forgettable experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First I'm a huge film buff love many of the classic films Hitchcock, Lean, Kubrick etc. but i've never understood what's so great about Kane. I know all the technical stuff, rapid panning, jump cuts, crane shots over model sets yes yes it's all very impressive but Pauline Kael called it a "shallow masterpiece" and that's what it is. Imho the main reason is none of the characters are likable and several Bernstein, the reporter, second Mrs. Kane are annoying and shrill. Even Kane himself , can anyone honestly say they care about him? Most or all great films have at least one or two characters the audience sympathizes with or at least finds interesting, here there's no one and there never has been anyone, for this reason Kane is shallow , shrill, and pretty dull when you get past the technical wizardry.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What does a guy do when he starts off at the Top and Tees Off a guy named Bill, William Randolph Hearst, that is..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It comes to mind of an incident occurring back at the work place, which was directly related to CITIZEN KANE (RKO Radio Pictures, 1941) and to the why to its having been almost universally held as being 'The Greatest American Film.' The 'work place' was the Chicago Police Department, the year was ca. 1991. The question of "They're having CITIZEN KANE on cable all week long. Why are they doing that?" The question was posed by one of my old partners, a guy whom I had known for about 25 years at that time. Let's just call him Officer Elmo Aymee. (Much like DRAGNET, "The names have been changed to protect the Innocent."As for an answer (there were about 6 of us in the Doughnut Shop then) it was myself who finally answered "Well, Elmo, CITIZEN KANE is considered to be the greatest film of all time, and this is its 50th Anniversary." Without much of a hesitation, Elmo responded; "Yeah well, I'm not watchin' it because I don't like Orson Welles!" That was sure as about a tough and unexpected a reply that could be returned; but I did my best to maintain the 'high' level of this discussion by saying, "Well then you must not have seen THE MUPPET MOVIE (1979); as it had Welles in a Cameo, toward the end." But now seriously, folks, it is no exaggeration to heap such praise on the Film. And it is certainly not considered to be puffing to bestow such a title as the Greatest Film on this one, singularly conceived and so constructed movie. We must remember that at that time, circa 1940, the young Mr. Welles was considered to be a young genius with his Star still rising in the Hollywood Zodiac. His accomplishments in varying theatrical areas were undeniably superb, being in the classification corresponding to Academia's designation as "Suma Cum Laude", or in the Queen's own tongue, "With Highest Honors".* We of course know of his famous and infamous "WAR OF THE WORLDS" national broadcast over CBS Radio in October, 1938 as a weekly installment of The Mercury Theatre of the Air programme. Everybody's heard of that and there was even a Made-for-Television Movie telling the story. But the accomplishments of the young Orson Welles date back much further than that; extending back to the time before the New York Stage and Radio days. .At 14 years of age as a Prep School Freshman, young Master Welles was writing and producing plays which were staged at the Woodstock Music Hall, in Woodstock, Illinois. This was nothing unusual, for the talented adolescent lad. This sort of thing had become expected of him and no surprise in those days in New York with partnership with John Houseman in the Federal Theatre Project.So when Orson was being courted by RKO Radio Pictures to ink a "standard, Rich &amp; Famous" Hollywood contract; Welles would continually make what would surely be deemed as being outrageous demands, but RKO apparently "double crossed" him. They gave in. So, it was armed with guarantee of absolute Artistic control and an essentially a "the skies are the limit" budgetary considerations, that he headed West; taking his company of players and Musical Director, Mr. Bernard Hermann, along for the ride and appointment with destiny.OUR STORY???.Aw, c'mon! We all know that! So let's waive this part. All in favor signify by saying, "Aye"! All opposed signify with "No!" The "Ayes" have it. So, on with the Show, Schultz! For such an outstanding example of the Cinematic Arts, the underlying structure of the story &amp; screenplay is rather simple, amazingly non-intricate even. When all is cleared away, what we have left is a good, old-fashioned Detective Story. Sure, we have no hero with names the likes of Sherlock, Marlowe, Spade, Blackie or Philo. And there are no colorful supporting characters to help solve the mystery. There's no mysterious murder, but there is the mystery of the identity. Just who or what is "Rosebud" and just what did this mean to Charles Foster Kane on his deathbed? The non-frilled structure of the Detective Story would certainly not be enhanced by the use of flashbacks, for the flashback is an almost indispensable ingredient of the way a detective or other investigative person uses by way of the interview. But again, how does an otherwise normal and standard story-type command such great acclaim and accolades? The "secret" lies in the methods of story-telling by flashback with the most colorful of overlays. As the story continues to unfold, it goes over the same ground already covered, but it always takes us a little more along the way. The story is also seen from a different view point each time some re-visitation occurs.All of the scenes no matter where they come in the story, in present or flashback, are accompanied and successfully underscored with the original score of themes, queues and incidental music, all specially ordered and special delivery sent to the movie audience by the Maestro, himself, Bernard Hermann.As a result of the Mercury Theatre Company's relocating out to the "left coast" it truly does appear that Tinsel town would never be the same. First of all, Mr. Welles' own Star quickly increased in size to that of a Nova and then to the status of a Super-Nova; before its explosion and crashing down to Earth. It would be years before Orson's brief flirtation with life at the top was gradually supplanted with the appreciation with performances in films like THE STRANGER (1946), THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI (1947) THE THIRD MAN (1949) and scores of other roles over the years.And over the years whatever the role that Mr. Orson Welles had in whatever film project, or Television appearance, he always did his best in giving his all. And that includes THE MUPPET MOVIE.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Life of A Man: A ShortTake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Please let me give you one short critic: -"Citizen Kane" is old, but is needed. It's breakthrough over technical implementations made it classic and a milestone. Overall, it's not fun as we are accustomed in the Hollywood way. It narrates the life of a man, in the view of others, while searching his ultimate secret lying on his last word: "Rosebud". Movies usually involve people in front of a conflict, solving it, learning the lesson. "Citizen Kane" is an racconto of a life, it's a progression of lessons and conflicts."Citizen Kane" lasts so long because it's story vents every story of man; not in the content, but in the manner of being told. Every man has his story, every man and women will lye on their bed before dying and try to remember her life by one image, one word, one feeling, one movie. Although Charles Foster Kane, the Citizen, (a memorable Orson Wells) has wealth, a lovely wife and power, he cannot buy what he misses most and he falters over the memory of his most (and everyone's) precious moment: childhood, where every story begins; and where we want to go when it ends. The innocence that is sacred, irremovable. The beginning of every story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remarkable movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is an expressionist interpretation of a story that, if told conventionally, would be flat. The story is expressionist because it is told from the point of view of the reporter who is trying to piece together the pieces of a puzzle regarding the life of Charles Foster Kane. The only clue the reporter has is the last word that Kane utters before he dies; it is that word that may hold the key to revealing the real Charles Foster Kane. Kane's public persona is a sham covering up a personality that is an enigma. The movie consists of a series of flashbacks as told by the people who were closest to Kane, and who despised him the most. The depicts Kane's life as a series of montages, with wide-angled and close-ups rapidly interspersed, depending on what feeling the movie is trying to evoke, all of which together convey the impression of a jumbled life in which the pieces don't quite fit together. At the start, Kane is young, dynamic, and determined to make things happen; by the end, he is defeated, deflated and behaving like a child. He is angry by the way he was rejected by his parents and has contempt for money, which he associates with the banker-guardian who Kane despises. Kane dedicates his life to spending as much money as he can, and in doing whatever it takes to maintain control, including building a palace and housing it with as many artifacts as he can buy as a way of insulating himself from a world which he finds hostile to him. Kane's life goes into a tailspin after he is caught cheating on his wife, destroying his reputation and revealing him as being a hypocrite. His second marriage, to his mistress, is also a disaster as Kane bullies her into becoming an opera singer just to prove to the world that he had in fact married a singer. He tries to buy her love and when she leaves him, he completely falls apart, utterly alone and unloved, having driven away the last person who had still cared for him. To suggest that Kane deliberately and maliciously used people would not be entirely correct. He was driven to act by psychological forces that distorted his ability to get close with people and ultimately led to his demise. As for the word rosebud, the reported never finds out what that word meant, but the meaning is revealed to the audience, leaving the audience knowing something that the reporter does not know. Citizen Kane is a remarkable movie. It has withstood the test of time, meaning that the movie is not dated and presents a story that would resonant with today's audience, in fact even more so that when the movie was first released in 1941. The acting is great and the cinematography is astounding. Who really was Charles Foster Kane? He had so much money and was known as a man of the people yet was alone. The acting is great. Dorothy Comingore's performance is especially powerful. Her role is the key to the movie. Actually this movie could have more aptly been titled Mrs. Citizen Kane because of the central role of Ms. Comingore's character. The story is as much about her as about Kane. The movie is timeless, its themes universal and contains performances that cover the gamut of human emotions.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WELLES, Orson. In 1938 a young, chubby man had a radio show in New York, in which he listed recipes for housewives. His listeners often called in, and they exchanged tips. One day, one by one, call after call came in about how little green men were killing women, raping animals, and offering free cakes. This last part particularly caught the young man's attention, and by the time a call came about how delicious the cakes and cookies were, he stormed out of the KCNYMA building and looked around for cakes, shouting "Leave some for me!". What he found on the street weren't Martians distributing cakes, but three journalists and a cameraman who were laughing hysterically. It was a practical joke. The footage of this hungry young man screaming for food at the sky was a unique hit during pre-main-feature reels shown in theaters across the nation. This young man was Orson Welles.It was this incident which spawned the phrase "to make an Orson out of yourself". This remarkably gifted actor, writer, director, producer, and devourer of small antelopes will best be remembered for "Citizen's Cake", a classic about a powerful magnate who like a magnet drew chocolate and vanilla to his enormous never-saturated belly. With this delicious masterpiece, which is still served in many cinemas with a cream topping, Welles also managed to make a movie that was well ahead of its time. Sadly, it is now well behind the times, like most 30s, 40s and 50s classics, and people only watch it to see the $200,000 cake which the cinematographer captured so superbly in all its fattening glory. "Citizen's Cake" was also the first movie to be served with a main course and desert. Welles has revolutionized the world of motion-pictures with his unique-yet-simple idea of combining film with food. His next movie, "The Magnificent Chocolate Pudding With A Cherry On Top Which Amberson Made" (previously filmed in 1925 as "The Pampered Tummy") won rave reviews for its stark, brutally neo-Breugelian depiction of a family of obese farmers during the Great Depression who refuse to put down their expensive chicken-legs and eat salads like everyone else. When it premiered in 1942, it was served with mayonnaise sauce and then apple-pie for desert, causing the likes of Charles Laughton and Edward G.Robinson to jump out of their seats and applaud until the palms of their hands bled (or until they got hungry again). When the movie opened nation-wide, many theater-owners gladly re-furnished their theaters to include tables on which roasted pork meat was served during the first half of the movie. During the second half of the movie, in which the farming family is faced with a salad-dressing they don't want, Welles decided on serving to audiences a special fish dish with little cookies shaped like dead Japanese soldiers. Considering that this was 1942, Welles couldn't have come up with anything more brilliant.Just when it seemed that he could do no wrong, his career took a downward slide. Welles was never content with being predictable so he discarded the idea of making yet another food-serving movie. He mused long about what next great invention he can bring to the world of cinema, and he came up with an idea that was as brilliantly original as it was ridiculously unprofitable: he was going to start a movie without finishing it. "Bits And Pieces" was the working title (official titles don't exist for unfinished movies) of a semi-drama about a family of zombies who decide to go to college so they may get socially accepted by their human neighbours, some of whose relatives they had eaten in the past. When the youngest zombie decides to drop out, the other zombies excommunicate him from Zombie Church, forcing him to join the humans, who are planning revenge. The humans are about to tell the young zombie of the secret zombie-killing machine that they built, but just at that moment the movie ends, leaving the viewer disappointed and upset. Critics loved Welles's concept, and praised "Bits And Pieces" for its "post-Eisensteinian reaffirmation of neo-Brechtian values that condone anti-Viscontian attacks on social pseudo-Marxism". The audiences, on the other hand, looted the theaters when they didn't get their money back.Totally oblivious to the financial disaster of that movie, Welles decided to expand on his unique brand of cinematic ideas by making another incomplete picture - only this time even the part that is filmed won't be edited in the proper order of the "story's" events. The working title was "What? Where? Why?" and was perhaps a drama roughly about some people doing some things. It was a major flop, but the critics were once again happy, calling his work "the most accomplished unaccomplished work of part-art to ever partly semi-grace the screen".Welles's next project was even more unlike any other ever before: he started a movie that was not only going to be unfinished, unedited, and unwatchable, but a movie without a script and without sound. The working title for it was "The...". European critics called it "the most satisfying cinematic creation of the 40s". Fans didn't call it anything: no one went to see his movies anymore. And they couldn't even if they wanted to because they weren't shown anywhere. At Cannes the film won for Best Movie Of All Time Even Though It's American and for Best Existentialist Movie That We Love Because We Won't Admit That We Don't Know What The Hell It's Really About And Call It Existentialist Because That Sounds So Very Mighty Impressive. Welles then decided on the ultimate "non-movie": a film without editing, sound, a script, and even without actors and dialogues. Only Welles himself appears in the movie, in two brief scenes in which he stands semi-nude on a city dump and looks as if though he is about to say something. I hit the word-limit?

		<fullReview>The ending is what really got to me. When Kane finally realizes he's become what he's hated, what he originally fought against. It's such a real tragedy of a human train wreck. Kane tried so hard to be a good man (without really knowing what one was), to use his power and wealth for the truth and benefit of his friends. I think it emphasized the importance having a loving family during childhood, especially a mother.The film laid the groundwork for many future villains of the silver screen: Norman Bates, Darth Vader, Lex Luthor, Dr. Evil. But it's fearfully symmetrical to our own society. Even if they aren't eccentric media magnates like Hearst. How many people could have turned out differently if they had someone that loved them since the day they were born, and even before? Is it truly art that imitates life, or does life imitate art? How many wealthy men swear to use their power for good but inevitably do not? And how many are loved by the world solely for their wealth and celebrity? Millionaires, billionaires, so called artists, athletes, people we worship? There's this scene where Kane is standing in front of what seems like thousands of people, and behind him the giant picture of himself as he's running for office, like many tyrants the symbol of the man becomes greater than the man himself. Basic lessons like how money can't buy you happiness, how philosophically everyone needs friends, and the way the film builds to a crescendo, all of it up to that memorable scene. Rosebud. That ultimate loss of childhood innocence and wishing with every bone in your body to take it all back, like it was a terrible nightmare. Not unlike the story of Frankenstein, this movie is about the making of a monster.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Non-chronological history of the ups and downs in the life of Charles Foster Kane, based on the character of Randolph Hearst</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Citizen Kane," released in 1941, was ahead of its time in cinematography. Many long cuts, showing action in real time, fill the film. The few short cuts are taken mainly to emphasize dialogue. This story of newspaper tycoon Charles Foster Kane is based loosely on the life of William Randolph Hearst, who fought the release of this film into theaters.The story is not told in chronological order. The first impression we get in this film is of a run down mansion, inhabited by a dying old man, whose last word in life was "rosebud." The quest of the film is to discover the meaning of this word."March of the News," a satire of the theater weekly "Time Marches On" newsreel, is footage of Kane documenting his lifetime, and gets the audience inside the life of this powerful, yet uncaring man. The story of his life is told through a series of flashbacks, some spanning many years through one dissolve. Kane collects statues, paintings, animals in a zoo, and a vast area for his home and castle in Florida known as Xanadu, based on the "castle" of William Randolph Hearst, who did his best to destroy the film before it was shown to the public. Charles Foster Kane is a montage of several real-life characters, Hearst among them.As a boy, Kane is removed from his mother's home because she has come into money, and wishes for the boy to be well cared for. In addition, the father is excited about receiving $50,000 each year during the boy's absence. The mother, played by a young Agnes Morehead of "Bewitched" fame, is solid, stoic and almost unfeeling at the loss of her child. Similarly, Kane does not visit his parents during the film, referring only to his mother's passing, and possessions he ought to go through.The shot of a portrait of the newsmen of "The Chronicle" dissolves into a shot of his new "Inquirer" staff. Kane paid these reporters well to come to work for him. One senses Kane has no scruples, despite the fact he gets his way by being charming. During an office celebration, Kane dances charmingly with chorus girls, his dancing reflected in an elaborate shot with his image reflected in the mirror as his friends Mr. Bernstein and Jedidiah talk of him as a great and famous man, and all sing an original some about Charle Kane. Kane announces his engagement, and consequent marriage to the niece of the President of the United States, Emily. He wants not only to fit in with the elite, but to have high society to bend to his whims. His is not a happy marriage, shown in a series of montage cuts over the breakfast table. His wife eventually leaves Kane and takes their son because Kane doesn't spend time with them, or understand and empathize with family feelings.He treats his wives like another of his many possessions, telling the women what they are, what they will think, and what they will do. His second wife pursues a career in opera, which is a mistake because she has no talent. Her misery falls back on him, but he pushes her to continue.Kane has political aspirations which burst like a bubble once his extramarital affair with the second woman is made public, and his first wife divorces him. The grandiosity in which Kane presents himself is actually very shallow, his work for his fellow man's benefit appears only in his early life. As an old man he is callous and uncaring of anything that doesn't have directly to do with him. "All he ever wanted was love," recollects Jedidiah as an old man.We learn of the meeting of Kane and his second wife on a street corner, as she leaves the drugstore with toothache medicine, and he has just been splashed with mud by a passing horse and buggy. Thety retire to her boarding house room, and his attempt at first seduction is quelled by her keeping the door open. Their relationship shown on screen is harmless, but the audience knows that more comes to pass between them. Kane loves Susan because she loves him, without realizing he is a wealthy powerful newspaper man. But, the more she knows him, the less she likes him.Kane pursues the governorship of the state, expressing his concern for the "working man." His dreams for the Presidency of the United States die, but out of his grasp because his affair is exposed. "A toast to love on my terms. That's the only terms that anyone really knows," says Kane when defeated at the hands of his precious working class, now represented by organized labor.Kane is a man of wealth and power, and builds an opera house in Chicago for his wife to sing in. As well, his newspapers across the country give her rave reviews. Only his friend, and arts editor prints a scathing review which Kane finishes as the man, Jedidiah Leland, his friend from college days passes out from drinking before he finishes the review of her performance. "Some kind of friend he is," shrikes his lame songstress, now wife.Despite a palace of 49,000 acres of scenery and statues, and the still being built compound/castle of Xanadu, Susan leaves Kane, and he erupts into a violent temper explosion in which he destroys Susan's room. Kane lives his final years alone, in what Leland refers to as his coliseum.As a group of reporters and photographers survey more possessions than can be counted, the audience sees Kane's sled, burning in an incinerator. Can one word really sum up the wishes of one's life?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would recommend getting the anniversary addition DVD and listening to the commentary and special features to those who didn't appreciate the movie. For its time it was a front runner. The 'star wars' of its day. As far as special effects and camera effects. Its hard to see all the innovation watching it today, because a lot of the innovations used in this movie are standard today. Welles is a genius, and was a stubborn genius at that. When they told him it couldn't be done he said 'watch me' and he did it. This movie is proof of that. I appreciated the movie and knew of some of the amazing things done for the first time in the movie, but when I watched the commentary, there was so much more that I was unaware of, I had a new found respect for the film and for the determination of the man behind it, who wouldn't compromise his vision.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Citizen Kane" is a very well-written movie with a great plot and wondrous character development centered around one man. What's more is how impressive of an achievement it is for the director, Orson Welles. It was his debut film and he directed, co-wrote and starred in it. It is a defining piece which, at least for me, serves as a basis for other films. I would categorize it as a drama/mystery film, though in some ways it resembles a tragedy. However, saying anymore would disclose too much information. The only advice I can give is this: when you watch it, watch it with a clear mind and be patient. The movie does take some time to get started, but patience pays off bountifully. After that the pace is perfect and keeps the viewer engaged. Not much more can be said of this film, just watch it and experience it for yourself.</fullReview>

The use of focus and the blitzing displays of multiple images are a true testament to the cinematographer, and was something you would rarely see in those times.It really helps as well that a fantastic script is used here to show an interesting take on the great American dream, and the acting is also top class.

When the newspaper takes off, their celebration includes Kane, along with about a dozen dancing girls, doing the exact same thing. It could be nothing, but the reason I noticed it was because it seemed kind of odd the way Jed did it. He moves past the pillar, then goes back and spins around it. Strange...

		<fullReview>Citizen Kane is wunderkind Orson Welle's first film and has been considered by critics and directors for the past 50 years as the best film ever made. It's #1 on the American Film Institute's top 100 best films. Charles Foster Kane is a publisher of a yellow journalism newspaper. He becomes rich and powerful and establishes a publishing empire. He builds a costly mansion for his wife, Xanadu. Citizen Kane is the story of his rise and fall. Joseph Cotten is Kane's friend and partner but their relationship deteriorates over the years. The structure of the movie is told in flashbacks which keeps the film moving. The movie was a box office flop. But for decades it's been discussed and dissected in film classes.

		<shortDescription>An epic facing the test of time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An unquestioned masterpiece of its time Citizen Kane holds up pretty well decades later. While some may find it a little slow by modern standards all in all it is easy to see why it is among the most celebrated films of all time. It is a fascinating story brilliantly told. It is also a film which was innovative on so many levels, most notably for its stunning cinematography. Brilliantly conceived and brilliantly executed by Orson Welles, Citizen Kane was a true triumph.Citizen Kane is the life story of Charles Foster Kane, rather obviously based on real-life newspaper mogul William Randolph Hearst. In a rather unique twist the film begins with Kane's death. Through the use of a newsreel obituary we are then told Kane's entire life story in the span of just a few minutes. But we will soon see there is so much more to this story. For a man who lived so much of his life in the public eye, Kane was in fact quite a mystery. One mystery he leaves behind is the meaning of his dying word, "Rosebud." A reporter is sent on a mission to find the meaning of that last word. Through interviews with those who knew him and flashbacks which tell the story behind the story we will follow the fascinating life of Charles Foster Kane. And perhaps if we can discover the meaning of "Rosebud" we can unravel the mystery of exactly who this man was.From beginning to end this is Orson Welles' film. His performance as Kane, spanning an entire lifetime from idealistic young man to bitter, old recluse is simply stunning. The film soars whenever Welles is on screen, especially in Kane's vibrant youth. When the film stops to let others tell Kane's story some of the magic is lost. All of the other performances, from a cast of mostly unknowns, are commendable. But this is Kane's, and by extension Welles' movie. Welles is a commanding presence and the film suffers for his periodic absences. Kane's story is a fascinating one and the circular manner in which it was told makes it even more thrilling. With each succeeding flashback another layer is peeled away and we learn more about who Charles Foster Kane really was. It is a life of tremendous peaks and mortifying valleys. For the viewer it is a thrilling journey to follow. It really is one of the great character studies of all time as we see Kane evolve over time and see what drives this extraordinarily successful yet seemingly unfulfilled man. And of course there is "Rosebud." Can a man of the stature of Charles Foster Kane really be explained in one word? That is the film's great mystery and it is a fascinating one. Put it all together and Citizen Kane gives you a truly unique and memorable experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tied with Star Wars?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The fact that Citizen Kane is tied with Star Wars with a score of 8.7 is a clear indication of how far we have declined as a culture. First off, let us take a quick look at Citizen Kane - the debut of Orson Welles, a 24 year old phenom - one of the few men in Hollywood deserving of the title of "genius". Citizen Kane was revolutionary, not only for its cinematic techniques, but for its profound nonlinear story. Add to that some stellar performances and a brilliant score, and you have one of the very best movies in the history of cinema. Contrast this to Star Wars, a movie similar in its dramatic score as well as its liberal use of special effects, but whose b-movie banal dialog and apathetic directing certainly give one pause when seeing it on IMDb's top ten.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It would be difficult at best to contribute any insight in what might be the most analyzed movie of all time. So I think I'd like to just give my initial impressions of this film after seeing it for the first time in over a decade. This is a hauntingly powerful work. This is a film that many will relate to and revisit mentally. The strength of the film lies in the writing. The unique way in which the story is revealed and the smart believable dialog. The technical aspects are also unique and the use of light is superb. It's one of the best and certainly one of the first. Some of these images will sear themselves through your eyes into your brain. Orson shows his story telling and visionary talent in this piece. He was well beyond his time which is why his peers booed this film multiple times during the academy awards. It's looks as though Orsen had the last laugh as this one time art house film becomes one of the films against which all others are measured.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Different Take on Citizen Kane</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have only watched Citizen Kane once, but I can already understand why so many people consider it a great movie. I am not speaking of the technical aspects of the movie, but of the actual story and the many layers to the story.There is the first layer of the story which has received the most attention.This layer is the story of Charles Kane, a wealthy tycoon who ruthlessly used his wealth and power to control and gain the affections of others. I think much has already been said about this layer so I will not explore it further.To me the true beauty of this movie is the great deal of mystery that surrounds Charles Foster Kane. The fact that the story of Kane is told by others adds a great deal of complexity to the movie. Many of the commentaries I have read on CK, seem to believe that the focus of the movie was Kane and that the other characters are there as windows through which we can view Kane. Unfortunately, after having seen movies like the Usual Suspects and Memento, I have a great deal of skepticism regarding events relayed to the viewer by a character in the movie. As we saw in Usual Suspects, such accounts may simply be utter fabrication, or as in Memento, they may be so clouded in self deception that they bare little resemblance to the actual truth. I believe that in considering Kane one must consider the characters who told the life of Kane. Those who give the harshest portrayal of Kane deserve the most scrutiny. At first glance is may seem that there is little information given about these characters, but almost every scene with a supporting character sheds light into that character's nature.Perhaps the most damaging account of Kane is given by Leland. However, one most remember a few things about this 'honorable' character. First through another character we first learn that Leland is an aristocrat who has lost all his wealth. We then watch as through much of the first part of the movie Kane satisfies his every whim and need. During this period we do not here him complain about Kane's cruel nature. It is not until Kane is humiliated in his bid for the Governorship, that Leland decides that he no longer needs Kane's friendship. But instead of resigning in protest, he asks to be transferred elsewhere. Just when his supposed friend needs him the most, Leland abandons him but still expects to be financially supported by him. In fact, it is rather difficult to pinpoint moments where Leland acts as a true friend towards Kane. Many of Leland's comments and actions reveal him to be a very selfish man who harbors a great deal of jealousy and resentment towards Kane. Thus Leland's account of Kane is hardly an objective accurate portrayal of the man. I think an examination of many of the other portrayals of Kane, by an analysis of the characters giving the accounts will yield much deeper insights into the movie. To me this movie has some similarities to Lermatov's 'A Hero of Our Time'. At first glance both stories appear to about deeply flawed men. However, the true theme of both stories is an indictment of the society and individuals that destroyed the potential greatness in these men. Kane's utterance of 'Rosebud' at the end of the movie is a manifestation of his desire for a different type of society, one that nurtures people through love and friendship, as opposed to one that worships money and power.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What did the poster say? "It's Terrific!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've taken my time before commenting on what is usually considered the great American film masterpiece, but at this point I feel up to it--having now watched the film eight times and read four books about it as well as watching the documentary "The Battle over Citizen Kane" twice. No, it doesn't take that much effort to understand the film, but research can embolden a person.The first comment so many people now make is that "Citizen Kane" is not a work of genius, but they're wrong; it is a work of genius--four genii in tandem. Herman Mankiewicz was a self-destructive, crazy, egotistical Hollywood genius long before Orson Welles would define that phrase (though he was not, as some have contended in recent times, a Hollywood intellectual--he was a master of lowbrow screwball comedy in the 1930s--see Pauline Kael's book "Raising Kane"); Orson Welles really was a genius, for all the things he wasn't; Greg Toland is perhaps the most famous and celebrated cinematographer in history to this day; and Bernard Herrman wrote seemingly every memorable film score from 1940 through 1970 (including what I consider the greatest film score of all time, "Psycho")."Citizen Kane" also did not receive bad reviews upon its release; it received unbelievable raves. I read over 20 contemporary reviews of the film and over half of them called it the greatest film of all time, and the least adulatory called it a "good film" but not quite a "great film." How we've had it come down to us from history that "Kane" received bad reviews upon release, I don't know; but it is patently untrue. It received fewer reviews than many films because of the Hearst boycott, but those it did receive were all adulatory.Now that I've dispelled some annoying myths about the film, I'll speak of the film itself. Perhaps its most notable quality is its beautiful and strange look created by Greg Toland and Orson Welles (how much each did is a matter of some conjecture). It is loaded with brilliant high-contrast lighting; large, mostly vacant, stage-like sets; and odd camera angles that give it a distinctive look that would then be appropriated by the film noir genre.However, what truly holds the film together is one of the greatest characters and performances in film history. Not truly William Randolph Hearst but rather an amalgam of big media types, including Hearst; Charles Foster Kane is an amazing character and Orson Welles's performance is nothing short of extraordinary--from the somewhat awkward dancing in the song scene to the unsure look on his face when Jed Leland asks for the Declaration of Principles to the way his physical mannerisms change as he ages, Welles crafts a wonderful performance. But if you're looking to define Kane by one moment in the film, it's not "Rosebud," it's the speech Jed Leland gives about him, saying correctly, "that's his story."The other performances in the film are also top-notch, highlighted by Dorothy Comingore as Susan Alexander, Joseph Cotten (whose performance may even equal Welles's, though his part is much less showy) as Jed Leland, and the beautiful Ruth Warrick as Emily Monroe Norton.Of all of this film's innovations, its use of music may be the most important. Music as a scene transition device was a radio trick, but since "Citizen Kane," it's become standard in film as well. Bernard Herrman provided a score that is mostly brilliant, if at times a bit over-dramatic."Citizen Kane" is fascinating and, above all, fun. It's loaded with great small pieces of humor ("Kane Elected"--"Fraud at Polls," for example) and has all of the intellectual and academic fulfillment one could want in a film. It's not, as are many "great" movies, something only for film-studying intellectuals; "Citizen Kane" is a wonderful work for the masses all the way around.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great picture but heavily influenced</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Citizen Kane" is awesome, but it tied together a lot of stuff that was used in bits and pieces previously in other great films. If you view "Stagecoach", "Rebecca" and even "The Grapes of Wrath", you'll see little things in them that Welles borrows and expands on (both in terms of technique and performance). He obviously spent a lot of time screening great flicks prior to making CK. I read somewhere that he was especially influenced by John Ford's "Stagecoach" and if you take a look at that film, which by the way was shot in 1939, you'll see stuff like great low angle snap shots of actors, similar claustrophobic set design, deeper focus then normal due wide angle lenses rather then lighting/depth of field and some little bits where Ford used sparse sets/props and shafts of window light to convey atmosphere (very theatrical).Light and shadow play is even more dominant in Alfred Hitchcock's "Rebecca" and watching a pristine print of Rebecca you can't help but be reminded of the lighting, art direction and framing techniques used in "Citizen Kane".Not to put Welles and CK down in anyway -- CK deserves all the praise it gets and more, but I hate to see great films prior to it get ignored.So, if you enjoyed the atmosphere and quality of "Citizen Kane", do yourself a favour and see the other pics I mentioned. The decade of 1939-1949 produced some incredibly moody, marvelous b&amp;w cinema including "A Portrait of Jenny" and of course the crowning jewel, "Citizen Kane".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could Fit Today</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I finally had a chance to look at this film and I have to say that it was all I expected and more. The things that struck me about it was that there were two main messages. One was the fact that its main message was that power corrupts and that absolute power corrupts absolutely. Kane turned out to be like most men who achieve power and when they do they aren't satisfied with the power they get. It also showed how Kane would step over any and anyone to get that power. Also, this film showed how the media tries to manipulate people and this is especially true in today's world of 24 hour news and the internet. Even though Kane was said to have been based on William Randolph Hearst, the person of Kane could also fit media barons like Ted Turner and Rupert Murdoch, especially Murdoch. Murdoch is definitely someone in the Kane mold and if anyone had a chance to make a film like this today, they probably would use him for the model. This film is definitely the classic that I have heard about.</fullReview>

Nobody has ever shot half as he did. Just look a the low-angle shot in the office. Awesome! "Rosebud" is actually the symbol of Citizen Kane's youth, which is the only thing that failed in his life. I mean, he was more powerful than anyone, he was married to a beautiful actress (who tried to commit suicide), but he didn't have a real youth. The first scene shows Welles know how to hold a camera, as all the rest of the movie. Watch also the other films by Orson Welles, and the movies in which he starred. A genius!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>POSSIBLE SPOILERS Even though I think this is possibly the best movie ever made, I can actually understand why someone would not like it. There is some research that needs to be done before seeing Kane to fully understand it's importance on the film industry, even up to today.There are little things about Kane that one may not know without doing some reading beforehand. For example, little things we take for granted in movies today were done first in Citizen Kane, like the filming of scenes that showed ceilings. Kane was the first Hollywood picture that had a storyline that wasn't beginning/middle/end, but on the contrary, the main character(Kane) dies at the beginning of the movie. The use of deep focus photography, ect ect. It may be a lot of boring tech stuff, but without knowing how it was used in Kane would take away from the experience when watching it.Then of course, is the comparison with William Randolf Hearst, which I won't go into because you can read about that in your own spare time.To me, this film is a brilliant display of the psychology behind a man who has SO much, but at the same time has less than the poorest individuals alive.If you do the research before seeing this film, then I would say it would be well worth seeing. In fact, I would say it's a must see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You are all probably thinking that I'm one of those people who like movies only because other people like them too. But I am in the firm belief that Citizen Kane stands as a masterpiece of the art of storytelling. As avid film watchers we all love to be told stories, and we love them to be told well. Citizen Kane is a milestone in American cinema, and is living proof of what a great movie can be. I can't think of another movie more complete and fully realized then Citizen Kane. Citizen Kane was made in 1941. Film makers have had 63 years to make a more influential film. I think we'll be waiting a very long time.Citizen Kane was starred, written, and directed by Orson Welles, and it was his FIRST movie!!! RKO Pictures took a big chance giving a first time film maker so much influence. Maybe if today's studios took more chances better movies would be made. There's nothing more I could possible say except watch and enjoy.</fullReview>

A newsreel company sends one of its best men to talk to the surviving people in Kane's life to find out of all the things to be in Kane's final thoughts, why Rosebud. This film is worthy of every piece of praise that has ever been said about it. Watching it again last night for at least the sixth time, it still fascinates me like no other movie can (or will). Acting, script, directing, cinematography, and music scoring, are impossible to be any more appropriate or better. Hard to realize that Welles can make such a work of art and only be 25 at the same time. Rating- can't be anything besides a 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Citizen Kane review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Aside from being argued as the technical genius of films, 1941's Citizen Kane also delivered plenty of ahead-of-its-time issues to the forefront: monopolization and celebrity doom. Citizen Kane is a film that charts the four-step life of entrepreneur Charles Foster Kane, a dramatic on-screen version of William Randolph Hurst, who merged his vast array of national newspapers and radio stations into an evil empire. The buying out (or making up) of other papers, such as the Chronicle for instance, along with his usual yellowish editorial tactics, helped the Enquirer become the voice of America; again only to be propagandized by one voice: Kane's.With popularity that skyrocketed nearly everyone but the president, Kane (the always masterful Mercury Theatre Radio guru, Orson Welles) looked to shoot even higher in politics-ala Larry Flynt-only to be dragged down by the same tabloid controversy he once seemingly mastered. This case will also recollect to the near chagrin Arnold Schwarzenegger took just days before election in this year's California gubernatorial race. Kane was sought fostering with a `singer,' much like the fun Arnold had during his `groping' days of Pumping Iron.Nothing in the film seems to swarm with more controversy, however, than Kane's final word, and the very search for, `Rosebud.' Was this Kane's second mistress? Or yet another one of his four-billion statues crated into a mover's worst nightmare? As you'll discover in the film's culmination, Rosebud was the only love Kane had for whom or what it was, and not because Kane wanted the love back; a rarity, since the gist of the film is about Kane desire for everyone's love. Again, this opening and closing to Citizen Kane is surrounded by the same aura the tabloid-edged Enquirer swelled upon the nation; of course it seems likely Kane would not have had it any other way. And much like America will always watch Schwarzenegger films (even more so now because he is governor), America then still read Kane newspapers, as Citizen Kane himself was always news-and if perhaps not the greatest, the most important film of all time.5/5 stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is definitely a movie the viewer needs to pay attention to the whole time. The movie has a lot of depth and symbols throughout the whole story. This is the movie that started a lot of trends for other movies.This movie is believed to be based on the life of journalist William Hearst. The film starts out with a very dark scene, a castle on a hill, symbols throughout the whole scene, such as a sign saying `No Trespassing' which shows the character Charles Kane was a very private man. Then the scene shows Charles Kane played by Orson Wells dying in his bed with the last words of `Rosebud'. The movie fallows his life by interviewing people who knew Kane and journalists trying to figure out the mystery of Rosebud.Orson Wells must have been so busy by directing , producing and starring in such a great film. Even though he was doing several jobs in this movie he still put out a great acting performance portraying an angry, sometimes happy, sometimes sad, lonely man. He made it very believable. Agnes Moorehead who played Kane's second wife Mrs. Mary Kane did a great job at playing an annoying wife. The viewer watching this movie will most likely get annoyed watching her.The depth of this movie was amazing. It was very symbolic and artistic, which made you think. The special effects were also very well done, for that era. The make-up was excellent, on the actors, Orson Wells went from a man of 25 to an older man very realistically.Citizen Kane made movies what they are today. This film was a big step in special effects and artistry and script. It's a classic movie everyone should see.The rating of this film is 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is definitely one of the best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie upon which all others are based is and always will be `Citizen Kane.' Although loosely based on the life of the infamous William Randolph Hearst, `Citizen Kane' depicts a power hungry man who's life spirals from the lime light down in to darkness. This movie filled with superior lighting, music, camera work and acting is possibly one of the best movies of all time. The movie actually starts off at Charles Foster Dane's death. As he whispers the name Rosebud. A snow globe is dropped and shatters. With this the flame of Kane's life is blown out. The audience is then shown a news report about the incidents of Kane's life and opinions from critics. When this news reel is over, a room full of reporters decide that they need to figure out what the word Rosebud meant in Kane's life. This leads to the rest of the movie as they interview Kane's closest friends. In which the characters in the movie never find out, but only the audience alone is shown the missing piece of the puzzle. The beginning of the movie starts out with the upward shot of Xanadu, Kane's castle. The end of the movie is shown with a downward shot. This shows the beginning and end of Kane's life, and is just one of the great camera shots in `Citizen Kane.' Another wonderful shot is when Kane is shouting at Gettys. He is looking down stairs that descend in a spiral. This symbolizes the same spiral that Kane experiences in his life. Probably the most profound shot in the movie is when the candle is blown out during Kane's death. This obviously shows that Kane just died. Rosebud, the last words of Kane serves as the plot for this movie. Although the audience finds out in the end that it is the name of his childhood sled, it can also symbolize other aspects of Kane's life. A rosebud starts to sprout and bloom in the spring. Which symbolizes hope, and a new beginning, but then it soon blooms and dies. This is much like situations and people in Kane's life, after one rose blooms and falls he must find another. Kane was a man that was always searching, but never found a rosebud that never dies but always in bloom.This movie on a 1-10 scale is rated an 9</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Its hard to believe that Orson Welles was only 25 or 26 when he wrote, directed and starred in Citizen Kane. It is also hard to believe that this film was not a box office hit when it was first released (Its A Wonderful Life wasn't either). I saw this film in a college class I took on movie making and thought it was wonderful. Time has not "dated" it at all. Its still as wonderful today as when it was first released. The opening is the best when they have that "news on the march" that details Kanes death and tumultuous life. Welles based Kane on William Randolph Hearst and his powerful newspapers did everything they could to stop it from being released. It was only with the passage of time that people realized how great it is. I for one loved the symbolism of "Rosebud". People say that it was only the name on his toy sled but it was more then that. Kane had achieved great wealth and power but died a bitter, lonely unhappy old man. All his wealth couldn't buy him happiness. In his last moments, he was thinking back to the simple joys of his childhood. In a sense that toy sled tossed into the fire was Kane's Paradise Lost. Orson made a bad mistake, he directed the greatest film of his career at the very beginning of his career and basically had no where to go but down. The Magnificent Ambersons, Journey Into Fear, The Stranger, The Lady From Shanghai, MacBeth, Othello, Mister Arkadian, Touch Of Evil, The Trial, Chimes At Midnight. Welles could never top Citizen Kane.</fullReview>

Similar to how Jimmy Stewart wants an image of a woman(Vertigo), Charles Foster Kane longs for something that isn't there. Humankind is always longing. What you need or want becomes what you have, and so you need or want more, and so forth. Kane is a man who can have everything he wants, yet he still longs for the unattainable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So sayeth Charles Foster Kane -- a bigshot stock-holder who is arrogant and cynical. But this is what interests us; not the honest american making his way through honest methods -- we like to see scandals and heart-ache. It enthralls us.What made this film important was it's narrative, which transcended typical movie fare and pioneered new age film-making. The visual trickery and camera mastery is so apparent. Welles created this at age 25 -- I applaud him.This film is artistic in its direction, but it's story is much more poignant, even today. One thing I remember off the top of my head was the cockatoo that lacked and eye - it squawked and then dissolved. Leaving John Q. movie-goer wondering what the deal was with this one. So, this guides us into looking deeper. There are moments of apparent visual trickery - and then there are moments of genius subtlety. The shadows that often look so really are often hinting at something behind the eye, something we have to feel instead of see. Is this the best ever? I don't think it bests The Godfather, but I think it runs a close race and dismisses other classics with ease.A+: A grand achievement that will long be remembered. Hollywood directors should focus more on deeply intimate stories instead of their regular tripe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Greatest Movie of All-Time...no Most Influential...yes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Citizen Kane is a ground breaking film that went to higher levels in cinematography, film directing, and special effects. This was the first movie at its time to be seen in a way that no other movie even came close to. Hollywood was never the same after the release of Citzen Kane in 1941.What best describes this movie is: It's about one man's life and his dying words..."rosebud." How he gained the world, but in the process lost his soul. The plot is simple... One reporter tries to recollect Kane's life by meeting with Kane's closest friends to find out what "rosebud" means. Each person tells their story about who Kain was in a random, non-chronological order that makes Kane's life like a jig-saw puzzle. You just have to figure out what it all means and what his dying words "rosebud" has to do with it.To be honest I did not enjoy the film. The story was very dull, nor did you really care for the characters, and the ending is not one you would expectedly unexpect. Possibly the only entertainment you're going to get out of this film is by analyzing the special effects, cinematography, and directing. For these are the only three aspects of the film that made it in my opinion not the greatest movie of all time, but the most influential movie of all-time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are many reasons WHY I like Citizen Kane. One of the main reasons is how it effected me after repeated viewings. I was curious to know why this movie is considered to be great so I watched it. But the first time I thought it was only 'decent'. But CITIZEN KANE was the kind movie that grew on me. When Kane was a small child, he was poor, he was living with his parents, and he was happy. But as he grew up and began to live a rich and powerful life, he threw away the love he had before for power and fame, and in doing so, he lost one of the most important things in his life, and that was happiness. He had everything. Everything that he ever dreamed of, but that wasn't enough, he was missing something in his life. I always remember the saying that 'money cannot buy happiness', and to me, that was the lesson I learned from this movie. If I say any more I will probably spoil the movie but I will say that Orson Welles really brought the character to life. We, the audience really get to know him. From his humble beginning to his tragic end. And I guess that there is a Kane in all of us, how we might long for power and forget what means the most to us, but we should look back at this movie and take a deep look at Kane's life. This was a complicated character, and as we go along with the movie we can finally understand him as the character itself is built more and more by structure---------until the final climax, we see the looks on his voice and hear him say his final words.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...but Citizen Kane remains one of the great cinematic achievements of all time. The greatest? Who's to say? There are many criteria upon which to base one's opinions of films, so I think it's impossible to say that ANY film is, in its totality, the greatest film ever made. What this film IS, however, is a tremendous achievement and a cinematic landmark...as well as an incredible chapter in Hollywood history.A boy genius comes to Hollywood and writes his own bill...he can write, direct, and star in his own full-length motion picture. Initially working around the idea of a film adaptation of Conrad's Heart of Darkness (a feat which would not be accomplished until Coppola's Apocalypse Now). The end result, however, may very well have been THE most controversial film in the history of cinema. Natural Born Killers has NOTHING on Citizen Kane, in terms of controversy. But beyond all the controversy, fascinating as it is, Orson Welles's achievement here is astonishing. Even if Citizen Kane isn't the greatest film of all time, it is certainly the most auspicious and brilliant debut that a 25 year old filmmaker has ever made...in Hollywood, or anywhere else.I'll spare you my admiration of Welles's direction, Tolland's cinematography, the make-up, the lead performances, and the writing. I'm sure you can find that in countless reviews for this film. What I wish to express is the reason that some people cannot see the brilliance of this film for what it truly is. Citizen Kane was made in a different era...a time when films didn't have to move at fever pitch in order to keep a viewer's attention. It was an age before MTV, an age before the attention span of the average audience went to hell. Films moved more slowly and gracefully in the '40s. But when audiences who were raised on glitzy, rapid-fire edited, car chase-laden action movies go back and attempt to watch true classics like Citizen Kane or Anatomy of a Murder, they find those monumental films to be "slow"...or "talky"...or even "boring." It's unfortunate...but it's true. Ever shortening attention spans have rendered many great films unwatchable by millions of viewers.All I can say is that Orson Welles achieved magic and true brilliance with this film...and that its impact on the world of cinema will never be duplicated. Perhaps that's what it means to be "the greatest."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Looking back to 1941 when this film was made, it still amazes me how this film succeeds on so many different levels. It should serve as a tool to those who would think that making a movie is easily accomplished, when it is obvious that to produce a film of this quality it takes a great deal of imagination and effort. This single movie has pushed the boundaries of film making to new limits and opened the door for directors and producers to explore the unlimited possibilities when given the freedom to do so. Citizen Kane is a victory for all who love great movies!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Citizen Kane is an incredible achievement from both a technical and an artistic point of view. Welles made use of innovative film techniques to achieve a larger artistic end, to tell a story.In a time where Hollywood films were far from innovative, Citizen Kane was an exception to the rule. Citizen Kane's plot centres around one word, `Rosebud', Kane's dying word. It is difficult to imagine that a great two-hour film was based on this single item. The search for Rosebud's meaning was a tongue-in-cheek jab at what Kane's life represented, the use of yellow journalism and the omnipotent power of the media. The great Citizen Kane was reduced to what he used to make his own fortune, sensationalism and gossip. The great irony of the movie is that Thompson proved to be greater than Kane; he came to realize that a man's life cannot be diminished to the sensationalism of one word and its meaning. Kane's life was depicted from five different angles and from five different people. Although each of them had different view of who Kane really was, none of the five individuals knew the meaning of Rosebud. During Thompson's search he encountered many different versions of Kane's life, but only one was common. Kane was a man who had it all, except what he wanted the most `Love'.Symbols are used throughout the film to stress the concepts that are of vital importance. These symbols include colours, sound, and space. During the film, white symbolizes purity. In the beginning of the film Kane is still pure, as he is only a little boy. To symbolize this purity he is surrounded by white snow. A second time when white is used to symbolize purity is found when Kane meets Susan, while he is wearing white. Immediately after Kane meets Susan, he begins to see her as a mother figure and decides that he must have her. Sound also plays a crucial role. From the outset of the film this effect is used to draw the audience's attention to certain important details that will affect the development of the story. One of the events where sound is used in this fashion is the scene where Kane's mother is negotiating his future. At the same time that Kane's mother is breaking up the family, Kane is playing outside and he screams `Union Forever.' Welles uses space in a fantastic manner; he is able to portray the relationships between the characters by the distance between them. Even if there were no words in the film, the plot could sill be discovered by simply observing the transition of the distances. The distance between Kane and his wives tell of the degradation in Kane's relationships with both of them, there is no need for words. Welles' use of timeline may be the beginning of what has been called the MTV style. Citizen Kane broke the rule that a film had a specific beginning, a single ending and a long middle. The film starts at the end, proceeding to some place in the middle, only to go again to some part close to the end, and goes on and on.Citizen Kane is not easily placed into one category of film or style. This film has characteristics of both Melies and Lumieres, it is surreal, but at the same time realistic. As for technique, this film can be ranked among the best ever watched. On the artistic side of the film, this is still to be decided. Citizen Kane is one of those films that can be viewed over and over, and each time there are new things to be discovered. As criticism towards society and the media, Citizen Kane is powerful but at the same time cruel. It brings the message that `love on your own terms' can be the perfect recipe for dying alone. Citizen Kane has made it to my favourites, but is not on the top of the list.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After all the hype surrounding this movie I really had no idea what to expect. I have heard people rave about `Citizen Kane', but I have also heard people on the opposite end of the spectrum. I can honestly say that I really enjoyed it. It might have been a little better had I not known what `Rosebud' was, but I cannot allow pop culture to detract from my appreciation of a classic film.AFI ranks `Citizen Kane' as its number one film of all time, while I may not share this opinion I think it is definitely worthy of some praise. As a directorial debut Welles shines. In addition to directing the film he also co-wrote the script and played the lead role. Many view `Citizen Kane' as a slap in William Randolpf Hearst's face, but I think there is so much more than that. The underlying theme is a man's search for lost happiness. `Rosebud' turns out to be no more than a sled, but it symbolizes the only time In Charles Foster Kane's life that he ever felt love. He spends the rest of his life trying to force people to love him, only to realize his mistake in the end. It is this theme that captured me. I could identify with it. `Rosebud' was the key that allowed me to look into C.F. Kane's heart and understand him. `Rosebud' gave the movie its humanity, a humanity that is so close to us all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the best movie of the century. It was original and extremely well crafted. Orson Welles was a genius. Hollywood did not like him because at the time he was a maverick. He didn't play by their rules. Citizen Kane had lighting and set design from the stage. This made the camera angles even more extraordinary. This was not common at the time. The acting by all was superb. The story technique of using flashbacks has been copied and copied. It was by far the best use of this. It is an original work.

		<shortDescription>The best film anybody will ever see</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even before "Citizen Kane," Orson Welles, was Hollywood's favorite little prodigy and no one could wait to see how he would fare with his first shot at motion picture directing. At 25 years old, with his directorial debut, he made the greatest movie of all time.There just isn't anything that you can't like about "Kane." The story is compelling and timeless, the visuals spectacular, the artwork enigmatic and gothically beautiful, the ensemble acting an unsung triumph, the score haunting and suggestive, and through it all we can feel Welles' deft touch weave this powerful tale of a man's lifelong battle with himself like no other director could have dreamed of doing.The amazing thing about Charles Foster Kane, himself, is we only see him as others did. The only things that we, for a fact, know that he said or did were either included on the newsreel or the classic opening scene, where we know that he uttered "Rosebud." Rosebud. What a fantastic imagining by Herman J. Mankiewiecz. An entire man's life is about to be judged because of a childhood memory he utters as he dies. As touching and heartbreaking as the best parts of the movie.The best part, however, about "Citizen Kane" is the effect it had on American movies. As if this wasn't a great enough film to begin with, it had such a strong influence on future filmmakers that one can sometimes pick out Kane-esque shots. In short, see "Citizen Kane" once or three hundred times and you will agree that nobody ever did it better than this kid did on try #1.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Most people who go around brandishing 1/10's for this movie are probably trying to stir a reaction, or are on a self-affirmation quest of sorts. Hey, if you watch this movie and don't enjoy it at all, do yourself a favour and don't try to rewrite history. Bashing the hell out of this movie is every bit as worthwhile as bashing Beethoven's 9th Symphony, or Da Vinci's Mona Lisa; no one cares. This IS one of the most significant, important, influential and striking movies ever made, and it has been relevant and innovative for more than 60 decades, and it's bound to be so for a long time. Get over it. Share your feelings if you wish but don't try to look smart. So there.Those who haven't yet watched the movie NEED to watch it if they have an interest on cinema, on what it represents and what it has represented for all this time. The movie is an important piece to movie history just like "Rosebud" was important to Kane. The thing is, this movie isn't just a historical document. It's a powerful, gripping story that is still significant to this day. I'm not willing to tell the whole story here - many have done that before me. It's more worthwhile to advise you to watch the movie, instead. This isn't a story to hear - it's a story to WITNESS.Movie buffs go crazy for this movie, and they have a right to do it. Citizen Kane's technical innovations and clever storytelling style really do play tricks with the viewer, and make an apparently simplistic (only on the surface!) story come alive. Of course, it's not a movie for everyone. One who's utterly unimpressed with the movie won't get any beating from ME. But even the most impatient ones should at least try to look through the surface. It's a rewarding movie, and deserves no less than 10 stars. Give the critics some credit on this one, for one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the music</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the help of the brilliant musical director, Bernard Herrmann, who had never worked on a film before, Welles Expands the use of music to build and structure his film. The same musical phrases will recur at seemingly unrelated moments, tying the scenes together. Or be subtly changed each time they appear anew. A melody such as the "What is his name?" tune is sung vigorously at the Inquirer Party, is heard again played more aggressively at the political rally, becomes sadder after the election defeat, and reappears behind the credits. The breakfast scene between Kane and Emily was cut to correspond to the music, Welles patterning the montage of shots, one shot successively superimposed on and then replacing another, to follow the movement of what Herrmann called his "ballet suite." Music had seldom been used so cleverly or given such an important role in a film before.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So, here goes. While I'm only 16, I've of course heard about Citizen Kane. I honestly don't know that much of the back story. William Randolph Hearst sounds foreign and I can honestly say that I know nothing about Orson Welles. All I knew about Citizen is that it is widely considered the "greatest" film ever made.When I saw that it was playing on TMC (one of my favorite channels), I figured that I should watch it to see what all the hype was about. I often watch black and white movie because I'm entranced by the stars, but the movies themselves often leave a lot to be desired. The timing, the pace, that corny music that always punctuates every important scene, it all detracts from the quality and value of the movie. The plot itself is often eclipsed by the mystique, the intensity of it's stars.But this movie was different. I know some things about the technical aspects of film and theatre, and I can honestly say that simple things such as the lighting were arresting. When Suzanne kneels on the floor and Charles walks near her demanding that she continue singing, my heart tightened. Just that one shadow affected me more than anything has in awhile.Now I understand the attraction of Citizen Kane. For once, while watching a movie, I felt suspense. Not the odd, manufactured suspense that movies today FORCE you to feel, but real suspense. Who or what was Rosebud and what did it mean to this man? I had to watch until the end (which is rare for me, I usually flip channels after 30 or so minutes). I had to see the final culmination of this man's life.And whether it's 1941 or 2005, that drama and suspense is what truly matters in a film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ahead of its' time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The main thing that stands out when watching Citizen Kane is that the techniques used in the cinematography were decades ahead of their time. Specifically, the rotoscoping in of reflections, the camera angles, and the "pseudo-interview". The camera angles used in Citizen Kane were not really picked up for common use until the early to mid 1980's. This film was the first to really integrate the perspective of the viewer to make an emotional and psychological impact outside of the typical movies of the time. It was a risk taken by Orson Welles, and has had impacts that reverberate to this day in the movies that we watch, though some directors do not even know "why" a camera angle holds so much impact. Viewing this movie as a time capsule of the art-deco period, and taking in the "might of man" attitude of the time period, it is easy to sense how Leni Riefenstahl and Ayn Rand both influenced the directors vision.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More to Citizen Kane than meets the eye...yet more direct than the modern crap covering screens</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Citizen Kane was one of the first movies to portray the American Dream as anything less than attractive. As a child, Kane is fully happy as he plays in the snow outside the family's home, even though his parents own a boarding house and are quite poor. He has no playmates but is content to be alone because peace and security are just inside the house's walls. When Thatcher removes Kane from this place, he's given what seems like the American dreamâ?'financial affluence and material luxury. To most this would seem to be a piece of Heaven blessing them with good fortune for a happy life. However, Kane finds that those things don't make him pleased, and the exchange of emotional security for financial security is ultimately unfulfilling. The American dream is an empty, hollow shell for Kane. As an adult, Kane uses his money and power not to build his own happiness but to either buy love or make others as miserable as he is. When one watches the movie it seems that his purchasing of the newspaper was a fun venture. But if you look closer into the reality of the film, the newspaper was simply a means of touching thousands of people, and ultimately gaining their affection. Kane's wealth isolates him from others throughout the years, and his life ends in loneliness at Xanadu. He dies surrounded only by his possessions, poor substitutions for true companions. His last word is "Rosebud." Child hood and that which he missed out on. "I could have been great man without all of this money."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rosebud Revisited</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen Citizen Kane numerous times over the last 25 years and studied it in film class years ago while in collage and it remains my favorite film of all time. Not because of the awards and accolades it has won but because it taught me to look at film and film narrative in a different way.Having said that I do admit that I understand why currently some younger viewers don't appreciate it as a masterpiece. In the age of MTV film-making and CGI inspired scripts, many current moviegoers don't have the patience to allow a film to unfold before them, taking literally until the final frame to complete the story and characterization. The truth is that film production has come so far since 1942 that we take for granted many of the storytelling and cinematography techniques that Wells employed. Although he may not have invented these techniques, Wells used them in groundbreaking ways and his influence can still be seen in movies today. There is also little recognition of the film within the context of when it was made. Wells, at 26 years old, had produced a very controversial story using film techniques that were quite new to movie making. Using a cast of mostly unknown stage and radio actors he managed to make a movie that wasn't simply the filming of a stage play, which was a common style of the period. Add the controversy created by the William Randolph Hearst connection (and the fact that Hearst newspapers of the day wouldn't carry ads for the film) and you see a movie-making story that has become a part of American culture.I'm looking forward to re-watching Citizen Kane, this time with my 15-year-old daughter. Hopefully, she'll get it? even without Orlando Bloom or Lindsey Lohan.On the subject of Rosebud:I never believed Kane's dying word 'rosebud' had a deep psychological meaning such as a representation of everything he had lost or his inability to love. Some have suggested rosebud was 'mantra for memories of a lost childhood' and the separation from his parents which lead to his lonely life. To me, it was simply the last memory of an old man. Spurred by the visual of Susan's snow globe he recalled one of his oldest memories. At the end of the film, when asked what he thinks Kane's final word Rosebud explains, the reporter says, 'I don't think it explains anything. I don't think any word explains a man's life.' In actuality, Rosebud, a simple memory of Charles Foster Kane's, was Orson Wells' catalyst for telling the story of Citizen Kane.I've always had a certain fascination with the character of Charles Foster Kane and Orson Wells' portrayal of him as well as many of the themes of the movie. One moment likable and attractive, the next despicable, Well's played Kane with a charisma that has been rarely equaled on film, (or in Wells' subsequent films.) Themes such as wanting to be loved but being incapable of giving love and a man's value being measured by his 'collections' are fascinating to me. Even now, with all the modern advances in film technique and the hundreds of movies I've seen, I still get chills at certain points of the film. I first saw the film at 20 years old and for me the movie represents my awaking to seeing film as art. It also gave me the desire to look below the surface at Wells' motivations and created for me a fascination with his style.Equally fascinating is the 'making of ' story behind Citizen Kane. The power struggles and controversies that surrounded the production of the film are Hollywood legend.Most people with whom I've discussed Citizen Kane, who love the movie, don't really care whether it's considered the 'best film of all time'. The awards and recognition the film has earned are not determining factors in how I look at Citizen Kane and my passion for the film goes beyond any websites top film listing. In the end, one's favorite films tend to be determined by how they touch you personally and not the box office or acclaim they attain.</fullReview>

Beyond that a gondola, and through a golf course, a mote and draw bridge, and finaly up to the single lit window in the highest tower of the castle only to have the light diminish.At the time of its release Citizen Kane was a revolutionary film. The camara technieque of fading from one chene to another. And still today it is a great movie. The movie Citizen Kane is unique in such a way that there is no other movie like it. It begins at the end of Kane's life. Kane's life story is told in parts by many people, from many diffrent pionts of veiw. From the uptite banker that took him in as a boy, and his best friend (if he had any), to his second wife.The movie fallows a reporter that is searching for one thing and one thing only,Kane's dying word; 'Rosebud'. The reporter learns Kane's life story and gleans from it nothing that can help him discover the meaning of 'Rosebud', though its meaning is revealed to the audience at the end, and the movie comes together and what realy mattered to to Kane is told. And as it turns out Kane's happiest days were as a boy with his folks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is not my favourite film, but if I try to set aside my personal taste, and judge from a general point of view (far more difficult...), I have to say this is the greatest of all time.What's most impressive is how modern this film looks. If a movie like this was made today, I'd say it is twenty years ahead of its time. And it was made more than sixty years ago! Camera angles, directing style, originality of the framing, everything is more peculiar and, in a sense, more modern than what we're used to. The best example is maybe the multiple reflection of Kane image in the mirrors. How many modern films have a shot so original, so simple, and so evocative?The other great aspect is that this is by far the best example of character development in all cinema history. Kane is a like a real person, always coherent with himself, but never banal or predictable: a lesser writer would have described him simply as a greedy man that makes everything to make money (and this would have been a very banal and boring story). Welles shows us the drama of a man that use his great wealth to make other people love him, and at the end of its life faces his failure, as he dies alone. Welles' performances, both acting, writing, and directing, are astonishing, given that he was only 25 at the time, and all the other actors are great too.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pick up any guide about movies, particularly one written by a professional movie critic, and "Citizen Kane" is rated the best or near the top of the list of movies ever made. There is no question that Orson Welles coalesced many film-making techniques of the thirties, as well as innovations of his own, in producing "Citizen Kane". Additionally, at the time of release in 1941, there was great pressure brought to bear on Welles and the studio not to put the film out due to its (fictionalized) portrayal of powerful publisher William Randolph Hearst. All very admirable, but does it make for a great movie? Not in my opinion.The story itself is not all that remarkable. The characters, including Kane, are not overly engaging and I never found myself caring what happened to any of them. Parts of the film are staggeringly boring. It takes a good 15 minutes for the plot -- or what there is of a plot -- to get moving. Yes, certain techniques of directing, camera angles, flashbacks, and the like, are interesting from a scholarly viewpoint. However, the real interest of a dramatic film should come from interesting characterizations, a good story, and tension amongst the characters. In these critical areas, "Citizen Kane" is sorely lacking.Watch this movie if you are a film scholar, professional or amateur, or if you want to see what all the fuss is about. In my opinion, this film is wildly overrated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest films of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What can I say that hasn't been said already on this masterpiece. The first time I saw Citizen Kane I wasn't that impressed with it. My opinion of Citizen Kane was that it was a good film but definitely not the best picture ever made. When a movie is so hyped up you can't help but be dissapointed but on my second viewing I was amazed by the film. This is probably the best experience I've ever had watching a film. You can feel the energy and youthfulness in the picture and you could sense that the filmmakers were trying to push the boundaries of film and were not afraid to experiment.I still don't think that Citizen Kane is the best film ever made though, no film can be called the greatest. How can you prove that? You can have a favorite film but calling it the best is just ridiculous. Now I've heard alot of people say that the ending was terrible and it doesn't make sense. The thing is that the movie is not saying that Rosebud is the answer, right before the end Mr. Thompsons says that no one word can explain one man's life. That's the filmmakers telling you what your about to see should not be taken as an explanation for Kane's life.I think Rosebud is the search for one's lost innocence or childhood. The important parts of our life that we want to remember. I think Citizen Kane is about humanity, our search for understanding and meaning of our lives and how we lose ourselves in the things that don't matter. Anyway that's just my opinion. To all the people who didn't enjoy this movie, I would encourage them to see it again and you'll be rewarded. For anybody to truly appreciate any of the great films you must watch it more than once. There is so many things I would like to say but that's how life works, you never get to say everything you feel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Is Citizen Kane the greatest film of all time? Who cares? The fact that it's great is qualification enough. While I can't say I'm surprised that so many have called this movie "boring" (the success of Jerry Bruckheimer hasn't escaped me, after all), I will say that I'm disheartened. I've always found the picture to be breathtaking, even exuberant, throughout its entire 119-minute running time. The sound and dialogue have a crackling wit to them, and the visuals! What can be said of Toland's cinematography that hasn't already been stated a million times over?No, Citizen Kane is not emotionally jarring, and we don't necessarily feel any sympathy for any of its characters. We are not meant to identify with the movie's hero, Charles Foster Kane. We're merely asked to be intrigued by him, to contemplate his situation and how he came to it.If the revelation that comes at the end of the film is a letdown, well, it's supposed to be. Ultimately, Rosebud is no more important to Kane the man than the girl with the white parasol is to Kane's assistant, Mr. Bernstein-- the girl whom Bernstein saw on a ferry dock one day and then never forgot. Rosebud is a remembrance, perhaps a symbol of youth or a transcendence that was never achieved, that has no significance outside of Kane's own mind. The revelation of what it truly is underscores the futility of trying to fathom and define a man's motivations-- it explains nothing.But Rosebud's function within the film is clear-- it's the key that Welles and his collaborators use to open up the world of Charles Foster Kane and then spin us through it. And what a trip it is! The structure of the narrative and the visual program play out in a surprising, almost gleeful way (although people call it "slow," I always find myself exhausted trying to keep up with what the movie throws at me). After I've watched it, I often have trouble pinpointing where exactly in the film certain scenes occur. It's almost too rich, too varied, to subtract from.I also disagree with the notion that Citizen Kane is a "cold" movie. Several scenes emit a strong (if reserved) emotional warmth (those in which Kane first meets his mistress come to mind) while others are quite humorous (the razor sharp dialogue and the dead-on timing of the actors contribute substantially to this). And besides, not every movie is meant to give you a warm fuzzy feeling inside; not all set out to make you cry. Some simply dazzle you with the brilliance of their conception and force you to reconfigure your notions of what a movie can be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Welles's Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Orson Welles really put one over on RKO executives through clever distraction and manipulation in the making of "Citizen Kane." He made history by creating a true art film by using the Hollywood system.The trouble was, "Kane" was simply over the heads of the mass audience at the time, and the film didn't make the profit the studio expected. The total result severely injured Welles' reputation, and inhibited his future ability to work freely and without inhibition--necessary requirements of the true artist. The real-life scenario of Welles' being beckoned to South America to create a US "propoganda movie," was undoubtedly a pay-back to private funders, who had granted Welles the addditional monies needed to finish "Kane," but which place Welles in a vulnerable position of future obligation.With the debacle of "It's All True," the Pan-American project, which was parallel to the unauthorized studio hacking of "The Magnificent Ambersons," the dye of destiny was cast: it would be an uphill career struggle for this artist through the rest of his life.Nowhere in the annals of film history is there so great a tragic figure as that of Orson Welles, whose genius deserved as fine a working environment as possible. Alas, the distored values of the motion picture industry is the culprit; likewise, the blame is extended to big business in general, with its primary objective being almost perversely profit-oriented.As the years pass, the great work of Welles will undoubtedly escalate in appreciation. Come to think of it, isn't that the case with so many genuine artists of history and their creations? In the meantime, let us continue to discover and uncover the subtleties of a great artwork, "Kane."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Possibly the greatest movie ever made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Citizen Kane is so far the most admired movie by the film critics and movie makers all over the world. There are many reasons to love this masterpiece, including many technical achievements which helped the further development of cinema as well as the deep meanings behind it such as: the wealth and love can bring misery rather than happiness or how difficult it is to judge a person when we find out the reasons behind his acts as well as how can a person be mean and selfish as well as considering and generous during the different periods of his life. Don't expect to love this movie right away after the first time watching it. Citizen Kane is a movie that should be watched several times. You should read about it, you should think about the deep meanings beside it, and you should pay attention to it's unique cinematography, editing as well as it's special effects, for example the fact that the beautiful mansion in the movie was mostly paintings on glass. Also try to read about the life of the newspaper industry icon William R. Hearst in which this movie is based on. Citizen Kane for sure is among the top 10 movies of my life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>no match to Casablanca</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A few weeks ago I was in the position to see Casablanca and Citizen Kane in the same week, after not having seen them for a long time. I came to the conclusion that Casablanca was still a great movie, and that CK was not that good after all. It's actually very boring and slow. The acting is, except for the last part, not convincing and at times really outdated. The film-techniques that are supposed to be that great, didn't help the story at all, and that should be the main purpose of any technique. My conclusion is that CK is still a hype, and it doesn't deserve to be one. Maybe it's worth the 250th place in the poll, just for the supposed historic importance (which I don't get, but I give the 'learned' some credit).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After learning that this is rated "the best movie of all time" in many surveys, I decided to watch it. I am confused who voted this the best movie, this movie is a nightmare. It is very boring and the story is so ordinary. It took me three days to finish watching it, after going to sleep the first two days. I kept at it expecting something interesting might happen, but nothing happens right till the end. Even the ending, which is supposed to reveal something enlightening, is very lame. Watching birds and squirrels is more interesting than watching this movie. Save your time and energy, avoid this movie, unless you want some frustration in your life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, But Ultimately Weak</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you hear people talk about the greatness of this movie, it usually has a lot to do with its technical brilliance, which I can't contend with. But to call it the greatest movie ever made seems rather arbitrary when you compare it to a long line of equally inventive and well put together stories that have come since (not to mention more entertaining). The only reason I can imagine that it has risen to this level of acclaim is that so many people have called it the best that it makes anyone who disagrees look like they just don't "get it." So, Citizen Kane longs for the simplicity of his childhood, when happiness was so easily attained. If Kane could whisper to us he would say that what he wants is unconditional love, from someone who has nothing to gain. What he has been seeking is the love of his mother, who at the first opportunity abandons him, perhaps because of his rambunctious nature. He would tell us that when you only seek your own happiness you are incapable of love. I say I get it but it just isn't as clever as you'd like to believe it is. Agreeing that this is the greatest movie ever is like agreeing that the Citroen DS is the most attractive car ever. Everyone knows that it really isn't, but they humor it because it makes them look deep. I believe that movies serve a specific purpose, and if they fail to achieve this purpose they have failed, period. The way I measure the quality of a movie, is by its ability to do what a movie is supposed to. Fiction exists as a mirror, to reflect back at us the fundamental truths of the human experience. A good movie should be one that takes us to a place of emotional enlightenment. It scratches that part of the human psyche that only the most moving moments of life can accomplish; moments of sadness, joy, anticipation, excitement etc. But surely if a movie fails to move you it fails. I cannot imagine how this movie could have possibly floored anyone. I can recall many movies that have left me a lot more moved: American Beauty, Godfather II, The Shawshank Redemption, Requiem for a Dream, Fight Club, Forrest Gump, and Saving Private Ryan to name a few. Lastly I'll say this, Shakespeare was great for among many things being able to write a play that was commissioned by the Queen of England, but that was equally enjoyed by both peasants and nobles. That takes talent. Wrapping up your oh so clever point in an enigma is something that I believe many authors do in order to make themselves look clever. If they really had something to say, moreover to teach the world why would they wrap it up in riddles?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>general statement of principle; I am sick to death of commercial filmmakers preying on the young by obscuring the fact that, as filmmakers, they have nothing original to say or do, by chewing up the past and spitting it out again with "new, improved" special FX.yet, judging from some of the reviews i read here is that the sad fact is that many young viewers are not only ignorant of film history, they earnestly wish to remain ignorant.what could possibly be gained by a surrender to one's own ignorance. an ignorant man has to be told what to do and what to think. simply rejecting the advice of one's elders does not constitute freedom of thought - it is exactly when we reach a decision contrary to that of our peers that we discover what it may mean to become an individual.this means, of course, that statistical arguments concerning the uselessness of history are wholly unconvincing. to say that 'most people agree with me on this point' doesn't say that the point is well-made; possibly everyone in agreement with it is simply wrong.to assert one's independence and then turn around and say that the 'majority agree' is self-evidently contradictory. to abide by such statements despite evidence and reasonable disproof, is not simply exposing ignorance - which can be corrected through education - it is simply stupid.furthermore, since an ignorant person has to be told what to think, it follows that such a person is a victim waiting for a crime to happen. such people seem proud of their ability to thumb their noses at people who reach out to help - but they easily and quickly fall victim to con-artists, who usually know how to make such people feel good about the victimization.knowledge of history means; not getting scammed for want of it. it means deepening one's awareness of the strengths and faults of those we admire. it means that we learn the tricks used to produce something of value, thus making it easier to find and judge value.in film it is also well to bear in mind that good film-makers are precisely those who have studied film history the most. this gives them a stock of film-techniques developed by others on which to draw for increased effectiveness of their own films. i find it unclear, why it is young viewers of today wish to remain in ignorance of where the contemporary film-maker draws inspiration.this fact blasts away the commonly proffered assertion, 'we do things better now than anything they did 'back when'. if that were true, then the film-makers of today would not need such inspiration; but they do.finally, it is simply a fact that those who profess ignorance - as a desirable quality - have nothing new anyone might be able to learn. they always get basic facts wrong.citizen Kane is not about a 'newspaper editor' - to suggest so is merely to admit one's ignorance. Charles foster Kane is a 'media mogul' - as we would call him today - which means that he belongs to the 'upper ten percent' of the population that decides the future for the other 90 percent. he helps to reform politics in new york city; he intimidates a president into going to war with Spain. he gobbles up entertainment media in new york and los angeles, simply to give his wife a stage on which to sing.and - all of this is misguided. even his attempt at political reform fails because it has little to do with 'helping people' as he claims at first, and everything to do with his own ego and ambitions.one of the tell-tale signs of ignorance to be found in reviews of it is the harping reference on the 'rosebud' motif.the movie has nothing to do with rosebud - that's just a little joke on Welles' part.finally one has point out the tasteless ignorance of insisting that a film is weak because - heaven forbid - it's not in color. that's sort of like saying 'your father's a fag because he hasn't gotten your mom pregnant in years'. - it is wholly irrelevant to any movie whatsoever, to be sure, a director can handle color well - but he or she can handle black and white lighting and composition equally well.citizen Kane is one of the most innovative films in cinema history, and it has been used as such by filmmakers literally ever since its initial release. yet these innovations are still as striking as ever - from the use of convex glass reflection in the opening sequence, to the amazing tracking in and out of the fireplace at the end.if you care about film, you owe it to yourself to see the film; had it never been made, neither would any contemporary films that you enjoy today, or that you may enjoy tomorrow.and if that doesn't sink in - then, screw it - i've no patience for fools.still one of the best films in the history of cinema, and still a film necessary to see and appreciate.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the greatest film ever made?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Somehow you feel like everything has already been said about this movie: often at the top of ?best of' lists, certainly regarded as the greatest first film ever made by any director, and the best of all the films to be associated with Orson Welles. Of course he was only in his twenties when he not only co-wrote and directed ?Citizen Kane', but also appeared as the central character over a span of decades ? from fresh-faced young entrepreneur to crabby old man of wealth, trapped in his white castle of mirrors and jigsaws.The structure of the film ? a series of interviews about the man who has just passed on, plus incidents from his life in flashback ? doesn't always come off, but for sheer scope and inventiveness this piece has few peers. We see ?Charlie' Kane right from the early moments of his life, when he is sent from his parents to a better life, fit to govern, through his highs and lows as a newspaper magnate. We meet those who loved him, those who hated him, those who weren't sure. We get swept along by the momentum of the movie. Other films would be directed by Welles in the future that are worth seeing (The Magnificent Ambersons, plus his own takes on Macbeth and Othello with himself in the lead) but ?Citizen Kane' is the most memorable and the most important. His own Mercury Theatre group play the various parts within the saga ? names such as Joseph Cotten and Agnes Moorehead, both of whom would have long careers after 1942. Others such as Dorothy Comingore didn't live up to their initial promise but at least have left us this film to remember them by. ?Citizen Kane' is certainly worth the time of anyone remotely interested in the history of film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Movie Ever Made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm really sick of seeing people panning this film. Either they're doing it just to spite those of us who appreciate good films, or they're doing it because they really have no clue what makes a good film good. A lot of the user comments I've seen here fall into both these categories. Which leads me to believe that most people on imdb.com have no real appreciation for cinema as a true art, and also as a true form of entertainment. But that's another subject.Citizen Kane is easily the best movie ever. To audiences today, it might not wow with its special effects, its lighting, its acting, its camera work, its editing, its sound; the list goes on and on. Most of us have been born and raised on color, explosions, and even CGI in the case of the many teenage LOTR fans here. But the fact is, for its time, Citizen Kane re-invented all that could be done in all of the above areas. I can only imagine what it would be like seeing it at the time of its release. It would have been simply mind blowing. No movie ever since has revolutionized cinema like Citizen Kane, not even the Godfather movies, however good they may be.And it's likely that no movie ever will do again what Citizen Kane has done for cinema.10/10...and this deserves to be #1 on the Top 250.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It deserves the hype.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everyone knows the hype. Citizen Kane is the greatest film ever made. Some people agree completely with the hype, others acknowledge Kane as a masterpiece but not necessarily the greatest ever made, and then there are those that just don't understand the hype at all. I recently saw Citizen Kane for the first time, and I'm going to have to put myself in the first group. It does deserve the hype.I understand why some people find the classics boring and wonder how they could enjoy Citizen Kane. I enjoy watching the classics because I'm interested in cinema history and film technique, but when I put historical considerations aside and just look at the films themselves, I often find them to be rather tedious. Citizen Kane is not like the other classics. It is still fresh and entertaining, and I recommend it to everyone, film buff or not. You should keep in mind, however, that Kane was made in 1941. To avoid disappointment, don't expect an action movie with flashy special effects, a tear-jerking drama, a laugh-out-loud comedy, a suspenseful thriller, or a mind-bending story with deep thoughts about the universe, plot twists, or amazing shocks that will blow you out of your seat.What you can expect is the simple yet fascinating story of the fictitious publishing tycoon Charles Foster Kane, a story told with such cleverness and skill that it is a joy to watch. Much has already been said about Kane's dramatic and technical achievements, and I agree with the praise. I especially love the circular narrative structure, the brief montage that encapsulates the gradual disintegration of Kane's first marriage in only two minutes, and the scene in which the elderly Kane rips up his second wife's room. Welles' performance is mesmerizing as he lurches through his furious rampage. If you are interested in film technique, I highly recommend the DVD version of the film with its excellent commentary tracks (especially the one by Roger Ebert).If you watch the DVD, also make sure to see the documentary that comes with it, The Battle Over Citizen Kane, which chronicles the clash between Welles and the real-life publishing tycoon William Randolph Hearst. Hearst was angered by the portrayal of Charles Foster Kane, a character undeniably based, at least in part, on Hearst's life. Hearst banned any mention of Kane in his vast newspaper holdings and threatened any theaters that dared to show the despised film. He also tried to buy all available copies of the film and have them destroyed, and he came very close to succeeding. The scary thing is that if Hearst had been only slightly more successful, no one would have ever seen Citizen Kane.It is the fact that Citizen Kane survived that makes it the greatest film ever made. Its triumph is not only a testament to the power of the cinema, but a shining example of how that power should be used. Some critics acknowledge Kane as a technical masterpiece, but erroneously fault it for being too shallow. Such critics miss how Citizen Kane dared to truthfully and intelligently display the corrupting influence of vanity, wealth, and power and how it defeated a challenge from those very elements in real life. Never falling prey to the pride that it warns us about, Citizen Kane does not stoop to pretentious preaching or arrogantly claim to know all of the answers. Welles was an arrogant man, but he put his arrogance into his performance of Kane, not into the tone of the film. Citizen Kane is powerful in its simplicity and subtlety, and as serious and thoughtful as it is, Kane still manages to be fun, entertaining, and above all, clean and inoffensive. Hearst's papers have faded away with time, old copies preserved but read by no one. The old black and white movie that those faded papers almost destroyed lives on, viewed by millions of people. The cinema and Hollywood hype reign supreme.Hollywood's hype is a two edged sword. So quick to wield its influence whipping up a frenzy of anticipation for new escapist entertainment and filling its chests with ever growing profits, Hollywood is slow to use its enormous power to raise awareness of important issues, to give artistic expression to truth and to opinions and ideas that matter. When it does attempt to use the better edge of its sword, it is so often merely an assault of violence and pornography in the name of `edgy,' `stylish,' or `educational' art, and just as often a sappy, cheesy, or politically correct rehashing of stereotypes and clichés. Citizen Kane shines as a glorious example of how it should be done, and I wish Hollywood would follow its example more often.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Without a doubt THE greatest motion picture ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I got the CAV Criterion Laserdisc version of this movie, I didn't have any expectations what so ever. When the movie was over, I was so tranced and entoxicated that I couldn't believe what I had just seen.What I noticed the most was the photography. The gorgeous black &amp; white photography by Gregg Toland. The music by Bernard Herrmann was also something that I noticed.Having only seen Orson Welles in 'The Man Who Saw Tomorrow' before, I was excited to see such a young man in the title role, making his feature film debut with such tremendous energy and wonderful acting. I said to myself, 'How can a man so young make something like this?'. Welles, only 26 at the time, showed such understanding of the motion picture and how to make so something beautiful, funny, exciting and terrible. How could such a genius become such an outcast of Hollywood.Even 17 years later in 'Touch of Evil', hadn't he lost any of his touch of how to make something extraordinary. Like Martin Scorsese, 'Citizen Kane that makes you believe that anything is possible on film'.This is truly a motion picture that will be the greatest of all of motion picture for another 50 years. It will be the crowning and the most tragic achievement in the history of the motion picture. The crowning achievement because of the film's quality and groundbreaking means to achieve it. And the most tragic because of the way Orson Welles was welcomed into Hollywood. But we can thank God that at least one film of Welles' best was untouched by the shortsightness of the studios.If you like to see a wonderful movies with a tragic, funny story and gorgous photography, go and see this fantastic film</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfection</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is simply put, perfect. But in this reviewer's opinion, a little too perfect. Orson Welles, at only 24 years old, obtains complete artistic control and all the financial aid he would for creating this film. On the set, no one but cast and crew was allowed. The progress of filming was kept entirely secret from producers and studio executives. The movie is released and William Randolph Hearst leads a vicious crusade to have the movie boycotted. And in the end, everyone recognized that it is a landmark in film making history and perhaps one of the greatest movies, if not 'the' greatest movie of all time; in short, perfection. All of these are pretty odd circumstances for just one film, don't you think? I think so, For perfection is beyond the grasp of human minds and hearts. Then one must ask, how then was this film created if a perfect film can not be created by man? Well, frankly, Martians. Yes, it may come as a shock, but martians were the ones who created Citizen Kane.Martians have been observing humans for a millennium, studying our trades, our relationships, and ultimately our art forms. Film being the synthesis of most visual and auditory arts, the Martians decided in 1938 to give film a try. Through mind control and virtual hypnosis they manipulated a young, influential radio personality and actor to be their human front man. That man was Orson Welles. Welles, using Martian mind control received permission, finance, and freedom to go ahead with 'his' project. The reality of it was the Martians were in complete control of the production, using their influence over all the mercury players and cast members to do their will. The set was a closed set all the time, simply because the Martians were out in the open giving direction. When a producer would come by, the Martians would go into hiding, and upon Martian instruction the humans would start tossing around a baseball. Only a martian could think of a ploy so devious.Though no evidence for this exists, it is my opinion that William Randolph Heart caught wind that it was Martians heading up this project, and being objected to the mind control and manipulation, he lead his notorious crusade against this picture. He felt that human rights were being violated, and who can blame him? But really, in the end, no harm was done. The actors had created a marvelous performance under Martian instruction, and the Martians had proved to themselves that they understood human relationships, especially our need for love. Thus being satisfied with their artistic endeavors, the Martians headed off, only to return as consultants on the film 'Seven Samurai.' But, even though Citizen Kane is not a product of human artistry, it still is a wonder to know that someone out there understands us humans, even a little more than we do.See this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The American Film Institute knows their stuff and it's no wonder that they rank this movie the # 1 film ever made. Orson Welles portrayed some of the best dramatic acting along with directing that I've ever seen, and believe me I've seen a lot. This movie got robbed at the Oscars for reasons that I'll never understand. The quotes are so good and there are so many of them. Welles was a genius that was never fully appreciated even today, probably because most of us forgot about him. I felt bad for him because after he made this perfect piece of art he spent the rest of his life trying to make another one that was just as good or better and which he was never able to do (though it might've been impossible anyway because sometimes you can't beat the best). The supporting actors were fabulous, you just don't see it done this well anymore or anywhere close to it for that matter. This story has something in it that every person can relate to and it doesn't fall short on any of it. If you consider yourself even a novice movie lover you have to watch this and the sooner the better. That's my story and I'm sticking to it!Final Judgment:Movies : If it's ever re-released I'd be there in a second!DVD Purchase : Get the special edition.Rental : More important than air and water!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The greatest film of all time - for many reasons</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>`Citizen Kane is the greatest film of all time'. How many times has anyone who watches films or follows films heard that phrase? The question is, do people who actually tout this oft-repeated phrase actually believe it? Or have they ever even seen the film? Arguably, there have been some truly great films that have been released since Citizen Kane, in fact, most of the `great films' have been released since Citizen Kane, but there are many factors that support the assertions that A) Citizen Kane is indeed the greatest film of all time, and B) Citizen Kane is uncontested as my favorite film of all time.Citizen Kane is of course, the story of Charles Foster Kane told through the eyes of those who loved him, hated him and idolized him. It is also a famously thinly-veiled telling of the life of William Randolph Hearst, the publishing magnate. Welles, at 25 and already being touted as a genius, had enough of an ego to tackle this subject. Unfortunately for Welles, and his ego, Hearst was still very much alive and very much in control of various media outlets, movie studios and their executives, all of which demolished the film's release and hype. It wasn't until decades later when people realized the incredible visionary aspect and technical genius of the film.Citizen Kane was released in 1941 ? the same year as such films as The Little Foxes, Suspicion and Sergeant York ? all three great films, all three big competitions for Kane. And actually, `How Green Was My Valley' won. But what Kane had that these films did not, was passion. Technical mastery. Ground breaking camera work and blocking techniques that paved the way for the way films would be made, even today. Thought-provoking symbolism, and defiance. Welles knew that he had a time bomb ? he was warned by industry insiders, friends, maybe even Hearst himself. But whether it was ego or feelings of entitlement for his own work (or, most likely, a combination of both) the film that he poured his entire life into remains the standard that films made 60 years later with remarkable technology are held against. One looks at the deep focus and isn't fazed because it is now standard. Welles created that. The camera angles, the symbolism that is so creatively used, (watch for faces that become shaded and draw your conclusions as to why that is) the blocking that tells a story without actually saying, `This is what we are trying to convey here'. (Out of about twenty scenes where this occurs, you can specifically invoke the `breakfast table' scene between Kane and his first wife, or the scene between Kane and Davies where the shouting is almost irritating, but is executed to provide a demonstration of the vastness, grandeur and loneliness.Some friends and I recently decided to start an informal `Movie Club' and for the inaugural night, I wanted to screen my favorite movie of all time, `Citizen Kane'. We discussed why that is a dangerous statement, and why calling Kane the `greatest of all time' could be construed as intellectual irresponsibility considering the stories that have been told since Kane in 1941, and the technology that has been invented since Kane graced the big screen for the first time. I agree that the point can be argued. Someone can argue with me that George Lucas, director of that `other' groundbreaking film(s) is improving upon the original with his extended versions. Yes, you can argue with me, but you will not change my opinion, and in that same vein, I will never find a film that has affected me more than Kane has. It is for that reason alone that films that I have seen since compete for slots #2 ? Infinity. Citizen Kane's historical importance and innovative technique give it an automatic pass to #1 ? the beauty, the story, and the acting are just wonderful extras that truly make this film the `Greatest of all time'. --Shelly</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What's all the fuss about?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>CITIZEN KANE pioneered some innovative technical practices we take for granted today, and it proved a worth vehicle for introducing some very fine actors &amp; actresses to Hollywood. Ray Collins, Agnes Moorhead, Joseph Cotton and Orson Wells all made big impressions later on in their careers, but this film is just too boring and you don't care about the characters. First issue: boredom...CK is not boring because of the age in which it was produced - Gone with The Wind, Double Indemnity, Mrs Miniver, Casablanca, The Postman Always Rings Twice, The Big Sleep all belong to this era and still hold almost every movie fan's attention from start to finish, even after repeated screenings. Perhaps CK is warning us against the evils of materialism, which is laudable. Kane has millions and spends compulsively until it doesn't interest him anymore. He acquires one fantastic woman, battles with her, then finds another. Wife #2 is a hotcha-girl and seems none too bright, but she's just ignorant and her character-development is the one truly interesting thing about the entire film as her gathering sophistication reveals an intelligent and finally independent woman. But, little else interests me very long. We're told about his wonderful, massive house and don't get to see much of it. Kane never seems to have much fun and I don't care why he doesn't. The odd, stark shots of theatres, libraries, offices, etc. bored me stiff the first time I saw the movie and are still just a bunch of stuff to plod through the next time I watch it. Second issue: Why don't I care?? We're treated to that "Rosebud" remark early on, but I can never find myself caring about it. So what if it's the sled he had as a little boy. The movie doesn't make me care about Kane either as adult OR child. Mr. Bernstein is a likable kiss-ass, he admits, and he's mildly interesting. Jed Leland goes to one of Susan Kane's operatic performances, gets bored with mediocrity and is too cowardly to finish a bad review, gets drunk, gets fired. Hoh-hum. Mean old Mr. Thatcher is a little interesting, and his final scene with Kane is a humorous island in a sea of mediocrity: Thatcher and Kane should be good, old friends - - they even finish each others' sentences, but they're old enemies and always will be. Then everybody gets old and/or dies. So what? God willing, that's what'll happen to most of us. This movie shows us that, as time goes by, the once young and lively become old and slow...then the Kane's life is over and there's a half-hearted search for Rosebud and nobody ever discovers the origin of Kane's dying remark. Big deal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Drama Ever Filmed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a great movie, the best drama ever made. Everything about it is perfect. And the test of it is that no one at the time of its release knew what to do with it, or what to make of the genius of Orson Welles. These two facts themselves engender a tragedy that should, but probably will never be, a film like Citizen Kane. Yes, it was nominated for all the right things. And son of a gun, the Academy ACTUALLY gave CK an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay.BEST ACTOR 1941 Sgt. York? I love Gary Cooper, but... BEST PICTURE, BEST DIRECTOR 1941 How Green Was My Valley, Best Picture, Best Director? A great film, and by my list of films, John Ford is a great director, but... BEST FILM EDITING 1941 Sgt. York again? Now, come on! Guys, didn't you see that newsreel mock-up stuff, splicing CFK next to Hitler etc? Sgt. York? MUSIC 1941 All That Money Can Buy...well, at least Bernard Hermann, music man for CK, won.The Academy is not an Oracle of Film Greatness, and sometimes they even get it right. But in 1941 they looked past the brilliant Jewel that is Citizen Kane and picked up, instead, a handful of shiny pebbles.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Citizen Kane (1941) ****</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am totally elated to say I've just had my first - and by no means my last - wonderful experience with the well-labeled "classic" that is CITIZEN KANE.I decided to see it bright and early, at 7:30 am where I could be at my most alert and perceptive. It did not disappoint me in a single way. And even though I was fully prepared in advance to think "there's just no way this is going to be the 'best film ever made'," the more I became entranced in it, the more I understood precisely why so many fans and critics over the decades have bestowed such an honor on it. It's a truly great motion picture - and if I'm not presently prepared to call it "The Single Greatest Film Ever Made," I certainly think it's one of the greatest, at least that I've ever seen.I must say with regret, however, that I'd already heard what "Rosebud" was before watching the movie, and that's a real shame. Because I would have been totally blown away by that bittersweet revelation had I not expected it. The only thing for me to hope for was that, at least, the manner in which this information was revealed in the film would be properly dramatic and effective, and not just some character telling its meaning or some other less than stellar presentation. I was actually hoping that the movie would end with the "Rosebud" object somehow being amidst Kane's personal possessions -- but who would ever have though that it was going to be SO brilliantly revealed - with such grandeur! Absolutely perfect - drama at its finest!The performances were marvelous, beginning with Orson Welles and Joseph Cotten (what a shame to think Cotten was ultimately to be handed such junk as LADY FRANKENSTEIN later on). I spotted people I never expected to see, such as George Coulouris as Thatcher (another who wound up in Grade Z horrors like 1957's THE MAN WITHOUT A BODY!).I was totally intrigued with the character of Chuck Kane continuously, and I loved the manner in which this well-crafted story was told via flashbacks and time leaps backward and forward. Of course, the cinematography was second to none and, I imagine, astonishingly fresh and innovative for its day. Dialogue was great, too; I particularly liked one funny bit where the elderly Thatcher tells the young adult Kane: "You're too old to call me 'Mister'", to which Welles replies, "and you're too old to be called anything else" ! Orson Welles was a genius with this work of art. I can't wait to dig into the documentary, and perhaps even Roger Ebert's commentary. To think that Welles was so young when he fashioned this beautiful film, and had complete creative license! This is what I like with a director when I can get it - one who is in charge of everything, not just someone who is merely directing someone else's ideas. I like a director to conceive, write, direct, and edit everything (at this point I'm not positive that Welles did it ALL, but he did enough!).Well, I could go on forever at this moment, but I'll let others get a word or two in. All I can say is - if you hadn't guessed by now - this baby's got a space on my shelf with its name on it! And by the way, EXCELLENT restoration job, Warner!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I had Great Expectations - But this movie was awful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My wife and I bought this movie a few years ago, kept saying "We gotta watch Citizen Kane one of these days" -- so this weekend, got out the drinks, sat down to watch this highly rated flick, hoping it would be as good as they say.I have a friend who works for one of the Hearst grandchildren, so I thought "this will make a good conversation piece, to compare notes so to speak" -- well here's what happened.We started on Saturday evening, after the first 20 minutes or so, we started checking the DVD player asking "how much more of this movie is there" -- and every time we checked the remaining time, we both groaned. I paused the movie a few times to stretch, to clear my head, to prepare for the torture again, sat down and pushed the play button.We finally gave up at about 1/2 through. So the next morning, that would be Sunday, we thought we could finish the movie, which we did, checking the "time left" several times until the end of the movie and the explanation of the opening word.After this extraordinary boring movie, we took out the 2nd DVD to see the real explanation, which was far more interesting than the movie, and about 1/2 the length. And the explanation of Rosebud was clarified in the 2nd DVD, or at least a believable explanation was provided.I have only posted one other review on this service, about an equally boring but current movie. I have seen many great movies, and the reviews of the great movies are helpful, but how Citizen Kane is thought to be a great movie tells us all something about movie critics. They like to support the artsy and boring movies that everyone else hates, and pan the movies that the crowds love. I think they do this to demonstrate that they are independent thinkers, but what it proves is that most movie reviews can be ignored, good or bad, since they bear little resemblance to the actual joy one might get from watching the movie under review.Watch this with no expectations of enjoyment, but watch it just so you can ask a "real" movie goer that loves it to explain "What did you like about the movie, I mean, really, what? And please, focus on the story line and the acting, was any of it good?" I didn't think so.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awful, the worst movie ever!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all let me state I love old movies, black and white, Bogart, movies from the 40's war movies, westerns etc. I heard about this movie for years and everyone RAVED about it. I thought I've got to see it. So I rented it and watched, and watched and watched and waited for the moment of greatness which never came. The more I watched the worse it got. I thought there must be something terribly wrong with ME. I couldn't finish it. It was so bad I couldn't take it anymore. I didn't understand why didn't I like it. It had to be my fault. Then I read the review of one of the earlier posters and she said what I felt but was afraid to say. The movie was awful. It was beyond bad. It was the worst movie ever filmed in all of history and I can safely say there will never be one worse. The only reason I gave it one star is I couldn't give it zero. If the military wants to use this film as a substitute for water boarding I promise you they will get everything they want to know from a terrorist simply by strapping them into a chair and making them watch this film. One time will do it. Make them watch it twice and THAT would be inhumane and unspeakable torture.</fullReview>

For those who don't know the premise a group of reporters try to find the meaning of a millionaire's last word..Rosebud. It's a good premise, but executed horribly. All of the characters and the actors playing them are dull and unrealistic. The dialogue is boring, and sometimes even laughably bad ("Let's all go to the window"). The cinematography is simple and dull, and the plot is incredibly predictable. Those who like this movie need some explaining to do. All I've heard from them is "you're an idiot if you don't like this movie." Is the only reason these people enjoy Citizen Kane because they're snobs who are too good for quality cinema? I challenge these people to find one redeemable quality of this atrocious film. Then I might reconsider my position.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Hyperbole of Genius</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All the pseuds say it; all the polls of the "greatest films ever made" say it: this is the greatest film ever made. Orson Welles, in between mouthfuls, shows his genius once again.But things are never quite what they seem.Take all that brouhaha about "The War of the Worlds." All those people thinking that the Martians had really landed. Or did they? I have heard this play twice, and I have to say that I cannot see anybody being taken in by a radio play that is not particularly good. Indeed when you dig up the contemporary newspapers, you can see a distinct absence of named people; and the articles smack of having been written before the broadcast even went out. At the time, the Mercury Theatre was being threatened with the termination of their radio series: they were that bad! What better to keep them on the air than the biggest load of hype in entertainment history. It is reckoned by some historians that not a single person headed for the hills as a result of this radio programme.But surely Orson Welles answered his critics in "Citizen Kane." Didn't he?Well if taking the story of Hearst, blackening the reputation of Marion Davies, and pinching unusual camera angles from other directors, like Michael Curtiz, is genius, then Orson Welles is a genius and "Citizen Kane" is indeed the greatest film ever known.It just goes to show that if people go around shilling Orson Welles as a genius, the pseuds will be stupid enough to believe it.But don't take my word for it. See The Adventures of Robin Hood, which predates Citizen Kane. There you will see all the unusual angles you will wish to see. Curtiz even has a couple of shots taken from the fireplace, the difference between Kane and Robin Hood is that in Robin Hood, the fire is lit. Also in Robin Hood you will see moving camera shots a-plenty, especially in the opening scene in the great hall at Nottingham Castle, which means that the often repeated statement that Orson Welles invented moving camera shots in Citizen Kane is utter drivel. I will repeat it just in case the pseuds miss it yet again: Citizen Kane is NOT the first film to use moving camera shots and Orson Welles did NOT invent this technique.If you want to call Michael Curtiz a genius, I have no problem with that. He certainly has more right to that appellation than has Orson Welles.But I can be wrong. And I have been proved wrong. I once said to a friend of mine: "Is it just me, or is Citizen Kane the most overrated film ever made?"He replied: "You are wrong. Citizen Kane is a great film. whenever it is shown on television, I never sleep better."As someone who has fallen asleep in front of Citizen Kane myself, I just had to admit that I was wrong.And all those people who stayed at home instead of going to the cinema, making Citizen Kane a box-office flop. They were wrong, too. Or were they?</fullReview>

I realize that some of the cinematography is considered "revolutionary", but it was incredibly boring. I wouldn't rank it in the top 1,000 movies and probably not even in the top 10,000 movies if I've actually seen that many movies, but it would take a while to count how many movies I've actually seen. If there's any silver lining to this tediously boring movie, it's that certain scenes from the movie that have been spoofed more than once on the Simpsons with which they did an excellent job.

		<fullReview>Citizen Kane is a film with epic characteristics, and was at least 30 years ahead of his time, let's start by spectacular Gregg Toland photography, which for me is one of the top 5 best film photography, all the camera angles, metaphors, editing, close-ups, the use of natural and artificial light, mounts scenarios are something inexplicable (Remember Kane's speech), J. Mankiewicz script is great, using flashbacks (something new in time) and the timeline in your favor, I really can not say if this film was the first film to use these narrative resources, I think not, but it sure was one of the first to use a magnificent way, the soundtrack it is accurate, and the performances are very good, especially the Orson Welles doing a magnificent job, as director and actor, worth a reference scenes "Post credit" which explains that all the actors are new, cool also speak the name the cinematographer Gregg Toland is credited alongside Orson, Citizen Kane marked the history of cinema as we know it, so you go to see the movie today will notice that most of the "things" are very common nowadays and did not understand why the film is so prestigious, but remember that citizen kane invented this pile of "things."</fullReview>

The state-of-the-art techniques and the clever plot make this film unforgettable, even though the narrative has some flaws with its pace. For us, Rosebud is the name of the sleigh with which Kane hit Thatcher when he was little. It's a name of change, a very important name in his life. It dies with Kane because it is actually him. For Thompson, Rosebud will be another piece of a jigsaw puzzle he could never find. But the viewer is redeemed through all the things they learnt from Kanes life all these years.

		<fullReview>It's Orson Welles. The pseudo-intellectuals, especially nowadays with the immense classic status this film has cropped over the decades, will put this sort of film in the highest order of things simply because it's Orson Welles, the great American iconoclast cinematic intellectual of the time with this highly critical piece of film.Now, for the film itself, it's fairly good, but lacks in various places. Sure there's criticism of the society of the time, there's criticism about politics and more largely criticism of the individual ego, the vanity of men; the ending is authentic and the whole movie works in one direction and has coherence to its lore; and all of that is fine; but ultimately one could find it content-wise the film isn't the most entertaining, a common fault of Welles', that it seems it is the *narrative* of the film that takes the place of ...the film itself. It's like the film has to go through a painful bulk at the center, tediously going through a logical development of the situation and plot, before it can finally give the ending away. Some parts are too long for their own good, for their own point to be made (the whole opera singing thing), and overall one gets an impression of non-interactive coldness, blandness; as a lot of the early events just aren't very interesting (the newspaper days..). There isn't enough surprise, tension, dynamic content; Citizen Kane takes its sweet time to get to the not unpredictable or particularly subtle places it chooses to go; the film just lets its story casually played out and the conclusions are quite obvious (though rather good) even for the time. I understand cinematographically this is a strong and important film, but as a film in itself or even for the point it's making, it's not top notch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Began seeing this film in snippets running in and out of the house between playing baseball in the backyard and heading back down into the basement with Cool-Aid and tuna fish sandwiches to sit on the couch and watch this thing on our black and white T.V. Sooner or later, it would be on the Bill Kennedy show and he would look into his files for newspaper footage about it. The thing that's so wonderful is how accessible this film is for being touted by some as 'the greatest of all time'. Whether or not that is so is more than I know. I've seen and enjoyed a lot of great films. Anything that I might say would barely add or subtract to what has already been said and would probably prove to be redundant at best, so I'll just make a few personal observations and let it go at that.CITIZEN KANE is like a Magic Box filled with all these independent features of interest. Barely coming in under two hours it seems much longer than that and compares favorably with other epics that require an intermission somewhere between its three hours or more length. That's the first thing I have to say about it; the way it seems to dilate time and yet is over before you know it. You don't even have to see the thing from beginning to end to enjoy it. Some years passed before I actually sat down and saw this piece in its entirety. But it didn't seem to matter. There is something ubiquitous about it; it will be there for you when you get the time to fully appreciate it. As a kid, the film noir beginning made me wonder whether or not this was a horror story or some kind of detective tale. As most people know, the truth is it is both and more than that.Agnes Moorehead never looked better in her life! Joseph Cotton along with the rest of the Mercury Theater come on strong in this tale. There are many who will compare this film to THE GODFATHER or VERTIGO and there is probably much to be gained from this, but looking at the film from the inside out you feel yourself having access to one of the most liberal minds of all time. There is a strong spirit of inventiveness here where Welles as the auteur is not adapting his tale to the strictures of Film, but rather adapting the strictures of Film to this vision of grand sweeping storytelling. This to me is what separates it from other great films that it can be compared and discussed with. For most cinematic works, technique is subservient to the story; and yet in CITIZEN KANE it feels as though technique is subservient to the inventiveness of its creator. I'm sure this is true in some Hitchcock films and of course the films of Ingmar Bergman and others, but here that sense of inventiveness is less coldly calculated as it is with Hitchcock at his best, nor is it as somber and steeped in religious and philosophical overtones as it is with Bergman at his most profound. The inventiveness of Welles here is youthful and exuberant and in a naive sort of way distinctly American. Gangway! The young Turks have come to town! Clear the floor for some hoofin' and break out the champagne!I say naive because there is something unselfconscious about this modern classic. Welles is too busy having fun to worry about posterity right now, he'll get back to you later concerning all that. I'll never forget the scene with the dance hall girls. After a bit of cinematic legerdemain where we see Kane buy off the whole staff of a rival newspaper and frame them for a news photograph, we then find his own people joining in to sing his praises. As a youngster the thing that startled me was how long this scene went on; Welles didn't seem to be doing this scene to serve the story particularly, but just for the sheer thrill of dancing with the ladies and having fun! The exhilaration of this scene was something that has stayed with me all my life. Some kind of energy seemed to spiral out of the screen and shake you by the shoulders and urge you to take one spin around yourself. Come on! There's enough booze and food for everyone! It's this scene that makes me wish that Welles had chosen the life of Babe Ruth to chronicle rather than that of William Randolph Hearst.But it doesn't stop there. When you hear Welles present Kane as an orator you are seeing a spellbinder at work; you will see this side of Welles again in MOBY DICK and perhaps more importantly, in the final scenes of the film COMPULSION. This is the energy and passion of a young man at the height of his powers. Kane for President! He'll fight for the common people and win us our rights!Eventually, due to poor choices and a marked propensity to love the power that his wealth brings him more than the people he supposedly wishes to champion, we see Kane progress towards his inevitable slide into tragedy. This is handled with sophistication and taste and we see how Kane becomes an embittered worn out old man living a shallow existence among the shadows of the things that he owns.In the end, we are given a glimpse of insight into the character of Kane that is denied all the other characters in the film. But even that is just an echo of what Everett Sloan as Bernstein tells the reporter Jerry about the girl he saw crossing over on the Ferry. Soon even this is just so much smoke drifting up above the chain link fence and the NO TRESPASSING sign in front of Xanadu...NEWS! ON THE MARCH!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The master-piece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You may ask yourself: what are criteria for a good movie? This is a question of great importance; it is still an unsolved problem. However, there are some titles which deserve to bear title ''good'' or even ''master-piece'' despite the fact that we don't have such criteria. They change you completely, so you don't need any further proofs that they are ''good''. Orson Welles' ''Citizen Kane'' is certainly one of those titles. Charles Foster Kane, the protagonist, was a very wealthy and powerful man. For decades, Kane had been influencing public opinion thanks to his media empire. But, ''as it must to all men, death came to Kane''. His death was an ordinary death. Old man died in his bed. His last word was an ordinary word - ''Rosebud''. Nevertheless, Kane wasn't an ordinary man. Wouldn't it be great if we could find out what he meant by ''Rosebud'' at his very end? Does ''Rosebud'' tell us something about Kane's life that can be helpful for understanding his personality?In two hours of this master-piece, we didn't just get an answer to these questions. We got a story about Kane's whole life. Kane's childhood, youth, old age, moments of fear, love, suffering, his political failure, people he loved or, at least, possibly loved. After all that, at the very end of the movie, meaning of ''Rosebud'' is finally revealed. ''Rosebud'' is name for sleigh which represents Kane's childhood. One could say: ''Well, what's exactly the point of all this? An old tycoon remembered his childhood, the period of his innocence; almost all men are emotionally connected to their childhood. Furthermore, there was no point in watching events on Kane's later life because they are completely irrelevant for the meaning of his last word.'' I strongly disagree to this kind of argument. In my opinion, Welles wanted to send a message to us. Two hours of Kane's life should show us that man (any man) is very complex being. Kane's acts, his speeches, his emotions are often strange and unexpected, even paradoxical. On the other side, his last word, ''Rosebud'', as I already said, represents his childhood. Childhood is period of simplicity. So, Welles' message could be: Even we are very complex, we naturally strive to simplicity. If that so, if we accept this as a truth, there will be a lot work for philosophers and scientists.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Citizen Kane is a 1941 American mystery drama film by Orson Welles, its producer, co-author, director and star. The picture was Welles's first feature film. Nominated for Academy Awards in nine categories, it won an Academy Award for Best Writing (Original Screenplay) by Herman J. Mankiewicz and Welles. Considered by many critics, filmmakers, and fans to be the greatest film of all time, Citizen Kane was voted as such in five consecutive Sight &amp; Sound polls of critics, until it was displaced by Vertigo in the 2012 poll. It topped the American Film Institute's 100 Years ... 100 Movies list in 1998, as well as AFI's 2007 update. Citizen Kane is particularly praised for its cinematography, music, and narrative structure, which were innovative for its time.The quasi-biographical film examines the life and legacy of Charles Foster Kane, played by Welles, a character based in part upon the American newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst, Chicago tycoons Samuel Insull and Harold McCormick, and aspects of Welles's own life. Upon its release, Hearst prohibited mention of the film in any of his newspapers. Kane's career in the publishing world is born of idealistic social service, but gradually evolves into a ruthless pursuit of power. Narrated principally through flashbacks, the story is told through the research of a newsreel reporter seeking to solve the mystery of the newspaper magnate's dying word: "Rosebud."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film to see without thinking about what other people say.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film focuses on the figure of Mr. Kane, an important news baron that just passed away, leaving the journalists grappling with its mysterious and enigmatic last words. Directed and written by Orson Welles, who also gives life to the lead role, this film also has the participation of other players and is considered by many the best film ever made.First of all, its necessary to clarify one thing: despite the opinions of many people consider this movie the best ever, these considerations are ALWAYS subjective and likely to be discussed. Each person has the right to think of another way, like it or not, period. Now let's get down to business.When I saw this movie for the first time I was not able to understand or to see why it was so acclaimed by critics. Currently I'm most able to understand the reasons. The actors glittered in their roles, particularly Welles, who would become one of the film's biggest names in his time. The script is simple, but it tells a good story, which addresses such important issues as the simplicity and true happiness. Its a film made with love by those involved, where every detail has been thought and rethought. The use of non-linear narrative, through the use of constant flashbacks, allows the public to see the life of the deceased millionaire, a missing character, but always present. The scenarios are excellent and even the camera angles were thought innovatively. For all that, this film was considered a landmark. It doesn't have a history that goes stay forever in our memory, but it was a film that showed to the industry that certain narrative techniques, light, shooting etc. were truly possible.So, my advice is to forget the critics, specialists and experts. Forget that is an acclaimed film and see the movie, enjoy the film before you think about it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Any art becomes harder to appreciate as time passes. We look at statues and paintings from, lets say the Ancient Greece, and we appreciate them for their aesthetic, their style and the craftsmanship that went into making them. Yet we often know very little about why or even how they were made. Were they political in their time, like art often is nowadays, or were they made simply to feed the artist, like some of the greatest works of art in history have sometimes been made? And if we somehow found out that a painting of a human figure in some prehistoric cave was actually a political satire of the rival clan chief, would it add value to the work?I ponder this because I don't think I fully get Citizen Kane, or if I even can get it without a degree in history. Back in its days, the film was widely applauded for its groundbreaking style and its cinematographic feats. Orson Welles put himself on the map by pulling off tricks and visuals that had never been seen before. He also based the story of one Charles Foster Kane on a real life business tycoon William Randolph Hearst, a polarizing figure back then, thus tying the film to the days of its release.And I view this film and I must admit that it didn't blow me away. The cinematography is brilliant and impressive, but I've seen most of the tricks already in newer films, and thus their impact is lessened. And while it's an interesting character study about the meaning of contentment, wealth and American ideals, I was left with the impression that I was missing something. And I think it's that I have no real life parallels to compare this film to. Especially seeing as I'm not an American.Is it still a good film? Oh, definitely. It's a pioneer of its field, its themes are very deep, it's beautiful on the technical level and even the story, while rather slow, does keep you interested through the capturing presence of Welles' acting. I do recommend seeing it, though I must admit that I respect it more than I like it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Citizen Kane - Review: Purely Magnificent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen this movie twice, once in my film history class, and once at the local theater.I absolutely love this movie, it's awesome.Citizen Kane is beautifully directed, it's artistic in its direction, and the set-pieces are breathtaking. Orson Welles is fantastic in the title role, he's mean, he's evil, he's charismatic, and he has a lot of charisma. I loved the artistic choices that showcased the character. There are moments when the character turns nasty personality wise, he becomes consumed in darkness, and you can barely see his face. I loved the scene during the Opera performance, Kane knows the show is bad, but he continues to clap, when he stands up, he's covered in darkness, he claps louder than the audience, and now you can see he's only clapping because of his ego.Citizen Kane showcases the rise and fall of a tycoon. "You know, Mr. Bernstein, if I hadn't been very rich, I might have been a really great man." - Charles Foster KaneWhen the movie started, I kinda wasn't into it, it felt like a really bad comedy, I was worried that the entire movie was going to be like that, and I was dead wrong. After the introduction, the movie changed gears, the opening was just a documentary in the making, and the people making it where missing one crucial piece, Rosebud.Kane's dying word was, Rosebud. What is Rosebud, it's Kane's old snow sled, when he was a child, he played with it, and it symbolized his innocence before he became wealthy and powerful.The movie chronicles the story of Charles Foster Kane through the eyes of friends, employees, public information, and his ex-wife, however, there's still a mystery involved because the crucial information can't be found, Rosebud.Rosebud is a piece of information that isn't discovered. By the end of the movie, Rosebud is burned, and the secret dies with Mr. Kane. I like that the movie wasn't traditional and it ended on a sad note. At first I was upset by the ending because they just burned the damn sled, but then it's symbolic because his whole life wasn't privatized, and this one significant thing is his only real secret. Rosebud is a remembrance of his youth and when things were innocent, it's the only real pure thing in Kane's life, he gets to die with a sense of that long forgotten purity, and he takes his purity to his grave. A piece of Kane died when he left his sled behind, but then he got that piece back when he actually did die.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The man can not be explained in one word, but...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The fascinating mystery drama, the most ambitious and boldest debut film, with time he got labeled as one of the best and most innovative. I will not engage in, nor even parody comparisons. I am only interested in the "rosebud". The relentless pursuit of power, empathy and proving are not the essence. Things that no one pays attention are the essence. CITIZEN KANE is a dramatic and narrative masterpiece. The work in which all details of biographical mosaic of one man. A man who is after all a "big" except in being true to himself. The man can not be explained in one word, but to man one word can mean almost anything.The press magnate's only means of stories through which the director demonstrates extremely fresh, innovative and secure access, skillfully guiding the story and the actors, playing with light and shadow, deep personnel and other plans, and creating a whole that attracts maturity. I am delighted by the fact that each average viewer of the film can compose and reconstruct the story of the main character as he wants. The man and the emergence in society. Not many people will find some sort of fund, mainly to raising story to a multitude of disagreements, search and conflict. Man until deep talk with himself will not be able to talk to the world.Although Kane is incredibly rich and powerful, failing to take advantage of this wealth and power in order to win the election for governor, to promote his second wife as an opera star, or have the love and loyalty of those who surround him. At the end is shown as a lonely old man, imprisoned in his castle, ornate palace which was built to satisfy his ego. His precious things can not replace the emotional loss to the in your life.The acting is pretty good. I think that . Joseph Cotten (Jedediah Leland), garnered the sympathy of the majority. Kane is people generally was good fun. Loneliness, visible at the end of the film fulfills the main character throughout his life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kane's dying words are so simple and yet so powerful "Rosebud".Rosebud's the name of Kane's sled which he lose when he's taken away from his mother. Its the moment when he also lose the innocent of being an child and youthful happens. Those are replaced with the prospect of becoming an adult in an hostile world. That brings noting than just misery and unhappiness. Thus the meaning of Kane's final words's right in front of everyone sight yet nobody see through them. Because they themselves have also gone through similar prospect as Mr. Kane when going form youthful child to an unfulfilled adult. Citizan Kane's far as i'm concerned is just one of very few movies that make me cry every time I watch. Probably because I feel deeply connected with the change of going from child to an adult. Which I find highly depressing. Deepdown I feel like child trying to survive in the hostile world of acting like an adult, just like mr. Kane had to do in the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Every bit the masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Charles Foster Kane (played by Orson Welles), media mogul, dies at his isolated palatial estate, Xanadu. A virtual recluse, his only company was his large retinue of servants and his collection of priceless artifacts. A news outlet sets out to reveal the man behind the legend, going through articles and books on Kane, interviewing his friends, associates and ex-wife. They see his rise to power and fortune, his marriages, his attempts at politics. Moreover, they are striving to discover the meaning of his dying utterance - Rosebud. A masterpiece in every way. Superb plot, written by Orson Welles and Herman J Mankiewicz. Covers some very powerful themes, all of which are still relevant today: the corruption of innocence and ideals by power, wealth and greed; the power, manipulation and deceitfulness of the media, the yearning for simpler times and how earthly fortunes mean nothing in the end.Brilliant direction by Welles - this movie set a new benchmark in the field and even today would be difficult to surpass. His camera work and cinematography are exquisite: the use of light and dark (especially), the camera angles, panning shots. Just watching it you know you are watching a master craftsman at work - every shot is carefully planned and deliberately aimed to create a certain effect. It feels like art.Solid performances all round, with Welles to the fore again. Even the makeup is in another league - witness the transformations of Kane from 25 years old to 30-something, to 50-something all the way to his final days at 70-something.Probably the biggest travesty in all of cinema is that Citizen Kane did not win the 1942 Best Picture Oscar. It was nominated in nine categories, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Leading Actor and Best Original Screenplay, but only one won Oscar - Best Original Screenplay. Best Picture went to How Green Was My Valley, a good movie but not in Citizen Kane's league.The reason for this may well have been a campaign by media tycoon William Randolph Hearst to discredit the movie and prevent it from being released. The movie was loosely based on the life of Hearst.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's a lot of controversy over whether or not this really is one of the greatest motion pictures of all time. Citizen Kane was utterly fantastic regarding its technical aspects, and full of groundbreaking visuals. There were plenty of different and interesting camera angles being used. Every shot was meticulously planned, and the cinematography was outstanding. I really liked all the little lighting tricks, and the lighting really added to the atmosphere of the film. The editing was also interesting and really brought all the shots together. Welles managed to put together a complex story loaded with symbolism. It's understandable that many people find Citizen Kane boring, but the story is simply a slow build, and takes a little bit of patience on the viewer's part. It isn't my favorite film, but watching it was a great experience nonetheless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Citizen Kane is one the most analyzed and interpreted movies of all time. Thousands upon thousands of reviews have been written about Citizen Kane and its praise goes beyond that of a "good movie." The cinematography is above reproach and is unlike any other movie i've seen. The lighting, camera angles, camera techniques, and the use of space such as background and foreground are amazing and really captured my attention. The acting is marvelous and stands the test of time. Even watching it today as a younger movie enthusiast the acting is still inviting. The plot and direction of the movie keep you interested although some have said they find it to be "slow" or "boring." Orson Welles created a real masterpiece with this movie, even if it didn't see initial wild success. There isn't much more to say about this classic that hasn't already been said, discussed, and reviewed so i will only say this; watch this movie because it is a timeless classic that you will enjoy if you are a fan of, and can appreciate, classic cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Citizen Kane" is perhaps one of the most powerful film productions in American history there is quite a lot to admire and loathe about the film regardless is it thought about carefully and is made a reference of even years after the hit was quite done being a hit. "Citizen Kane" directed by Orson Wells also stars the incredibly talented director as our protagonist Charles Fster Kaneloosely based on the successful life of William Harst. what truly makes this picture so unique is the form of which is is shot, filmed, and edited. not only is this story told through a reporters research of the late mr. Kane but it is expressed using flash backs of the life and legacy of the wealthy and successful publisher. what is also very powerful about this film is that wells wrote directed and starred in this American classic. wells wrote a legacy of his own. this entire film is not even for a second about the what is happening to the world, or a society, or a family, or to a relationship, or a man. it is dedicated to observing and analyzing one character.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cinematic and Storytelling raw excellence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film by Orson Welles shows the end of the film first, but without explanation. The ensuring story, is about that explanation. It fills in the pieces of it as it goes along from various angles and viewpoints from those who knew him in some way in some point and time, or the few that actually managed to have a close relationship with Mr. Kane, such as his best friend Leland. This film capitalized it's black and white color base, use of low and high camera angles to show the power dynamic, and lighting most heavily to relay this story (outside of the ever clear use of diction in this, and many other, films). The film plays in a staggered time-wave while remaining logically chronological. It progresses with giving flashback moments of a forward moving story that we as the audience know from the opening scene, him dying alone saying "Rosebud" with his final breaths. The film makes great use of being filmed in black and white, to have stark shadow contrast, and of light 3-point lighting. Low key lighting is made dominant, but high key is used as well. Just as in life, there are happy times and there are not so happy, dark, fearful, stressful, depressed times. It is an autobiographical representation of real world William Randolph Hearst. Hearst hated the film and fought to keep it out of theaters, away from eyes that would view it and stick to it as truth of the extremely powerful man, how always has an air of a low camera angle following his life. Kane, becomes just as powerful, but the dark side to all of his success, and all of his and those close to him, such as his wife. The Welles rendition both shows the extravagance and aired out the dirty laundry of it all. He kept the fact that Hearst was a hard working man with the drive and ambition, dedication to success and charm, that helped bring him to the top. But he added in the bad, which was distasteful and unacceptable to Hearst. Still this film remains in circulation, and the cinematic prowess with which this story is told remains one of the many great American film classics.</fullReview>

Then i try to watch it. Wow, Citizen Kane was indisputable. I didn't need to contemplate carefully to make a statement that Citizen Kane was the best movie ever made. Cinematography that Welles use exalted by so many directors nowadays. It teach the next generation about what a true cinematography is. Welles is an inspirator of film directors.The difficulties to make Citizen Kane was extremely high. Maybe the hardest film ever made in history. The shadows and lighting direction implementation was absolutely triumphant. The camera set- piece, positioning, and movement was indisputably genius. I can't compare the geniusity of Orson Welles in Citizen Kane to anybody. This was a true maximum potential of cinematography in movie history. If we ask which movie have the best cinematography ever, of course it was Citizen Kane.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I fondly recollect, growing up in Canada in the 70's and 80's, my mom taking my older sister and I to the cinema (my dad was more interested in watching bowling, hockey, or either crime shows, British sitcoms or hockey on TV). Despite all of his TV appearances over the years, and films he acted in to fund his own productions, the first time I was aware of Orson Welles was one of those startling and bizarrely professional yet unmistakably charismatic 'Paul Masson' wine commercials that they tend to make fun of on The Simpsons in these decades gone by. My first thought was 'that voice is amazing', then 'he looks like he'd be a fine grandfather or Santa Claus', and I instantly wanted to know who he was: Just the way he carried himself, I knew he must be both brilliant and someone who was really important.As you can tell, I'm not going to unnecessarily repeat all the endless accolades this film has gotten over the years. If you're any type of film lover, you have either seen this or will eventually--unless you're hit by a bus tomorrow (Heaven forbid) or something else drastic. It's a hallmark of what is possible in cinema. I waited until I was 46 to see this, because of its stellar reputation. It's not my favourite Welles--either acting or directing, and not by a long shot in either regard--but I'm very glad that I finally saw it, and I'll probably revisit it every couple of years for the rest of my life. There's just something really special about it that's hardly ever seen any more--and I think of that just as wistfully as Charles Foster Kane did about his beloved 'Rosebud'. That a 25-year-old could be so gleefully and breathtakingly experimental and innovative, yet still endlessly entertain, is nothing short of miraculous.</fullReview>

As the audience views this scene, we are left to wonder who this man was and what that one last word is supposed to mean. Of course, the people surrounding Kane are curious as well what this man could possibly mean. Fellow reporters are determined to find out what this man could've meant and almost go crazy trying to discover what he would mean. We are taken through a series of flashbacks of Kane's life and how he became so successful and why this last word was so important. This movie is all about the journey of success, power and greed.

While I may not agree with that statement, it would be difficult for me to disagree. It is one of, if not the most aesthetically pleasing films of its generation. A modern film-maker would be challenged to shoot a movie as beautifully as Citizen Kane was shot, even given modern technologies and CGI.When it comes to characters, one would have a difficult time finding a more dynamic one than Charles Foster Kane (Orson Welles). Kane is essentially three different people throughout the movie, and the viewer is convinced of each personality the character takes on.If Citizen Kane is not the greatest film of all time, it could never be ruled out of the discussion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great story that stands the test of time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was very glad that I knew almost nothing about this movie before watching it outside of its being very acclaimed. It's pretty clear why it's so well renowned due to it's great central character and driving question of "who or what is Rosebud?". Without giving any spoilers, I was totally shocked by the revelation of Rosebud at the end. It really ties in well to Kane's personality, because Rosebud reminds him of the only time in his life that he felt loved and wasn't just millions of dollars of inherited money.Kane is a rather tragic figure. He is a nice guy that wants to do something good, but has that insatiable desire to be loved by people. This desire is the flaw that keeps him from relating to people and drives all of his actions. He tries several different ways to get people to love him, and most of these means seem positive on the surface. But somehow Kane just can't trust himself to fully commit to something. He "thinks it would be fun" to run a newspaper; he doesn't think it would be fulfilling or fruitful or a good experience. And while he puts a lot of effort into running the Inquirer, he has no sense of how to make profit with it. Part of his dilemma also takes root in his money. He recognizes that he has more money and time than he knows what to do with, so he throws his money away on whims like building an entire theater for his second wife Susan. He thinks that he can buy his friends, but his money can't buy their trust. His wives, though completely different in personality, both leave him because they feel unloved by Kane. By the end of the chronology, everyone close to Kane has abandoned him including his entire newspaper staff, two wives, and his parents.The story is told through the eyes of the minor characters. Jedediah Leland is the most pessimistic and has little sympathy for Kane. Emily, Kane's first wife, is not given much screen time, but is the first example of how Kane hurts the people he comes in contact with and leaves them feeling bitter. Mr. Bernstein seems to have some more sympathy for Kane, but still sees his flaws. Susan remembers him with hatred for his the ignorance and materialism that Kane treated her with. I wish they could have gone a bit more in depth with the reporter researching Kane's life. In some ways it's his role to be an Everyman and giving him a personality might kind of tell the audience how to react rather than letting them react. Still, I can't remember ever seeing the reporter's face clearly or hearing any real emotion from him. It's interesting to see how all of Kane's old friends turn out later in life and how they remember him. He seems to have left a pretty notable impression on each of them, but none of them remember him fondly, or at least that isn't their primary memory of him.As it was made some seventy years ago, it doesn't come off as very technically striking. But the directing is remarkably engaging for the time it was made. Some of the acting felt a little unrealistic, but for the most part the characters feel real. This is especially noteworthy considering that, as is stated in the credits, most of the actors had never been in anything else. Orson Wells is great as Kane with his intense expressions. The only time his acting felt off was when he trashes Susan's bedroom after she walks out on him. However, I would assume that scene was done in only one or two takes, so the acting is excusable. The script also kept the characters distinct and kept the story moving at a good pace. I especially liked how it hinted at some things that came later in Kane's life such as Susan and Xanadu.If you're someone who mainly seeks entertainment from movies, this won't probably entertain you like modern movies. But if you are willing to watch with some thought and enjoy a deep story, you won't find many that are better than this. Anyone looking to write stories, whether for film or not, with strong characters should watch this. I would really recommend that you watch the whole thing through if only to learn the meaning of Rosebud. Overall Rating: 7.8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Was very confused about this movie throughout the entire movie not easily lost with certain things that were happening maybe I should have paid better attention and I possibly could have understanded it more from what I did understand it was a well made movie and great acting throughout the entire movie this movie could resemble certain people to this day to where they came from little and built an empire around themselves with their hard work and hard work from other people could not fathom having 496 people living in my house with me but while they were there for was to take care of me and my wife that would be completely insane in my book but none the less this was a very good movie and great acting the picture was also of good quality and it was great to see the many different features throughout the movie including the statues that he had brought in to furnish his house</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Citizen Kane" is possibly the most acclaimed film that I know of. It's been called the "greatest film of all time" by a lot of film critics, polls, magazines, etc.The film is a chronicle of the life of Charles Foster Kane, a fictional character based off of William Randolph Hearst, a famous newspaper publisher. The film's structure is highly unconventional, in which Kane's life is revealed through interviews with various people who knew him well, making a majority of the film a series of flashbacks.On both a technical and story level the film is quite influential. The story, itself, becomes far more bleak and dark than a lot of the films coming out at that time (at least in the US, that is), and it completely insults a very powerful figure (that being William Randolph Hearst) who was still alive at the time, and fought to get the film banned (just watch the documentary "The Battle Over Citizen Kane" and the drama "RKO 281", two films that are also quite great).On a technical level, there's many extremely inventive techniques being developed here. There's one particularly interesting low angle shot that was made so low because Welles actually drilled a hole in the floor of the set. Other than that shot, you mine as well look at every single other shot or scene if you want to see some technical innovation. You could just analyze it frame by frame if you want to attempt to see all of its influential visuals, and you still may not have truly seen all of the detail. As Roger Ebert said on the commentary, "Citizen Kane" is actually a special effects picture. The main difference between this film's special effects and the special effects in a film like "Jurassic Park" (another greatly influential film) is that the special effects in this film are kind of hidden, but nonetheless powerful in their own right.A lot of people may call it the #1 most important film of all time, but I have to disagree. While it certainly is one of the most important films of all time, one really needs to go back to the silent era to find all the TRULY most important films. Films like "A Trip to the Moon", "The Great Train Robbery", "The Birth of a Nation", and "Intolerance". Welles, himself, actually did say during his introduction of D.W. Griffith's classic "Intolerance" that that film deserves all the credit for a lot of modern cinema's techniques.However, with all its technical innovations that have been talked on and on about time and time again, I've heard very little about how ENTERTAINING the film is. "Well that's because it isn't entertaining!" I can hear some guy who had overly high expectations (and gave the film 1 star with a lengthy review entitled "Disappointing") shout. Well, you're wrong, the film is quite entertaining! Sure, there's no action sequences, explosions, Adam Sandler doesn't play his twin sister, and Kevin James doesn't wackily fall down 420,000 times, but there IS true human emotion, iconic lines of dialogue, and a truly compelling imagery that ends with one of cinema's greatest twists! There was actually a time in my life in which I watched "Citizen Kane" nearly once a day because I enjoyed it so much! I genuinely watched it TWICE in one day just because of how much I enjoyed it, which is very rare with me.If you're looking for the greatest film of all time, maybe you should lower your expectations a tad bit and just experience the film for what it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exceeded expectations and then some!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As someone who's seen plenty of excellent modern films, I expected Citizen Kane's greatness to strongly depend on historic innovations rather than truly timeless quality. But after watching it in my film course this week, I immediately recognized why it has been touted by many (including famous film critic Roger Ebert) as nothing less than the best piece of cinema to ever grace the silver screen.Orson Welles and his team left no stone unturned in their quest to fill every scene with clever camera-work, intelligent blocking, smooth editing and... well the list goes on and on. Right from the first scene, where you are embraced with the cold and dark tone of the movie through creatively plastered-together shots of the ominous Kane castle, you know you are in for something special. Something that I don't normally notice in contemporary movies but I picked up on in this one is the lighting. The lighting in this film is practically another character, and this in and of itself is something to be in awe of. I can't imagine the amount of time, effort and talent it required to craft something so precisely beautiful. I feel like a sap going on like this but Citizen Kane truly is a masterclass in filmmaking.I went into this movie expecting a dull experience with decent technical aspects and cheesy performances but left it with a whole new mindset on what makes a good film and what makes a good filmmaker. If you're a terrible cinephile like me who is reluctant to watch the 1940s classics, I strongly recommend giving this a watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Movie Worth Watching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a film student who wants to make films of his own, I had to watch Citizen Kane. The greatest movie of all time? A masterpiece? Well I wouldn't say that it's the greatest movie of all time. However it is worth a great deal. It's a movie with a central theme you see in a lot of cinema, television, and novels of the past few centuries (it is a very common theme you could apply to anything really). However Citizen Kane does it in a very unique way. The film centers around a man who's been given everything in his life. His education, his fortune, and his pride. All of these things were gifted to him by the choice of his Mother. Seeking to give her son a better life after discovering she owned a wealthy gold mine, he is ripped from a quaint life in the west to a life of riches and (as mentioned before) higher education and class. The film centers around "Rosebud", the point of stability that Kane uses in his older years to remind him of a different time. And one man's quest as to what Rosebud means. Ultimately the quest for Rosebud is abandoned, as only the man himself might know what it means. It is discovered at the end that it is his sled that was named Rosebud the whole time (I kinda had a hunch at the beginning after he is gifted a new sled to replace it at the beginning of the film). What this means to me is Kane looking back on older, better times. Before his life was made more complicated. Kane states at the beginning that he's close to what he wanted to be, but that he'd rather have earned what he made. Kane wanted love in his life because he was deprived of that when he was young. He would've rather spent life with people who loved him, that he loved in return. Rosebud is the trust between his family and him, something he lost when he was taken from them to a different life. Perhaps the life of a different man. Rosebud is everything that Kane lost, and perhaps more. Overall the movie holds up pretty well for its age. This movie isn't the greatest of all time, because there is no greatest film of all time. Every film has something to offer to different people, and you won't find the same thing in every film. However Citizen Kane is a film I recommend you see at least once, just so that you can decide for yourself if Kane is right for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie widely considered to be the absolute best. Almost every "Best movie ever" list has Citizen Kane either at number 1 or somewhere else. This is a movie everyone has talked about, even going into the relatively small minority in comparison of saying it is terrible. So with it's reputation being what it is it's either a love it or hate it movie and I can see why on both fronts.A media tycoon dies and utters his last word, that being "Rosebud". Being that this guy was a high profile man all throughout his life the media decides to look back and ask just exactly what he means by the word "Rosebud". We see everything from his family adopting him to a richer family just for the money, him attempting to make his newspaper focused on giving the working man the truth, his political campaign, his scandals, his romances and how quickly they grow apart all up to when his second wife leaves him.Okay, onto what people may not like about this movie. Well, Charles Foster Kane isn't as easy of a character to warm to as others and the rest of the characters have almost nothing to them. That and I wouldn't think the "What do his last words mean?" holds that much weight and one of the reasons for that is nobody was in the room with him and it's kind of instantaneous in the movie wanting to suck us into it. Unless my rating may not make my opinion clear cut, I do like this movie - I'm just saying that it has it's share of problems and I'm not saying it isn't possible to get sucked into "Rosebud" or the characters or how it can be overlooked how nobody was in the room. I'm just saying it may be a little difficult for others.I've just trashed the greatest movie of all time so I should say what I like. The cinematography is brilliant. The acting is great and that set design is so good. I will say while he might not be the most likable of characters I did sympathize with Kane in a way that has to wait until the ending but even so there are clues that suggest that his performance is of a man who knows how much emptier his existence is getting.I will say while I am not really in the crowd of "It's the greatest movie of all time" I can see why a few would consider it a masterpiece. It's all subjective but I have seen other movies considered to be masterpieces that I have found to be much better but it is worth a look to see what the fuss is about. It might have become a cliché to say how great this movie is but I will say it's a damn good one.</fullReview>

The acting is terrific and the and the suspense building up in the film was fantastic. The lighting was dramatic without being too over the top. Its very interesting how Wells uses low camera angles to make the central characters seem absurdly tall, this is a very successful technique. The ending was outstanding and very satisfying.

		<fullReview>This film was great, the way that time was portrayed was pretty cool: using the makeup department to tell us how old Kane was becoming and also what was happening. In the opening scene we see Kane, an old man in bed saying his final words, then we're brought to the past, a childhood memory of Kane with his "Rosebud." Flashbacks was one of the most important tools in this film. Throughout the film we're brought from one point in time to another, each scene holding some type of significance. The way in which the cinematography carried out each scene was incredible. This film was sad in a way. We're giving this character (round character), a man who wants to be successful and a man who wants to be loved by everyone. He doesn't realize that he doesn't need love from many to be happy because he already had it from is second wife...or is it his third? I'm not certain but in the end its terrible, he suffers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Once Thought To Be The Greatest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Following the death of a publishing tycoon (Orson Welles), news reporters scramble to discover the meaning of his final utterance.What stands out about this film is the cinematography, not just the concept of "deep focus" (which puts so much in a single frame, such as young Charles out the window) but also the use of the lowered floor to make people larger than life. For students of film, this is one they must see early in order to fully grasp the importance of the camera.What is also interesting about this film is its rising and then falling star over the years. Disappointing on its first release, booed at the Oscars, and silenced out of existence... it later rose to be considered by many as the greatest film in cinema history. Now, since the 1990s, it seems to be slipping again. Not that IMDb is an authority, but it has fallen from the site's top spot to much lower. How far will it fall?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most empathy i've felt for a character in a while</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Citizen Kane is widely regarded as 'the greatest film of all time'. After seeing it at the top of the American Film Institute 100 list i decided to actually watch it and i can safely say that after i watched it, you can certainly see why. spoilers ahead so if you haven't seen it don't read on.The film starts off with a few dark and dreary shots of Xanadu, (essentially a palace owned by Charles foster Kane) building up tension before zooming close to the small snow dome ball he has in his hand, Then he utters 'Rosebud' the most famous line in movie history. The snow dome ball is then dropped and the story begins.After a short documentary on Charlie Kane has been shown the men at the magazine begin to sought after the meaning of his final utterance.Charlie Kane's parents inherited a mine which happened to be rich in gold. His parents sign the bill to Walter parks thatcher which gives him the authority to raise Charles in extreme luxury. This scene is very sad indeed the boy is reluctant to leave his parents but in the end succumbed to Mr. thatcher and sets away with him we see a close up of Charlie's sled which then becomes neglected in the snow. That is a huge scene and a sad one at that. The investigative reporter Thompson triggers every flashback by questioning his old alcoholic wife Susan Alexander Kane, his old wilting friend Jedediah Leland and his rich associate Mr. Bernstein.We learn about his beginning in the publishing business from Mr. Bernstein from when he took over the inquirer to the marriage of the presidents niece. When the flashback is over Bernstein says "maybe rosebud was something he lost, Kane was a man who lost everything he had" At this point we are intrigued to learn more about Mr Kane who seems to be an enigma.The story then builds character depth for Charlie and the rest making us feel a lot along the way, i can say that the cinematography is a huge part in this and the way Welles acts as Charlie Kane is exceptional, the supporting cast are great too Joseph Cotten puts in a key performance. latter stages of the film will now be explored.The penultimate flashback about old Charlie Kane and the rockiness of his relationship with Susan, she sits alone in Xanadu playing jigsaw puzzles to pass the time feeling lonely and bored the subsequent shot, she begins to argue with Charlie saying that despite having all these items bought for her none of them mean anything implying Charlie has bribed her into making her think he is a generous man who cares and making her love him, the next shot shows Susan leaving Charlie it then backs out of the flashback to Susan telling Thompson that she advises him to speak to Charlie's butler at Xanadu he sets off to find him.The final flashback is triggered by Raymond the butler, we see a wonderfully acted scene by Orson Welles trash up the room throwing everything down in it's path bed sheets, shelves, mirrors, everything you could think of apart from one thing the Small glass snow dome, Charlie picks this up and says "rosebud" we know from this shot that because it stopped the crazy outburst it is something extremely sentimental to him but at this point we are still not sure exactly what rosebud means. The members of the magazine are reunited with Thompson at Xanadu which is completely full of statues and other material objects purchased by Charlie Kane, They ask Thompson did you find out what rosebud means ? he responds "no i didn't, i don't think a single word can describe a single mans life my guess is that rosebud was something he lost or something he couldn't get, anyway i don't think it would have explained anything". The famous shot of the camera slowly making it's way past all of the junk to the sled he once had as a child, we here the butler say "burn all this useless junk" the sled is then thrown into the fire where we see the close up of 'Rosebud' the paint then curls and the film ends.This film gives me a huge bone chilling feeling every time i watch it to the final scene where we see rosebuds meaning it fills us with deep sadness and huge empathy towards Charles foster Kane, we found out that rosebud symbolised innocence, a memory of a once normal childhood playing in the snow, youth and happiness. This film tells us that although you can be the richest man in America you can still be extremely lonely, happiness can not be fulfilled purely by money nor can it buy love or friendship there is a famous line in the film where Charles Kane says "You know Mr. Bernstein if i hadn't have been really rich i might have been a really great man" Charles Kane just wanted to lead a happy life like most of us.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not bad. Not bad at all.But I cannot tell when this movie is failing and when it is just being purposefully stylistic and I am being an ignorant peasant. There is a number of times when a character makes a joke and others start laughing heartily...and it's not funny, and...I think it is meant to be not funny, but then again I am not sure. Other times the movie is quite funny with barely any effort.Actors overact, and it seems they are doing so on purpose, in the style of the that time. And yet other times the acting is quite modern and realistic.Then there is that fake looking old man's face mask that the main actor wears in the entire second half of the movie. If you think old man makeup looks bad in today's movies, try a 40s movie.And yet again, overall the visuals are quite good. The effects are interesting. It feels like the makers really tried to come up with new stuff. There are a lot of dissolves between shots and camera is flying through things. The film has a dream-like aesthetic.The plot is quite good, but is the movie teaching me lessons about life or is it being preachy and pretentious? Perhaps both? Overall, the movie is quite charming and well-acted. I just can't understand where its brilliance ends and its flaws begin.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The forever fascinating &amp; fantastic search for "Rosebud"?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although I'm not entirely convinced if I would personally label it the greatest film in cinematic history (there are just so many to choose from), "Citizen Kane" remains an indisputable landmark that still seemingly gets better with every repeated viewing ? which is quite astounding after so many viewings already ? and it will presumably forever qualify as the most influential artistic achievement ever. Orson Welles' brilliant long-feature debut is, prior to and above everything else, a progressive movie that was far ahead of its time in terms of narrative structure, camera work and imagery, source material and pulverizing the sacred American Dream! Welles masterfully depicts self-made tycoon Charles Foster Kane from the birth of his newspaper empire, over the Great Depression and throughout two failed marriages, until his lonely passing in his private sanctuary named Xanadu. Kane is rather blatantly inspired by the real-life newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst, and he certainly didn't consider this to be great honor. He even tried boycotting Welles' film, and partially succeeded as his career never fully recovered from Hearst hatred campaign. Understandable, perhaps, since Kane is illustrated as a forceful but megalomaniac and incredibly stubborn tyrant. Everything about "Citizen Kane" is just overwhelming and demonstrates sheer macho power: the dialogs, the scenery and the bombastic soundtrack. Everything, except ? Rosebud.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think that Citizen Kane's story line is to simplistic and unbelievably boring. I think that it does hold some neat aspects to it since it does jump around from the past to the present, but even with this element, it is surprisingly easy to follow. Because of this, it made watching the movie very dull and tedious. Since it was boring, the entire time I was watching the movie I felt that I was trying to figure out if I was missing a bigger picture or I wasn't grasping the true meaning of the film. I felt like I was missing something which maybe took away from the film itself. But then during those final scenes did it all come together and make sense. In the end it wasn't that bad of a movie. I did LOVE the lighting aspect in this film. It was a very bright film! I loved the way that the light reflected off the character's faces. I liked the very dark backgrounds and suits compared to the lighter aspects of the film like the walls of the buildings and the highlighted parts on their faces.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reel Look: 'Citizen Kane'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Rosebud..." When experienced screenwriter Herman Mankiewicz collaborated with Welles on a screenplay originally called "The American", it was going to be based on the life of Willaim Randolph Hearst. Hearst in his time had put together an empire of newspapers, radio stations, magazines and news services. To top it all off over his achievements and successes, he then built to himself the flamboyant mansion of San Simeon; a castle that only came to be furnished by rummaging through the remains of numerous countries. What more can be said about this milestone in cinematic history that has not been said to death? I, in turn, will continue to do so thus. Let's take a look.In retrospect of this phenomenal film full of depth and physical manifestation, Orson Welles' tour de force 1941 masterpiece 'Citizen Kane' indeed earns the rights to be regarded as "the greatest movie ever made" due to its magnificent themes, metaphors and camera angles. Here, we meet William Randolph Hearst (a twenty-five year old Welles), a newspaper tycoon who eventually metamorphoses into an aging, lonely old man with hardly a spark left for a soul. Hearst was the Ted Turner, Bill Gates and Warren Buffet of his day, encompassed and ensnared in an egocentric oasis. The aftermath of Hearst had effects on both the movie and Orson Welles' career by engaging the viewer into a world where power and greed can eventually lead into emptiness and depravity. Hearst and the character of Charles Foster Kane diminish slowly together on a long, sorrowing note, ending their lives with a somewhat similar void that could never be gained back. His dying word "Rosebud" (an extreme close-up of his giant rubbery lips before releasing a snow globe that crashes to the floor) encapsulates and summarizes his very existence as a man of power has every aspect and viewpoint snatched from his once-iron clutches. A news reel obituary "News On The March" tells the life story of Kane, as one of the viewers, a reporter named Jerry Thompson (William Alland, a thankless role in which we never see his face) is tasked to discover the meaning behind that last puzzling word uttered "Rosebud" via interviewing friends and associates of the now-deceased magnate. We then sojourn through memories and hauting shadows of the past of a once wealthy man with a hollow existence, echoing that from promising beginnings with newspapers to that of the abandoned Xanadu. Through vivid memory and recollections, we go back to when, as a boy, we see he was taken east to a boarding school, losing security, hope and innocence all too soon by his parent's forbidding choice for a "promising future" (his mother played by Agnes Moorehead). This role would be played throughout he spectrum of his whole life, leaving him completely drained of something he lost and could never gain again. An example being when tries to make his mistress and second wife Susan Alexander Kane (Dorothy Comingore) an opera star, only as the camera pans up to a stagehand above holding his nose. Kane had spoken and entertained millions, but as his life came to a close, he died alone in his enormous and luxurious palatial estate in Xanadu that had died along with him, surrounded by priceless artifacts from around the globe that he could never take to the grave excepting a single untouchable source: his own inner turmoil. A vast palace of great and powerful splendor was now an empty shell, along with its now deceased and powerless owner. Kane may have died in the picture nonetheless, but Orson Welles' unforgettable portrayal of him and his directorial debut boosted his career even higher to continue on to making more wonderful films.The metaphors in this film are very clear for someone with a keen and observant eye. It is these bravura moments that truly capture the essence of the picture itself. For example, when Kane is sitting with his first wife at the dinner table, the camera shows a newspaper headline and then goes back to them. As this goes on, we see them separating more and more from each other as a new headline appears. It is showing the viewer on where their relationship is going and how it is going to end: estranged with nothing but a large gap between them. Another moment is when Kane is alone in his darkened, barren office talking with an inebriated Jed Leland (Joseph Cotten). Here the camera angle is show looking up at them from the ground, implying a defeated Kane feeling as hollow as the newspaper room in which he works. A third example is when we see the many Kane reflected through the parallel mirrors, each one the same shape and persona. It is here that Kane is who he is, which will always be his enigma for the people he knew as for himself.This spectacular masterpiece should not be missed by anyone. On this being the second viewing of this film in my life, and probably not being the last, I too have noticed things that I have overlooked before. Though I have only scratched the service and papers upon papers have been written about this cornerstone of cinema, seventy plus years later it still remains a powerhouse of brilliant achievement for Welles and for the generation of cinema that forever raises the bar of genius filmmaking.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is only great in the cinema world due to its outstanding use of new techniques in cinematography. So the great things could be listed on and on about why its such a great movie technically etc. However, while watching this movie the most impressive technique I found was using a human characteristic in keeping the viewer alert. That was: curiosity, that was: rosebud. The urge of wanting to know what rosebud means makes the movie good to sit through. Other than that, there isn't anything else that made the movie fun to watch. Of course, the acting was great also but this movie is already a professionally made movie which naturally leads the audience expecting good acting anyway. So if you want to know what rosebud means in the movie, go ahead and watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A gem from the Golden Age of Hollywood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a reason this Orson Welles's production is set as an example to most film students already during their first lectures. Filming techniques, sets and script itself are carefully thought through and perfected that very often even a few seconds short moment in the film can 'haunt' you long time after watching the masterpiece as it has many cinema lovers since the golden age of Hollywood. Mise-en-sc?ne, cinematography and actors are at their best. And I don't think I have seen a movie that could be stood next to Citizen Kane's mise-en-sc?ne for it's numerous and powerful moods and meanings created. One of my all time favourite pictures from the Golden Age of Hollywood, forever and after ..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Cinema classic, from a modern perspective</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Citizen Kane is a classic movie that many consider to be one of the if not the best film of all time, but I can't help but disagree. Now I will say this is very good and the film is firmly that as well, it doesn't have the same effect I think it had back then that it does now and has been eclipsed by more modern dramas. Here below I will review the film and tell you why I did though think it was very good.The story is an epic tale of intertwined periods of Charles Foster Kane's life that do go together so well and done so well that even if you get slightly confused, the story telling takes you away from that. It has it's slower moments but most of them lead up to big dramatic scenes with powerful exchanges between characters and parts where you can't help feel for the character, whether it is good, or even at times bad.Orson Welles is brilliant at acting in this movie, he by far is the best actor used here and that old thing of people saying the supporting actor is the star of the show is cast away with his superb leading performance. Joseph Cotton does well too here and really when the mood is more anger or even sadness, he manages to be the one seeming most depressed and down on his luck. Dorothy Comingore I felt although very loud and screechy, does a good performance and adds to the wealth of great actors performing in this picture.Welles Directs and writes this as if it was easy, simple little scenes with very little going on get wrapped in the key dialogue and great choices of wording to make it actually entertaining. With it also being in black an white you may think the brightness never really shows but the script really makes up for any mistakes the film may have as it is so delicately done that you feel Welles may just be one of the best writers of all time.My review seems very positive yes but the film is not all sublime as It looks, I disliked the middle of the end shall we say with it's confusing back and forth story line and in a sense predictable ending. I wanted more on the rosebud theories, I wanted to delve even more into his life but we only see him at his highest success and lowest endeavours so it would have been nice to have seen more of his life.Who to recommend this too?, well the critics love it and so should anyone who REALLY get's into classic cinema and enjoys it picking away at it's subtle story lines. I can't say some modern audiences would enjoy(and not just because of the black and white used) ,it is just very slow and a long movie to say it is all talking pretty much, great drama yes but to some, it could just be a bore-fest. Overall it is Firmly a Very Good movie and quite possibly moving near to being Great. With this you have to not watch it as if you have heard the critics applaud it to it's highest level, but watching it not knowing a thing will actually do better, you might not enjoy it as much as people say but I still think it is an important step in the history of cinema and for that very reason alone, It is essential viewing for any budding critic or cinema lover out there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Highly Over-rated, Like Gone With the Wind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Citizen Kane is the fictionalized story of William Randolph Hearst, right down to the inherited mine. It is a fascinating yet overly-long film that, just like GWTW, bogs down during it's last half. Too much time is spent on his 2nd wife, a singer of very limited talent, who ultimately leads to the destruction of Kane's life and happiness. Except for the fact that she is a beautiful woman, she is shallow and boring, and I care very little for her life story, which dominates far too much time in this movie. Although Kane wins the governorship, it is curious that very little time is shown with him doing anything while in office. A sterling cast, with Agnes Moorehead playing his first wife, and Joseph Cotten as the chief narrator. Orson himself is a wonderful actor. His aging makeup, while clumsy at times, is remarkably accurate. The movie is at its best when telling the story of Kane's rise to newspaper power as the king of "yellow journalism". The photography is outstanding, and it makes full use of what was then-called "deep focus" with the entire frame from front to back, sharp as a tack. The simulated newsreel footage is outstanding, as is the musical score by Bernard Hermann. Wonderful sets and masterful miniatures and mattes. However, tedious to watch, as I found myself unable to enjoy it in one sitting, almost falling asleep! It's too much like a good murder mystery. Once you know that "Rosebud" refers to his childhood wooden sled, which was his beloved possession before he became rich and was sent off to an Eastern boarding school, the movie does not require repeated viewing. Once is enough, for me!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More Personal Onslaught on Randolph Hearst than Great Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen this now 3 times, once in a full-size cinema, and while really wanting to admire it I think it's only possible to do that if you can judge it in 1940s context.The camera-work is - I'm informed, I have no expertise - ground-breaking but almost all of the plot is mundane (esp the parts on his electoral hopes and second marriage) and overall it drags. The official nub may be intended to be, what did Kane mean by Rosebud, but overriding that is the Emperor's Clothes question: why on earth should we care? And the answer is no we shouldn't! Kane is another ambitious tragic soul and with respect to Orson Welles (who must surely have known this) that subject has been more covered in art than almost everything else. Yes, the fictional Charles Kane is very likely modelled on Randolph Hearst, which may be the real point of making the movie, but if so, its interest lies in it being a personal onslaught, not a great production.Most of the 6/10 rating is for the visual ingenuity... in the end here is just another old man who sacrificed too much of his humanity on the path to material fortune. Citizen Kane is I'd imagine best viewed if you don't expect anything special - although the final 15 minutes, showing the ageing beast in his sad finery, are probably worth a look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>flashbacks and the unanswered questions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Citizen Kane is regarded by many to be one of the greatest films of all time. As for its significance it bring a lot to the table as far as cinematic structure and meaning are concerned. With regard to the structure the film consists of almost entirely flashbacks and the revisiting of a dead mans best associates and acquaintances, including an ex-wife. This film style exhibits how using flashbacks as a films core story telling method can truly capture an audience. It forces viewers to ,like the reporters in the movie, piece together Charles Kane's life and story based on what we learn about his past. Flashbacks had never been quite been used in this style or to this extent. unlike most previous film when the flashback started and continued throughout the entire plot duration and most of the screen duration Citizen Kane continuously goes back in fourth from reality to flashbacks as reporters try and uncover the meaning Charles Kane's last words, "Rosebud". Considering meaning the films has a powerful and significant message. Come to find out Rosebud was the name stenciled onto Kane's sled that he is seen playing with as a child before his parents give him away to wealthy business owner in hopes he will live a better life and become successful. Kane becomes one of the richest men in America but is seemingly ungrateful to the man who assisted him in getting there. An old friend of Kane reveals throughout his life he seems to go to great lengths to try and please those he loved and was always doing things that would make him feel loved. At the end of the movie its revealed the Rosebud sled is in the home where Kane died. This implies that being given away by his parents made Kane strive to achieve a feeling of love and embrace that is unmatched by the love and embrace a child feels from his parents. The message here is that attaining all the fortune and success the world has to offer does not make up for the love we receive from being apart of a family, something Kane was robbed and the only thing money could never buy him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>different but good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a very interesting film. The story looks into past life of a wealthy newspaper publisher Charles Kane, and reveals the story of his success and downfall. While the film does seem to drag on occasionally, I never found myself separated from the overall experience of the film. However, this effects was somewhat intended by the director Orson Welles, who purposely filmed many long and uneventful takes. In my opinion, the choice to include long takes makes the film more believable and highlights the actor's skill. In this case, the lead role of Kane is played by Welles himself, which goes to show off the talent of the filmmaker. This film may not be for everyone, but for those who can enjoy the slow pace will be delighted by Welle's effective film making.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of those historic movies that people are either raving about, or trying to bash it. This argument weighed on my mind when I first watched this film, but I found quickly that it has been praised for great reasons. Orson Welles, starring, directing, and producing, did a great job in all three roles he had. Much of this film is told through flashbacks, and goes to show the rise to prominence of Charles Foster Kane, but keys in on the mystery of Rosebud. What does it mean? The mystery will not be revealed here, you have to find out for yourself. This film was named an iconic piece of American cinema for a reason. To fully understand and appreciate it, you have to see the film. Only then can you judge and decide.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Those last words</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film deserved to be seen in the theater with friends, not at home. When I saw this film I was unprepared by the excessive background information. It is a story about a man who was very wealthy,that's really all you need to know. If you enjoy films just take the time to see this one. Have fun using your imagination, think of this man's life, think of your own and think of what the director is trying to create. I hope your first time seeing Citizen Kane will be enjoyable.The second part of the plot was shorter but it's a key part of the film. It starts with a shot of Kane, at this point we do not know who Kane is), drops a snow globe whilst delivering the words "Rosebud", and then the snow globe rolls down some steps and smashes on the floor and Kane dies. Then after his death a newspaper journalist is sent around to talk to Kane's associates to find out what rosebud could possibly mean. The conversations between the journalist and Kane's associates turn into flashbacks which forms the whole film wonderfully and create an unpredictable story that it would be almost impossible to not follow.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Through all movies this is the score which I give to this one. For its time he deserves more. But we are in other moment of the time/space continuum.Most probably every one of us had period in his life in which he wanted to be very rich. To be famous and known from everybody. To wealth and fame we can add the utopian idea this character to be noble, selflessness, robinhoodian. And what is the price for this when it really happen? This movie shows the life of Charles Kane, personification of the mentioned image above. He, from flash and bones, lived in the beginning of the previous century. Torn apart from his native home and his parents, the real things which he has are friendship and love. But they could not fill the opened wound.About this - what we want and what we receive, how much our life is our property and about the value of the material goods. This movie intrigue with setting an aim which is pursued till its end. Shown as stories of different characters, documentary restores the portrait of the protagonist and the main story.http://vihrenmitevmovies.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Raised the bar for presentation &amp; storytelling.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Orson Welles' 'Citizen Kane' is a classic film about a successful American entrepreneur, Charles Foster Kane, and retraces the events of his life up until his mysterious last words, "rosebud". The film encompasses a unique style of cinematography for its time, some of which had never been tried in film before. Every small aspect of this film has a significant meaning that serves a purpose to each scene, and is sometimes hard for the average viewer to pick up. Things like the positioning of the props and the lighting cast on the characters' faces are purposefully conducted to express the filmmaker's capabilities. The film's cinematographer, Gregg Toland, incorporated a lot of new and unusual techniques for that age, and set a whole new standard for presentation in movies.The most notable quality of 'Citizen Kane' is the use of mise en sc?ne throughout the movie. Each character is placed in a specific place on the set, in order to allow the camera to free flow through the scene, capturing multiple angles of the same scene. Everything is in plain view without any obstruction, not to mention all in sharp focus due to Toland's use of deep focus. The setting is usually grand and sometimes seems somewhat deceptive at times. For example during an interview with one of Kane's old colleagues, we see him sitting at a table with a fireplace burning behind him, which looks like it's only a couple of feet behind him. As the camera pans back, he eventually gets up and walks to the back of the room, and then finally up to the fireplace. He is surprisingly dwarfed by the now obviously large fireplace. This kind of trickery with depth perception is one of this film's most captivating perks.There's also a lot of symbolism within this movie, and actually tells a lot of the story than most of the dialog. As we're taken through the scattered scenes of Charles Foster Kane's life, we begin to get an idea of how huge this man's life has become. But it also becomes apparent of how empty it actually is. The setting of his incredible home Xanadu, enormous and grand, is also cold and empty. And as he begins to lose what little he has left to cherish, his final words start to make a little more sense. In the final scene the camera soars over a sea of boxes and crates, all of which were Kane's many belongings. In my eyes, all these boxes began to look like a massive city, which I think reflects the enormity of what Kane had accomplished in life. But none of the contents have the purity of his old sled, "Rosebud".</fullReview>

Even if you know nothing about the storyline you'll be hard pressed to find someone who hasn't at least heard of Citizen Kane. Through the series of flashbacks, the audience learns how Charles Foster Kane became the richest man in the world, and how he turned his life around after his rise to power basically made him lose himself. One of the greatest artistic works of all time, Citizen Kane is a classic that everyone should see at least once.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie a couple times and each time it was just as interesting if not more interesting time the next time. It is about a tragic story of a man that had everything, but really had nothing. The acting is pretty good, but after a while the main character, Kane, becomes annoying to listen to (i think that was the point). For a black and white film this movie has a lot of character. The camera work really made the film i think. The use of lighting and shining light on specific spots really added to the mystique.

Then after it goes off onto the life of a reporter, to say the least. Then the Life of a millionaire, and then the fall and crash of a man's life. With all this being the same person. The story is told beautifully about why he does the things that he does. And it goes to show that a man with everything can have nothing at all, at the very same time. Great Concept. The way Orson Welles has this story portrayed is very different. But his style in how he does all his movies, are reassured that they are incorporated in this film. The illusions and metaphors are incorporated in this film, but are made remarkable by the help of Gregg Toland.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"I don't think any word can explain a man's life". This quote stays true to its movie, Citizen Kane directed by Orson Welles, as it cannot be described with one word alone. Citizen Kane has been hailed as one of the greatest movies of all time?however, I think that fact itself ruins the movie for many viewers, including myself. Though the movie doesn't hold up to what it is praised to be, characters Charles Kane (Orson Welles), Susan Alexander (Dorothy Comingore), Mr. Bernstein (Everett Sloane), Walter Thatcher (George Coulouris), and Jerry Thompson (William Alland) all play their respective roles in the film excellently.I feel that this movie is to be appreciated by a small group of people from today's audiences, mainly those who loves older films or have a love of classic mystery films, that aren't cliché murder-mysteries, and as I have previously stated, I believe Citizen Kane is just an OK movie. I feel as though many people go into the movie knowing that it IS the highest acclaimed movie of all time, and are let down when they get into it. Orson Welles did lots of things that no one had ever done before at the time, and nearly every film maker was in some way influenced by this movie from thereafter, so much that all of the techniques have become modern clichés. I understand why it was groundbreaking at the time, however, as time passes, so does everything else. This again does not mean that I believe that Citizen Kane was a bad movie, I just believe it has become dated. I give this film an 86/100.</fullReview>

I thought it meant that Kane never wanted to be adopted and wanted to have a simple life, instead of the rich and famous life. The movie was directed brilliantly. You could tell Orson Welles put his all into this movie. He also won an Oscar for Best Screenplay, but it should have won all the awards it was nominated for. The acting is also brilliant, especially since most of the actors in the movies were new to film. I strongly recommend this movie to anyone who is interested.</fullReview>

It's a unique way to start a movie though, with the ending. And than it goes through flashbacks to his life and we get to see how he rose to fame. The sound of this film is very advanced for its time. Sound hadn't been around for too long, but this film does it very well and makes it believable. Visually as well, this film is ground breaking.

I was shocked when I first saw this movie, I had never expected such defined, glowing, steady and adroit camera movements and cinematography. I don't know how Orson Welles did it after hearing from a number of sources that this was his first film ever and that he had little filming experience in general. I just know that the whole thing contains a great message. The narration is insane too, the complexity of time within the film, and the plot as it's winded in so many different directions. The film in its style and speed feels fresh enough. But the story is not a new one, although it is a thought provoking and well-told one, it felt a bit too much for me in this day and age. There were elements of age within the film, certain things that didn't mean as much today for me. Orson Welles has an unforgettable charisma as well as a face which is contagious, he puts those elements to good use.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>New Appreciation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was channel surfing the other day and caught a segment of Citizen Kane that gave me an even better appreciation of Orson Welles. Orson Welles is one of my cinema idols and several of his films are in my favorites list; Citizen Kane, A Touch of Evil and The Third Man. The fact that Welles wrote, directed and starred in his films gave him total control of the art he produced so if you like it he gets the credit and if you don't he gets the blame.Citizen Kane is a staple of classic cinema and the first time I saw it was during the 1970s in a high-school film appreciation class when I was 16. At that time I didn't have a full understanding of the movie and yet because I was a budding photo enthusiast I do remember how impressed I was with the cinematography; the manipulation of light (in black and white) and the unique perspectives of the camera. I didn't know at the time Welles directed all that. Since high-school I've probably only watched the entire film maybe twice.The segment I saw the other day is the scene between Welles and Dorothy Comingore when Kane first meets his future wife Susan. They are in her apartment parlor having a dialog with tight close-ups and subsequently she plays the piano for him while singing arias. Watching that scene, especially the tight close-ups of Welles, it truly reveals what a hugely talented genius Welles was. His eyes and carefully created expressions provide an incredible depth to his character rarely seen in film.While the movie was a fictionalized biography of William Randolph Hearst I have the impression Welles simply chose that story as a frame to hang his art on.</fullReview>

It is well lit at the appropriate times, but not without the occasional blown out or 'underexposed' shot to demonstrate certain circumstances like being in a dimly lit library or being outside. The lighting is actually very interesting to watch in this movie due to Welles' tendency towards very dramatic lighting schemes. The editing, also, works very well, with clips 'layered' over top of each other to show the passing of time and other such things. The sound is very clear, as it had a trend of being in the very early days of sound where you could hear every noise, from a pillow being fluffed to a room being torn apart. All in all a fabulous movie that I would watch again and again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>this is a movie classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whether this movie is overrated or not, Citizen Kane tops the list of many reviewers.This 1941 drama film, was directed, written and starred Orson Welles. Who was at that time making his directorial debut. Citizen Kane is a movie that i may not boldly say go watch, but if you like the art of film making then this is one classic you should see.The high points in the movie will have to be the story telling, based primarily on flashbacks. The movie is about a man named Charles Foster Kane a newspaper magnate, played by Orson Welles, whose story is loosely based on the lives of four men, American newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst, Chicago tycoons Samuel Insull and Harold McCormick and some aspects of Welles's own life.Narrated principally through flashbacks, the story of Charles Foster Kane is revealed through the research of a newsreel reporter, who was seeking to uncover the mystery of the newspaper magnate (Charles Foster Kane) dying word: "Rosebud".The thrill in this movie is how it moves from flashback to real time in such powerful continuity that makes you respect the art. If you are to compare this movie to such like Inception and co, you may view it as an overrated classic, the cinematography is one for the books and the story is masterful.Viewing the film with an objective look that it was made in 1941 in black and white, where no CGI is available at all but we have makeup artist doing their absolute best to make sure that you are carried along in the growth of Kane himself.Then the question comes to play in your heart, the portrayal of the character, Orson did so well at various stages in the life of Kane that he convinces you that he either most have known Kane before in a previous life.The directing style of Orson too is something to talk about, making the story based only on the life of Kane and making the newspaper reporter kind of anonymous.The story of the movie depicts a man who had everything but lacked empathy, this makes you the audience either judge his actions or commend them as brave.The film was nominated for nine Academy Awards but took home one for Best Writing (Original Screenplay) by Herman Mankiewicz and Welles. It has topped many reviewers 'greatest film ever made' lists such as that of Sight &amp; Sound's decennial poll, the AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies list and its 10th Anniversary Update.This movie is a classic true and true.www.lagsreviews.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The death of a powerful media proprietor causes a news team to research the meaning of his last uttered word.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Orson Welles' ability to not only direct but play the leading role in a film is something that's not seen that often today, or recognized. I found it creative that the film started at Kane's death and then went backwards in an effort to show his life journey, while the reporter, Jerry Thompson, searched for the meaning behind Kane's last word, "Rosebud". It showed the growth of a man born in poverty who makes it lucky when a gold mine is discovered under his mother's property. Kane grows to be a charismatic man loved and looked up to by many. However his personal life lacks, as what happens to most people who experience such wealth and power. It was a lesson of the things that matter in life. The scene where Kane throws and breaks many objects in his room after his wife leaves him. This scene shows a different side of Kane, and as the viewer I felt a lot of sympathy for him, as though he was looking back on his life wondering if all the wealth was really worth it.</fullReview>

Orson Wells directed and played the main role in this movie and he did a great job in both of his jobs. The movie was filmed very well the cinema-photographer did an outstanding job with the way he chose his angles, lighting, and his takes. So if you haven't seen this movie as of yet go and watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really good movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought Citizen Kane was a really well written movie. The movie kept you interested the whole time, he didn't seem to repeat much of the same techniques or types of scenes which I thought was the most interesting about it. There was definitely some odd point of views and perspectives, but this movie was odd in a good way so therefore it worked. When they first started off the movie, they showed the body of Citizen Kane, I liked perspective of the camera, you were aligned with his body. They also were showing newspapers of Kane's death, with an added voice. I liked the scene were all the men were gathered in one tiny room trying to find out how to publish his death, with the light seeping in from the windows hitting causing a outline of light to hit their faces and heads while the rest of their bodies were black or dark. You don't know what rosebud is and either does anyone in the movie, I liked that point of view. The light in this movie is just awesome,they used low key lighting. They did a crane shot when they were introducing Ms. Alexander, I like how they changed up the camera angles and did not keep it at just plain old eye level. With the mystery type of movie, I think the different angles, perspectives, lighting and other techniques just made the plot even stronger. I also loved the lighting in the room in the Walter Parks Thatcher Library, it looked like light beams were shining down on the floor and the man was very confined in there, with just a long table and a chair. You really understood Mr. Kane with all of the flashbacks of his life, they brought you back to his childhood and you could sense how much this child would change. I thought it was interesting about the flashbacks and that they were through other peoples eyes and not Mr. Kane, they were still sharp and very clear to understand despite them being from someone else's eyes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I got a chance to see this on the big screen at a theater close by, some of the audiences seemed bored by it. But this is one of the movies some people might have to ponder about after seeing it in order to know why it's a masterpiece. Before the death of Charles Foster Kane who is notorious and everyone wanted to be. He was filthy wealthy and had everything anyone could dream of. But their was more, way more behind the scenes from the public's eyes. And it gets revealed after Kane's death since reporters are trying to figure out Kane's last dying word which is Rosebud. Their is quit a bit of humanity to this movie, especially how it shows what makes Kane tick. There more to the world than money and it shows in this movie. How "where would a man be without love?" and that is the main question of this movie. "Citizen Kane" has dramatic approach to showing the messages but it's also very effective and the way it's shot in certain scenes is artistic. The camera work really shines in this and the plot is engrossing as it progresses. It's one of those movie that sticks with you and makes you think about it, even when it's over.8.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great, though still a flawed film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While considered by some film critics as the "greatest movie of all time" not only because of it's quality but also because of it's high level of innovation, both in terms of further exploring the possibilities of film, special effects and also in technical terms. This is an excellent film. It is perhaps one of the oldest films that I have ever watched, perhaps only some Disney and Chaplin films (such as Snow White and Modern Times) are actually older.So, how this holds up compared to modern movies? Quite well actually. The technical quality of the movie is far superior to 7 Samurai, for instance, the camera work is very well done and the effects work quite well. The main problem of the movie is that as it is very old it requires more patience from the audience as films those days were not as tingly edited and composed, instead this less refined version of the art still has a loot of rough edges. Scenes take took long, dialogue is a bit overlong and complex, which increase the costs of watching the film with attention.Still, despite it's technical limitations if compared to modern movies, Citizen Kane still holds quite well if one is willing to sit through it's entire duration. It's a very powerful film and I would consider it the best movie that I ever saw made before the 1960&#x2032;s.I would recommend There Will be Blood, for someone who has liked this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>. . . that is, if you want to enhance chances for creating a great artwork. Chaplin knew this, and he reportedly distracted bankers who came to his set to see for themselves what was going on. Chaplin and his child star Jackie Coogan did flatfoot and shimmy routines that delighted and diffused their uptight backers.So Welles dazzled his inquisitive studio and banking chiefs with displays of magical disappearing acts and levitations. All the while crating a masterpiece behind the closed doors of his set.It was to Welles' good and bad fortune that he convinced Nelson Rockefeller to add additional funding when the original "Kane" money was running low. While the production was able to be completed, Welles found himself owing Rockefeller. This debt was reportedly paid in the form of being pulled away from the completion of "The Magnificent Ambersons" to do "It's All True" at Rockefeller's bequest. The consequence: studio editing of "Ambersons" without Welles' approval.It's all about art vs. business, and fortunately "Ambersons" turned out well, despite the studio cutting. The negative side was Welles' being placed on a list of hard-to-work-with personalities in the profession.There's been enough said about the value of "Kane" among these user reviews, so may these remarks serve as a tiny footnote.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perhaps a bit overrated, but still a striking film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought I had watched this film several years ago...but if I did, I had forgotten most of it. So it was with fresh eyes that I watched it this time around.It was not quite the hatchet job on William Randolph Heart that I had expected it to be. For nearly the first half of the movie, the Kane/Hearst character is portrayed as flamboyant, but in a positive way. Then, in a brilliant "marriage sequence", you begin to see the dark side of Kane/Hearst.While I would not class this as the greatest American film, it is remarkable that Orson Welles produced this fine a film his first time around.As an actor, Welles was extremely good here. But for balance, the performance by Joseph Cotten was equally fine, and Cotten is undoubtedly one of American's most underrated actors.All the other supporting actors, with the exception of Ray Collins, are relatively unknown to film audiences, but they do their jobs well in this production. Collins, a very recognizable face, has a very short role here, but does it nicely.One criticism I have with this film is the makeup as the characters age. I know a lot of old people, and I'm getting there myself, and trust me, as you age your skin doesn't get smoother and smoother.Certainly well worth watching, but I think the sensation of "Rosebud" and the controversy behind the film has made this a more famous film than it deserves to be.</fullReview>

Charles Foster Kane dies and says "Rosebud" and people have to figure out what that means in order to do a documentary about him by asking about what his life was like. The plot is great and the acting is great also. If you pay close attention to this movie, then you'll enjoy what Rosebud comes out to be. That, or you might feel ripped off and really angry.

		<fullReview>Let me start off with- this movie is not my favorite.Especially compared to modern movies, this movie is way too slow (the camera moves way too slowly, and the plot advances pretty slowly as well).But taking into consideration the time that it was made, this movie is simply amazing. It does everything right. The quality of conflict is high- one truly grasps the troubles of Charles Foster Kane. Its message is simple, yet effective.Don't see this movie with the high expectations of "Greatest Movie Ever". See it for what it is, and it will be enjoyable. Hype kills everything, and this movie is no exception.In short, for the modern viewer, everything about this movie will be disappointing, simply because all of the innovative things that this movie does has been used to every other movie after it. It's also in black and white, so the on screen effects will hardly amaze anybody.But at the heart of any movie is its story, and the story is quite enjoyable. After all, most of the time, we watch a movie for the plot and the plot is one of the best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When some people think of movies that were out in black and white, they also think of boring moments and bland acting. That is just a bad stereotype. This movie is the symbol of true American movies and kills this stereotype with its meaning. This movie shows how great people can rise to the top and somehow lose themselves, as well as this fame within a short amount of time. It also shows that even though a person can have a lot of nice things, they can't have everything, including Charles Kane, who lost his childhood to rise to the top. This movie was extremely beautiful and anyone who tells you that it is terrible has got to have issues to call a masterpiece anything less than its title.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Citizen Kane was a great film it was perfect across the board! To start the use of flash backs to tell the story was a great idea because it gave a new perspective each time some one was telling a piece of his history. as for the people who saw Citizen Kane know it is about Mr. Kane dying and the reporters are trying to figure out what Mr. Kane final words are. the lighting used in this movie was dark giving his life shadows which make it him mysterious.the further the interviewers get to know Kane's life the editing becomes slower because you are reaching the older Mr. Kane. Over all i thought it was a great movie because the movie conveyed every thing it wanted, love, anger, and jealousy,</fullReview>

Some parts were amusing but for the most part I just wanted to turn it off. One part that was cool, though, was that since it revolved around the newspaper the newspaper clippings were cool to show as the plot thickened. The whole rosebud plot was interesting as well and the way it ended made me say "ooooohhhh I see." and that does not usually happen often. I would not watch it again unless I had to, but never the less always a good experience to figure out what movies I do and do not like.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Welles best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Orson Welles has been called a one hit wonder for directing, co-writing, and starring in Citizen Kane. The story is a thinly disguised biography of William Randolph Hearst, the newspaper publisher. Charles Foster Kane(Welles) lives as a recluse on an estate. He dies while lying in bed and his last word is rosebud. The media spend the rest of the movie trying to find out the meaning of the word.The investigation is shown through a series of flashbacks and interviews with his second wife, his butler and a journal written by his childhood guardian who has passed away. The research uncovers a poor early upbringing, living in a boarding house run by his parents. After gold is discovered on the property, they go from rags to riches. Kane's life is a combination of great wealth accompanied by an equal amount of pain and sorrow with divorces, suicides, alcoholism, adultery and other asserted woes.All of the troubles occur during his rise to power as a media tycoon who manipulates public opinion mostly through a underhanded newspaper. We finally are told the meaning of rosebud at the end. I was not overwhelmed by the supposed greatest movie ever made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A poignant and sad film that clearly demonstrate that Gregg Toland and Orson Welles were well matched in their ability to give dimension to a movie. I don't think I have ever seen a better depiction of massive size and scale of a room and how it could feel so claustrophobic at the same time. The lighting and photography deserve all the accolades they have been given over the decades, the makeup is fantastic and the acting is on par with the quality of the movie as a whole. Yes, some scenes are less than stellar (the pterodactyls in the swamp picnic for example), but this only emphasizes how good the remainder is (such as the scene where Mrs. Kane is signing away young Charles Foster Kane to the banker).The complexity of the time shifting plot is also impressive and well orchestrated to make it seem logical and seamless. I particularly like the way time was shown to progress through shots of each of his wives going about such mundane, daily tasks as eating breakfast and putting a jigsaw puzzle together - it described their lives as rather ordinary in an artistically subtle way that strengthened the effect for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The ultimate must-see film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Given that "Citizen Kane" has owned the best-film-of-all-time lists since the mid-1950s and that it was called the same by the ultimate film critic Robert Ebert, I'll have a limited amount to say about it other than to agree that Orson Welles' masterpiece is the film you need to see a few times in order to have a technical yardstick to judge others by. Like many of 2010's Oscar Best Picture noms ("Avatar", "The Hurt Locker", "Up" and "District 9"), the basic plot is not quite up to the technical prowess of the film. Welles uses deep focus, framing of characters in the background, and other special effects techniques that would give today's $200million USD extravaganzas a serious run for their massive piles of money. His aging of Charles Foster Kane from age 25 to old age is as realistic as anything you'll see in "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button" or any modern blockbuster. His use of cutaway titles (such as the neon sign above the night club) which the camera magically flies through presages the interactive titles in "Zombieland" or TV's "Fringe". In short, much of technical aspects of film-making in any post 1941 film will seem derivative to the Welles masterwork. The story itself is compelling but not overly so; however, it does lay the basic arc from super-stardom to has-been to crazed collector living alone in a crumbling palace for several biographies of actual people (e.g., Michael Jackson and Elvis Presley). In short the answer to the central trope of who is the "Rosebud" of Kane's dying words doesn't turn out to be that interesting but the trip to find out is well worth your time.</fullReview>

Welles character, Charles Foster Kane, exudes charisma and confidence. Welles as an actor created one of the deepest, most complex, and memorable characters in movie history. He is impossible to take your eyes off of throughout the film. Welles was surrounded by a strong supporting cast, and benefited from an engrossing story. The only thing that surpassed Welles as an actor was his superb directing of this film. Welles use of lighting was wonderful. From back lighting to spot lights to beautiful natural outdoor lighting, Welles used every tool at his disposal. The camera work was even better. Every scene was crisp, clean and expertly shot. Welles work behind the camera and in front was so noticeably professional, above grade, and frankly perfect that even a novice to film can't help but notice and appreciate it.

It carries a simple message using a series of complicated situations for our main character. It carries a good message about life, love and wanting to belong. It also carries a good message about the affects of certain circumstances in life that never leave us and perhaps are the things that motivate us to become great people. This movie is like poetry in action and is extremely brilliant. It is the concept and the message that makes this movie a masterpiece.

		<fullReview>The first time I watched Orson Welles' Citizen Kane(1941) I had some trouble with following the film because of the unusual story telling structure. Upon watching it for a second time I was able to follow the story and the character development and it certainly improved my enjoyment of the film. I can certainly understand why so many rank it as the greatest film ever made, the groundbreakingly inventive visual style of the film is incredibly impressive and with the knowledge that this was Welles' first film it was an amazing achievement. But for my own personal enjoyment of a work of fiction I need to feel a personal connection to the characters. Charles Foster Kane is necessarily a character that the audience cannot connect with as his enigmatic and distant nature is the whole point of the film but I found it difficult to connect to any of the characters on any level, they all left me feeling cold. I think that perhaps with more repeat viewings I'll be able to penetrate the extreme density of the film further and may in time come to truly appreciate it but for the moment I'll have to remain incredibly impressed but not quite entertained.</fullReview>

The lighting along with the use of creative and dramatic angles puts this movie in a category of it's own. I liked the story in the sense that Kane was able to go from a poor family to running a news paper it gives you the feeling that anything is possible.

		<fullReview>I had never seen a Orson Welles movies before I had seen "Citizen Kane." I had heard so much about the movie, I had very high hopes for it, as everyone I talked to said it was a magnificent movie. "Citizen Kane" tells the story of Charle Foster Kane and his life through flashbacks, as the title character died in the very beginning of the film. The entire movie is an investigative journey through Kane's life trying to figure out what "Rosebud" means, the last word the man uttered. Welles charted into unknown territory with "Citizen Kane." He told the story through flashbacks, something that has never been done before, on account of not wanting to confuse the audience and therefore loose ticket sales. This was a very risky move that Welles made in 1941, however it proved to profitable since many movies since have used the flashback sequence to tell their stories.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Review of the movie, "Citizen Kane"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Citizen Kane" as one of the strong break-out films of the early 1940s. The film opens up with the death of our hero. Prior to this, there haven't been too many films that showed the demise of their main characters (especially a death at the beginning of a film). This was one of the many ways that this film attempted to break away, and be different from the films representing the Classic Hollywood Style. The film doesn't play out in any chronological order. It jumps back and forth from present day to the life of Orson Welles' character. In the usual films of the time, rarely did the main character struggle with the female characters. In "Citizen Kane", Charles Foster Kane is originally married, but he then destroys his first marriage for another love interest. In many ways, this was a more realistic film than other films of its time. It dealt with the true troubles of many men and women. The film showed a complete downfall of the main character. Charles Foster Kane was a man who had everything, but couldn't handle it. In the end, the only thing he longed for, that was probably robbed of him, was his childhood. Sadly, Orson Welles' character dies an old man in a broken down palace. This was a great experimental project that remains, to this day, to be one of the greatest motion pictures of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Incredible. Citizen Kane is a true visual treat. Orson Wells is one of the greatest film directors of all time, you can see his intelligence just from watching Citizen Kane. And I have to say, the man is one hell of an actor as well! This is by far one of the greatest movies ever made. One outstanding feature to Citizen Kane is the astonishing cinematography. Gergg Toland the DP of this movie is truly the best. Not only does he bring outstanding lighting to the film but the shot composition is remarkable. The composition brings excellent stability along with depth and illusion. The Rule Of Thirds is used so incredibly. You'll see how they have shots where they line an actor on the left in the fore ground, another actor on the right of the screen in the middle ground and another actor all the way in the background. This easily conveys depth to the movie. Orson Wells has always been considered a very stylistic director both in film and theatrical plays. Many think Wells is all about style and not story, think what you want. In Citizen Kane, I don't think any other director could have done it other than Orson Wells. He not only brings his own style of filmmaking but tells an incredibly compelling story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is almost frightening to write a review about this film. Mainly because of reputation. So long, on top of a top lists of lists. What hasn't been said already.OK, I am giving in and writing, but don't expect I can live up to the movie. Or some other reviews to analyze it. I'm like the Pauline Kael style, blunt, to the point, show your emotions.I'm doing this to say I've seen this while in my 30s and can well understand the hands down voting. (And because it's so much better than Gone with the Wind also - some say you can't compare genres .. SURE you can!!!) Kane is a as technically perfect as it gets, but the story has no heart. The plot does - but not the composite culminating end product. It is a product - a perfectly chiseled statue of David. But it has no meaning with the story of David. The B&amp;W is superb, the complexity of the shots and edit are saying 'look at me!' So I'm changing my vote - from 10 to 8. I even like Joe vs. the Volcano better than this. Sure in a different way - the way that the movie connects to me as an audience - not as a critic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece but a masterpiece that's not for everyone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Citizen Kane is arguably one of the most groundbreaking movies ever made. its hard to believe that this movie was considered to be a huge flop the time it was released and people booed it for even getting nominated for the academy awards, i guess it received its glory long after it was released. Orson Welles did an outstanding job directing the movie given the time it was created, he pushed all boundaries of movie making. That is the true reason why Citizen Kane is called the greatest movie of all time by so many people, not for its depth of emotion or performance but for what a breakthrough it really was. All of the Cast did their job well. They were very much in their character, Whether it was important character like Joseph Cotten as Jedidiah or Small character like Ray Collins as Getty's. Orson Welles did and Excellent job as Kane. The movie Shows the Rise and Fall of the Great Charles Foster Kane, It shows how his life really was , how he never wanted money for himself, how he was Both Bad and good at the same time. The Movie has amazing amount of depth in it, But still the movie is not without it's flaws, The Biggest Flaw of the movie is how it is shown and at the same time that same thing is its biggest Strength. The Movie is Somehow Dark and Dirty, Where Many like my self will love the movie, many will find it to be boring and out of pace. I think its safe to say no matter how great the movie is, its not Timeless. It never really touched the Level People Expected, Over expectation killed the movie. This movie is a Masterpiece but a masterpiece that is not for everyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm still only a little over half way into reviewing AFI's list of Top 100 Films, and that list from 1997 is already pretty old. I've seen "Citizen Kane" before of course, but have never felt quite prepared to give it the treatment I thought it should deserve. So rather than worrying about it this time, I'm just going to jump right in. It's not like I'm going to have anything new or inspiring to say about the picture anyway. It has it's reputation, it has it's fans, and it has it's detractors.For me, the picture doesn't grab me the way I think a 'Best' picture should. It's story is OK, but there are others that are better and that have entertained me more. Maybe by mentioning some of my favorites, I can provide some perspective. "Casablanca" is my all time favorite and has been for years. Then, in order, there's "On The Waterfront", "To Kill a Mockingbird", "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest", and "The Day The Earth Stood Still" to round out the Top Five.There are some elements of course that lend to the film's reputation. I'll second the camera work and lighting, and something that no one has mentioned (at least I haven't read it anywhere), is the unique kind of juxtaposition we see with Charles Foster Kane in a balcony scene alongside Adolph Hitler. I also thought the aging sequence involving Kane (Orson Welles) and Susan Alexander (Dorothy Comingore) was remarkably well done over it's span of six different time frames. But it's not enough. Not enough to merit Best Picture of all Time.I certainly don't think it's a dog either. For Orson Welles to direct and act in this picture at the age of twenty five might merit him a standing even greater than the film. It was an outstanding achievement by any comparison, and he deserves the accolades. It's hard for me to imagine that kind of talent in someone so young, so handing out that accolade seems well deserved and the right thing to do.I'm not of the opinion that I'll never watch the film again either. I've seen it three times now, and it does seem to have it's effect with age, not the picture's age, but my age. As long as it keeps getting better with time, I'll continue to give it a look every now and then.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Absolute Classic. "Citizen Kane" is possibly the single most important film of this century. Setting aside the (then) controversial subject matter and the grief Welles went through over this film, watch the film at least once for sheer enjoyment. The black &amp; white cinematography is brilliant, the direction is smooth, and the key players all turn in outstanding performances. Orson Welles richly deserved his Oscar for Best Actor this time around. Even the makeup, while seeming "overdone" by today's standards, is effectively used. This movie belongs in every movie lover's library. The film does such a great job at taking the viewer on a personal journey. The verisimilitude does well at enhancing the glorified storyline.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a really cool film, due to the fact that you never see the main character's face. This was probable done to make you feel as though you were the reporter going around interviewing all the different people from Kane's past to figure out what the hell is important about rosebud. The straightforwardness and relatively fast pace of the story are what i think make it a great movie using the old phrase: keep it simple stupid. Everything moves smoothly, it felt like I being fooled,like there is something much greater that I just can't seem to grasp.I knew from its reputation that there must be something that separates this movie from all the others. Something buried within its simple plot line that everybody else has seen, but that I just could not seem to get a handle on. And then, during those final frames, that something was revealed, and it all began to make sense, understood why this is such a respected film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An amazing film that is so spectacular that words really can;t describe it the way it is meant to be described. From the way the film is filmed to the way the characters are portrayed. The film focuses on Charles Fpster Kane, a well known and powerful tycoon and his extraordinary life. The film travels throughout his life all the way from his heartbreaking childhood to his final word "Rosebud." The film follows a group of newspaper writers and their quest to find out the meaning of Kane's final words.A great film with extraordinary filming and great actors. Some say the story line and the movie itself is boring but most are engrossed in the story and by the end of the film the viewer almost knows Kane's character played by the great and talented Orson Welles.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Citizen Kane a 1941 film noted for its cinematography, and music. This film almost seemed as a mystery because throughout the movie there are many unanswered questions and the only way to get the answers is to ask more questions. The cinematography in this film used a lot of deep focus. Deep focus is a shot that the foreground, middle, and background are all in focus so you are able to see the entire shot clearly. The cinematographer Gregg Toland also used many different camera angles such as ones from the floor facing upwards towards the actors. During one of the scenes Toland dug a trench in order to shoot a scene where the ceiling was in the shot. Orson Welles' acting in this film was very powerful. As a viewer I felt as though he had truly embraced his character and took on the role fully. The writing and script of the film was not particularly the best part of the film, it at times was for characterized and a shallow plot line. Throughout this film I saw a common theme of self-regret. I saw man not willing to appreciate what he has and always wanting more. This is a common theme in today's society of many people always wanting more than what they have.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>still the Great American Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If Orson Welles' debut feature isn't the best American film ever made it certainly remains one of the most impressive, combining narrative and technical dexterity in a stunning display of talent unmatched before or since. Every scene is a minor masterpiece of style and invention, and the elliptical story of newspaper tycoon Charles Foster Kane, who squandered a wealth he never earned on a woman he couldn't love, is as much a catalogue of camera techniques as it is a compelling drama. It's hard to believe the film flopped at the Box Office when first released in 1941, but perhaps it was simply too sophisticated for widespread audience appeal. Today of course it remains a model of creative entertainment, and a sad reminder of Hollywood's disdain for rogue talent. Welles never equaled the achievement, but even if the film itself could never be repeated the joy of watching it certainly can, and after half a century the rise and fall of Charles Foster Kane is as fresh and compelling as ever. In all likelihood the only viewer left unimpressed by the film was its inspiration, William Randolph Hearst, but what angered him more: Welles' reckless re-creation of San Simeon (Kane's Xanadu), or the true identity of 'Rosebud'?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful and one of a kind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Charles Foster Kane, who is a newspaper tycoon, has just died and his last words are "Rosebud." Journalist are trying to figure out what this word meant in his life. They start by visiting people that are important to him, but can't find an answer.This movie was written, directed, produced, and starred by Orson Welles. He did a remarkable job on all accounts. I am sad that he never reached the recognition that he deserved. The technical skills were amazing for it's time and are still lovely today. The lighting in certain scenes were so beautiful and helped with the emotions that wanted to be felt. Both sympathy and compassion seemed to flood at certain parts. I also understood Kane a lot more overtime and began to care about him. A lot of the shots were clever and very artistic. Gregg Toland was an excellent cinematography and couldn't have made it more lovely. He found the shot that fit the story and they were edited in perfectly. I kept on finding something that was beautiful in each scene. The story was slow in a few parts and it seemed to drag, but I think that this story was more about the life and what it eventually leads to. Not to sound morbid, but life can be slow and boring at time and I think that is what the message is. The screenplay is rather direct and too the point most of the time. Witty one liners are sporadic, but they also stop and make you think. My favorite line is, "You can't blame me. They've been making statues for some two thousand years, and I've only been collecting for five." -Kane The actors were also stunning and didn't overact. I could relate to this quote, through my book collect and this helped me understand Kane more. I have never seen a movie like CITIZEN KANE, and I don't think I ever will. This movie is clever and is groundbreaking. I enjoyed this movie immensely, even if the story was slow at times. I would recommend this movie to anyone that is looking for strong characters, beautiful cinematography, and a remarkable screenplay.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"What is Rosebud!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"What is Rosebud?" This is the question we are asking ourselves throughout the film. Charles Kane is a mysterious and controlling character who just wants more, more, more!! This leads everyone to believe that Rosebud is a material item, when it really relates to his family and his childhood. The ending was perfect. It was unexpected, and you were left guessing until the very end. I would recommend this film to anyone. It really keeps you on the edge of your seat.I particularly enjoyed the effects of the filming. I like how the camera would fade in and out or would film a scene down at foot level and then look up. It seemed very modern for its day. All of the characters were also perfect at their roles. This story just seemed like a more realistic love story compared to others of its time. It dealt with divorce, cheating, and many others wrongs in marriage. He was scarred from childhood, made the best of his life, and he still wasn't happy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Citizen Kane: an important movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>NO TREPASSINGWith no doubt, Citizen Kane is a film major and even more if you put the movie in his time.It is a very modern film by his language, his approach and design screenplay. With the support of a strong plot that literally holds us in suspense until the final images and a construction of history based on a short documentary and flashbacks, the film's structure is very well done and very innovative. And although those can be a bit bogged down in the relations of Mr. Kane as for example the relation with his singer wife, but this brings us finally to Mr. Kane's character, his world he has built, symbolized by his unfinished palace Xanadu, his isolation and finally his descent.The distribution is deserving and original. The actors are novice in front of a camera and they are remarkably and comfortable for all the tricks and different points of view of the plot.In addition, the film is very good, intelligent and technically controlled, supported by shadows effect and symbolic and evocative details of the history.So we have a plot of the most captivating, beautiful and skillful narration, effective distribution and flawless execution. On those points there is only one conclusion: if you had not watched yet, Get Citizen Kane! This film is a must-see. And even more, for all lovers of cinema, even if you like it with less enthusiasm than reflected in these lines, it is a work that marked and still marks the history of cinema.And remember...NO TREPASSINGNB: I notice, "RKO 281" (1999); a very interesting mivoe about the building of the film citizen kane with a lot of informations about political, society, background,... environment.jeliosjelios@hotmail.fr</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Citizen Kane</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have always been told that Citizen Kane is one of the best films ever made, now I see why. This movie portrays a man who is taken away from his parents and put into a world of wealth, which lets him do basically whatever he wants. This wealth seems to make him lose everything that is important to him. His friends, his wives, and his passion for his newspaper. I believe this is why on his deathbed he said the famous word of "Rosebud". In the end, we all see that Rosebud is his sled he had when he was a kid. For Kane to remember this when he loses everything must mean that this was what he loved most. A time before wealth and power came to existence for him. This teaches us the theme of the movie. That being too wealthy will ruin a person and that simple moments in life, like sleigh riding, is what makes life worth it.Besides the theme, the overall movie was amazing. The audience could recognize when it was dark and when it was light due to lights in a room and shadows that appeared. Also, the camera showed many scenes at different angles. For example, when Kane was running for governor the camera was above him, so the audience was looking down at him. Also, when Kane was talking to Jed after Kane lost the election the camera looked like it was on the floor following these two men around the room. The acting was superb and Orsen Welles is a great actor as well as a great writer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One thing has always puzzled me about this movie. It may be a hole in the plot. A small hole, but a hole nonetheless. Perhaps someone else has noticed this. Concerning the scene where Kane finishes Jed Leland's bad review of Susan's opera debut, Thompson, the reporter remarks "everybody knows that story." Yet Susan Alexander herself doesn't seem to know anything about it...she never remarks about it in her segment of the film. If it's common knowledge her husband finished that nasty notice she gets so upset about how come she never seems to have found out about it. It's a small point but I've wondered about it for years. Yes, the film is a masterpiece. It was way ahead of its time. My favorite scene: when Kane trashes his wife's room after she leaves him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Citizen Kane</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Citizen Kane is a millionaire newspaper owner and one of the richest and most powerful men in the world. On his dying lips, his only words were "Rosebud". The film opens with his death, and the audience is then brought on a journey through Kane's life. A reporter is assigned to figure out who or what Rosebud is. Kane is an individual that is willing to give up relationships to gain wealth, yet also seems caring and wanting to do what is right for people.Right from the opening scene, I thought lighting, use of shadows, camera angles and cinematography played a huge role in the movie. The dramatic building of the opening where the cameras pan slowly up the chain link fence, to the next fence area, to the wrought iron fencing, to see a glimpse of Xanadu, Kane's castle, to his lips speaking "Rosebud", the tumbling and smashing of the snow globe, was an interesting sequence. I thought the ending shots were symbolic of the Thompson's (the reporter) statement, "Rosebud is like the missing piece of a jigsaw puzzle." The camera panned an aerial view from what almost looked like a cityscape, it slowly brings the audience down to an item which is thrown into the incinerator. Finally, the camera pans down the chain link fence from the beginning of the movie going full circle. The use of lighting and shadows as Kane is arguing with Susan makes him appear vulnerable, almost in desperate.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Citizen Kane is a curious study in American film. It's lauded as one of the greatest works of film, ever. Sometimes in the same breath, it's lambasted as a hackneyed story and a waste of a film reel. So what is the real Citizen Kane? Well, in a simple breath, this movie is meant more to be studied than it is to be enjoyed. The film itself is somewhat of a biography of William Randolph Hearst, but takes liberties to make a more interesting story. The story, however, takes a backseat to everything else going on in the film.From the first scene on, it's apparent that this movie is simply different than any other movie of its time. For instance, in the first scene with the boy playing outside, the camera pans back, revealing that it is actually inside of a house. Two characters come into the foreground and are having a conversation while sitting at a dinner table, but the camera still keeps focused on the window outside. The viewer gets to capture everything happening at once, from the parents deep conversation indoors to the child's lighthearted play with his sled Rosebud. All with the choice of the viewer's eye.This is what makes Kane special. That and the revolutionary way to tell a story through flashbacks, which is normal now, but in that day, was, as they would say, "the bee's knees." Still, boring plot does knock this film down a peg or two. Still amazing in its own right though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Citizen Kane is a masterpiece and one of my favorite films. Orson Welles' use of the camera is what stands out the most in this film. Every set and background was filmed with a sort of mathematical precision. Another great aspect of the film was the story. The story reveals so much about the life of Kane yet leaves the audience baffled about his true feelings about his life. This leaves the audience to discuss with each other and for the people to use their own imagination. This film also explores the the theme that money does not but happiness. Throughout his whole life Kane had unlimited power and resources and became consumed by them. If we can't share our successes with other people then what's the point?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worthy of the praise, but best film ever? (hard to say)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The thing about true brilliance is that it does not come instantly. In the same way that Van Gosh was not considered an artist till after he died, I would imagine it took a few years for the academy to even consider the possibility that giving the gold to How Green was My Valley (over Kane) was a mistake. Today there is no question. Some would argue that there is also no question that it is the best movie ever, I don't fully agree. I do like it a lot though.Citizen Kane is loosely based on the life of newspaper king William Hearst. And chronicles his life from boyhood to the grave. The film moves at a leisurely pace, never to slow or too quick and while it is not the most cathartic of movies Citizen Kane has much to say. To me, the film is driven primarily by Welles' performance. If you want something done well, you gotta do it yourself, and Welles knew that. The reason for the studio's dislike of Welles was because of his control freak attitude, but it results in some interesting decisions. One of which is the total absence of stars or names in the cast, definitely a positive. It keeps us focused on the story and not the stage or cinematic presence of popularity. What's more, Citizen Kane is the first feature for most of the cast. There are actually a number of moments which I can point to and say, 'this is not featured in any other movie of the time'. Citizen Kane has several tracking shots in which the camera literally goes through pieces of furniture and other solid matter. Now, I'm a smart guy, and I'm studying film production, but it wasn't until I heard Roger Ebert's commentary that I realized how these shots were achieved. I never would have guessed Even the title sequence is great, because it is subtle. When we see sixty or seventy year old movies, we are used to seeing title card credits, with loud blaring fanfare. That doesn't happen here. Citizen Kane absorbs us with its ambiance from moment #1, in addition to word #1, ROSEBUD.Throughout the movie, Kane ages pretty well, which shows skill on the part of the make-up job, the movie however has aged even better. Soem reasons are obvious, but others may not be. Perhaps this is what makes Citizen Kane so special from a 21st century perspective. This controversially is more epic than any other movie.Watch it and decide for yourselves,</fullReview>

Even though he was 25 when he made this film, his direction is legendary. every shot is just pleasure to look at, particularly the famous deep focus shots, where both the foreground and background are in sharp focus. Even if you don't like the plot, just looking at this film is worth the 2 hours it runs for. Not that the plot is bad of course. Charles Foster Kane is a dying newspaper tycoon, who's last words cause a spur in the media and the rest of the film follows one man (who's face we never see) interviewing people who knew Kane, and flashbacks of Kane's life. The ending, even though a lot of people know the twist, is brilliant. The writing's great, the acting's great, the editing's great and of course the direction is amazing. This film really is great. It has a reputation of being the greatest movie of all time. DON'T WATCH THIS FILM WITH THAT IN MIND! It will be a let down. It isn't THAT good, but it's still good.

		<fullReview>Will Rabagliati Citizen Kane is truly one of the greatest films ever made. Yes the story isn't that original. Yes some of the acting leaves something to be desired. There are points in the film when you wish it would hurry up and get to the point, some of the scenes can be overly long winded. I also found some of the dialogue slightly lacking,Negatives aside though, Kane is possibly the best example of cinematography in existence. The brilliance and talent of Welles as a director is apparent in every shot of the film. One particular scene which stands out for me is the Breakfast scene which shows the progressing and the disentergration of Kane's first marriage. The shooting of that particular scene is brilliant, provoking and incredibly effective, it says a lot for the film that such a simple trick is so well used.The ending of the film is also great, in a way it shows a human side to the monster that was Kane, it's Orson Welles's way of adding both a clever and a thought provoking end to the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unfortunately Citizen Kane didn't make me jump out my seat. I don't think personally that the subject matter appealed to me, but I did appreciate the way things were presented. The dark and gloomy beginning was great to represent death and the movie of Kane's successes was nice to put in the beginning because it threw off the audience and also gave a motive to go back and research his life more thoroughly. It was sort of evident to me in the beginning that they weren't going to find what this rose bud was. Orson Wells played the character beautifully. He made Kane seem invincible like he was "the man". Charles Kane was funny, determined, and charismatic. Although it may have been just how he was remembered or seemed to be it made the flashback worth remembering. Probably the thing that most stood out for me when watching was how Orson Wells lined out the position of things and created things to look at everywhere. He would have Charles mother in the foreground, his father in the middle ground and Charles playing outside all the way in the background. Or in the opera house scene how people were passing by the camera as to get to there seats in the foreground, yet you could see all the preparations going on in the background. The also most clever thing I saw was how they had time pass when Charles would have meals with his first wife. I loved the scene because it showed how time passes , but if effort is not put forth in making things better things will just remain the same and get worse. Lastly, something occurred to me when I watched the flashbacks I wondered if it would have been better in color because it could have showed more of the person's perspective of the time and show how the time periods were different from one another.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Citizen Kane</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Citizen Kane is a great movie to watch. This movie has great cinematography throughout the whole movie. Especially when the camera moves from outside and then comes in through the window of the house. This movie also has flashbacks of Kane's life showing everything from his childhood up until he died. The movie starts out with Kane death and he says one word Rosebud. A detective tries to figure out what it means. So this movie makes you wonder throughout the whole movie what it is. But in the end the audience finds out what it means not the people in the movie. It reflects on something from his his childhood and maybe it was what he wanted not to be rich and just have a normal life. But in the end the meaning of the word dies with him since it was burned.</fullReview>

This movie tops most critics lists as the greatest movie of all time and I just see it as a good film. The story is great and I love how it is told through the use of flashbacks. I love how Kane built up from a childhood in poverty to become very successful. The film is known for its cinematography and is said to be Orson Welles breakthrough film. It is one of stories that helped changed film making and there are some beautiful scenes such as the scenes when he is taken from his parents. I didn't expect Rosebud to be the name of his childhood sled that was strange. I am glad I watched this movie and its a must see for any film buff especially since it is ranked as the number 1 film by many critics. When Welles made this film he forever changed the way to make movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first couple minutes of this movie we are shown the death of Kane, and soon it jumps to be some documentary of his life, with a narrator telling us. This is a great way to start out a film, especially one that has mystery.After this introduction we are introduced to the main character inspector Leland who is determined to figure out the meaning of "Rosebud". Joseph Cotton plays a great inspector making the film watcher think they too are trying to figure out the meaning.The filming is one of the best I have seen in ages. So many different angles and long takes really makes the realism of this film come to be. With having a lot of long takes it takes a lot of practice and patience, and all the actors and actresses were marvelous to pull it off working with one another.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In 1941 the film Citizen Kane was released. A Black and white film that worth seeing. I really enjoyed this film. The cinematography of the film is outstanding. The use of lighting the many scenes was amazing. What I really like about this film was the narrative structure of the film. I found it to be different than the usually straight forward narrative used by most films. The film begins with the death of old man Kane. Before he passes on he mumbles the words Rosebud. The film becomes center upon the meaning of this word for Kane. I like how viewers are giving incite to Kane's life though a series of flashbacks of his life. I like how the story of his life is told after his death. It leaves little confusion to the viewers. When the films finish then we begin to understand the real Kane. If you want to see a film that uses incredible camera work I would highly recommend Citizen Kane.</fullReview>

This was based upon the life of William Randolph Hearst. In the movie, Kane spends his whole life and time demanding that people love him and what he is about, but when it comes to the most important things like giving love back the man is lost. The movie was extremely well done in the fact that it was revolutionary for it's time. Kane start's as just a simple man who believes that running a paper would be fun for him and help mend his new life. Throughout the movie, through the reporters eye's you begin to see that as time went on, Kane became hungry for power and it turned into a pursuit of love and fame in which he could give none of it back. No matter how much fortune the man had or could fork out, all anyone wanted him to show was love and he was incapable of doing so.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The 1941 dramatic film, "Citizen Kane" by Orson Welles is said by many to be the greatest movie of all time. After viewing it myself, i could understand why so many people felt this way. I felt that Welles approach of filming some of the scenes were a little different, but he mastered these angles in which to capture his vision. Not only that, but he also introduced different ways of focusing on people or objects, which i thought was quite clever. Along with the great camera-work, I felt like this story sent a great message, and whenever you can take something away from a movie, to me, it is a great success.

		<fullReview>As a man of modest knowledge on film criticism I feel somewhat apprehensive about commenting on a film regarded as the epitome of cinematic masterpiece. However that is my task and moreover that is exactly what Citizen Kane is. So I follow the advice given to so many confused writers: "write what you know". Firstly the credit owed to Orson Welles for this film's greatness can be compared to the credit Michael Jordan would receive for the Chicago Bulls winning championships in the 1990s. Of course there were supporting players in the making of the film, a great script and score, phenomenal set development, and a more than sufficient budget were undenyable factors contributing to the film's greatness. But the memorable aspects of this film arise from it's brilliant screen time structure, excellent camera work, and technological innovation that must have been spellbinding for a 1940's audience to behold. Amidst the logistical greatness, the story itself can almost become forgotten, but there-in lies a classic commentary on life and what moves us. The fact that a man of un-imaginable power such as Kane reverts back to a childhood toy in his dying breath, is a comforting aside that says truly simple things can be the most important.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rosebud... who'd have guessed?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Originally I was accepting of the nickname of the sled, but finding out what 'Rosebud' actually was code for in the world of William Randolph Hearst... Welles was probably lucky he wasn't killed, literally. Listed as No. 1 on the AFI top 100 films of all time I think it falls just a tad short. I'd have been more than happy to see it in the No. 2 or even 3 hole behind "Casablanca" and "The Godfather" respectively. The film still is an awesome piece of American film-making and in my opinion represents one of the first great 'indie' films as everyone aside from R.K.O. turned away the young upstart and his blasphemous script (with credit to his writing partner Herman J. Mankiewicz). The film is thorough in bringing along for the journey, even if it does hit a hump at the midpoint it follows quickly enough to keep us interested. Obviously it has survived the ultimate test, which is time, to prove itself since it was basically left for dead upon original release. It also didn't help that 'Kane' is one of those films you really do need to take in more than once to fully appreciate the film-scape. (In tribute, just see their reference in an episode of 'Family Guy' as "Two long boob-less hours!") Given that Orson Welles was a filmmaker well ahead of his time, it leaves one to wonder what his legacy may have been if 'Kane' had been more widely accepted by the film industry and the populace. Unfortunately we are left to realize his greatness too close to his death and well after it. How things may have been different in Hollywood as a whole if he had been anointed the master director and ringleader of the Mercury Theater he was instead of relegated to studio actor under the 'Dream Factory' thumb. Luckily, we'll always have his 'one hit wonder' (to those who simply ignore his body of work) to remind us of 'wasted potential' (due in NO part to Welles' own effort) in epic film. Enjoy the movie, pay attention and no bathroom breaks. Oh, and pay homage to Rosebud.</fullReview>

I don't want to come off like a snob and start analyzing every aspect of the MOVIE, and I don't want to give anything away. Citizen Kane is a MOVIE about how you can spend your entire life searching to regain you childhood, it explains aspects of human nature in our desire to be loved.

		<shortDescription>Quite simply one of the top 5 movies ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When released Citizen Kane was a box office disaster. Yet over the years it has become a misunderstood masterpiece. It's hard to believe that Orson Welles was only 25 when he made this gem. I have to admit I am not a fan of old movies yet Citizen Kane kept me engrossed throughout the duration of the movie. The story(as if I even need to say)involves Citizen Kane, a recluse who utters the word Rosebud before he dies. What follows is a mystery to find out the meaning of his last words. We see his life from the perspective of the people who knew him(his ex wife,his best friend and many more people). We go back to his childhood, when his parents give him up so he can have a better upbringing. Then he sets up a newspaper company through which Kane exposes scandals of politicians. We see his first marriage fall apart, coincidentally if I am not mistaken his first wife was played by Agnes Moorehead who also starred as Endora as Betwitched. We even see him trying to become politician but rumours of Kane being involved with a woman is circulated by his rivals. That results in him having to hand over his business to his partner. Then he distances himself from society until his death. Even at the end the people didn't manage to find out the meaning of the word Rosebud but we as the viewers do(don't worry I am not going to spoil it for those who haven't seen it). I see Kane as a remarkable character He is stubborn yet principled, a very good example is in the scene where his friend gives Kane's wife, who is a actress a bad review and how he reacts. Citizen Kane has opened my eyes to old movies and I will definitely try to watch Orson Welle's other work. Citizen Kane is one of the best movies ever made and the fact that the audience couldn't accept it at the time is most certainly their loss.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A lot has been said about this film, however the lighting is not praised often enough. This film impresses in many areas, but the lighting is truly extraordinary. I particularly loved the shadows that covered up the reporters in the present - it showed how irrelevant they were to the story of Kane's life and how they were merely their to lead us to the individuals who would speak of Kane. Shadows are used in similar ways throughout the entire film - it was really quite extraordinary in that department.The story was definitely intriguing and the ending delivers a remarkably successful payoff. Indeed it is a truly intriguing and remarkably truthful (as far as being truthful to human nature goes) character study. At times the story drags a bit and I blame that on the fact that despite the story being presented incredibly well it is not that good a story.The dialogue is pretty good. Sometimes the humour put a smile on my face which is all it was meant to do - to keep your attention and keep your eyes on the screen.Citizen Kane is certainly a successful film and I have a huge amount of respect for it (it was hugely influential) but there is something missing. As technically marvellous as it is and as well made as it is the film lacks power and the beauty seen in it is only slight and indeed short lived.</fullReview>

The film flows vividly and there were some wonderful shots. A great one is a shot near the start of the film where Kane's mother is talking to Mr Thatcher and there is a view of Kane playing outside the house in the snow. A haunting shot.Citizen Kane holds its helm at the top of AFI top 100 films of all time. Whether i agree with this is questionable. However, this film is hugely influential, its iconic style is a first. One film in particular where I can see its influence is There will be blood.

		<shortDescription>Incredible film-making</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Continually hailed by the critics (especially the American Film Institute) as the greatest film ever made, "Citzen Kane" remains a classic and one of the most well-written and executed movies of all time. The film was really the first of its kind, and its simple concept of flashbacks (which is taken for granted in all films since) was revolutionized by this movie. I don't know what impresses me so much about this film, whether it's the excellent writing, the mystery that surrounds the film from the beginning, or following the reporters' path from Kane's last word to the revelation at the end. Whatever the reason, it's just a great film. Somewhat loosely based on the life of reporter William Randolph Hearst, "Citzen Kane" can be described as a drama crossed with sort of a mystery. The techniques used in this film, including original ideas for camera angles (such as zooming in through windows) was basically created by this film. Orson Welles proved himself to be an ingenious filmmaker, though "Citzen Kane" was largely underrated for its time, winning only a single Oscar for its screenplay rather than all nine it deserved. Is it the greatest film of all time? Not in my opinion (I choose "Casablanca"). Nevertheless, this is truly monumental movie-making. All movie lovers need to see this film. Nearly perfect.***1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pauline Kael in her famous essay on this film tried (wo)manfully to give all the credit to Herman Mankiewicz's script and Gregg Toland's camera work. It persuaded few at the time and is hugely unlikely when you look at the work both did outside of this film. Kael as a critic was always a doubtful proposition, her chumminess with the makers of many of the films she reviewed was on an ethical level with those internet reviewers who take cash to rave about Hollywood's latest mindless blast ie "The Dark Knight" - an adolescent film for adolescents. The credit for this film is almost entirely due to Orson Welles, less a man than a legend even then. That said though, Welles has to take the blame for the film's shortcomings as well. The story is little more than the usual homily about money not buying happiness, wealthy Hollywood dished up this message gleefully to an audience that had no chance to test it's truth. The script contains some great lines but lacks depth. The psychology second rate Freud. The acting is variable, only Welles himself really managing to put any gusto into the film. Despite this the film is close to the masterpiece many have proclaimed, a fitting testament to old Hollywood's ability to turn trash into great cinema on a par with "Casablanca". How it manages this is hard to pin down (if it was easy to describe other filmmakers could achieve the same results with equal ease). At root it comes down to the sheer cinematic nature of the film, none before or since has used the medium's possibilities with such abandon or genius (this is one of those rare films that is unimaginable in any other medium). In the right mood you can surrender to this film and become convinced it is a work of art. Of course it does not stand up to serious textual analysis - few films can - but this is an American film that does not insult it's audiences' intelligence -a rarity then and even more so now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Definitive Classic!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For myself, I term Citizen Kane the definitive classic as it invokes thought from the audience at every scene. It is a portrait of a life which explores not only the events but the causation behind the events. To simply view the film without exploring the nuances does not truly appreciate the experience of the life of Charles Foster Kane as expressed by Mr. Welles. The film explores the reasons behind the actions of the main character via brilliant "interviews" with his fictional life's characters providing an opinionated commentary upon his actions yet leave ample space for the audience to form their private opinions and critique of both the character and the film. The single word used as a theme is brilliant and sums the purpose and intellect of this work as a discussion topic for everyone over the years. Seldom, do any artist's works elicit such a lasting and thought evoking response. I can well understand why Mr. Welles was proud of this work yet as the man himself would probably reply, Pride, but what is pride but a manifestation of one's ego bordering upon madness??? My words of course, yet inspired by a genius and master of the ages.</fullReview>

Frame after frame, scene after scene, we witness a stunning freedom from being outside the creatively parasitic bubble that was old Hollywood, afforded by Citizen Kane's masterful star and creator Orsen Welles in a way anyone entrenched into the business of making movies at the time it seemed had no perception about.With all the controversy concerning the studio and artistic control giving way to Citizen Kane resting high above the AFI's greatest lists most years, you would think the moneymakers would grasp the concept that great things can happen when great chances are taken. Though far from being perfection in motion all the time, Kane is worthy of the lazily used word classic more then just about any movie before or since in this country, if only for it's film vernacular innovation and articulation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Citizen Kane is a 1941 mystery/drama film released by RKO Pictures and directed by Orson Welles, his first feature film. The story traces the life and career of Charles Foster Kane, a man whose career in the publishing world was born of idealistic social service, but gradually evolved into a ruthless pursuit of power and ego at any cost. Narrated principally through flashbacks, the story is revealed through the research of a newspaper reporter seeking to solve the mystery of the newspaper magnate's dying word, "Rosebud." Citizen Kane is often cited as being one of the most innovative works in the history of film. In 1998 and again in 2007 the American Film Institute placed it at number one in its list of the 100 greatest U.S. movies of all time. In a recent poll of film directors conducted by the British Film Institute, Citizen Kane was ranked number one best film of all time.The film's main character, Charles Foster Kane, was inspired by newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst. Upon its release, mention of the film was conspicuously absent from Hearst's newspapers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is no doubt that "Citizen Kane" is a great movie, extremely well-made and acted. But to constantly say it is the "greatest film of all time" is incredibly wrong."Citizen Kane" is like the "Jimi Hendrix" of movies. It's great, but has somehow been elected as "greatest of all time" when there are obviously greater movies. There seems to be a notion that we have to choose a definitive "greatest" in almost every category, and "Kane" seemed like a good candidate at one time, so hence there it is.Film elitists love saying "Kane" is the "greatest" and look down upon many that disagree. But come on - is "Kane" really better than "Casablanca?" Or "Gone With The Wind?" Or "Star Wars?" Or a number of others? No. Is "Kane" great? yes. The best? Definitely not.But it is a very enjoyable movie, made this way only because Orson Welles plays his role incredibly well. And sure, the actual film making has many nice touches, and was groundbreaking to a degree back then. It's definitely a film that must be seen if you are a film fan, especially a classic film fan. But by no way is "Citizen Kane" the greatest film ever made.What is the greatest film ever made then? Well, who knows. That's up for debate. I would guess there really isn't a definitive "best" - like "Kane" is usually erroneously said to be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This review is part serious and at times frivolous in the enjoyment of the film, but it is my account, and I am deeply moved by this film after having seen it now in it's entirety.Rating 10/10 There is so much history behind this film.The light that goes out perhaps indicating we may not enter so hastily, but as the light slowly returns alight, perhaps we may gain entry slowly, through the passage of this film? One must be reminded of Coleridge's famous poem, Xanadu which is not only quoted here but recreated in flesh, like an edifice of archetypal power and myth.What's unfortunate about the film is the huge empty space between Charlie as a child and after he takes over the family empire.What makes Charlie the way he is? What drives him? What are his ideals and where did he learn them? Why does he demand his wife to sing? Why was Emily so quick to believe Gettys and not stand by her own husband? And would there not be some liability after the fact and hearing concerning the libelous blackmail by Getty? It all seemed too easy, too simple and unrealistic. Why do they hole up in Xanadu when they can do anything they want.Then it hit me, Susan is one of the unicorns from Candy Mountain... and I have the proof! First, Candy Mountain Charlie: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5im0Ssyyus Note that every time the unicorn says Charlie! it sounds exactly like Susan. Also note when Susan says Goodbye Charlie it's just like when the unicorn says goodbye to Charlie at the end of the video.That aside, the review continues.Why is it the single thing Charles Foster Kane recalls in his demise is rosebud? It is the word of a man who has never truly loved another, or found a deeper truth in their life and that is truly sad. For what is a man that he gain the entire world but lose his own soul? The missing piece that of Rosebud is perhaps the innocence of youth, that folly of being a child when ignorance is bliss, and we still believe in the illusions set before us and our vision is of magical things and high ideals.Perhaps we all have our Rosebuds, and in the end our memories are either upheld, values restored daily in our endeavors, or they are lost the smoke and dust of our forgotten and meaningless lives.Now even though there is much left unstated, I have to admit this is a brilliant and important movie, one which tells a story of not just one man, but of all mankind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Orson Welles' genius masterpiece!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Orson Wells was 25 when he made this picture which shows he matured early. The story is about a publishing tycoon who lives a great and rich life only to be torn down by scandal while running for political office. He lived in a mansion called Xanadu which has many vast treasures and expensive furniture. When he dies, reporters want to find out what he meant by his dying last word "Rosebud". A great story and directed to steely perfection by wells. If you are in the mood to see a film that is different than any other film imaginable then look no further than Citizen Kane. I don't know if this is the greatest film of all time as AFI has posted but it comes close.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a great classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think that this is a really great movie. It is one of those good classics. at first i thought that it was going to be a really boring movie because in my time, around people of my age classic films are no so popular, but i have to say that Orson Wells did a great job writing the screenplay and directing and also acting Thur role of Charles foster Kane. He plays such a controversial character with so much talent. I also like the movie because it gives you a sense of the values that people had in those times and why Kane was so criticized. For example, when Kane is in Susan Alexander's room. that was so scandalous because it was thought of as wrong for a married man to be alone with another woman.I really like the plot of the movie and i think it is a true Hollywood classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't watch this film for its entertainment value alone. This film will bore the Average Joe to tears. However, it is the one film that every film student must see. Once you know what you're watching for and why, this film becomes fascinating. There are more "film firsts" (innovations) in this one movie than possibly in any movie made since. A few example of innovations include the first use of stage make up to age characters in the film and the first time a camera passes through an object.Do yourself a favor. Either wait until you get a chance to take a film course or read up before renting this classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flawless: Without A Doubt The Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is more than a masterpiece. This is flawless. This film stands out above every other one that I've ever seen. It's not my favorite film, but I'm sure that this is the best ever, and will remain that way, no matter what film could come along. When you combine Orson Welles, Herman Mancawiez, and Joseph Cotten, there's not much thought in your mind that it's bad. The almost two hours revolve around a fascinating mystery that takes one man all around the country trying to figure out the last words of Charles Foster Kane, a newspaper tycoon who had died not long before. Oh, and, of course, the surprise ending-but, if you haven't seen it, it will ruin your experience. But make sure you're bored yet happy when you watch it. A rainy day is the perfect time. It's worth a 10/10, and, although it may not be a 10.0, it falls just short. It's much closer to a ten in my mind that a nine. Well, watch it and you'll see that it's true, it is flawless and the best ever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Most filmmakers take on simple subjects. Most finished works have defined edges, they fit within a comprehensible space. The finished picture is usually just a beginning/middle/happy ending formula. To present it, the whole is jigged into 'parts', usually just those 3 pieces which effortlessly snap together in the mind. From my previous comments you can probably glean what filmmakers are on that end of the spectrum.The young Welles was special, a revolutionary. He's on the opposite end of that spectrum with Kubrick, Kurosawa, Ridley Scott, most of Woody Allen's work, among others. The 'Kane' puzzle seemingly is a simple end product -- but it's jigsawed into at least 1000 pieces. The final 'piece' (Rosebud) eludes us, driving us mad.The opening sequence is like the box of pieces strewn on the table -- what are we seeing? The most common way to solve a puzzle is to first find the edges; Welles defines those edges in a 'newsreel', with movie footage interspersed among historical newsreels and fictional 'newsreels'. This gives us the parameters within which to figure out the middle. Try to imagine "JFK", for example, without this influence.Along the way, Welles plays with story narrative; who can complete the story? the diary? the second wife? the major-domo? the estranged friend? Kane's office lieutenant? We seem to go in circles, and yet we keep pushing forward, because we're convinced the piece is there, somewhere. Our surrogate in the story has to put this all together for us. We see what the investigator sees, just slightly more because of our perspective; over his shoulder, or while he lurks undefined in the shadows.But far more important is the visual narrative. The compositions of light, camera stance, motion of the eye, previously unheard of perspectives...it all literally draws us into a different world -- the mind of not just a story teller, the mind of a filmmaker. There's so much detail, so much to appreciate and just languish in. This, by God, is a movie.There are many reasons Kane ranks at or near the top of every list of greats. Think of all of the movies that have borrowed from this...it's staggering. That says it all...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Citizen Kane What a superb film. Everything in this film is perfection down to a tee, and it is shot SO well for it's time (I would say it's about forty years before it's time). Evidence of this is through the camera angles as they pan around, then up and into buildings. It is directed brilliantly by Orson Welles, who's presence really oozes out of the screen (and he plays the eldest Kane so well, that you cannot think of anything that would improve it). A beautiful sound track, a script so sharp that it's thick satire and irony is not lost and a good supporting cast really do mean this film is an essential classic, everyone should see.I give this film five potatoes out of a possible five potatoes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Art of Classical Film-making</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director and Star Orson Wells takes the art and technique of film-making to outstanding levels in this fictional biography of a Newspaper Tycoon Charles Foster Kane. The film is said to be a veil on the life of William Randolph Hearst, a newspaper magnate in the 1920's and 30's who was popular in politics and once interviewed Hitler but was also cited as creating loosely based stories with phony characters and deceiving the reader. Citizen Kane plays on the The True Greek Tragedy that Aristotle set in stone. A true tragedy is the fall of someone great in stature, especially if that someone was self made as is Charles Foster Kane.The Film takes us on the journey of a successful mans life, from the age of 8 to his death. Director Wells uses every film technique to capture this journey captivating the story and propelling a mans 70 year life into a 145 minute time frame. The angles and shadows crisscrossing the rooms and characters, the elapsing of time through dissolves and transitions, optical printing of lay overs in the reel, and the use of space all laid out in beautiful black and white photography. Every scene is well executed and the aging of Mr. Kane transfers off the screen in a magical way. A riddle is laid upon the viewer and it's answer is heart breaking and questionable as to what we become from who we were because we have to succeed. Beware the power of ownership. Citizen Kane is a well crafted and flawless piece of art. It is spellbinding at times and magical in its storytelling. Orson Wells had an enlightened sense to a film technique that is worth studying for filming future stories. Powerful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply one of the best films ever made...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alright...I'll be quick and short about this. Citizen Kane is simply one of the best films ever made. Mr. Wells did an excellent job of putting together Citizen Kane with his brilliant acting, directing and writing. The film is a very good example of a 'bildungsorman' (that is a literary term from the German meaning a tale of discovery). Wells pieced together the sad story of a rags-to-riches man in the early 20th century with amazing detail. The story being told in bits and pieces gives the viewer time to put the shards together and form their own opinion about Kane as the movie plays on. Wells used many varying stiles and angles in the shooting of the film and his use of lighting gives the movie the perfect feel. It is best to watch this movie knowing little about the actual story because that makes the experience that much more enjoyable. Although Orson Wells himself preferred 'The Trial' and 'Chimes at Midnight' more 'rewarding', I personally find Citizen Kane one of the most amazing and influential films of the twentieth century.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rosebud</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The greatest film of all time. Who ever knew that the greatest American film could be so... European? Rumor has it that Orson Welles saw Le Jour Se Leve, and the fotogenie of that film influenced him to adopt some of the camera techniques that were used for this landmark of cinema. It is infused with minimal comedy (seeing the young Kane starting a newspaper is perhaps the most lighthearted moment in the film), epic drama, detail, detail, detail, a powerful storyline and message (money doesn't buy happiness), brilliant writing, dialogue, camera work, and acting, especially on welles' part. the greatest thing about citizen kane? welles has given us the key to figuring out the enigma that is the title character through the revelation of rosebud. i had a huge grin on my face when this was pointed out to me in my film study class. However, we can sit here and praise Kane for all we want, but the point is that works of art such as this are being ignored by many people who are my age (19). many will opt for stoner flicks, cheap horror movies, and mind numbingly dull action movies. too many people are stuck in the star wars state of mind, and i've moved on beyond that. years ago. if people are serious about cinema, they'll take exactly two hours of their time to view citizen kane. you may not catch on at first, but with subsequent viewings, it flows much more easier. but this is merely a pipe dream of mine, but i'll give you my testament. i just decided to see citizen kane one day, because i felt it shouldn't be voted as the greatest film of all time. i was wrong - dead wrong.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to sympathize with the people who hail this film as one of the ones worth remembering. Although the story is slow (quite slow at times), it is so profound. The underlying meaning of "Rosebud" is one that truly will jerk the heartstrings and make the viewer feel a large amount of pity for Charles Kane. Makes one wonder just how much like Kane William Hearst was. Welles' performance was magnificent, absolutely deserving of an Oscar. Those who dislike the film are at least somewhat justified in their reasoning. However, someone with a real appreciation for a deep storyline is going to have at least some measure of praise for this movie. Approach this with the willingness to not be merely entertained.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>take it according to its time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just visited "the message board" of the movie and I saw a thread titled "this movie is over-rated". Well I never do pre-judge a movie without seeing it or say anything bad about it without reading about it. "Citizen Kane" is a very old movie even for middle-aged people of 2000s. Given that I just turned my 21 I knew perfectly well it wouldn't be a flawless experience for me to to see the movie.Yeah to be honest at some points(in the beginning)I felt bored but seriously I said to myself: Come on this movie must be at the top of IMDb list for a reason right?" Then I displayed the required patience and I am pretty glad that I have seen this movie at last.Like Jorge Luis Borges said this movie is a "metaphysical detective story". Its subject (both psychological and allegorical) is the investigation of a man's inner self, through the works he has wrought, the words he has spoken, the many lives he has ruined. All we need to do is to combine and reconstruct the fragments of this man's life portrayed perfectly by Orson Welles.With that in my mind I loved the movie and I do know that I gotta evaluate a movie according to the time it is produced. Think about it its production date is 1941 and some techniques used in the movie --series of jump cuts shot on the same set while the characters changed costume and make-up between cuts so that the scene following the cut would look as if it took place at a time long after the previous cut. --Unprecedented use of deep focus. In nearly every scene in the film, the foreground, background and everything in between are all in sharp focus. If you are very young and not patient enough you may not appreciate the movie but if you can be patient enough you will understand why so many people give high points to that movie but it is the time-honored fact that "Citizen Cane" is a very old movie and it is still associated with Hearst-Welles struggle.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>there was one drawback</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film last night for the first time. I can certainly appreciate the life story of a man who becomes increasingly closed, controlling, and frustrated in his search for love and adoration, maybe for himself.The one flaw I felt the movie had was that it focused too much on Kane's personal life and not much on his public life. And what is shown of his public life is equivocal. His "principles" published in an early issue of his paper were hardly convincing given his previous desire to harass some average Joe for good copy. Maybe this is the point, that he was a fellow that never had principles, but then one wonders why his friend was so easily taken in by this melodramatic gesture (publishing the principles) when it is really just a ploy. As an old man, this friend says Kane never had any principles. But that seems fairly clear from the beginning. So, though the friend perceives a change and at one point openly voices worries about a change in the man, there is really no change. It is all a bit undramatic from the point of view of Kane's public life. This makes the film more realistic, of course. He doesn't really change just becomes more of what he always was in the negative ways. But it makes the movie less dramatic. There was also too much time spent on the second marriage. This part dragged.Certainly the film portrays sterility in leadership from a class "born to rule". In a deep way Kane did not want to rule and did not want to play the role set out for him. There was the lack of passion coming from a road not freely chosen. Much of his early journalistic efforts are made to thumb his nose at his benefactor and all he stands for. One even if he half intentionally sabotaged his political career. He wants what we all want it turns out, acceptance of himself for himself. And the character is interesting. But I think they could have done more with the public career of the man to give the film more impact.As for Rosebud, I think it represents the path not taken--not what he lost or some search for love, but simply the man he would have been if had stayed with his parents and chosen his life more freely rather than having fortune thrust upon him.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is certainly NOT a "boring" film as so many reviews here often claim. I remember the first time I saw this back in the 80's I wasn't very impressed and was somewhat disappointed. I did like the "twist" ending though. Since then I have seen it maybe a dozen times and it just keeps getting better and better. To me this is the sign of a classic film. Is it "the greatest film ever made"? Of course not, there is no such thing, you cant compare a drama to a comedy to a musical to a documentary, etc. But I can say one thing, this is a great film. As a photography enthusiast, I find the beautiful black and white cinematography absolutely stunning. The lighting is incredible and if you haven't seen the recent 2 DISC DVD set you are in for a real treat. The film transfer is incredible, the film looks like new. I like the film just as it is, not too long as many are complaining, just right. I would say to all the nay sayers here, SEE IT A FEW TIMES before you declare this to be "garbage"! You couldn't be more wrong. This is one for the ages and belongs on any list of great films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>LETS TALK ABOUT FILM, PLEASE</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It occurs to me that most of you, with all due respect, should get their priorities straight. Namely: there's the movie of Citizen Kane itself, which is rich enough to provide for lots of interesting questions, and there's the question wether it should be rated best movie ever made. However uninteresting the last question, it seems the one most of you are trying to answer. If you want to know wether it really is the best film ever made, or the worst or second worst or third best, i suggest you do that somewhere else. Let's talk about film, if you please.How can one say that rosebud is not interesting? Can anyone explain that to me? Why should i forget about it, when it seems to play such an important role in the story? Maybe i need not know what it meens, or maybe it's wrong to try to find out the truth behind it, but it sure asks to be thought about.And how about the collectioning-fetish of Kane? Why statues? I think, maybe, because you can count on statues not to leave you, always to be there.Another interesting view on the piece as a whole is the question: say that you have all the power you want, not only moneywise, but you seem to be able to persuade people into doing almost anything. In other words: you have total control over your life, and it seems you can mold it into anything you want. Does that guarantee happiness? No, because Kane got everything he planned for, but not the thing he really wanted: love (and giving it). So then: the thought that we have that control over our lives is an illusion.Next: the mystery of man is as old as man himself. As long as we have been on earth, we've also been trying to find an answer to the question: who the hell are we? The reporter trying to find the truth about rosebud (which, in turn would be the truth about Kane), is a symbol for man trying to understand man. In the end he says something like: 'the truth about a human being is not to be found in a word'. Therewith saying that man (Kane) will remain a mystery.Anyone thinks this makes sense or not? SHould i be thinking about Citizen Kane in these terms or not? Please react, i could be wrong about everyting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I recently got a chance to see Citizen Kane again in my film class. I watched it for the first many years before but didn't really appreciate it so I was looking forward to see what became of it now. The opening scene sticks in my mind first off because it's very dark and gives you an uneasy feeling in the same way Hitchcock did with Psycho. Orson Welles was the kind of person who would break the rules when it came to filmmaking as he made films different to others, but keep in mind he was a theatre director so he knew how to trick audiences and I suppose he does the same with Citizen Kane which leaves you wondering what the word `Rosebud' meant. Welles did create a whole new genre I think but there are a few negative points about Citizen Kane which I feel I must share with you. I didn't think it was long enough to get a real feeling for Charles Foster Kane because there was hardly much to see about him growing up. It shot through different generations of his life to fast to even care about what he was about. But that doesn't make it a bad film, just not a great one. It may have been something huge and inventive in it's day but I wouldn't go as far as saying it was the greatest film of all time as the critics say. I could honestly name 20 other films which are just as good, Citizen Kane sticks in everyone's mind because it was fresh but when you look at it now it offers nothing new. Nevertheless the camera work in this was just fantastic when his father and mother are talking to Thatcher in their house but through the window you could see Charles Foster Kane as a small boy sledging through the snow and then it cut to a scene where his mother was looking outside at him and then kept with her and the other two characters till they got outside which must have been very hard to do back then and the lighting in Citizen Kane is probably the best I have ever seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you're ever watching Citizen Kane again, slow down the movie when Kane and Susan are on the picnic- we see the cars in a line, then the next scene is in the marsh with the tents set up and the musicians playing. As a man walks to the left, birds fly by rapidly in the background, but in slow mo, you can tell that these are pterodactyls! The set is actually of a prehistoric movie that RKO studios shot earlier. Also, the scene where the reporter goes to the butler and asks about Rosebud- we shock cut to a cockatoo screaching, and if you look closely, you can see through its eyeballs. I always laugh at the scene where the staff is going to present Kane with the trophy, but then he goes outside- does Leland really have to say "Let's go to the window!" Seems kind of hilarious on screen, but then again, Kane is making a movie based on radio programs, so this kind of dialogue would be necessary in that context.</fullReview>

So a news reporter starts intreviewing people about his life to find out what that word means. The movie shows Charles Kane's life from when he was little child all the way to an old man. The twist at the ending is lengendary and is amazing.The acting in this movie is great. Orson Welles steals the whole movie away. And not only is the acting incredible, but the whole plot, the way they deliver it, and the directing all have greatness in them.Go out and watch this jewel and enjoy it.

No film I can think of has a more flawless ensemble, a more driving and intriguing story told in a more elegant and beautiful way. After finishing a film like Citizen Kane, you never forget it.Its innovative structure, its flawless cinematography, its flawless editing, and its near flawless performances. Profound statements on memory and historical rememberance. Almost flawless on every imaginable stratum I could possibly think of. It may seem that I have abstracted the term "flawless", but I am only giving credit to where its due. Welles has crafted a masterpiece for all times, and its my favourite Orsan Welles film after Chimes at Midnight -- another masterful work of art by Orsan Welles. Even after 62 years of its premier in New York, Citizen Kane still stands out as the only film conceptualized and consummated too perfectly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kane the General Public</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The fact that most Hollywood films of today live for 'profits' and 'success' before sacrificing for great direction and narration doesn't surprise me that we have films in this era that will never (NEVER) reside on the same plane as 'Citizen Kane'. Films are getting worse from where they started. I'm not saying that all films are bad coming out now, I'm simply saying for every one good film coming out in 2003 80 weak films (The Twin Towers happily falls into this category) only worth the advertising money that was spent on them to get all of us flocking like sheep to go see them are making me want to think twice the next time I attempt to relinquish my cherished time to set foot into today's movie theatre. What gets me is how so many films worth their weight in gold aren't being showcased at all (Good films don't need to be showcased as much as bad films ((history proves that)), word of mouth still precedes over the most flamboyant advertising campaign out there). I simply hold that if these great films like 'Citizen Kane' were showcased like the films of today they wouldn't be any worse to look at than how they were when you had to go out of your way to dig them up and watch them at a library. I believe the genius would still last in them and make us a more learned,skeptical society when it came to cheesy films coming to theatres every week asking for our viewing (more so our money). We don't know the equation (if there ever could be one) on how to make a film=masterpiece. I know for sure after seeing 'Citizen Kane' that Orson Welles' came pretty close to this equation. Many foreign film makers before Well's time (and even today...France,Italy,Germany,Mexico,Iran:Color of Paradise (1999)) have also succeeded in approaching this 'perfect equation' as happily and unknowingly as most of will be able sit through a 'great' movie at awe and soak in all of its genius practically for granted.I already expect that from foreign film-German film literally brought Hollywood to level that it reigns at today. Shockingly enough Orson Welles was an American director and made a 'great film'...very hard to do in 1941 if you were an American film maker who usually had to stick with creating the stereotyped 'box office hits' of that time. Say what you like about how 'overrated' and 'over estimated' 'Citizen Kane' seemed to be. Then again you can focus on watching 'Friends' every Thurdsay night for some sense of trying to diminish the fact that you contain the personality of a brick when it comes to comprising your social life. My main grudge with the youth of today is they aren't watching these 'great films', they don't know how far movies have come let alone where they originated from. Hollywood is using this ignorant youth as the main entity who go and pay to see such films that are supposedly 'geared' for them.The next time you hear about films (especially worthless ones i.e. teenieBop, feminazi,teeniehorrorBop,epic thriller, etc.) that were made for a specific audience/generation in that specific 'time/era/period' think about the time when you didn't study for a test and decided to cheat in order to pass it. You may have passed it and gotten away single handedly with cheating but in the end all you have to speak for of that class you cheated on is the piece of paper that shows your passing grade. You'll stop caring why you took the class in the first place let alone why your going to school: (in a politically correct world) to learn and gain more knowledge. Therefore you either look down upon that certain subject until your able to go back and maybe ascertain it or give that certain subject total lack of respect whether it be Math, Economics etc. As long as films like 'Citizen Kane' are being showcased as 'washed up' and 'great in its time' we mine as well cheat for everything in life. Focus on the 'cool' and care less about the movies that make you contemplate and consider, expand your thoughts like school is supposed to do. Hollywood may obtain a foothold on the film industry as of now but if they continue on the path their headed they may just end up crying 'RoseBud' in the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A rose-bud by any name would not taste as sweet!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For such a long time i could not understand why this film was so acclaimed. Then recently i read about it, and watched a few documentaries on the people involved, and then it clicked, and i understood how truly great and ground-breaking it was.It's difficult to recommend a film which isnt such an instantly apparent wonder. I don't think it is, and still maintain it's pretty hard-going, and not something i would watch to either gain instant gratification, or relaxation to; but film is as much art as it is anything else, so why should i be so small-minded.Some would certainly diagree and take a great deal of pleasure from it, but having first watched it, it wasn't a hit. Perhaps it was simply me being disappointed at "The greatest film of all time". And, i think it was that.What IS Rose-Bud?No, he's not the character out of the British film Snatch (but how ironic, intentional im sure!). Some after having seen the film still wonder. The greatness of this film lies within it's REAL meaning, and the references and people the film is actually about (taken from the day). Parallels are drawn, and in fact we see a great satirical play by Welles, giving this film more lifes than anyone could disect. Look at the sum of books written on this film and you'll see what i mean.Watch it, if not simply to say you have. Then, should you have chance, read about it, you'll be quite surprised at what major steps you've witnessed, and what a truly fabulous and ground-breaking film this was.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A splendidly acted if at times difficult to follow movie, told mostly in flashbacks, about the rise of a newspaper tycoon who made life awfully difficult for his friends and subordinates. Gregg Toland's photography and Bernard Herrmann's music helps move things along at a brisk pace. Director Orson Welles, who also co-authored the script with veteran screenwriter Herman Mankiewicz, works wonders with the material. A bumptious, elliptical film, this one may not appeal to all viewers. It requires patience, and a feel for the past, especially early twentieth century America, which it is in many respects a meditation on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfecting the art of cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seeing "Citizen Kane" is seeing the full potential of the cinematic medium. Charles Foster Kane comes to life before the viewer's eyes and ears as only the great Welles could have done it: with the greatest of vision.When you look at this film 61 years after its initial release, the story of the rivalry between Orson Welles and William Randolph Hurst is long forgotten, but this movie still stands as an artistic landmark, an island in a sea of mediocre movies of its time.Orson Welles' vision brought notions into this movie that weren't to be seen again for years later, and some are even today used in a bad way, pale imitations of the original mind of Welles. The script of this movie is absolutely genius, and the idea of overlapping lines is a fascinating experiment in a 40's movie. only Woody Allen movies come close to exploring this idea nowadays. The cinematography is, as it should be, haunting and unique. The editing is rhythmic and vibrant, and dictates the mood of most scenes. The acting is fantastic, of course, but you would expect nothing less from an experienced theatre group such as the Mercury.All together, this movie stands out so obviously among its contemporary films, much as it stands out among modern films.For the absolute genius of putting so many fine elements of the cinematic art together so beautifully and perfectly, I give this movie a whole-hearted 9/10.</fullReview>

On a technical scale I do not think any film to date has rivaled the quality and planning of Citizen Kane. This movie is an all around great example of film. Citizen Kane combines the best in cinematography, story, and acting. Citizen Kane conveys some of the simplest truths in life through a story of great scope and range. Citizen Kane's message is timeless, and so thus is Citizen Kane.</fullReview>

Forgive me for being in school when I saw it, perhaps that was it, but I fell asleep on three occasions i believe (three different days of watching it). Anywho, sure the camera work was ahead of its time, the angles are spectacular, the theme is excellent (rosebud), etc. but let's look at the actual content of the movie. This movie WAS the greatest movie of its time but it has nothing to offer to the 21st century. Perhaps great content along with great direction would constitute it as such but there is only great direction, outdated content. I give it *** out of **** nonetheless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is one of those movies that I like mostly due to technical perfection. The cinematography, editing, direction and writing are all perfect! Gregg Toland is a wonderful DP. Welles and Toland worked closely together to bring this story to the screen, and I think that Toland interpreted Welles' vision perfectly. Robert Wise's editing is done to perfection as well. The wipes and fades are all done well, and all done with purpose. Too many films have editing and cinematography done without thinking of how it will affect the story--Citizen Kane is definitely not one of them. Also magnificent is the set design. This is my definition of a technically perfect movie! Must see for those who desire to be in the industry.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seeing Citizen Kane has to be one of the most rewarding experiences I have ever had the pleasure to go through. I am a great fan of classic movie, partly due to my strong interest in history and original sources (in the historian's sense of the word). If you don't share this fascination be prepared for a narrative which may seem slow, sometimes even tedious compared with the dialogue of modern classics like Pulp Fiction or the editing of Memento. To name a few other non-linear movies. The fact that the film uses a lot less music than modern movies might put you of aswell.These aspects just go to show that in movies experience can be accumulated of the years with great ease: you can always see if someone's idea worked out or not. You should have to appreciate the fact that this movie brought a lot of new ideas (especially when it comes to lighting a shooting).See it, being aware of the fact that it was groundbreaking at its time and, in some respects, even in our time. If you don't look at it this way, get ready for a disappointment</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>On Citizen Kane and the whole "greatest of all time" thing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's get one thing straight. There is NO unquestioned greatest film. Opinions on the greatest films diverge widely. The people here that are offering negative reviews seem to be under the impression that Kane is the cinema's Shakespeare What you have to realize is that, while Kane invariably shows up at the top of greatest film lists, these lists are always composites, based on hundreds of different lists by different critics and reviewers. Check out the web site of Sight and Sound, where they have the top ten lists for the past 50 years. Kane is on the top this year, just as it was in 92, 82, 72, and 62. But if you look at the individual lists, you'll find a lot of variety in people's individual choices, and you'd be surprised how many Citizen Kane doesn't even appear on. Or, when it does, how rarely it is at the top. In fact, outside of dim bulb TV talking heads reading off of a teleprompter, I don't think I have ever heard anyone say that Citizen Kane is the greatest film ever made. It just happens to show up in the most critic's lists.And in any case, this sort of thing is cyclical. Kane didn't have this kind of respect until the 60s, and it's already starting to falter a bit. A recent poll made up of critics and afficionados in their 20s ranked Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo at the top. In any case, Citizen Kane is not my favorite movie. It's not even my favorite Orson Welles movie (that would be Touch of Evil). When I took part in one of these polls, it didn't even make my top ten. But I can easily understand why it's so well respected, and it would probably make my top 20 or 25. All the tools of cinema are used to sublime effects here, from the expressive camera angles to the stunning interplay of shadow and light. The acting, especially be Welles, is simply stunning. And the plot is constructed artfully, non linear but always quite engaging. We get a deep sense of the characters in all of their subtleties, quite a difficult task that most filmmakers fail to accomplish even today.I have to laugh when people complain about how Kane doesn't live up to 'today's standards.' Of course, this is just a matter of personal taste, as I enjoy the dreamlike grace of the classic films so much better than anything post '77 (ironically, the year that I was born.) And if you think that Forrest Gump or The Green Mile are the pinnacle of filmmaking, then you probably won't 'get' what's so great about Citizen Kane. Which is fine, nobody says you have to, but I have to think that you're missing out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Greatest?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems rather annoying to read people slagging this film and claiming that others are "jumping on the bandwagon", afraid to insult this film because of it's legacy.The fact is, this is one the greatest movies ever made, American or otherwise. It is groundbreaking, both in terms of the narrative (films like Pulp Fiction and Memento owe a great debt to Orson Welles, simply for proving that a non-linear story can work), and especially for technical aspects. Boring details aside, the difference between movies and theatre lies in what the director captures with his images; so even if you have any complaints about plot and acting (the latter is overly histrionic and dated, to be certain), they are essentially insignificant in the scope of things. Another user has asked if this version of the American Dream story is the reason as to why the film is considered "The Greatest." The story, in my opinion, is uniquely American, and defenitely an important part of the film, but I still prefer to think that filmmakers (read: people who MAKE FILMS) look more toward Citizen Kane for what the can accomplish with a camera lense, rather than with a good story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Citizen Kane is not my favorite movie of all time, but it is the perfect film to show to someone who wants to understand the medium of film more than they currently do. The story of Citizen Kane is filled with fun, music, wealth, happiness, sadness, tragedy, anger, fear, hatred, but most of all, mystery. Orson Welles portrays a truly mysterious man, and only at the end do we really have a full picture of Charles Foster Kane, a fictious newspaper mogul who some say was modeled after William Randolph Hearst. I enthusiastically recommend this picture, because even though it's over 60 years old, it is still as fresh as any new film today (probably fresher), and the picture quality has been restored to near perfection on the new DVD release. Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I put off seeing this film for the longest time and after re-reviewing it through comments here, I just had to add my own. I did see it finally a couple of months ago and my thoughts are as fresh as when I did...I think this movie was great and innovative for its time, and it's still a good movie, hey I even rated it a "ten," but I would have to go against the tide, which gives it a "greatest movie of all time" rating. I just don't buy it. Sure Welles brashly bucked the establishment and gave everyone a lot to think about at the time, but it is dated and the message (I think) is not as clear as that brought forth in some works of today. The filmmaking itself may have been new at the time, but when compared with today, the technique is old hat. The story was interesting and from a historical point of view, we might regard the innovations Welles brought with Citizen Kane, but are the accolades lauded on this work here, really warranted in comparison to what has come since? Again, don't get me wrong, on all fronts I thought this was a solid work, but in comparison to other solid works here in the top 250, I thought the film wanted for comparison. In other words, I wasn't sucked in. So...in sum, I will give the work its due for what it represents both artistically and technically, and if it were still the 1940s, I too would most likely rate in the tops ever made, but I refuse to apologize for what has been done in cinema since 1941... It's hard to take away from that which is innovative since.</fullReview>

It defines the art of film in two hours. As brilliant for the use of sound as for its visuals, this was also the most extensive use of visual effects in a non-genre film up to this time. Kubrick was probably the only disciple to equal Welles's visual mastery, but even at his best he seemed to lack the sheer exhuberence evident in every shot of a Welles film. Everything about the craft seemed to excite and inspire him. If "Kane" had been on the shelf, unseen for these past 61 years and released now, it would be hailed as fresh and ahead of its time. The only thing which dates it are the colloquialisms of the forties. Without Welles, there might never have been Kubrick, Scorcese, Spielberg, Coppola, and on and on...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Citizen Kane is often regarded as the best motion picture ever. But if you show it to someone who is not into movies he won't understand the power of this movie. The plot is not that outrageous to make this movie great it's more the kind of expression Welles uses. In the 40's it was a scandal to make a movie that didn't fit into the stereotypical view of the ?Découpage Classique`. New techniques to tell a story ( for instance the main parts of the story are brought to the viewer by flashbacks), the new camera-system (to sharpen characters and the background at the same time) and the use of special effects (like matte-paintings). Furthermore the actors are playing sensational. It's real fun watching Welles developing from the young dynamic newspaper owner to an old unbearable bastard. He is realistic and overbearing at the same time which makes the character lovable. Not to forget the trouble with Hearst who almost managed to withdraw the picture from all cinemas and to destroy it. God thank he failed!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ask yourself the question: who makes a film like this as their first effort? The answer: only a genius, perhaps a flawed one. Beginning with The Cradle Will Rock and the Mercury Radio Theater, Welles simply overwhelms the careers of his peers. Never underestimate the contribution of Greg Tolin, his deep focus work and dutch angles add a feeling of scale and panorama. Movies are made of moments. Say the word "Rosebud" and what else can you think of but Kane? Is it the greatest? That's like trying to figure out who was the greatest baseball player or football figure. Greatness is like a butterfly, hard to pin down. Well, compared to another epic of its era, "Gone With the Wind", it makes that well thought of film look like a Soap Opera. Kane is a film that delivers something new everytime you see it. Like a Russian Doll, there are layers and layers. Okay, maybe you don't want to intellectualize entertainment, but this film transcends entertainment. Like the best of Shakespeare it gets into the human soul. The result is that it is truth and truth is never dated, nor is it bounded on the east by Eastport. This film should be preserved forever. As a filmmaker, I would be overjoyed to write, produce or direct anything half as good. Frankly, I don't think you can compare Kane to any other film. By the way, the Soundtrack by Bernie Hermann was recast into a Classical Suite, "Welles Raises Kane". Everybody gave 110% to this picture. I wonder if Orson Welles life would have turned out differently, if he hadn't peaked on his first film.</fullReview>

It remains the high watermark for efficient, integrated visual storytelling even 60 years later, providing the ruler by which all other films are measured.Even if its daring visual innovation and technical mastery weren't enough, it also tells a complex, multi-layered and quintessentially American story that turned traditional film narrative on its head, and reveals new depths which each viewing.

And allow me just one more. . . I find the plot of "The Maltese Falcon" terribly confusing but have never bothered to work it out as it just seems to be about several nasty people doing nasty things to each other in claustrophobic Los Angeles apartments. There, that's me done for! I doubt that anyone will take my cinema writings seriously again. But back to "Citizen Kane". It really is a very good film indeed, brilliantly inventive, its monochrome visuals as breathtakingly exciting as any I know. It is so clever that one cannot but admire it; the wonderful "March of Time" parody, the haunting use of deep focus photography in the childhood sequence, the disintegration of a marriage charted in a sequence of breakfast vignettes. I wrote the other day of how the great Polish director Krzysztof Zanussi achieved a wonderful marriage of the head and the heart. What ultimately prevents "Citizen Kane" from being a a great film to my mind is that it is all head and very little heart. In 1941 the Oscars for best picture and director were awarded to John Ford's "How Green was my Valley", a film that not only displays marvellous Hollywood craftsmanship but possesses such an abundance of heart that it just had to be the winner. Take a look at Ford's earlier "The Hurricane" (1937) and you will even see those sets with ceilings that "Citizen Kane" is purported to have pioneered.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a compelling picture of epic quality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Citizen Kane is truly an American cinema classic. Combined with a brilliant performance by Orson Welles (who also directed, produced, and co-wrote this film)and an amazing story, Citizen Kane brings a sense of power to the screen. It is truly the inspiration for anyone who wants to direct. This is so because this was Orson Welles's first film. Nominated for 8 Academy Awards including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, and Best Screenplay. (Orson Welles should have won for Best Actor), it ranks as an essential film in the history of cinema. However, the only thing that brings down this picture is trying to understand what the term Rosebud means at the end of the movie. I know that Rosebud was his sled, but how does that describe his life? In spite of that minor detail, Citizen Kane ranks as the second best film ever made, second only to Gone with the Wind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>classic 1941 film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The term "classic" and this films title go hand in hand...so much it's a cliche'. The film is the tale of the life of a newspaper magnet and his rise and fall. The film also deals with his life that could have been and the happpiness in childhood he missed. This was one of the mysteries behind ROSEBUD. Rosebud; the mysteries of life and and turns and twists and how it all could have been. A fascinating and visually arresting film. CITIZEN KANE is one of those movies talked about in university courses or in newspaper columns by other reviewers. Nearly half a century old, this film thrives today as a symbol of quality craftsmanship in filmmaking and character development. The film can be equated with a "novel for film feel." This was one of the best known of ORSON WELLES films.</fullReview>

The movie was clearly ahead of its time, thanks to Welles' revolutionary style of direction. The intricately detailed scenes, the unique camera angles, the lighting, etc, all that was new to audiences. The acting is very exceptionally as well, as Welles portrays Charles Foster Kane, the man whose simple childhood quickly dashes away when he gets a taste for the high life, which ends with his last breath proclaiming his one true happy moment.</fullReview>

What ? what am I saying ? Citizen Kane is better than Starwars ? YES FOOLS, IT IS ! Because it is not all about liking it or even having fun watching it (what am I saying?)! We are talking about art, and the benefit that movie was able to provide to a relatively new art is tremendous. We are talking about new ways to say things with images and sound, new techniques (special effects, and storytelling) and, above all, human aspects in the matter depicted. Citizen Kane is an important movie and without it they wouldn't be any Starwars. That's it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Love it or hate it, you have to accept that Citizen Kane is the most important movie ever made. The techniques that were employed in this film are still an important part of film-making today.The first hour of this film is a fantastic romp through the early years of Charles Foster Kane, and is only halted once he meets Susan. It is their that the movie becomes slightly more sinister.At the beginning we see Kane as a loveable rogue prepared to fight the good fight, and by the end of it he is a desolate wife-beater, who finds that money can't buy happiness.Overall, Citizen Kane is a fantastic film, and deserving of such a high-ranking for being so far ahead of it's time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the greatest EVER, but...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When a movie is advertised as being the greatest ever before you've seen it, there is a certain level of expectation and anticipation during the initial viewing. Certainly, this may have been the greatest movie of its time, but after viewing it in 2002 I could name about 10 movies I thought were better than Citizen Kane. I'm not about to start an "O-VER-RATE-ED..*clap clap clap-clap-clap*" chant or anything, but I think it is a reflection just on how much movies have evolved since 1941. Surely, this was a classic story, with Charles Kane living his American Dream, but I was just not totally engaged with the story-telling and the acting. It was boring at times, and when it could have made "the leap" and totally captivate, it just dragged.But keeping it in perspective, I can see how this was the landmark movie of its time. There were innovative camera angles and expansive, elaborate sets, particularly the interior of his palace toward the end of the movie. I would hardly call this the greatest movie ever; I don't know if it is fair to label any movie as the greatest ever. Nevertheless, Citizen Kane was most likely the greatest movie of its era, and should be required viewing for everyone, simply for them to decide if it really is the "greatest movie ever."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Few directors have understood the complexities of film like Orson Welles. To him, lighting set the entire mood, the angle told the story, and the looks were dialogue. Perfection was his goal, and no film ever got closer than Citizen Kane. At once, enthralling, depressing, thoughtful, and uplifting, the greatest of this film is ineffable, its impact undeniable, its vision unforgettable. This film changed making movies forever. Every director that has made a film since has strived to be Orson Welles. Every actor that has acted since has wanted to act like Orson Welles. Every lighting designer, every cinematographer, every screenplay author, they have all wanted to be Orson Welles. This film is what we measure all over films by. No, it is not as action-packed as Star Wars, it is not as scary as Psycho, it does not use the digital technology of Titanic, but let us get one thing straight, none of those things are what films are about. Film is about a story and how you tell it. Nobody told it better than Citizen Kane.</fullReview>

It has innovation writ large all over it, from Gregg Toland's deep focus cinematography to Bernard Herrmann's moody score to the natural interplay of the performers (especially Welles with his wonderfully modulated voice) and it never flags, not even for a minute. The screenplay, by Welles and Herman J. Mankiewicz, is a model of perfection, cutting, as it does, through a life as seen through the eyes of those who knew Charles Foster Kane at various points. All in all, it's impossible to conceive improving upon what is quite possibly the greatest, most influential film ever made.</fullReview>

If shown on a High Definition TV, you will marvel at the beauty of this work. The sound has been left in "Mono" and not enhanced for stereo -- and it sounds like it must have when originally released. The "Extras" contained on this 2-Disc set are excellent: Disc Two contains the almost 2 hour documentary,THE BATTLE FOR CITIZEN KANE, which chronicles William Randolph Hearsts efforts to destroy Welles' film. It also gives you a marvelous understanding of how Welles came to create this unique film. The film features access to two audio commentaries, one by critic Roger Ebert and the other by director Peter Bogdanovich. (I've listened to the Ebert commentary and it is outstanding.)

		<fullReview>The movie for Citizen Kane has just ended for me a couple of minutes ago, and I am pretty stunned, and I still do not know what to think about this movie. I do not know if I ever will. It does not have your modern day special effects, but it does have one thing many movies today are lacking- plot. Also, while watching movie, I enjoyed knowing that each scene was through someone else's eyes other than Kane's. This means that several scenes can be seen over and over again, and depending on which point of view or who is speaking, the scene means something different. I understand why so many people put this movie on the top slot- it is an enigma. This is one movie that will never have a straight answer, only keep asking the question over and over again. I had no idea what the meaning of "RoseBud" was, only that it was said in the movie. For that I am grateful, because I kept watching the movie in hopes of finding out what the answer was. I cannot wait to buy this movie on DVD.</fullReview>

And above all else, it is a great story about a complicated man and his longing for what he could never get back.

		<fullReview>I watched Citizen Kane for the first time yesterday. It is a fine film, but why is it playing so much on my mind? It's about a man's life, about winning, about collecting, about losing, then selling and burning. It is about a wish to return to childhood because of a growing alienation in adulthood. Citizen Kane is about us, about the castles we try to build, about our noble passions in our youth, about our alienation when the cunning of the world destroys the object of our passions, about our selfish passions, our madness for love, about our destructive passions, about the loss of faith and the loss of passion, about rejection from the world and rejection towards the world. It is about smoke, as the memory of the man and his passions is burnt away. I think that's why it plays on my mind so much. Orson welles was this passion.</fullReview>

For example, Welles used "panning" to great excess, to achieve a "one-take" effect i.e. panning down through the night club ceiling in the interview with Kane's Mistress, and in the Opera sequence where he went from miniature to real life in panning up to the cat-walk and the two stage hands.

It plays with narrative without even letting the viewer realise that it is doing so; bouncing from present to past and back again. All along though, there is charm and daring coupled with high intelligence and inventiveness. Packed with great pitch perfect performances note Agnes Moorhead in the role of the mother: less than 5 minutes on screen and completely believeable.)The dialogue (whoever wrote it) uses stutterings, speaking at the same time and different volumes in a way that is a credit to the training that Welles had in radio. One could mention the lighting, cinematography etc but to dissect would be to destroy. Proof that there is a God and he loves film is here for all to see. A truly wonderful film.</fullReview>

I decided to rent the movie last week and form my own unbiased opinion.I can feel it. I can sense it. I know why some find this movie great. The cinematography and screenplay is awesome. The movie moves rapidly from scene to scene. The 2 hours went by in no time. The plot comes full circle as the movie concludes. It is truly a dynamic movie.At the same time, I can't run out and say "You have to see this movie!" I found it dark, sinister, and downright depressing. While black and white is classic film making, it can often create light and shades that are emotionally difficult to watch. Perhaps that's what makes Citizen Kane so great to so many. But at the same time I am spoiled by today's movie technology. I find it difficult to relate to movies that are so old (60 years) that the primitive technology effects my ability to appreciate how good a movie may have been IN IT'S TIME.The greatest movies of all time will stand the test of time. The Godfather was made nearly 30 years ago and it has a whole new generation of fans. The college campus reaction to Citizen Kane would suggest that it does not have the same staying power.As I said...I am torn with Citizen Kane</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It just doesn't reach the modern audience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film for a class entitled "The Art of the Cinema" at Penn State University. Within thirty minutes of the opening credits, only a handful of students in a class of around 800 were awake.What I think this demonstrates is the very criteria on which I base my own opinion of "great" movies: the ability to transcend time and culture, and to have a perpetual impact on audiences. Unfortunately, Citizen Kane does not have this, as evidenced by these sleeping students, as well as the thousands of other film students who fall asleep during this film. It isn't that they're being "disrespectful" to a classic, but it's just this: the younger generations don't take classics for more than they're worth (there is no reverence for "the name itself"). I think that this is worth looking into, because other such "classics" such as Singing in the Rain, Some Like It Hot, and The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance still do captivate even the youngest audiences. Maybe this is because there is something in these films that young Americans feel that they can relate to. Citizen Kane, despite what the critics and many "film buffs" say, lacks this.If you don't believe me, look at the empirical evidence. Go to a showing of Citizen Kane in a film class at a university near you. You might be the only one still awake at the end of the movie. You may think that Citizen Kane deserves to be #1 on AFI and IMDB, but remember; this is far from the majority opinion among Americans today. It doesn't matter what film critics or buffs say, young Americans will continue to view films for their actual worth, and to Citizen Kane, young Americans say, "over-rated."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is certainly a black n' white movie, and there's just no getting away from that fact, although Orson Welles (not to be confused with Orson's farm) tries very hard by giving the whole picture a gloriously contemporary feel.This is certainly a better movie than Last Man Standing although, in fact, when you really think about it, the two movies have absolutely nothing in common at all and it really wasn't worth my bringing it up.We all know what Kane is about because we've all seen it, and if we haven't seen it then A) we really should have by now because it is sixty years old and B) we'll find out what it's about when we do see it. But just in case we don't know:Kane is a successful newspaper man and he dies very happy, and says ROSEBUD which is some big mystery for some small journalists to look into. What is this Rosebud? What did he mean by it? And how did the nurse who heard him say Rosebud hear him say Rosebud when he said it sotto voce and she was just coming in through the door on the other side of the room?They are big mysteries. We find out the answers to some of them, but I won't tell you them, even though you really should know by now, because it all happened sixty years ago in black and white.So the journalist goes around finding out about Kane's life, and it is all a bit like a jigsaw puzzle, a point that is emphasised when the journalist says that it is all a bit like a jigsaw puzzle.Direction-wise, other than that black and white thing, the film is exemplary. Use of deepfocus photography - scrummy - and clever clever things like putting the window through a skylight, which Orson Welles was the first person to do... except Fritz Lang ten years earlier and a few people in between.Smashingly good. Can we have a colour remake please??????</fullReview>

What is good about it has nothing to do with camera, lighting, technique, or any such nonsense. It is perfect the way a piece of music can be perfect--and, as with music, it is impossible to say in words just what it is that makes it so great.Wait a few years, my young friends, and see this movie again. Do people still mature or is that old-fashioned?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Technically great, but just an academic study</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have no doubt this film remains an ethalon as the artistic form and technicalities are concerned. However, the idea or message of "Citizen Kane" did not convince me. It is an amazing study on the issue of "unhappy most powerful man". But it hardly is more than a study. I did my best to understand this classic, but still I found the story quite superficial, calculated and cold - too academic in one word. There was no point of the film, where I could really identify myself with the heroes. Maybe the young age of the director was the reason, why he could not get deeper. In my view, it is always a bit "cheap" to demonstrate ideas on lottery winner, millionaires or press moguls. I appreciate more, if values and wisdom are shown in lives of rather normal people, who have to defend their dignity and happiness without having the power of huge cash and media behind them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cinema's Greatest Achievement</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film that defines a masterpiece, Citizen Kane is a film which revolutionized the industry of filmmaking. Without it, so many of our favorite films would never have existed, so its influence alone makes Citizen Kane a great achievement. But the film itself, which was incredibly innovative for its time, is just as innovative today, as there is meaning behind every frame. Whether you're watching the film to enjoy a good story or to study it, it never fails to satisfy. While Citizen Kane may be technically perfect, it does lack the emotional pull to make it truly perfect. Citizen Kane will probably remain the greatest achievement in the history of film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love movies. I love all kinds of movies. I am very open minded. I can get deep. I can get shallow. If I saw this movie without knowing it was the number one movie on the AFI list I would have been like "It was okay." But since I saw it knowing it was number one on the AFI list I have to say that it is probably one of the most horrible movies I have ever seen. Movies are supposed to be enjoyable. There are many ways for one to do so, but this found not a one. I had to watch it in school. I laughed to myself and out loud many times. I almost skipped going to class the next day to finish watching it. My teacher would explain why it was so great and I would be like "Yeah, he's right." Then I was like "What the hell am I talking about." If someone has to explain why a movie is so great, it shouldn't be number one On the AFI list. Then again, what do they know. This movie pulled no emotion out of me except laughter. I suggest you get in your car and take a nice drive on a road you've never been down. Come back home, take a nice hot bath. Slip into your robe, make some tea, toast a muffin, and eat it on the back patio while you watch the stars. Then go inside, get under the nice warm covers on your bed, and know that you did something many other movie wanna be directors have not. You experienced life for your movies instead of movies for your movies. My luck, no movie wanna be directors will read this. Anyways, rent it and decide for yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most innovative film ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw this film, I was impressed enough to buy it, and to invest in *The Citizen Kane Book* with the treatise Raising Kane by Pauline Kael, which I would highly recommend. The article goes into great detail on the making of the film, and of the time period it came out of.This film is great because of the innovations it made. No, it was not the first to use overlapping dialogue, or the first to use flashbacks to tell the story, or the first to use deep focus. But the way that Orson Welles used these innovations was innovative. Not only that, but the script, which is by Herman Mankiewicz and not Orson Welles, as many would believe, is superb, and was better in earlier drafts. Welles clearly deserves credit for his combining of great talent, in Mankiewicz, cinematographer Greg Toland, and his actors, and for his excellent acting as Kane. This is the best film I have seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perfection! Masterpiece! What more can you say about THE Citizen Kane. On my list as one of the best films of all time. The technical genius amazes me every time I watch it. No wonder this film is in every film class. Now I understand why some people do not like this film. These people do what I like to call "passive viewing". You can't just watch a film and give it the thumbs up or thumbs down. You must PAY ATTENTION to the details that make the movie. What makes this film so great is that Welles tells his story of the newspaper tycoon not only with words but with the camera. Every shot and person is framed accordingly for a specific reason. For example, in the famous scene where Kane's mother signs him away to Thatcher the banker Welles uses what is called a deep focus. The frame is set up so that from left to right it goes father, Kane, Thatcher, and Kane's mother. The brilliance is that Kane can be seen through the window of the shot in the foreground. The shot symbolises the struggle between kane's father and Kane's mother and Thatcher. Kane is in the middle of this outside not knowing that his future is being decided for him while his father fights for him to stay. Perfect deep focus shot showing the relationships and struggle over young Kane. This is just one example that you can say but you could analyse EVERY shot in the entire film and point out why it is so brilliant. I also enjoyed the beginning of the movie where it shows the trespassing sign and then the camera works its way up the fence dissolving from fence to fence. Then when you see the house a careful viewer would notice that as the house shots dissolve into closer shots of the house you would notice that the light on in the room never moves. The entire shot changes except that one window with the light on never moves. Not easy to do. The brilliance of the shots of the fence are that they really capture how empty and closed in he was. An active viewer would notice that these shots symbolises the "jail" that he built from himself. Look around the shot next time you watch. You will see so many things and if you think about you will understand the meaning. I think people don't enjoy this film because it requries something that most people don't like doing. This activity is THINKING!! People prefer movies that tell them how to feel and think. Film is art and can be entertainment. Citizen Kane is a masterpiece of artisic cinema. If you don't like Citizen Kane you just don't understand it and should go watch that new stupid movie with the cheerleaders. Bottom Line: Welles is GOD go see his other movies and appreciate his genius!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**Spoiler** (But everyone who knows anything about movies knows the end anyway)Since I'm all of 15, I can't begin to imagine what kind of impact Citizen Kane had on motion picture history at the time. Frankly, I can't see any clear reason why this is the 'finest motion picture ever made in America'. Nothing about this film holds up today. The 'ingenius' camera work is merely shining a bright light over someones head. What's the big deal? Someone explain it to me please! At no point in this movie was I moved to feel for Kane in any way shape or form. Wells script is merely an altered version of William Hearsts rise and fall. Even if it wasn't intended to be a movie of the week style exploitation, (you know the drill-'Citizen Kane: The William Randolph Hearst Story; Sunday at 9:00 on ABC) that certainly the way it looked to me. Nice plot twist at the end too. Rosebud was his long-lost SLED. Maybe if I didn't know the end before I watched it that would have seamed a clever way to symbolize his lost childhood. Or not.I'm just rambling, but someone please tell me what the big deal is with this movie? It's competing with "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" as the most over-rated movie I've ever seen.Go rent Casablanca, a true classic, instead of this sappy drama.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Regarding the content, "Citizen Kane" is quite dull, but the technical and narrative innovations Welles used in it are wonderful. Now, all those techniques are used by every Hollywood director, but in 1941, they were revolutionary. Orson Welles was a genius. He was even too smart for the average filmcrowd of that time. The viewers didn't understand the message Welles wanted to get across with his deep focus and his lightning mix. That's why, commercially speaking, the film wasn't a succes. Critics, however, saw that "Citizen Kane" was to become one of the greatest films ever made and I share their opinion. Orson Welles was a man who knew what influence a medium like cinema -or radio, remember "The War of the Worlds"?- could have on people. Now everybody knows and the issue is cliché, but back then, people didn't have the slightest idea. Except Welles, he knew.You might say that "Citizen Kane" isn't based on the life of W.R. Hearst -like Welles intended- but is kind of an autobiography.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eccentric and genius</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Orson Welles' classic film, Citizen Kane, still stands to be one of the finest in film history. It's influence has surpassed the influences of Gone With the Wind, Casablanca, Mr. Smith Goes To Washington, All Quiet On the Western Front, and possibly moreso than A Birth of a Nation. From Scorsese to Spielberg to Kubrick to Kurosawa to Coppola, it has influenced more filmmakers from across the world (or Hollywood at least) to not only make movies, but to make life... or at least have the ceilling be viewed in the shot. What I love about the screenplay is it never reveals what Kane's last word, "Rosebud", in dialogue. Now, I'm not going to say what "Rosebud" is, because I don't want to be chased by an angry mob of people just to be backed into a dark corner in a black alley and beaten senseless with baseball bats just because I gave away the big surprise ending. Hermann did a fantastic job in presenting the story on paper but Welles really worked the dialogue in the film. He shortened extended paragraphs into simple, catchy sentences. "People will think..." "What I tell them to think!" could have originally been something far more elaborate. Ah, but the direction is the true essence of the film's genius. It was presented like a painting by Leonardo da Vinci; it seemed so mathematical and so direct. Especially in my favorite scene in the film, when a drunk Leland (played with superbness by Joseph Cotten in what is possibly the film's best performance) and a sore loser Kane (coughAlGorecough) are talking in the newspaper building/campaigne HQ. The camera moves with them like it's doing a slow tango with the actors. This is the most unique film that I might ever see and the greatest that will ever be. It's the Dark Side of the Moon of motion pictures. Majestic yet sincere and pushed so many buttons that it even went beyond its own time. It's not just an example of amazing filmmaking, but it shows aspiring filmmakers how.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is one of the peaks of cinematography, a brilliant creation, a masterpiece beyond human understanding. In my list, this movie shares the first place with Godfather I, and I still do not love Citizen Kane as much as I do Godfather I, but then again, I love them on different levels. I am a fan of Godfather I. I know every little bit of trivia, I'm a fan of each actor, I have the three movies of VHS in a special version with interviews with the cast and crew and the such. Citizen Kane is just, in my book, a brilliant masterpiece that I watch whenever I get the chance. If you haven't seen it yet, you are missing half of motion picture history. If you have seen it, watch it again for you will only enjoy it more the other time. Welles's best work, topping The Magnificent Ambersons in my book, and a sheer piece of genius that will never be forgotten. If anyone will ever ask me to make a time capsule (and they do it every other day, of course), two ingredients inside will definetely be videos of Godfather I and Citizen Kane. A movie that has been considered a classic for almost 60 years and I'm certain it will last for another 60 (and more).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have never found anything wrong with Citizen Kane, nor have I tried hard to do so. A sour note of dialogue badly read, or an auteur quirk taken too far; both are so ostentatious in a film that they cannot be overlooked. So instead I compare Citizen Kane to itself -- a privilege I hold for very few films. Orson Welles and Joseph Cotten give excellent performances, but the character that I cannot resist is Everett Sloane's Bernstein. Bernstein is so consistent as a character I forget he isn't real. He is the source of humble wisdom as the manager of the New York Inquirer -- it is he who first suggests the most correct interpretation of 'Rosebud'.Then there is the camera work, the innovations that appear only in this one-film wonder. It doesn't take a trained eye to hold in awe the beginning of the film. Fades, montage, and actions reflected in a glass ball.Incredible stuff!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Greatest, plus the other 9.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Can there be any doubt that CITIZEN KANE is it? There have been critics who have called it the greatest "American sound" film of all time. Let me clear that up. As far as silent films go, there are a lot of great ones. The General, Nosferatu, The Iron Horse, Phantom of the Opera and Hunchback of Notre Dame come to mind. But all of them pale before Kane. When you turn to Foreign films, I'm sorry but none of them measure up either. Too many of them are culturally obscure, boringingly artistic or simply bad. There are great films made over seas, but again they fall far short of the pinnacle that is Kane. 2 centuries from now, Kane will be mentioned in the same breath as the Mona Lisa and Beethoven's Fifth. It is the very definition of the term "Classic." No other film has ever put together all of the bits and pieces that are needed to build a film in such perfect order as Kane. From Herrmann's score to the Welles/Mankiewicz script to Greg Toland's cinematography, this is an encyclopedia of film-making in one neat package. The number of people influenced by Kane since its release is incalculable, but evident in many films that have come opened after it. This film became Orson's curse. He never was able to duplicate it, and he was reviled/loved for not being able to do so. He is nonetheless one of the true geniuses of film history, ranking with Buster Keaton, Kubrick, Hitchcock and Kurosawa. It is to Hollywood's great shame that they never allowed Orson to get that close again. Their jealousy robbed us of who knows how many more films like Kane. THE TEN Greatest Films of all time: (In no particular order except #1)1] CITIZEN KANE 2] NORTH BY NORTHWEST 3] SEVEN SAMURAI 4] THE GENERAL- 1927 5] KING KONG 6] 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY 7] GONE WITH THE WIND 8] VERTIGO 9] SINGIN' IN THE RAIN 10] CASABLANCAAnyone who believes that Godfather I &amp; II or Raging Bull are anywhere near the top ten needs to see more movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Missing Link</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Citizen Kane is many things. It is the film cited as an example of perfect, visionary filmaking. It is the movie which has arguably changed filmmaking and film viewing more than almost any other. It is one of the few movies everyone must see to appreciate the art.But it is not the greatest film of all time. It is not the best. It is not the most lovedWhen asked what I believe is the greatest movie of all time, I simply say, "Not Citizen Kane" Why? I don't know. Personally I do not believe the greatest movie of all time has been made yet. Cinema is only a hundred years old and it, hopefully, has a long life ahead of it.We all know Citizen Kane. Even the unfortunate few who have not seen it know about it. I'm not going to bore anyone with the details of what makes this movie so great. In one sentance, however, it changed how filmmakers view filmmaking. It said that there were different ways to tell a story, to shoot a story. It bridged the films before it with the films made after it. Almost every movie that came after Kane have been influenced, directly or indirectly by it. It is also an example of a filmmaker, Orson Welles, having complete control over a film long before the rise of the independents. As a first time driector this was rare. And for Welles it never happened again in Hollywood.Kane is the missing link that ties the young, fledgling art of filmmaking to its more grown up version. It made sure that everyone knew that film, cinema, movies, was an art form, and not just some piece of whimsy.But there is a missing link in Citizen Kane as well. There is something lacking in the movie, something that just isn't there. It's got the drama, but it doesn't have.... .....heart? a soul? compassion?I don't think it is fair to say it doesn't have any of these. These do not make a movie good or bad. I think, instead the missing link in Citizen Kane is empathy. It is not something that Welles forgot to put in the movie, but something he intenionally removed. It is a connection between the audience and the film, in which by the end of the movie we feel closely related to the main character. But Charles Foster Kane is an ellusive, mysterious man. We can only see his life through the eyes of other people, none of whom understand him. Because of this, Kane is crafted as an enigma, a character with more questions about him than answers.Welles obviously wanted this to be the case. But that does not allow us, the audience, to really relate to him. We look at him under a microscope in a lab. Citizen Kane is a scientific experiment. It's a very good one, but still just an experiment.If you look at other Hollywood movies of the time, Wizard of Oz, Casablanca or It's a Wonderful Life, three of the most beloved movies ever, it is easy to make a distinction between them and Citizen Kane. All three were put together with less finesse or confidence then Citizen Kane, yet all three are cherished in a completely different way. If any of these movies are on TV, people seem to always switch the channel over. I don't know many who would watch Citizen Kane any old day of the week.Kane is an academic movie in many ways. Perhaps a bit too sterile, too aloof to be really loved. Many would call it the best movie ever, but not necessarily their favorite film. This is not bad, just a fact. I believe that Welles wanted Kane to be just a bit aloof, maybe not loved, but well respected, viewed more as a triumph of aesthetic and technical perfection then as a sentimental classic.</fullReview>

I also think that it is no secret that the picture should have received more Academy Awards.

		<fullReview>Citizen Kane is the film forever trotted out by America cineastes who want to prove that American films can hold their own against any other. Rubbish. Citizen Kane, in fact, elaborates the entire problem of American film - it's refusal to admit that it can ever really capture the whole of a man's life, even the meaning of that life. European films, Japanese films, and films from as far away as Argentina and India have been illuminating the depths of human souls for as long as films have been made. Hollywood would rather create special effects. They're a bit more expensive, but they don't require a whole lot of creativity and insight. As a superficial examination of the impossibility of illuminating the true character of a man, Citizen Kane is a masterpiece. But it is also a troubling forecast of the depthlessness of American film in general.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Citizen Kane is definitely one of the best movies ever made, but it should not be #1. The Godfather is the best movie ever made in my opinion. Anyway, Citizen Kane is still a very moving film with excellent cinematography and acting. The first 20-25 minutes of this film are kinda boring, but after that its very good entertainment. Orson Welle's masterpiece by far. 9/10 The Five Best Movies Ever Made are... 1.The Godfather 2. One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest 3. The Godfather Part II 4. Citizen Kane 5. Rain Man</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Citizen Rosebud</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like visiting the dentist Citizen Kane is one of those movies that should be seen at least once every year. And preferably on a big screen. It demands (and deserves) a level of concentration that television viewing seldom allows, and the rich photography of Greg Toland is best seen in a darkened cinema. I agree somewhat with those who claim that Citizen Kane has been ruined by the many accolades that have been poured over it, forcing us to take a stand on whether we agree that this is the best film ever made or not, rather than enjoying the experience of the movie itself. It has been subject to so much study, and is held forth as an example of so many different things in film-making that one approaches it almost with caution -again a bit like the dentist. But only if we can put aside all our knowledge of the film's history, its reception and controversies, and forget for a while how much it influenced American film-making, can we get to the underlying core of the film; and the myth of both Kane and Welles. For one cannot help but seeing Kane as at least a facet of Welles himself -he put not only his heart, his wit and his intelligence into the making of the film, but fed many of his subconscious fears and delights into the portrayal of Kane, and thus into the enigmatic aspects of the film. Much attention has been given to "Rosebud". Too much I think, for though the search for Rosebud is the initial and driving motive of the narrative, the film never properly focuses on why this is so important. In one sense the search for Rosebud is the "MacGuffin" of Citizen Kane -it serves only to bring the story forward. Kane's last word is "Rosebud", and the last image we see on screen is the peeling word "Rosebud" on the burning wood. Go back to the beginning of the film and the first word we hear is "Rosebud. So Rosebud is a starting point and ending both for Kane AND for the movie, but has little significance in the broader story of his life.Citizen Kane is not a film that engages the viewer emotionally, and is as such a very cold film. We have little sense of identification with any of the characters, and though we are treated to insights in certain facets of their characters, we are never given enough to really CARE about them. We see the characters rather as a scientist views his lab animals -interested but detached. None of the characters really reveal much about themselves, only their thoughts about Kane, and as such this is the main weakness of the film. Though seen in another light of course this could be regarded as one of its strengths. Welles glibly focused his attention on technical and narrative innovations rather than emotional studies which I suspect he was incapable of presenting truthfully at this time in his life. It is the showman Welles behind Citizen Kane, not the poet. But the show is so good that it becomes a poetry of its own, and though there is little passion in the way he presents his characters, there is true love in the shooting style of almost every frame. Kane and Welles the director share therefore the traits of being gifted, original and highly successful personalities yet aware of something unattainable on a human level. This is part of the true myth of Citizen Kane , and of the enigma of Orson Welles.The film is intriguing in style, mood, composition and structure and is in my opinion one of the very best made films of all time, but I cannot say with honesty that it is one of the best films ever made due to its emotional detachment. But perhaps when I see it again next year, I will think otherwise</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest films I've ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Citizen Kane has received many honors in the past, including the AFI's #1 American film award, which is a great honor. The camera shots in the movie are unique, and were brand-new techniques at the time of its filming. The cinematograhpy is beautiful and powerful and the camerawork is fantastic. For example, when Kane (Welles) becomes the rich and powerful mogul that he is in his later life, the camera shoots from under him, to make Kane look taller. When Kane was having an argument with his second wife, the camera shot from over her, to make her look smaller in his presence, giving Kane an aura of superiority. The story is sad but beautiful, and the acting is superb. This is a classic and shouldn't be missed by anyone mature enough to understand it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Rosebud" is the mournful, deathbed utterance of Charles Foster Kane (Orson Welles). "Can one word explain a man?" one reporter asks. This is what reporters intend to find out. The film is a jigsaw puzzle of Kane's life assembled piece by piece by those who "knew" him best so that everyone might learn what or who "Rosebud" is. The film's opening seems to suggest that this investigative intrusion into his personal past is not a place that should be trespassed upon. The cast is brilliant, especially Welles as the unfulfilled newspaper mogul. The story, scripted by Herman J. Mankiewicz and Welles, owes as much to the life of Welles himself as it does to yellow journalist William Randolph Hearst, its most obvious model. The film remains fascinating from start to finish, in viewing after viewing, in this, Welles' directorial debut. It is filled with innovative technique, symbolism, and powerful meaning and has solidified its place as one of the true masterpieces of cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Orson Wells was a mastermind! Nothing less could be said of him. The screen play was amazing! It looked deep into the life of a multi-millionaire newspaper owner, Charles Foster Kane, after his death. The goal for a newsreel reporter was to find the meaning of Kane's dying words, "Rosebud." In his search he discovers many opinions of Mr. Kane and the life that he led. He finds that Kane was never satisfied and always wanted more. It was an attempt to gain the life he knew as a child. Citizen Kane is considered by many to be the greatest film ever made, and I must agree completely. The technical work that went into the film was ground-breaking. At one point in production, Wells couldn't get a low enough angle for the shot he wanted so he cut out the floor of the studio a 4:30 in the morning. Wells had to have everything perfect for this picture. He certainly did. Citizen Kane IS the greatest movie ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is it just to use cinematography as the sole criterion for "best film of all time"?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Citizen Kane **? / 4This film is regarded by some as the greatest motion picture of all time. Most of these cite their one and only reason as its innovative and influential cinematography. This raises the question: is it just to use the latter as the sole criterion for stamping a film with the "all time best" label? A further question that may be raised: does a movie that is technically brilliant qualify as great without due regard given to its ability to entertain?Although the whole is greater than the sum of its parts and judging motion pictures is as subjective as it is objective and an art as much as an analysis, I'd like to identify several elements, which are universally considered to make a movie great: the enjoyment one is given by its plot, dialogue / script, musical score, depth of character, solid acting and directing, and cinematography.In my view, an all time best film must be outstanding in all of these; Citizen Kane was not. Its plot was overtly dull and unsophisticated: reporters review the boring life of an uninteresting man who rose to prosperity. Citizen Kane had no memorable dialogue whatsoever (compare it with "Casablanca" in this department); its script was nothing special. Its musical score was a far cry from the creative genius of someone like Ennio Morricone, Leonard Bernstein, or even John Williams. There was absolutely no depth of character in the film-none that appeared had any heart or appeal. Its acting was only satisfactory. Mind you, the actors did not have very difficult roles to play. Because of this, one could not direct praises towards the director who had an obviously unchallenging job. This leaves cinematography. Influential? Yes. Innovative? Yes. The greatest of all time? No. Even "Touch of Evil", another Orson Welles' classic (and much, much better than Citizen Kane), had far superior black and white photography and use of shadows.Does all of this mean that Citizen Kane was a bad film? No. Citizen Kane is an average film and, though overall boring, generally deserves a marginal "thumbs up".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most over rated movie of the 20th Century!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is supposed to be the best movie of all time. But it is not that at all. It is merely trying to show that rich capitalists (like Charles Kane) often live emotionally empty lives."Citizen Kane" didn't win the best film oscar in 1941, it lost to the much more entertaining "How Green was my Valley". "Citizen Kane" was poorly set out, one minute it's a documentary on Kane, the next minute you see flashbacks of his life. It is hard to follow at times, and unless you're willing to search for the much talked about 'powerful statement' of the film, you're bound to lose interest. It is not a film that anybody can enjoy and the message of the film doesn't come across as well as movies such as "Mr Smith Goes to Washington"."Citizen Kane" was in no way enjoyable, it was slow, background music was generally unsuited to the scenes, and, with a few exceptions, the acting wasn't very strong. Orson Welles' portrayal of a rich capitalist does give some credit to the film which has been over rated over the years, but the women he was connected to in the film poorly supported the leading character. "Citizen Kane" wasn't a powerful masterpiece like some have claimed, it wasn't the best movie of all time, and it doesn't deserve the adulation it receives!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greats...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film's greatness is everything that Hollywood has seemed to have forgotten these days. First of all, a great script. Very little can save a poor script, and great ones these days, with the exception of Good Will Hunting, are fairly rare these days. The script provides a framework from which a director and actors flesh things out, and Mankiewicz and Welles have provided just that. Secondly, great cinematic effects are used best when complementing and at the service of great filmmaking and a good story, not in place of it. The use of music overlapping scenes, the camera coming from the ground to give the illusion of size, and the track backwards from the young Kane to into the cabin are marvelous, and add a great sense of perspective and almost commentary on their respective scenes- and these are just two of many examples from the film. The reinvention in plot structure, something that's happened only once this decade, in another great film called Pulp Fiction. All of these elements combine to make an absolutely fascinating portrait of the rise and fall of an infamous, legendary man. Arguably the greatest film of all time, and definitely one of my favorites.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A powerful study of living just for the power that wealth can give you and ignoring the importance of interacting with people. Kane was shaped early in life when his mother had him adopted just so he could live a wealthy life. It was obvious that he preferred to stay where he felt love. The movie shows brilliantly the results of not being able to return love. As Kane's power grew he grew more distant in his relations with other people. In his first marriage he is shown in a very comfortable living area quite close to his wife. By late in his second marriage the scene shifts to a very cold, barren, cavernous room where Kane is at one end and his wife is by a fire at the other end. Finally at the end, his last word is "Rosebud." The one tie to when he felt something toward people as opposed to just wanting from people.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>CITIZEN KANE has been rumored to parallel the life of newspaper magnet WILLIAM RANDOLPH HURST. Whether this is true, remains to be seen, however, this is a good film. It follows the rise of a newspaper owner and his rise to national prominence and power, and his subsequent fall. ROSEBUD, is symbolic of the life he would have had,had he note chosen the route of wealth and power and stayed with his original mother, instead of allowing himself to be adopted. This is why ROSEBUD, plays such a prominent role in the opening of the film. What the film tells you by the end of the movie is that with all his wealth, and accomplishments, the one thing he truly lacked was love. It also says perhaps, the life of a "commoner" would have given him happiness; fame and wealth are not all they are cracked up to be. Fame and wealth can by you many things, however, they can't buy you happiness, friendship, or wealth. Despite all CITIZEN KANE'S material trappings, he never achieved this. In the film, he realizes this at his dying moment.</fullReview>

He eventually lost every thing he had. Both of his wives left him, lost all of his power he once had over people.The first 15 minutes of this film "News on the march" is the best opening scene in film hisory-one for the ages.

		<shortDescription>The Loss of Childhood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Rosebud" is the last word that is uttered by a rich but unhappy man. Then he dies and takes his secret into death: What is the meaning of "Rosebud"? An investigating committee is quickly installed that illuminates and unwinds his life once again, like in a time-lapse film. The tragical existence of the powerful newspaper tycoon Charles Foster Kane becomes visible, his solitude. Although married twice, he always stayed alone, because of his incapacity of feeling love, of giving love - a love related to somebody else but himself. All women finally leave him behind on his enormous mountain palace Xanadu, on which he sits enthroned high above all human beings, so high that he finds it impossible to get anywhere near them. A distant God, resident on earth, a symbol for the inability of Man to communicate with God, for God's unrelenting distance? Maybe we can also find that. But Charles Foster Kane has got a human touch, too. His life ends in failure, despite all the accumulated power and wealth. And the key to this failure might be found in childhood, or rather the loss of childhood.For only when being a child he felt safe, somewhere in the immensity of the American North, under the loving care of his mother - probably the only person in his entire life he was ever able to show feelings for. Then he becomes rich by accident, by some happy (or must we say unhappy?) constellation of parentage. He is hurled out his familiar surroundings, taken away from the protection of the snowy landscape - the kingdom of his childhood. However much he resists and clings to his modest wooden sledge, he irretrievably has to go out into the "big world", where he is raised, far away from his mother, and where he eventually builds up his empire. Of course, it is only a hollow construction and finally turns to dust. The wooden sledge, called "Rosebud", is taken away by the flames like all the other goods and possessions that he has accumulated in the course of time and which he has conserved in the wide chambers of his palace: souvenirs from his journeys, sculptures, vases or jewelry - things without a lasting value for posterity. Death sweeps it all away. And so, at the end of the film, you see nothing but an endless pillar of smoke, which is rising up into a darkly clouded sky, and in which everything definitely dissolves, our childhood, our memories, our entire life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Citizen Kane is overall a great movie for the time. It has great acting and shows how people really thought of Charles Foster Kane. The deeper issue in the movie is how the media can control what we think by printing anything they want to and we will believe them. This movie shows how the one man who was supposed to have everything actually was very unhappy and was always missing something. He tried to buy love and happiness but he never achieved either. He would have been happier if he would have been with his mother and father his whole life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>POSSIBLE SPOILERA lot has been said about this film, so my comments are pretty insignificant. I saw this movie in a film class, where we watched sections of it at a time. I was impressed, although when you get a bunch of immature students such as myself, together watching it, its inevitable that it becomes the butt of jokes, especially during the more surreal. You can appreciate this film even more when you compare it to other films of the time. Its use of camera angles, fade ins/outs, and shadows really stands out. The meaning of "Rosebud" was correctly guessed by at least a couple people in the class, and in retrospect it seems kind of obvious, so don't feel too proud of yourself if you guess it. One things for sure, it better than Titanic!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting bits.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having seen Citizen Kane almost two dozen times I have discovered a few interesting things about it. You may or may not have heard everything there is to be said about Citizen Kane's innovations--deep focus, low angles, most important American film ever made, and so forth. If not, one can easily discover these famous ideas so I won't restate them here. What follows instead is a list of fun things you can look for while viewing this landmark film.· The opening shots are of the Xanadu castle from different locations on the Xanadu grounds (actually all were paintings.). There is a light in one window. Notice that in each new shot, from a different angle, the castle is a little closer than in the one preceding and in each shot, the window is in the same position on the film frame, almost perfectly matching the shot before.· Joseph Cotton and Erskin Sanford are sitting in the back row of the projection room being extra "reporters" or "staff" when the "News on the March" newsreel ends. · There is very nearly one cut (the illusion of one cut, certainly) when Susan Alexander is first interviewed: shot of Susie on a poster; pan up over the roof; dolly forward through a "neon" sign; down through the rainy window; down to normal camera height; follow "Thompson" as he walks over to Susan; follow him as he sits down; rather long scene follows, then he gets back up; crosses the room to the phone booth. First cut is a reverse angle in the phone booth. The same thing is repeated for her second interview. There are many "long cuts" throughout the film where entire scenes are played in one cut. They're all interesting to watch but this one is really something.· Watch how seamlessly the transition goes from one scene to another as Ray Collins (Gettys) and Ruth Warwick (Emily) come out of Susan's apartment. Kane is shouting, "I'll send you to Sing Sing" and as the door closes his voice is covered by the sound of a car honking, street noise, a few words are exchanged, they leave, pan up to the number above the door and then there is an almost invisible dissolve to a picture of the same door in a picture in the paper and a news boy shouting "Read all about it", shot of Leland as he turns and walks back through a door into a bar, to get drunk.· The opera house opening night. The story is told from two different points of view. First Leland's, we see the confusion backstage and a front shot as the shadow of the curtain opens. Later the same story is told by Susan, same scene from the reverse angle. In the first one, the camera pans up through the fly system of an enormous theatre until we reach the stage hands holding their noses disapprovingly. This is actually series of paintings all flawlessly put together in the lab, using several traveling matte shots.· When they go on a picnic in the Everglades. There is a scene in the tent where Kane's makeup is many years older than the preceding and following scene.· When Susan Alexander leaves him, she walks across a terrace. The scene is a triple matte shot. In the background is an ocean/beach view. In the middle ground is the terrace. In the foreground for an instant is a screeching "parrot." You can see through the eye of the parrot.· In the scene where Kane destroyed Susan's room after she leaves, Welles cut his left hand pretty badly during the take and had to be taken to the doctor. When he comes up to the glass ball in close up at the end of the scene, he appears to hide his left hand (because he knows it was bleeding, perhaps.)· The film ends with a long shot on Xanadu. Black smoke is pouring out the chimney. This image is in a lot of Welles's films. See Mr. Arkadin or The Trial.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are those out there who do not like old movies period. I am not one of those people. Some of my favorite films are oldies; Gone With the Wind, Casablanca, etc. I try to give all movies a chance. I do not like to listen to reviews, I don't even read the back of the box because I think it gives too much away in the movie. I heard that AFI gave this the number one spot in the greatest films of all time. That is some title. I had to see this movie. I rented this film and watched it closely. After the first 45 minutes my mind raced. What in the world made this movie so good? I couldn't put my finger on it. This film, to me, was mediocre at best. It seemed like they tried to bore and confuse you as much as possible, and then they threw in this whole ROSEBUD deal. I wanted to turn this off after an hour, but thought that the movie would take off and it would be well worth it to stick around. It wasn't. I felt dumb. I thought I was the problem. I thought that I had missed something entirely. But then I thought if over and replayed a lot that went on in my head, and I realized that I just didn't like all that much. I do not have the foggiest idea why this movie is so great. I wish someone would tell me.I am planning on watching it again. There had to be something I missed. I really don't believe that all of these people can be wrong. All of these critics they praise this movie and say it's the best, they cannot all be wrong. I am a film buff and have been for many many years, and I have seen many many movies, but this one just doesn't live up to what everyone says.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The greatest film ever made??</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently viewed the film Citizen Kane in my Read-the-Movies course at school. I must admit that I had a difficult time staying alert during the duration of the film. I found the film, overall, to be awkward and much too lengthy. I did, however, appreciate the superb cinematography crafted by Orson Welles as well as the expertly woven web of themes that evolved. One theme that I identified throughout the film was LOVE. In the beginning of the film, Charles Foster Kane was a passionate newspaperman out to change the world. He showed a love of justice and honesty by promising his readers that his paper would report the news fully and responsibly. As the plot developed, this love became distorted and ugly. This distortion was also present in Kane's relationships with women. After divorcing his first wife, Kane married his second wife, Susan Alexander, but their love, too, was doomed. As their relationship digressed, Susan confronted Kane about his love of possessions and power over his love of people, as well as the fact that he wanted to be loved and possess other's love but was too selfish to give love to others. Although I found the film to be well crafted, I certainly would not rate it "the best film ever made."</fullReview>

He wrote, directed and starred. He was great and I love James Cotton also. They were also great in "The Third Man," a movie I think is equally as great as "Citizen Kane." I give this movie 3.67 out of 4 when I rate and a 9.25 out of 10. I do only wish more kids my age could enjoy this movie and at least experience, even though they probably won't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A reason for high ranking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's tough being number one, as this film is often ranked. Everyone likes to shoot at the top dog. But there is a test for the true movie fan.Is this a movie that draws you back into it, time and again? Do you go back, looking for something new? And why do you keep going back? It can only be because there are revelations each time you see it. There is always something fresh, something worth catching. It is true that this movie was filmed for a '40s film audience, but the best movies seem to lock themselves into a time and we have no problem realizing that. "Maltese Falcon" was a '40s detective drama and we know detectives today would use a different approach. But we enjoy that film for the very reason it gives us a definite view of the '40s detective and his work. And the story is compelling. The same is true for "Citizen Kane." We see the life story of a contemporary man of the '30s and '40s, and from that story we can realize that what he finally values, upon his death, is not much different that what we grow to value in our late years. We can relate to his memories of youth. Welles, though a young man when he made 'Kane,' found the essence of life and magnified it on the screen. The acting is efficient, the setting is bigger than life, the use of the camera is innovative and still imitated, the story telling is timeless. Even "Pulp Fiction," which I consider to be the best film of the '90s, owes some debt to the story telling of "Citizen Kane." There have been many great films made since this one, but it was ground-breaking, and it remains fresh even though the plot is stuck in time.Does it deserve to be call "the greatest film ever"? Why not? It deserves the honor as much as any film made before or since. Watch it again and see if you do not agree.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A personal look at the film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's plenty of backlash against what's usually called "the best film ever made". Some critics have suggested that it's a cold film, merely expressive of Orson Welles' ego; others (an admitted minority) have basically asked what's so great about it, beyond its technical wonders. Perhaps two personal comments will show you where I stand, and why:1. The first time I ever saw Citizen Kane, I was 13 or 14 and knew nothing about it, except that it was "about newspapers" (and I was interested in journalism) and had in its cast Endora from Bewitched. I watched it on TV, and when it was over, I turned to my mother, who'd been puttering about, and said "that must be the best movie I've ever seen."2. I have probably lived my life by the maxim expressed at one point in the film: "There's no trick to making a lot of money...if all you want to do is make a lot of money." (I may have gotten a word or two wrong.) Well, that's not at all what I wanted to do with my life...and I certainly haven't made a lot of money!Citizen Kane is more than Orson Welles' ego. I agree that it is the best film ever made...and it is certainly one of my very favorites. I hope it's one of yours, too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(78%) A film that you've seen referenced more times than your're probably even aware. So ignoring most of the influence and admiration that surrounds this, how exactly does a film often regarded as one of the greatest ever actually stack up? Well it's certainly an ambitious film with hardly a single second wasted in expressing its tale of a super wealthy tycoon, which for me at least is a perfect message of the actual reality of riches and success; that truth be told the pursuit of wealth and influence is in a way a con. This is a film that's very much of its time, yet it still has this timeless feel to it, mainly because it tells its tale so well. The second half of the film is as near perfect conclusion as you'll ever likely get from any film, the direction was way ahead of its time, and there's a great sense of sadness that runs through almost everything that still holds up even today. This honestly is not one of my personal favourite films ever, not sure exactly why it just isn't, but as far as a classic films go this is indeed a must watch that should be tracked down by all true cinema fans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having watched Alfred Hitchcock's 'Shadow Of A Doubt' just yesterday, then viewing 'CK' today - both of which star Joseph Cotten - I was struck that these were two distinctly different genres. However, for me, what makes a film is how it engages with the viewer, and for me, there is no comparison between the two. That is to say I was underwhelmed with 'CK' and it just didn't engage me. That is not to say that there are not some very nice set pieces of cinematography in it. I would imagine that, back in 1941, this was so different to anything out there that it was regarded as quite groundbreaking. But in fact, I actually prefer Welles's 'Touch Of Evil' (reconstructed version) to 'CK', however that's only my opinion.In summary I would say, rather than being influenced by top 100 film lists and getting enticed into the whole 'rosebud' PR stunt, watch what Hitchcock described as his own favourite film i.e. 'Shadow Of A Doubt'.

		<fullReview>Citizen Kane is a masterpiece of a film for its artistic aspects as well as its story. The story in short, is about a group of reporters trying to find out what Charles Foster Kane's last word were. This film was directed by Orson Welles and was his first film. throughout the film Welles had a lot of power over the movie, he was given full artistic freedom over the film. Charles Foster the main character is said to have been a portrayal of an actual newspaper journalist William Randolf Hurst, which was another reason the film stirred a little controversy. The film is also said to be way ahead of its time when it comes cinematography, Welles utilized many low angle shots, extreme close ups and long uninterrupted shots.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rosebud</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Kane first meets Susan Alexander he says he is on his way to (or coming from? I don't recall which) a warehouse where his childhood belongings are stored which he has not seen in many years. He doesn't mention the sled, but presumably that is the one thing which drew him to the warehouse. Kane is splashed and Susan laughs at him and one things leads to another. But my point is this: Kane would never have met Susan but for Rosebud. If Kane never met Susan he would never have been caught in the "love nest" with her and lost the election for governor. Kane might have had another mistress, but this seems unlikely. Kane is not very interested in sex - perhaps because he feels he is making love to the whole world. His interest in Susan is primarily idealized and not physical. So but for the meeting Susan, Kane would likely not have had a scandal and would have been elected governor. We are told he would then have almost certainly been elected President. Also he would not have lost his wife and his son would not have been killed in the car accident. As President, Kane could have been the most powerful man in the world. Instead he loses this chance, loses his wife and loses his son - all because he happened to be on a certain street at a certain moment. And the reason he was on that street at that moment was Rosebud!So maybe when Kane says "Rosebud" he is not thinking of when he was a carefree lad playing in the snow. Maybe he realizes that because of Rosebud his whole life went spinning in a completely different direction from what it otherwise would have taken. By pure accident Rosebud ruined his life and shut him off forever from everything he otherwise could have been and could have accomplished. And maybe that is why "Rosebud" is the last word he speaks.</fullReview>

As the movie progresses the viewers are join the shadow-faced reporter, Thompson and go more in depth into Kane's life through multiple interviews, trying to find the hidden meaning or message of Kane's last words, Rosebud. This great film brings together good acting and believable conversations. With an exciting story and many characters to follow as more and more things get complex in hi life. This film is wonderfully filmed. The high point to me is the character of Thompson. You, the viewer, rarely see his face fully, whether he has his back o the audience or because the light is barely shown on his face, leaving it covered in shadows.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Charles Foster Kane is his last moments says his last word "Rosebud", the newspapers aims to find the meaning of that word and interviews Kanes former associates, friends, wife and his butler tells the story of Charles Foster Kane in their own perspective.The movie starts with a narrator who tells the quick story in less than 13 minutes about Charles Kane, but we know more of Kanes life in the flashback which are the interview which I above mentioned, Charles is clearly a man of his obsession and he never backs out from any fight, maybe the big reason of this is cause when his parents abandon him and he realizes that things can never stay with you forever. This is a great movie, I wanted to see this one for a very long time though its old but it sure is a classic. The dialogues I consider is great and couldn't be better, the acting is also very impressive specially of Kane (Orson Welles) which according to me portrays the role in a mesmerizing manner, the cinematography that how the movie is told and we came to know more and more about Kanes life is amazing, this movie is a one of its kind.This is a must watch movie, if you are a movie lover than you must watch this EPIC movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Citizen Kane (1941)was directed and starred Orson Welles'; along with Dorothy Comingore and Joseph Cotton.The film is in black in white. The lighting was in the film was very dark at times. The movie expresses the life and legacy of Charles Forster Kane, a wealthy newspaper publisher. Thompson, reporter is sent out to find the meaning behind "rosebud" and why was it said during Kane's final moments.We learn that Kane married and had a son, with Emily. He then has an affair with Susan. When Emily finds out about the affair. her and Kane divorce. Two years after Kane's divorce to Emily; Emily and Kane's son both die in a plan crash. Kane then remarries Susan. Susan is pushed into a singer career, which results in a depression and attempted suicide.At the end, its revealed what "Rosebud" represents.

		<fullReview>CITIZEN KANE isn't a bad film, per se; it's quite watchable, with some engaging characters and a storyline that keeps you guessing. The mystery angle of the narrative is interesting enough to sustain the viewer's interest despite the relatively slow pacing. But after watching it, I was left thinking, "Is that it?" and "What's all the fuss about?".It's a common problem when viewers are first exposed to movies regarded as classics by those who profess themselves to be in the know, and one I've experienced before. Because CITIZEN KANE doesn't anywhere near feel like it deserves its one-time reputation as the greatest film ever made. It's watchable, but it's not even a film I'd want to watch a second time, now I know what happens. I was looking for extra meaning, for something, but it all feels quite limited and even a little hollow.Orson Welles' celebrated stylistic flourishes only really occur in the opening and closing parts of the movie, while the central part of the film is quite ordinary. It's good to see the reliable Joseph Cotten in a strong supporting role, but the female characters are overly given to histrionics and there just isn't enough depth for my liking. There's none of the suspense that Hitchcock would have brought to the table, either, leaving me feeling more than a little disappointed in a film which is nothing like it's supposed to be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While attending film school I had heard many people talk about Citizen Kane as a fantastic movie. Finally, I took the time to sit down and watch it while taking notes.Everything in this movie is planned out, and you could watch it scene by scene and break down everything that is happening and is telling the story without actually having to tell you. The use of graphic weight was well executed, from how much of the screen a character took up (showing who is in power (Tallest is usually in control of whatever situation)), to the eyelines of the characters drawing your attention to exactly where you need to look. I could go on about this movie, but sadly I left my notes at home and will have to revisit this review at a later point.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maybe the most important movie in American cinema. The whole style, the camera angels, everything seems way different from the movies of the '40s or the '50s or even the '60. The influence of this movie stands until our days. The story is very strong too. The rise and fall of one man finds here it's cinematic peak. All the movies that tried something similar later, from "The Giant" to "There Will Be Blood" had to face Citizen Kane. I'm sure most of the big directors watch it several times in their lives. It hasn't lost anything over the years and I believe everyone can watch and enjoy this movie today. I first saw it 10 years ago. I didn't knew much about Orson Welles at the time. I watched many old movies that critics consider big masterpieces and classics but not many of those had the same impact on me as Citizen Kane did at that time in my life. It was a small shock and a wake up call for me as a cinefil. Maybe I didn't fully realize it then, but it was after this movie that I started paying attention to the director of each film. Nobody can call himself a big cinefil if he hasn't see Citizen Kane.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The American Film Institute has twice named Citizen Kane the greatest movie of all time. Gawd, pressure movie-lovers much lately?! What do you tell people if you DON'T like Citizen Kane? You're gonna sound as lame as Susan Alexander singing opera. Lucky for me, I dig this movie much. It's definitely in my own Top 10 (not #1, but it's certainly in a place of honour) and part of the reason I enjoy it is because it ISN'T the hard work you might expect when it's the "best movie evarrr".What this movie does best is tell a story of a rich man who wanted everything he didn't have. Since he had everything except bonafide love, he truly wasn't---unlike Jimmy Stewart in It's A Wonderful Life--- the richest man in town. He filled his sled-less life with statues, newspapers, giant houses, and a marriage to an untalented dimwit. But we've all made those mistakes. Most of us just don't act like megalomaniacs of Rupert Murdochian proportions along the way. And we tend to avoid cryptic words like "Rosebud" with our dying breath. Most of us would just admit, "I miss my sled."Orson Welles wrote, directed, produced and stars in Citizen Kane, making the single greatest debut in cinema history. His cast (comprised mostly of New York theatre buddies) matches him step for step and Welles' collaborators behind the camera are wonderful too. Was there a better cameraman in old Hollywood than Gregg Toland? None of that would matter, however, if the script by Welles and Herman Mankiewicz wasn't so fantabulous. In summary, as the pull quote on the original poster says, "it's terrific!"If you dug this snapshot review, check out the website I share with my wife (www.top100project.com) and go to the "Podcasts" section for our 78-minute 2-part Citizen Kane 'cast?and many others.

		<fullReview>Even if this movie doesn't look interesting to you, I highly recommend seeing it. This movie I consider the best ever made. The story goes like this.... the movie opens with Mr. Kane's dying with the last word he utters "Rosebud". Later everyone tries to find out what exactly Rosebud meant. People go around asking people about Mr. Kane's life and we see it through many other people's eyes. I love how we see Mr. Kane's life through other people's eyes! This movie has arguably has the tightest screenplay in film history not to mention having a great script. Plus the ending has a twist and is extremely satisfying. The Gothic architecture and cinematography is fantastic. Everything shot is dark and has shadows. The movie gives you a great moral telling you that money can't buy you happiness. This was Orson Welles best movie and his first! I'm just flat out impressed this was his first movie, it's fitting that one of the greatest directors ever's first move was one of the best ever. This movie really inspired me to love movies! There's a reason why this is in so many of the best movie directors favorite film lists such as Stanley Kubrick, Martin Scorsese, and Steven Spielberg! This is one of my favorite movies ever and continues to inspire people and be praised today.P.S. I wrote this view on another website and decided to post it on IMDb</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Personal View of Citizen Kane</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What can be said about Citizen Kane (1941) that hasn't already been said? Sights and Sounds magazine came out with its decennium list of best films ever and for 50 years gave Citizen Kane top prize. Last year Citizen Kane was relegated to the number two spot by the Alfred Hitchcock classic Vertigo (1958). Previously anyone worth their stuff would have to admit that Kane is at least among the best movies to ever exist. So to spell it out, even with some light bruising, Orson Welles's freshman feature has some high expectations to overcome.I won't justify the critics by writing a manifesto on its artistic value. There are too many essays out there already who have done that in the past seventy years. Besides which, despite my enthusiasm for film and film history, I am by no means an expert. Therefore my "academic" justifications would seem disingenuous and misleading. Instead I will be introspective and give you my person reasons why Citizen Kane is, to me, one of the best movies ever committed to celluloid.My interest in Citizen Kane peaked when I was in my late teens. This is when I started to take film seriously for its social and artistic value. Citizen Kane has appeared on multiple lists of important movies and therefore I was simultaneously intrigued and intimidated by the thought of watching it. After all the works of Federico Fellini and Robert Altman are for the most part plebeian to me despite being universally acclaimed. I have no serious means to justify my reasons for disliking Altman or Fellini so if I was not a fan of Welles I was clearly an unlearned philistine.Strangely enough I was compelled to watch Citizen Kane only after watching Reefer Madness: the Movie Musical (2005). The Showtime original feature made veiled references to William Randolph Hearst; the larger than life newspaper tycoon who became the inspiration for Charles Foster Kane. I knew that Kane didn't exactly glorify the man so the scales were tipped and I rented it.The first five minutes of the movie I had to remind myself I was watching something made in 1941. The use of shadows, mirrors and the assortment of camera techniques could easily fit into a modern Hollywood thriller. Cinematographer Gregg Toland used deep-focus camera techniques to fixate on both Charles Foster Kane and the space in which he inhabits. The technique was used extensively during the last act to create a sense of eerie emptiness, whereby Kane's world was enveloping him.Deep-focus cinematography is just one of the many reasons Citizen Kane is from a technical standpoint near perfect. The story switches back and fourth between flashbacks, told from a myriad of different people. Their opinions effect the overall impression the audience gets of Kane and as a result, we cannot truly believe everything they say. Kane is seen as warm and brash in one flashback, then seen as cold and distant in another. What results is a movie whose central character leaves you with more questions than answers.I suppose the movie's enigmatic tone is what interests me the most about the film; along with its brazen political underpinnings. It was pretty clear upon release that Citizen Kane was a film a clef, and William Randolph Hearst who wasn't exactly pleased by its release. He accused Orson Welles of being a communist and according to legend Hearst arranged for a naked woman to jump into Orson Welles's arms when he entered his hotel room in New York. There would also be a photographer in the room to take a picture that would be used to discredit him. Welles stayed away from his hotel room that night so its unknown whether this is true.What was true was Hearst may have sunk the film. It was a financial dud for RKO films and it would only go on to win a single Oscar for best screenplay. Welles would go on to direct a hand-full of American films before settling in France, however his autonomy was compromised. He would never have complete artistic control for a major studio financed film again. This is not to say his other American films; The Lady from Shanghai (1947), Touch of Evil (1958), and The Stranger (1946) weren't excellent. But if Welles had more freedom to do what he wanted, he might have had more than just Citizen Kane and The Trial (1962) to brag about.While I could go on and on about the brilliance of Citizen Kane, the best way I can summarize it is to say that among the list of movies accredited as "the best ever," Citizen Kane is among the least overrated. The plot is great, the story structure is great, the artistry is great; everything about it is great. The best? Well that's ultimately up to you.http://theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The BEST movie ever made??? Well, I'm not sure, but at least is one of them!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many critics today consider this the best movie ever made in the history of cinema. This statement has led many people today think the film is very overrated. Which statement is the right one it is impossible to say, but I think I can understand both opinions."Citizen Kane" begins after the death of the journalism magnate Charles Foster Kane (Orson Welles), who moments before dying uttered the word "Rosebud". Days after of journalism hype over the news of his death, the journalist Jerry Thompson (William Alland) is sent by his boss to investigate the life of Kane, in order to discover the meaning of his last word, in which no one knows. Then he begins to interview all living people who knew and met Kane. Going from his best friend Jedediah Leland (Joseph Cotten); his secretary Bernstein (Everett Sloane); the 2nd ex-wife Susan Alexander Kane (Dorothy Comingore). The journalist begins to discover that he plunged into the life of a lonely man who from childhood is obliged to follow the will of others. Nobody around Kane cared about him, and then he began looking through the acquisition of things the worship from the people, but it all led to his tragic and painful end.Many said at the time that Orson Welles (who also directed and wrote the film) based the life of Kane on a real tycoon from journalism William Randolph Hearst. Welles at the time denied such claims publicly, especially after Hearst negatively criticized the film saying it would denigrate his image. But the comparisons are almost obvious: Hearst was known to have transformed the simple New York Morning Journal to a sensationalistic newspaper (buy news from other newspapers or invent them) the same thing Kane did with the newspaper "Inmaker"; Hearst built a castle with his name, the Hearst castle in Florida, and Kane made "Xanadu" in the Gulf of Mexico, both Hearst and Kane had nationalists and communists concepts (they were part of a political party but then denounced them).The critics doesn't idolize this movie for nothing. Mainly because it is WAY ahead of its time, to imitate the life of a tycoon on a fiction film was almost crime at the time, but not only that. Welles gives the film a magnificent direction with gigantic footage such filming today require multiple cameras (more than 20) and at the time they used a very limited number (less than 5). Including a amazing photography and beautiful cinematographic with spectacular scenery.Not only in direction but Welles gives the film one of the best screenplays ever written, primarily because it can be smart and fun giving a modern language and humorous moments. But above all, gives a timeless narrative to the history, that is, it doesn't follow a single timeline, going back and forward to the past and the future all the time telling pieces of Kane's life from childhood to the arrival to wealth. This technique was very advanced and almost impossible to do at the time. And along the incredible story of Charles Kane, the film uses elements of politics, romance, and even musical. And for several moments, it critiques the rich society and American politics (another thing that at the time was almost a crime).But of course, today many people will find problems in the film compared to today films. It is almost inevitable a film having problems, and "Kane" is no exception of this. The main problem is with so many characters in the film, somehow it fails in making us care about them (except for Kane), but once again we have to have in consideration the constraints of the script and cast at the time.Speaking of cast, that was also a great revolution. All actors were newcomers, making their first appearances in movies. Not only this fact, but also the fact that they are all extraordinary. Since Joseph Cotten and Dorothy Comingore simply superb, but who stands out is Welles himself. He in their 20s, considered the wonder boy, then took his skills as an theater actor and radio announcer and not only give a excellent directing and writing to the film but also a magnificent performance from start to finish.People have to take in consideration the time that the film was made and not criticize it comparison to today. Early there, it was the beginning of the 2nd world war with much of the economy focused on armaments, Orson Welles with a magnificent direction, superb script and splendid performance managed to make a mark in the history of cinema that should be remembered forever! 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yet another middle-aged man gone ROSEBUD-CRAZY</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Quite a few "Citizen Kane" fans now know, that the word 'rosebud' was a clever inside joke on the part of screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz (and Orson Welles), because it was a nickname William Randolph Hearst used for his high-profile public mistress, the hot and juicy Marion Davies (the nickname being a descriptive term for a part of the female anatomy). It's my understanding they'd have known this because Hearst referred to Ms. Davies by this nickname in front of others (and to what must have been the embarrassment of these friends, who might also be gossipers).Who can say for sure whether this is true, but I believe it.Because it makes the story of "Citizen Kane" more coherent and focused, when you consider that it is largely about a great and influential man who throws away all the goods things he has, simply because he's middle-aged crazy for a young juicy blonde.And so now for me the central and key scene of the movie is where Kane has been confronted by his wife about his mistress (thanks to the hardball-playing Governor), he's caught in the "love nest" with the juicy young blonde... and what does he do, he throws everything away, a good and beautiful wife, a promising political career, and ultimately the respect and friendship of his closest friend, all because he's middle-aged crazy and foolish for ROSEBUD.Another scene which now has a different significance I think, is the one in the screening room, where the producer of the newsreel charges the reporter with finding out what 'rosebud' means, saying "it'll probably turn out to be a very simple thing..."And then immediately a FLASH OF LIGHTNING, showing Susan Alexander's face.Anyway, no doubt about it, an amazing film to watch, containing many other insights too, such as a scathing (but true) critique of Hearst's manipulative use of the powerful capital of a newspaper.And even if you don't think that Susan Alexander is Rosebud, it's still a real and common thing, many men, especially men of "money and property" (because of the greater independence and luxury it grants them), throw away everything at the onset of middle-age, in a mad and foolish and ridiculous pursuit of young juicy snatch.Two things though: one, I don't know if it ever has anything to do with the man's mother, or his childhood, or least of all any toys he had as a boy... and two, it usually doesn't result in a movie made about the man (and his high-profile public mistress), let alone one that film critics consistently rate as perhaps the greatest ever made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There will always be debate on where this film ranks all-time. It is not my personal favorite film, but I think it is one of the greatest films ever made. Why? Orson Welles. He wrote, directed, and produced the film. Oh, and he starred in it. At the time, it was not as common to direct and star in a movie. Did I mention he was only 25 years old when he did this?Is it a perfect film? Hardly. But it's not far off, either. I do not know of a single film that can be honestly called "perfect." Start by looking at the Goofs page because that needs to be empty for a film to be truly perfect.For people who want action movies or comedies, they will find Citizen Kane boring. If you prefer deep characters and, honestly, older dramas, I doubt you would come away from this film thinking it was a waste of your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A "Rosebud" By Any Other Name Would Smell/Look/Taste So Sweet?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was screenwriter Herman Mankiewicz's loathing and hatred of both William Randolph Hearst and Marion Davies (fuelled by Orson Welles) that brought Citizen Kane to the silver screen.Though it was a very thinly disguised story about Hearst and Davies, this film's underlying viciousness hit so far below the belt that, not only did it portray Hearst as being a pathetic, lonely, ego-centric hoarder and Davies as a nagging, gold-digging, no-talent singer/actress, but it also revealed to the whole world the word "Rosebud"."Rosebud", which was the final word uttered by Charles Foster Kane, on his death-bed, wasn't (in reality) the name of a wooden sleigh that he had cherished so much as a child. No. "Rosebud" was actually, in reality, Hearst's pet-name for his mistress's (Marion Davies) clitoris. (It's true. Look it up)And, of course, the biggest problem with Citizen Kane was that its whole story was literally based on this one, single word "Rosebud".With most people (back in 1941, and even now) not knowing the real meaning behind this word (it was a Hollywood in-joke), the viewer is forced to have to endure hearing it being spoken umpteen times throughout the course of this 2-hour picture.Since I am hip (and, so now, you are, too) that "Rosebud" really meant Davies' clitoris, I can't begin to tell you how tired I got of hearing that word being spoken by actors who were obviously doing a very good job of concealing their smirks whenever they were required to repeat it.Knowing the truth about the meaning behind "Rosebud", I think that this truly renders Citizen Kane as being one of the nastiest, most vile "revenge-movies" ever made against 2 very real people (who were both still living at the time) that I've ever seen.I can't think of another movie out there that goes so out of its way to make such a sneering mockery of 2 people (in this case Hearst and Davies). Its 2 screenwriters (Welles and Mankiewicz) and its director (Welles again) clearly showed how much deep-rooted contempt that they held for these 2 people, whom they only slightly knew.And what really surprises me about Citizen Kane is that so many people have fallen all over themselves, claiming it to be one of the very best movies ever made.I know that this is one of those movies that one's not allowed to dislike. But, hey, there's nothing wrong with someone just because they say that they don't like it.I'll honestly tell you that, aside from some interesting camera shots, and some massive sets, and its big-budget production values, I found Citizen Kane to be really something of a bore and, nope, it actually doesn't hold up very well, 72 years later.*A brief note about screenwriter Herman Mankiewicz* - For most of his adult life he was a miserable drunk (of the mouthy, belligerent kind). During his years in Hollywood (beginning in 1926) he managed to make a lot of enemies and alienate scores of celebrities with his drunken antagonism, including the likes of William Hearst and Marion Davies.Mankiewicz died in 1953 at the age of 55 from cirrhosis of the liver (a disease caused by alcoholism).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is art! The combination of photography, metaphors, dialog, acting, and art bring together a great film. The movie emphasized power a lot. Power was emphasized when he trashed the room. And also the scene of the fireplace in his big mansion. The power that he had in the city, state, and the world was emphasized in that scene. The fact that he died saying the one word that meant so much to him, but meant nothing to the people around him (or who once thought they knew him) struck a sense of empowerment. The camera-work that was done in this film was very impressive. The dark shadows on the reporter, to have the audience know that even though the reporter was one of the main characters, he wasn't as important as Mr. Kane. That went for all the characters in that film. The production really emphasized the power that each character held. It was not meant to get mixed up nor confused.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>www.TheMovieFrog.com Classic Cinema Series #2 - Citizen Kane #2Starting a review for Citizen Kane feels a lot like starting a review for Casablanca did. What am I going to say about the film Roger Ebert has dubbed "the greatest of all time" that hasn't been said before? EVERYONE knows that this is one of the most innovative and masterfully constructed movies ever told. It was drastically ahead of its time in terms of cinematography, editing, sound design, you name it. But we all knew these things long before I started this article.I could certainly write a whole review about the acting, so naturalistic and understated for a picture of the time period. Welles is a revelation as Kane, with this marvelously smug yet confidential line delivery like he's talking down to you and honoring you with a secret wisdom at the same time. Agnes Moorehead is positively creepy as the loving mother who has completely turned her emotions off in order to do what's best for her son. Dorothy Comingore absolutely blows me away as Susan Alexander Kane, probably the most fully realized character not featured in the title. Everett Sloane as Mr. Bernstein, George Coulouris as Walter Parks Thatcher, the movie is full of great performances. Again...we knew this going in.I could speak at great length about the film's groundbreaking narrative structure. We begin with the end of the story, then we get a brief overview that lays the ground work for the sub plot that creates the structure for the rest of the movie. Then we see different, shifting periods in Kane's life through the eyes of several different characters who all have their own take on who the man was. This may not seem so significant in an age where film makers like Nolan and Tarantino regularly turn chronology on its head, but these men owe a huge debt to Welles for showing them how it is done long before they were born. But...we knew this.I could write a piece in which the central point is that Citizen Kane is one of the most quietly busy films ever made, rife with symbolism. In the opening scene alone, we are treated to images of snow super-imposed over Kane's face symbolic of both an ending, and the story's beginning (which we don't know yet). We see the snow globe shatter, as Kane lets go of his... (continued at www.TheMovieFrog.com)</fullReview>

A film that can explain the entire film in just one shot, and that shot addressing so many dimensions is something I had not seen often to this age, let alone 1941!!!Truly goes to show the amazing vision of the director. One shot not only solving the mystery but also giving us a deeper insight into the inner problems of Mr Kane and what he was actually striving for life, in the process revealing the intricate hidden subtleties that one fails to recognize and see in our own lives!! Truly shows the supreme control of the director on the film who is confident of his skills. A perfect exemplification of the power of final cut privilege in cinema.

		<fullReview>I saw the movie on DVD and again with commentary by Roger Ebert. It is rated as the number 1 movie in the AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies list.Orson Wells, child prodigy and coming after his War of the Worlds stunt was given a free hand with this film, his first director role. So it had a lot to live up to. Failed at the box office, but later rediscovered, the film experienced a revival. The story was supposedly based on Hearst, a media Baron (although this was denied by Wells). Hearst went to some lengths to try and ban the film.Looking at it now, it is very dated. It does make some very telling points about human nature and the newspaper business. But I cant help but feel Wells tries too hard at being ground breaking, both in choice of a controversial story and in its cinematography. While the film was ground breaking, I didn't find it was a particularly entertaining film at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Technically this film is a beautiful masterpiece of camera work and lighting that is incomparable to many movies of the time. but really the plot is slow movie and is quite frankly boring compared to other works of the time and can be summed up quite simply as the story of a man who lost his happiness and could never find it. This is a prime example of a movie being over hyped and built up by to many people making disappointing when watched by someone expecting the best movie ever. This movie has left me and most likely many others feeling like we were not watching the same movie that so many people praise. Not good for a movie that many people consider one of the best movies ever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Weaknesses in its Plot Fail to Impress</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>i understand why this movie is considered as the forefather of the cinematographic techniques and movie-making used nowadays, and how phenomenal it must have been during its time ( and still is among many to be considered among the top movies of all time) However few things are certain in my point of view: cinematography breakthrough does not qualify a movie to be better than others, lavish props and good acting performances by unknown cast does not make one movie great either...the fundamental issue with citizen kane, despite all of that, is that this movie is still disturbingly normal as any other, however new or old -- with plot and character development so uninspiring, conventional and at times predictable (how many times a story of a rich tycoon's demise has been recycled?) -- and hence fail to impress. Best movie of all time? Far from it in my list. Citizen Kane only appears to me as having great outer beauty but lacking the brains to carve out inner impression. In fact there are other classic movies i can think of which are much more memorable than this one, and there are very recent movies with equally phenomenal cinematographic breakthroughs and yet superior in the sense of the inner beauty as compared to citizen kane.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Perfect Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Citizen Kane, 1941When I first saw this film, it was back in my 10th grade Journalism class - pretty fitting due to the content of the film. When our teacher asked, "What is considered the number one film in the history of American movies?", different answers floated around, but no one in class had heard of Citizen Kane. Surprised by this, our teacher played us the film and following the showing, 90% of the students in my class hated it. Said it was boring. Said they didn't get it. Said they didn't understand why it was the best film. Personally, at the time, I enjoyed it. I thought it had a good story, a great leading actor in Welles, and some cool tricks of the camera. It wasn't till the fourth or fifth time that I really saw the films true beauty and understood why it was such an iconic, classic movie.Citizen Kane is a flawless film. Genius director Orson Welles' debut picture was arguably the greatest film in the history of cinema. Given complete freedom to write, direct, and act by major studio RKO, Welles certainly made his mark in Hollywood with this unbelievably beautiful picture. Welles' style and innovative techniques really shine here and completely revolutionized the future of filmmaking for all movies after it. As an aspiring director and writer, this is a pivotal staple in the history of classic films and one that I could watch endlessly just trying to analyze every shot. It truly is an amazing movie.Everyone should see this movie if you want to see filmmaking at its best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best movie of all time (according to the one and only Reilly Madison)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ignore the 800,000 people that voted for Shawshank Redemption as the greatest movie of all time. Citizen Kane trumps it because Reilly Madison says so. According to the great and powerful Reilly, Citizen Kane is the greatest film to ever hit the big screens. Not because f the phenomenal acting and not because of the fantastic rating that the 150,000 users gave it. No, it is simply the greatest film of all time because... he says so.See, if Reilly says the sky is "brick red", the sky is indeed "brick red". If Reilly says that Bill Wennington was the reason that the 90's Bulls were as good as they were, then Bill Wennington has a spot reserved in the HOF. I'd like to take this time to thank Reilly for all that he has done for me.I'm privileged to have met such a stunning person (both inside and out) and I can't wait until you can teach me even more about cinema, the world, and other opinions that you may have that far surpass the opinions of everyone else. Thank you, and please solve these economy issues so we can both get jobs and continue to save the world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Review - Citizen Kane</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Citizen Kane has been lauded the best film ever made by many people. Do I particularly agree? No. But nonetheless, I think it is a great movie. It has some of the dated characteristics of cinema of it's period, the 1940's, but a lot of it's characteristics are still strong nowadays. I understand that the plot has some parallels to the real life story of William Randolph Hearst, but I don't know all that much about him, so I'm going to talk about only the film, which is great itself. The film is an important figure in the history of cinema, technologically and in terms of storytelling.The story is really not all that complicated, but the way it unfolds is great and engaging, and almost makes it seem complex, and it's told from a number of perspectives. The film opens up with the death of Charles Foster Kane (Orson Welles), the owner of the Inquirer, a New York newspaper. Just before dying, Kane utters the word "Rosebud". Then an approximately ten minute long newsreel summarizes the story of Kane, representing the public's view of him, and an overview of the story. Then, for the rest of the film, we are shown more details and depth of the story via flashbacks as news reporters go around and obtain information about Kane and his life.For those of you who haven't seen the film, I won't fully spoil it for you. I'll just give an overview. Kane achieved success and rose to power, but eventually suffered a major blow to his reputation, and he crashed. Along the way, he even gets married and divorced twice. With the aid of his closest friend, Jedediah Leland (Joseph Cotten), Kane starts builds a nationwide newspaper empire. He is ruthless as he achieves this, yet generous at the same time in a few ways, such as being willing to lose a million dollars a year to gain more newspaper circulation. Eventually, he runs for a political position, but his success to this is lost as his rival uncovers his affair with a "singer", and after this, his reputation is destroyed and his life's success declines. There is more to the story, but, like I said, I'm only giving a summary; I'm not giving the full story away, for those of you who haven't seen the film.All the while, we, the audience, and the reporters in the film, wonder who Kane really was, not just the story of the events of his life, from his rise to his fall, but who he really was underneath. They believe that a key to finding this out lies in his dying word, "Rosebud". At one point in the film, a reporter, Thompson, says, about the word, "Maybe Rosebud was something he couldn't get, or something he lost." At another point, someone (I don't remember who) says, "I don't think one word can describe one man's life". The entire movie is a puzzle, a puzzle of Kane's life, and not just that, but of who he really was (for lack of a better, deeper term). "Rosebud" is just one piece, a missing piece, of that puzzle, but it may be an important piece. Although, then again, maybe not. We do eventually find out what the word represents and what its origin is, and it represents one of the important messages of the movie, but I won't spoil it for, again, those of you who haven't seen the film.The film is great in terms of its storytelling. In addition to its storytelling, the film is also an important point in cinema in terms of a few other factors, such as cinematography. One of the most striking of the cinematographic effects is this stark contrast between brightness and darkness. Also notable are the camera angles - which create many unique shots throughout the film - and the use of deep focus, enabling images both in the back ground and the foreground to stay clear in focus. I also liked the music score. Bernard Herrmann, who also composed the score for Psycho (1960), created an effective score with very good combinations and uses of harmony, orchestration, melody, and other musical elements, and really supports the drama and moods of the film.So, in summary, while I personally don't think Citizen Kane is the best film ever made, I did find it to be great. Watching it was a very good experience for me. It's great in terms of storytelling and technical aspects, and, overall, like I've said, it's a great piece of cinema, and an important landmark in cinema history.My Rating: **** (out of ****)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Father of Film Noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For over 70 years now Citizen Kane has been regarded a cinematic masterpiece. So would it shock you to learn that its immediate reception was largely negative. Of course it would. But not for reasons of legitimate value, since the films content is a mirror image of the media tycoon William Randolph Hearst, who was incensed by the film, it was attacked with pitchforks by newspapers all owned by Hearst. Thankfully years later the film is appreciated for what it is. The finest work of an avant garde filmmaking genius in Welles.Lets start with the element of mise en scene (the techniques employed to combine visual elements e.g lighting, camera movement, setting and camera techniques such as montage to parallel the on screen narrative). Firstly to create the complex and materialistic Kane, Welles puts in a first class performance a seasoned actor would be proud of. Since this was Welles' first feature film, its even more astonishing that his input stemmed top to bottom and worked to such perfection. With all this in mind it's understandable a young up and coming filmmaker would want to be expressive in his work, but its unbelievable that all works to such accord. But as stated, its the cinematic techniques and the little things we ordinarily don't place emphasis or attention to that impress.The use of extreme camera angles is noteworthy in symbolising the sway of power in exchanges; Kane is occasionally framed from extreme angles- low visually making him overpowering and mirroring the on screen events. Aside from this the use of shadow and chiaroscuro lighting parallel the on screen narration, e.g the enigmatic Kane is often filmed in shadow symbolic of the private and emotionally detached Kanes dark persona and the enigma behind 'rosebud'.Setting is another important tool in conveying a story and Citizen Kane not only showcases the perfect settings but its inventive camera-work perfectly complements the environments to maximise their effectiveness. A good example of this is in showing Kane standing at a window when his adoptive father speaks with him. The window appears overpowering next to the minute Kane in the distance, but with just a few steps forward Kane appears overpowering to the camera framing as he speaks of his own vision for building an empire. All appear irrelevant and you may read and think I'm reading too much into these little bouts of symbolism and visual parallelling narrative in aiding the story but one thing is for certain is that these are no accidents and are absolutely deliberate.A little about the story. Charles Foster Kane is dying and his last word uttered is 'rosebud'. Immediately the press attempt to uncover the significance of this and a reporter is sent to interview the nearest and dearest to Kane throughout different periods of his life. The narrative unfolds from the non linear technique of flashbacks and the use of montage is deployed in conveying the jumps in time at different points. One of the most interesting concepts about telling the story in this method is that its more expansive in fleshing out the protagonist Kane; since each storyteller has a different perspective of their own on Kane, each contributes to humanising and dehumanising him accordingly.If I had to place this film into a particular Genre is would categorise it as drama, the transformation of Kane from youthful millionaire with good intentions to selfish materialistic recluse dramatic and extreme. To preach, the film takes a swipe at the rewards and benefits of capitalist America at the time, Kane quoting 'if i hadn't been rich, i might have been a great man'. Profound and innovative it is with money and power undoubtedly being the catalyst for Kanes unpleasant transformation.Supporting performances are all top notch from Everett Sloane, Joseph Cotton etc are the icing on the cake making this film near perfect in truth. I highly recommend giving this film a go, and cannot think of any reason to dislike the film. Even if this isn't your cup of tea, nobody can deny its creative flair, such was the innovation that it spawned a whole new genre in film noir.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know what to really say about this movie, but I do know it was pretty bearable to watch. As a director, Orson wells is pretty good and is known for making good movies. He plays as Charles foster Kane, an enormously wealthy media proprietor who dies and then BANG! He becomes historic news around the world. I remember seeing a clip in class from citizen Kane when he's in the room and he tears everything down. I laugh about that part because what if they had to do a retake? Anyway, the news reporter was so fascinated in getting to understand Kane meaning of rosebud; his last words, which I just don't get at all. Throughout the movie the lighting was always on point to. This movie was pretty good and was considered one of wells best movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Citizen Kane - Not the Greatest Film Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Citizen Kane has been labelled as one of the greatest movies ever made. The story of a newspaper tycoons life and how a reporter try's to find the meaning of his last word. Directed and starring Orson Welles.It pains me to say it but I found this film disappointing. I tried to go through my mind after the film searching for why I didn't enjoy it and I considered that maybe it was because of the age of the film, but then I remembered that there were many films from this era that I loved so that didn't stick. The only thing I could say is that maybe it was because it was literally the first big film after the new era of sound and at its time was considered groundbreaking while now it seems tepid. Even this reason doesn't really feel right with me and honestly I think it's down to the following reasons why I truly found this film a let down.The biggest hit to this film for me is the acting, it mentions at the credits that this film gave a first break for some of the actors and it really does show. Firstly though Welles acts his role perfectly as the love starved Kane, perfectly finding his electricity and his need for people to love him. Other than Cotton (perhaps the lead female deserves credit) I found the supporting cast poor in general but this is really to be expected as looking back to most pre 1960 film there are not normally more than two good actors in a film. This does not sound like much of bad point but I coming to why the acting in this film ruins it for me. There is one pivotal scene in the movie, the scene where the child is taken away towards the start. This scene was supposed to show the child's carefree nature and then how this is ripped from him by the corporation coming in and removing him from his family. The scene annoys me, the child actor does not portray the feeling of this emotion correctly and you watch feeling like it could of been done so much better and without this scene being done properly the metaphor for the film is lost. Now you may say this is harsh on the child actor but the people who made this film should have seen this and either re-shot with a different actor or thought of a different idea on how to work the loss felt by the child into the film.My second criticism of the film is partly to do with the way it is filmed, splicing different segments of his life story in different order due to them being told by different people. While I must firstly say this sort of thing in 1941 is groundbreaking and perhaps the fact that they even attempted it shows my following to be a moot point, but I still wouldn't expect this from the "Greatest Film Ever Made". Because of this way of film making the scenes with Kane himself are short and sharp, showing change in character very quickly, see scene with his first wife having dinner, this doesn't allow a true character arc. With more time spent in each scene perhaps a feel for the character or an understanding of why he changes could be seen. Also I would of preferred the film to have been perhaps 30 minutes longer to allow for more of Kane's character to be seen with perhaps some delving into his childhood or more of why he no longer ran the paper.I would like to make clear that while I did not completely love this film it must be seen as a groundbreaking film for its time and at the time, the best film ever made. It's use of camera angles and focus is far beyond anything seen in that age with some absolutely amazing cinematography. Two scenes stick out for me, but it must be said that there are many scenes throughout the film which look fantastic. Firstly where Kane is finishing Leland's review of his wife's performance and Leland slowly walks towards him from the distance showing Kane's madness and Leland trepidation of approaching him in one perfect shot. Secondly a scene where Kane signs away his newspaper shows Kane becoming smaller as he walks towards the window and then underneath it. It shows to our perception that the window is bigger than we think and that Kane himself has shrunk in stature.Lastly I would just like to add that after reading the film I read several posts on this films wall wondering why more was not said about Charlie's son. The people on the boards point to it as a flaw in the film while I claim it to be probably it's biggest success. The lack of attention to the child by Kane and the film overall(more so as a metaphor in terms of the film) is down to Kane's own loss of childhood. Being taken from his family and forced to grow too quickly causes Charles Kane to becoming a wreck, a man who will do anything to be loved. He buys possessions and creates a temple, he tries so hard to help the working man by promising to remove corruption and bring truth, he does anything for his wives but in the end does not listen to them thinking only selfishly. All of these thing's he does for love and attention but in the end the loss of his family and childhood leaves a gaping hole in a young Charlie and though he tries to fill this void he cannot, showing the true meaning of this film, and of of "rosebud", money cannot buy you happiness. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Charles Foster Kane was not entirely good or bad. This mystery surrounding him makes Citizen Kane a masterpiece.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having completed the core story mode of Team Bondi's LA Noire a night before watching Orson Welles' Citizen Kane, I realized the non-linear viewpoint narrative was common in both the game and the movie. There were crucial decisions to be made in LA Noire that could wrongfully prosecute an innocent or acquit a criminal, and the information we had about them was majorly through third party sources. In Citizen Kane, the first twenty minutes of so, with the exception of the mysterious opening shot, presents Charles Foster Kane as an wealthy, ostentatious and over-ambitious business tycoon whose life has seen major ups-and-downs and whose final years were spent predictably behind the walls of his palace like many other wealthy magnates. The media's perspective is not completely spurious, in fact Kane is wealthy, highly ambitious and grandiose, but that is not how his life should be defined or confined to. The 'Rosebud' puzzle leads to a week long investigation by a journalist Jerry Thompson in which he meets those close to Kane who are still alive.Thompson accosts Kane's ex-second wife Susan who takes to drinks after the news, but is dismissed by the melancholic singer. After perusing through Kane's manuscript, all he gets is an insight of Kane's early days. The disgruntled reporter quips at the librarian whether she is Rosebud, after an unsuccessful search. After meeting Mr. Bernstein, a jolly friend of Kane's, Thompson gets to hear more of the tycoon's rise as at the Inquiry publication. On the other hand, a bitter Jedediah Leland, Kane's good friend who had parted ways with him over the years, presents Kane in a rather divisive light, highlighting the mogul's unreasonable nature. Jed is also more concerned about himself and his cigars than Kane and requests Thompson to sneak in a few. The third person to be interviewed is a now-calm Susan, who discusses about her failed marriage with Kane. The last person who discloses about Kane is the butler. What we get from all these events is not an entirely accurate description of Kane; there are inconsistencies regarding his character that may be due to the narrator's own prejudices. Take for example Kane's first marriage as told by Leland, where Kane and his wife are only seen chatting about Kane's busy schedule in the most ridiculous outfits; by satirizing the interaction instead of including dramatic encounters between husband and wife, Welles stresses the unreliability of the events. And this is precisely what makes Citizen Kane such a captivating watch.The elusiveness of the story is elevated by the thrilling and brilliant cinematography that plays beautifully with dark and light. The opening Rosebud sequence is memorable because of the use of montage at various levels that give the scene a touch of disquietude and confusion. The five minutes boost the rest of the movie in a way rarely seen in film. Generally, a majority of the films believe in a placid opening that establishes all the characters before injecting some suspense. The extensive display of dissolve, montage and deep focus work magically, taking us through the many years of Kane's life. I haven't done film studies yet, but I can tell you that there is some intelligent camera work here, such as when Kane and Bernstein are discussing about the distinguished employees in their rival newspaper Chronicle and the camera closes in on the photo and dissolves to the nest frame where we see the same men working for Kane! Or the famous scene where a young Kane is playing with his little sledge in the snow outside while his parents are negotiating with Mr. Thatcher. Or the frequent shifting where Kane is reveling with the ladies towards the back while Leland expresses doubt to Bernstein in the front.Orson Welles plays a proud, charismatic and larger-than-life Kane in his youth and a megalomaniacal distressed Kane in his final years. Apart from acting the lead role, he has co-written, directed and produced the film; there is nothing to complain here, he excels in all the departments, and I can forgive the stiffness that robotizes his body movements when he plays the older Kane. The supporting cast is fine, Joseph Cotten, Ruth Warrick, Moorehead in particular while Dorothy Comingore was inconsistent.Citizen Kane is a film that treats us, invites us and invades us till we are keen to watch it another time, not to find more about rosebud, but to get a deeper understanding of Charles Foster Kane. We may never be able to fully appraise his life, but we keep hoping that we join all the jigsaw pieces one day and find out who Charles really was and what made him that man he became. This deliberate shroud that keeps us piqued all the time about the person is what was missing in 2011s Iron Lady, a recent movie about an important albeit non-fictional political figure Margaret Thatcher's life. Phyllida Lloyd never used the camera to give Thatcher this ambiguity that her character required and never gave importance to any other character in the film, and Abi Morgan, the scriptwriter could not give anything except one-liners and aphorisms. A 1941 film showed continuity and sequence better than a 2011 film, and that's something remarkable.My Rating: 9.7 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some will immediately say; "No action? Worst movie ever!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This might be perplexing to some, but I wouldn't want a film I made to be dubbed "the greatest movie of all time." I wouldn't want it to be dubbed "despicable" or even "loathsome," but I wouldn't want it to be labeled as the greatest motion picture ever made. With title comes untold expectations, and the problem with a title of this magnitude is it provides people the ability to make assumptions and expectations that a film simply can not live up to. I'm sure some have written off Orson Welles' Citizen Kane as "boring," "overrated," and "stupid," when really, if looked at from a technical standpoint and many other common film field, it truly is a masterpiece on film.Again, the question people will inevitably ask me I will not answer. The question will be "is it really the greatest film of all time?" That question simply can not be answered. It's an objective question, and you'll never get an answer that isn't subjective. Poll everyone you know, it will still be subjective. I don't care if a million people label something "the best," because it still doesn't represent fact. It makes it widespread opinion. Citizen Kane, I don't believe, is the greatest film I've ever seen (not that I could say what is), but it is one of the most intriguing and important films I have yet to see.The story revolves around Charles Foster Kane (Welles), who is based off of the real life newspaper mogul William Randolph Hearst. The film opens with Kane laying in his bed, gripping a snow globe, as he utters the simple word "Rosebud," and then the globe smashes seconds after he dies. Because of Kane's popularity, his death sparks mass attention, and reporter Jerry Thompson (Alland) is determined to decipher what his last word truly meant. The film winds up evolving into a nonlinear narrative, flashing back to when Kane was a boy, when he was growing up, and when he rose to fame.I can't see Kane being labeled "the greatest film of all time" for its plot. For a film of that title, you'd expect a twisty plot that goes in every conceivable direction, leaving you breathless and somewhat confused. Not Citizen Kane. The story is pretty simple and the progression rather speedy. But there I go again with that "impossible expectation" business.Where Kane really gets interesting is from a technical and intellectual standpoint. The film is the prime example of film noir, and the one cinephiles usually reference first. The use of light and shadow is very prominent in the film, and keep in mind, this was never done before. Some tracking shots are marvelous as they are complex and smooth. Everything seemed to be specifically planned out ahead of time, which is why the film doesn't feel rushed. Dialog was clearly perfected, shots were definitely practiced, and technique and stylistic intentions bleed through the storytelling. This makes Kane inevitably interesting and without a shadow of a doubt different. For the time at least.It is in this regard where people become massively disappointed. We have seen these same sort of tracking shots before, as well as having our perspective tricked, and light be the main focus in a film. It's nothing new. But for the time period this was revolutionary and riveting. It still is, personally. It is wholly consuming, incredibly enjoyable, and just all around fascinatingly complex.To add to the history lesson I'm reciting, the backstory on how this film came to be should award it some respect and recognition as well. Welles was big on the radio, airing the highly controversial War of the Worlds in 1933, and having major success in the field of theater. He signed a contract with RKO Pictures in 1939, where the studio gave him full control on a picture of his choice. He could write the script, choose the actors, and had privileges to edit the film to his own personal liking. This was such a rarity in a world dominated by studios. Newcomers were hardly given any room to maneuver, and when Welles had all of these privileges practically handed to him just because of minor past experiences, it really got people talking and what he delivered was beyond anyone's expectations. The film infuriated William Randolph Hearst so much that he threatened to have the film blacklisted and banned, which could partially be why the film received no Oscars other than Best Original Screenplay.Citizen Kane is a wonderful film that must be experienced. The history is one you can't ignore, the acting is superb, the storytelling, if a bit simple, is nonetheless engaging, the dialog is crisp, the music is lively and intelligent, and the filming and editing is nothing shy of entrancing and, literally, revolutionary. The moral also rings truer today than it probably did in 1941. Instead of feeling like you should enjoy it out of obligation, feel you should see it because of obligation.Starring: Orson Welles, Joseph Cotten, Dorothy Comingore, Everett Sloane, Ray Collins, George Coulouris, Agnes Moorehead, Paul Stewart, Ruth Warrick, Erskine Sanford, and William Alland.

		<shortDescription>A Landmark Achievement In Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Citizen Kane is a 1941 film, directed by and starring Orson Welles. It was released by RKO Pictures, and was Welles's first feature film. The film was nominated for Academy Awards in nine categories; it won an Academy Award for Best Writing (Original Screenplay) by Herman Mankiewicz and Welles. Citizen Kane has been voted the greatest film of all time in each of the last five Sight &amp; Sound's polls of critics,and is particularly praised for its innovative cinematography, music and narrative structure.Orson Welles first feature film -- which he directed, produced, and co- wrote, as well as playing the title role -- proved to be his most important and influential work, a ground-breaking drama loosely based on the life of William Randolph Hearst which is frequently cited as the finest American film ever made.Aging newspaper magnate Charles Foster Kane dies in his sprawling Florida estate after uttering a single, enigmatic final word -- "Rosebud" -- and newsreel producer Rawlston sends reporter Jerry Thompson out with the assignment of uncovering the meaning behind the great man's dying thought. As Thompson interviews Kane's friends, family, and associates, we learn the facts of Kane's eventful and ultimately tragic life: his abandonment by his parents after he becomes the heir to a silver mine; his angry conflicts with his guardian, master financier Walter Parks Thatcher ; his impulsive decision that "it would be fun to run a newspaper" with the help of school chum Jedediah Leland and loyal assistant Mr. Bernstein; his rise from scandal sheet publisher to the owner of America's largest and most influential newspaper chain; his marriage to socially prominent Emily Norton, whose uncle is the President of the United States; Kane's ambitious bid for public office, which is dashed along with his marriage when his opponent, corrupt political boss Jim Gettys, reveals that Kane is having an affair with aspiring vocalist Susan Alexander; Kane's vain attempts to promote second wife Alexander as an opera star; and his final, self-imposed exile to a massive and never-completed pleasure palace called Xanadu. Welles's epic tale of a publishing tycoon's rise and fall is entertaining, poignant, and inventive in its storytelling, earning its reputation as a landmark achievement in film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Citizen Kane (1941) - Rosebud? What the Hell is a Rosebud? Is it a...Wait a Minute!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Citizen Kane" is one of the most excellent masterpieces ever seen on cinema. It was produced, written, directed by, and starring Orson Welles, when he was just 26 years old. This movie is one of the first movies ever to accomplish such unique technical advantages, and it redefined the legacy of cinema. The movie begins as Orson Welles, playing Charles Foster Kane, a newspaper tycoon, who is introduced in the opening scene, on his deathbed, saying his final word, "Rosebud", before dropping a snow-globe to the floor. Then, it follows to the perspective of a reporter who is investigating the meaning of "Rosebud", and it leads to a series of flashbacks that shows glimpses of Kane's life. Okay, let's just say, I enjoy black-and-white movies a little bit, but the thought of seeing this was just plain enjoying. The story was found fascinating and interesting, but it's not really spectacular and remarkable. But it's Orson Welles that helped lead the way to show cinema the true meaning of filmmaking. I also enjoyed all the innovating camera techniques used to make the movie more unique, which includes so many uses of deep focus, long shots, soundtrack, film editing, transitions, shadows, and lighting. These techniques were too impossible to accomplish in the past, but it was Welles that made the impossible into possible. From an interesting script to a fine cast, it just proves that "Citizen Kane", after many years, is still a movie that impresses audiences everywhere, with a movie that beat the odds of cinema, and it's an incredible recommendation for true movie lovers. "Citizen Kane", in my review, "a brilliant masterpiece, masterfully accomplished".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's all about me, me, me, Charles Orson Foster Kane Wells.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If cinema lovers from around the world voted on the greatest film ever made they'd probably say Battleship Potemkin. No offense, but BP got plenty of the thing CK sorely lacks: Pathos. Or let me put it this way: can you imagine a Hollywood producer coughing up 100 million of his own dough for a biopic of, say, Rupert Murdoch? Sure. On the other hand, look at the news: Libya, Syria, Greece. That's why the episode on the Odessa steps still speaks loudly and will likely do so 100 years from now--it is real; today's news for most of us. That's why BP will still be a classic by then--as the fall of Troy or Hitler's bunker--while most people will have forgotten CK. Truth is, OW made a losing historical gamble there, because nobody really cares about a rich fat guy cooking his goose. Now the CK review: After 30 min. watching it I hadn't fallen slept and had come instead to the conclusion stated in my title. This is all about Orson Wells; about how great filmmaker and great actor he is, to which effect he uses CFK as his privileged vehicle. And with him comes the territory, so to speak. From the initial scenes we are warned we are seriously in artsy territory here, there'll be no let up to the richness of camera movements; the exhaustive use and abuse of different kinds of lightning; the endless going back and forth through different time frames--manifested by the characters' ages--the blatant, self conscious, navel gazing of the main character (and actor) Great for the artsy, the film student, the rookie filmmaker, I reckon, but somewhat lame for people like me, who see fiction movie watching mostly as a form of entertainment.But even in technical terms I found CK contrived, artificial. Despite what its fans say, it has no character development, not even of CFK himself, even when the movie is about him. For ex. he's supposed to be influent socially and politically, yet we have no inkling of what is at stake--except his political future--in that struggle with Gettys because Wells never bothered to truly put him in his social context as an active participant. We never see him interacting with real, everyday people, just with sycophants, pairs, enemies, inside his corporative shell. Where is the POV of Regular Joe? And how his own relationship with his wife, son, evolved and deteriorated? Never know. All we see are headlines. Those talking about Wells' great acting job don't know what they are talking about; he didn't play Kane as a real person?letting him be--but only as a projection of himself, of his own ego, keeping him confined in an fully enclosed environment. He was even more controlling with CFK than CFK--or WRH--ever was. And that was the lead; as for the rest of the cast, they are just references; not even cardboard cuts?except for Susie, the only one with human face, real emotion there (I'll qualify my conclusion on Wells' Kane, but only assuming he hated WRH so much he just couldn't keep the necessary distance with his cinematographic alter ego).But the main problem of CK is that it doesn't have a plot. We know from the beginning that CFK will go up and then down in life. So what's left, if characters won't be the ones saving the day? How about mood, atmosphere? No luck there either as--something ironic--Wells kills all possibility of building such things, and getting tension, thrills expectations by the side, with his ever present obsession with artsy cinema. I can picture him too absorbed with camera angles, scene framing, lenses focusing, perspective searching, lightning setting and montage editing, to have any time for plot development, which he may even come to see as a drag. And all that kills the mood, the tension. At the end, the only real touching thing in the whole flick is the Susie subplot. (many people just don't get Comingore's Susie. She was happy, she could laugh even with a toothache, and Kane turned her life into something dark and boring).In all, great in you are a film student, an aspiring filmmaker. If not, look elsewhere. 5/10 for film appreciation plus 1 pt. bonus for Susie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have no doubt that back in 1941 , Citizen Kane was a ground breaking movie that was loved by millions. The problem is, i watched this for the first time 60 years after it was released and sadly , time , has not done this films any favours whatsoever.The first half of this film really shows a lot of promise. The story starts with the death of Charles Foster Kane and then reverts back to the story of how he inherent his wealth as a boy. Then we see Kane as an enthusiast business man who's sole aim is to be the biggest newspaper mogul around.Up till then the film is fine but the last hour is a bit of a mess. It goes from being a politically motivated movie to a film about one man's self destruction and i was hoping for so much more.Orson Wells is excellent and the ageing process works very well on screen but sadly this film left me cold as old Rosebud.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll never understand the praise that this film gets. I can understand the photography was innovative and at times quite stunning for the time period, but other than that I cannot find a way to love this movie. "Rosebud" is perhaps what keeps the audience to stick around through this boring 2 hour movie. The acting is mediocre at best, and the characters are largely flat and lacking a certain depth, emotionally. From the beginning of the film, I could tell where it is going, and I would have a much better time respecting this movie and it's somewhat interesting story if it was at least an hour shorter. That way the cinematography could be appreciated, and the meat of the story told, without putting people to sleep.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A master charlatan at work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One scene sums this film up for me. Welles, as Kane, walks to a window which appears to be of normal size. As he approaches it, we see it is enormous and 6 feet off the ground. He then walks to the foreground again, and once more the window looks normal.This seems to say "Look how clever I am, to do this". This cleverness pursued for its own sake is the hallmark of Welles in general and Citizen Kane in particular. As Welles himself said in the film which provides the other bookend to his career, F For Fake: "I am a charlatan".This is not to say that Kane is not a good film, merely that its constant gimmickry detracts from it. It has as many special effects as a modern day science fiction film and Welles, being the infant terrible he was at the time, has an endless need to put in as many trick shots as possible even if they seriously overbalanced the rather slight storyline. Never do a simple shot when you can have a camera crane in, then dissolve, then have a piece of furniture open up and so on. All this has made the film beloved among cinephiles and uncriticisable among anyone else.But is the story any good? Does the pacing and narrative hold up? The answer is just about yes, although the story is not as good as it thinks it is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>That is not to say I didn't love it, this film is absolutely brilliant in every respect. I just more admire it rather than adore it, but I completely understand its reputation as a classic. The cinematography is enough to earn the film's reputation, every shot, every angle is exemplary and has so much visual drama, and you never know from looking at Citizen Kane that it was made on a shoestring budget. That is not all though. Bernard Hermann's score is superb, the story while not easy to understand at first is interesting and the screenplay is thought-provoking. Not only does Orson Welles direct impeccably, he turns in a magnificent performance as Charles Foster Kane, while the supporting acting is excellent too. People may dismiss Citizen Kane as boring and dull, and I have known people outside of IMDb to say that, but I have yet to hear any of those people to say it is not well-made or directed. As for me, I loved this film very much, and while my praise doesn't completely go beyond sheer admiration I cannot deny it is a great film. 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

The camera angles are beautifully shot, the story is interesting, the acting is great, and the ending is genius. It did change filmmaking in many ways with the creativity it has. All I'm saying it just doesn't do that as much as many other movies that made it to "AFI's 100 Greatest Movies". What about "Gone With the Wind", and its game changing use of color filmmaking? What about the brilliant portrayal of crime life that "The Godfather" gave us? What about the amazing cinematography in "Lawrence of Arabia"? There are so many other great films to pick from when naming the greatest film of all time. Why is this the one? Why is this chosen over all the rest? I don't know, but despite it being overrated in my mind it still is brilliant.4 stars out of 4</fullReview>

A critical success, the film failed to recoup its costs at the box-office. Raising Kane by Pauline Kael, adapted from the 1971 New Yorker essay about the film, is recommended reading.</fullReview>

Like most people I watch the film and make my own mind up. This film just doesn't do it for me. It has a running time of two hours and quite frankly I was relieved when it was finished. I am not a shallow person and by nature I try to look for the good in everybody I meet and that approach extends to works of art in whatever form they take. I have watched this film on more than one occasion and I would accept that the film tells a story well and it is also clear to me that a lot of care and attention went into its making. But when it comes to the bottom line I just didn't see the whole as being anything other than another fairly good film. Nothing particularly special about it but perhaps I am missing the point here maybe because I am just not bright enough to spot why it has so many admirers. I would suggest anybody see the film and no doubt you will come up with your own unique opinion which is what the above narrative is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fabulous.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Orson Welles's "Citizen Kane" (1941) is a masterpiece. Their is no doubt about it. It is one of the few films that are just fabulous in all departments. The plot is about Charles Foster Kane's (Orson Welles) life, as seen through the eyes of many different people who knew him. You hear a lot of people's opinions (his second wife, his personal business manager, his guardian during his childhood...) but never his own. The brilliant twist ending is one of the best I have ever seen. What really imprints itself on the brain is the cinematography. The acting, makeup, direction and screenplay are all fantastic, but the photography (by the great Gregg Toland) is truly the best camera work you are ever likely to see. The deep focus and distinct shadows almost place "Citizen Kane" in the Film Noir category. A film to watch over and over again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best movies ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, what to say? 22 year old Orson Welles came into Hollywood in the late 30s on a hiding to nothing. He had already had a big influence on live theatre, and made headlines all over the US with his controversial "War of the Worlds" radio broadcast. He was given a three picture deal by RKO with final cut on all of them. Unprecedented at the time. Surely he couldn't live up to the hype? What Welles produced was a cinematic triumph without equal at the time, that 67 years on still defies description.There is hardly an honest film maker in Hollywood that won't own up to being influenced, to at least some extent by this movie. Everything about this movie, from the premise, to the script, the score, the cinematography and the acting is exceptional.Orson Welles not only does a superb job as director, he also puts in one of the greatest tour de force performances in the history of American cinema as Kane. Growing from an ambitious happy go lucky 20 something to a tyrannical monster, to a bitter, pathetic old shell of a man in less than two hours. Welles inspires rage, hatred and pity out of what could have been a one note character in less skilled hands.The story is simple. A past his prime media tycoon dies muttering the word "Rosebud" and a journalist, looking for the real scoop on Kane's life, sets out to find exactly what Rosebud is. We hear the heartbreaking story of a young boy sold to the bank by his parents, raised to be a business man, finding success as a media owner and then being destroyed by his inability to love others. The journalist never finds out what Rosebud is, but we do, Kane's sleigh he used to ride when he was a child. It's been argued that the sleigh means nothing, it's been argued that the sleigh means everything. In the end it can mean just about anything you want it to.Also of note here is the performance of Joseph Cotton, who puts in one of the great performances as Jedediah Lelan, who unwittingly becomes the conscience of the story, simply by being himself.The story behind the film's release, brilliantly depicted in the late 90s TV film RKO 281 and the documentary "The Battle Over Citizen Kane" are almost as interesting as the film itself, and that really is saying something."It's Terrific" the original 1941 promo posters for Kane rather naively stated. But looking back now, sums it up rather nicely.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know exactly what's left to say about "Citizen Kane", about it's technical dazzle or the maturity of its plot, but it's interesting to note that its prominence gained height only gradually. At first, if not disregarded, it was mostly unnoticed, probably because William Randolph Hearst and his newspaper chain (pre-TV and pre-blog) avoided any mention of it. Only in the last 20 years or so has it been recognized for the masterpiece that it is.Of course everyone's heard of it by now, and though most of us admire it, some despise it. I suspect that if some of us dislike it, it's not because of the film itself, but because the majority adore it. This is known as "contrarianism" and I blame the Frogs for it.The French -- I can carry on with these Olympian generalizations, can't it? I mean, I'm protected by the First Amendment, right? The French have this tendency to turn common values upside down. That's what gave the world Jerry Lewis.Not that I intend to put France and its couture down entirely. The single best sandwich I ever ate was in the Gare du Nord. But, really, take the anthropologist Claude Levi-Strauss as an example. Greek mythology? Pfui. Let's look more closely at Tlingit myths. The Tlingit are not proto-scientists or philosophers. They're a bunch of clam diggers in the Northwest. I should know, having lived with them.Where was I? Oh, yes. That sandwich. Wow.Getting back to "Citizen Kane," I watch it now and again -- not too often because I have it memorized. But here's an example of why I think it's a masterpiece. Okay. Charles Foster Kane has forced his wife, who has a mediocre voice, to push herself into becoming an opera star with the help of his vast financial resources. She fails and tries to poison herself.Here's how that scene plays out on screen. The camera is shooting poor half-dead Dorothy Comingore in fuzzy close up, looking anything but glamorous, breathing heavily, covered with sweat, unconscious, her face away from the door on which Kane and his minions are banging. Behind her figure is a table on which we see the suicide apparatus -- bottles and glasses. It's a rear projection, meaning that Comingore was being filmed while a screen behind her (previously shot) is being shown behind her. And -- within THAT back projection -- there is a third projection screen of the door, which finally swings open and admits Kane. Back projections were in common use in 1941 -- but a projection within a projection? (Welles used the same technique later, in "Lady From Shanghai.") Okay. As someone said, Welles was a kid with a new toy -- the camera. But he turned it into a model that did barrel rolls and crazy eights. Few have done it better since then -- and Welles' technique was tacked onto an adult story with no bad guys and no good guys, yet gripping. A young man loses his illusions as he ages. (Don't we all?) Welles' output went downhill from there, his apologists notwithstanding, not because of a monstrous ego. That's too easy. He couldn't bring himself to finish the editing because it was never again to meet his demanding expectations.Don't let revisionists beguile you. It's one of the best movies ever made, and you can measure its quality along any number of dimensions, from Greg Toland's revolutionary photograph to Benny Hermann's subtle but apt score.It's pretty good.</fullReview>

I saw the title of citizen kane at number one. i eagerly searched for this film as well as the rest of the top ten. After seeing all of them i found citizen kane the hardest to watch and enjoy. My first viewing of citizen kane was uneventful mainly because i fell asleep through it. I had heard all the hype of this film. read all the top ten lists with this film being #1 on most of them. I have heard a lot of directors talk about the influence and the power of this film. I tried it again and laughably i passed out again. I didn't understand why this film made me so bored. Again i watched it with a group of friends and finished it finally. I admit i didn't like it and even hated it at one point but i still brought myself to watch it more and more to seek out all the technical spots that were said to be so revolutionary at the time. I would say impressive for the time but i still had a problem with the acting and the story that was Said to be controversial because of the similarities with William Randolf Hearsts life. I do wonder if this movie is ranked so high more for it being controversial and the technical aspects more than the film as a whole. I don't really judge a film by its impact but more by the film as a whole, the story, acting, music. After ten years i have grown an appreciation for this film but it is not #1 for me. #5 at best cause The Godfather to me is What movies are all about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most charismatic performances of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a teenager, I saw a copy of this movie in a video store and seeing as the jacket sleeve had some high praise for this movie, I watched it. It's hard to say how my perceptions of this movie may have been influenced by the blurb on the VHS cover.The start of this old black and white movie is quite disorientating-a newsreel tells of the death of a powerful media tycoon in the US. You wonder if you have gotten the right movie, or the movie is something different to what you thought it would be.Soon, you get a more conventional narrative movie-the story of the tycoon in question...the Kane of the title. One of the hooks of the movie is the whole "what does 'Rosebud' mean?" aspect of the story. It was Kane's last words before he died, and it nags away at you until it is resolved towards the end of the movie (pay attention to the movie for the resolution of this aspect of the myster!). Many years later I found out that the word "rosebud" has a whole OTHER connotation, to do with a REAL media tycoon whom this movie was loosely based on (there is a documentary concerning this real tycoon's attempts to shut down the making/screening of this movie).If you've done Media Studies, you might have had to watch this movie and there you learn about all the technical achievements of this movie. That's all fine, but this movie has a narrative and performance charm all of its own.A scene from this movie is one of my all time favourites from any movie-it's the scene where a hugely charismatic Kane (as played by the youngish Orson Welles) outlines how long his business can stay afloat for despite incurring losses. This is a brash, lovable, charismatic American character. Great scene-alongside say, one scene with Robert de Niro in the otherwise mediocre Mean Streets, or that of Noah Taylor in "He died with a felafel in his hand". All these have a great scene where their character reveals themselves, emotionally speaking.Many other scenes from this movie will leave an impression with you.A movie about power and love.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A cult film that has become a myth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The natural question ,we have to wonder about when watching this film, in its new splendor after restoration, is whether Orson Welles did not try to make a movie about himself. He sure did. I would even say it is a posthumous autobiography in prospective expectation. It is an American film about America and the Americans. The grandiose grandeur of those who are dreaming America into being and the petty narrow-mindedness of those who are only defending their own interests. Which tribe is most important? No one can know. The dreamers get isolated and lonely, at times in the golden heart of wealth and money. The self-centered ones just cut the cake and are very careful to give a very thin slice to others and an enormous slice to themselves. Then they all die sooner or later and only the dreamers survive. The others disappear in the darkness of hell, the underworld of forgotten anti-history. But this film reveals, and at the time it was probably scandalous, the power of the press as for building public opinion and the absurdity of the Americans as for forbidding politicians to have a normal private life, I mean the right to have a private life of their own and only their own. The tragic dimension of this character is that he is trapped by the very first, the power of the press he had used tremendously and had even boosted up in incredible proportions, with his very private life. Then the rest is only vanity and vain pretence: he tried to prove what he did not have to prove and he used other people to do so, particularly his second wife, which led to the end of the dream that had turned into a nightmare with a brain stroke and death. One can only prove what is really real and not what is virtually eventually maybe possible. Then of course we have to admire the technique of this film and the marvelous black and white finish and gloss. We also have to point out the film is renewing the genre of the biography of a great man by creating some mystery around one word, "rosebud", which probably has no value at all and is there to make us look at the pictures and images with a more attentive eye, as if we were supposed to be private eyed sleuths. Some say this film is a masterpiece and they must be nearly right. They would be totally right if they said it is one of the few masterpieces of the war years, the years that needed some boosting of the Americans and America. Orson Welles did it with a big tongue in his vast cheek, but probably had more positive effect than all the propaganda films that were filmed by second grade "directors", if they can be at times called directors at all.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne &amp; University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A fictional biography of media magnate Charles Foster Kane (Orson Welles) - a thinly veiled William Randolph Hearst that brought Welles and RKO all kinds of problems - that recreates a life in flashback, Welles' "Citizen Kane" was a startling cinematic debut by any standards, and from a 25-year-old made it nothing short of remarkable.Beginning with Kane's lonely death at his crumbling and ornate Xanadu mansion, the film details the destruction of Kane's childhood when his mother unwittingly inherits a legacy and his resulting adolescent realisation that part of the legacy includes a newspaper, which Kane decides to run personally. From there, Kane builds a media empire, dabbles in politics and women, and eventually starts to alienate all those around him.A potent metaphor for the betrayal of principles, the souring of the American Dream, and an intelligent mediation on the corrupting nature of power, the film's reputation is nothing short of gargantuan. Regularly cited as the greatest movie ever made, there's no doubting its pure brilliance and status as a contender for so lofty a claim.What is beyond doubt is that Welles and his collaborative troupe of Herman J Mankiewicz (screenplay), Gregg Toland (photography), Robert Wise (editor), and the fantastic cast of leading players managed to invent a whole new cinematic vocabulary. The attention to detail (ceilinged sets, the meticulous creation of Xanadu) and technical brilliance (deep focus photography and hitherto unchartered camera angles) combined to influence the future of cinema. "Citizen Kane" is the margin by which all of Welles' later efforts came to be judged and also, in many ways, the benchmark of film production.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kind of a disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the movies in my America in film class that we have recently watched was Citizen Kane. For homework I had to get background information for the movie. I read a lot of articles that told me that Citizen Kane was and is the greatest movie in American history. On the day that my class was to watch the movie I was interested to see if those comments were true. Nope. I'm not saying the movie was awful because it wasn't but I expected a lot more for the greatest movie ever. I think the whole thing with Rosebud was very clever and the camera shots in the movie were exceptional for the time. However the movie was not able to keep my interest. I'm not a big fan of black and white movies to begin with and Citizen kane did not really change my mind. As far as the acting in the movie I was very impressed with Orson Welles as Charles Foster Kane. Jedediah Leland and the reporter for the inquirer were good characters as well. Pretty much every other character in the movie did not hold interest. All and all not a bad movie just not the greatest movie in American film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The greatest piece of cinema..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Citizen Kane" (1941)Citizen Kane is the ultimate movie. Ultimate in the sense that it achieves the most, in its cinematic innovation and its ability to remain timeless. It has been hailed worldwide as the greatest movie ever made, and although it is impossible to establish the world's favourite movie, Citizen Kane is certainly the biggest contender, topping endless polls and lists with its breathtaking visuals and unique essence. It's style, plot, tempo, cinematography, score and characters are all something to be treasured, and it's impact on cinema is something never matched to this day. It is a moving work of art, flowing with a flawless poeticality.Accompanying it's sweeping visuals is a great tale. The concept of ''Rosebud'' is simply ingenious. Charles Foster Kane is a man forever yearning for a lost innocence, someone who has climbed the top of the mountain but dies with regret for not staying at the bottom. And yet the film is somewhat of a mystery, not just in the journalists quest but in the significance of ''Rosebud'' altogether. The burning sled gives us an answer not an explanation, it doesn't represent the meaning of ''Citizen Kane'', just a satisfactory feeling that nothing can be explained so simply. It serves as a philosophically profound essay on the unknowability of the human personally. Orson Welles creates an absolute masterpiece here, a landmark of innovation and a fine example of cinematic perfection. Timeless. Classic. Call it what you want, Citizen Kane will undoubtedly remain the finest film ever made. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant! Too Brilliant To Put Into Words. (SPOILERS)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERSAh, the good old days of movies, with simple plots, actors that always have serious voices, black-and-white, and the players instead of the actors. I have actually never seen Citizen Kane until today. I have seen the Simpson episodes Two Cars in Every Garage and Three Eyes on Every Fish and Rosebud before I saw this, and they are pretty much based on Citizen Kane. Anyway, I know it is always used as an example of a movie. For example, Psycho is usually called "the Citizen Kane of horror films." Well, Psycho was a great movie so this had to be a fantastic movie. Well, I went to a store and I rented this. I have got to tell you, this is one of the greatest movies of all time, in my opinion and most people's opinions. Sure, it is not the greatest movie of all time but it is one of the most famous movies ever made and one of the most brilliant ones.Here is the plot of this movie. It is actually very simple. A wealthy man named Charles Foster Kane's last words were Rosebud. A man named Thompson tries to discover what Rosebud meant. Thompson interviews Kane's past friends and family to find out his past life and what Rosebud meant. He discovers what happened in Kane's life, when he was forced to live with a banker for the rest of his life, when he runs his own newspaper, when he marries the President's niece, when he divorces here, when he runs for governor, but fails with a scandal, when he marries his second wife and forces her to be an opera singer, and when his attitude drove the people he loved out of his life. In the end when people burn Kane's possessions one of them is a sled. That sled is called Rosebud.Overall, this is definitely one of the best movies of all time. It had great acting, a great story, groundbreaking cinematography, a unique way of directing, a great twist, and pretty much everything. Nothing about this film is bad. I am mind-boggled that this film did not win Best Picture at the Academy Awards back in the 1942 Academy Awards. This is one of the best films in the 1940's, and definitely the best film in 1941. Anyway, this is one of those films that you have to see. There are many films that are must-see, but this is at the top of the list.10/10 Recommended Films: It's A Wonderful Life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Now I can see why people call this the greatest film of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Charles Foster Kane (Orson Welles) is a rich businessman who is on his deathbed and says his very last word (you guessed it), 'Rosebud'. But what is 'Rosebud' and why did he say it? That's why a journalist is trying to find out the answer to his last word by contacting the people who knew Charles Foster Kane.CITIZEN KANE is a classic. I really liked it and I can see why so many people call this 'the greatest film of all time'. But should it really be called 'the greatest film of all time'? I don't think so but it sure is one of the greatest films of all time. But even if it's not 'the greatest film of all time', it should be seen by every film lover in the world.</fullReview>

God himself seem to be the director. And what about the plot? Wonderful, of course!You can watch this film how many times you want, and every time it's a brand new experience, because new details comes to you.One Oscar, Best Writing, is not enough for this film.

		<fullReview>When my husband and I decided to rent this movie we knew that it was a classic, but had no idea what it was about. The fact that I was able to get both a History and Communication degree and never be forced to see this movie in college is ridiculous. It was not only a great movie that would have fit in well with my Film, Culture, and Politics class, but it was extremely interesting and did an excellent job portraying Hearst's life. I would recommend that every college student watch this movie to learn about yellow journalism, sensationalism, responsibilities of journalism, and overall California History. The DVD also has about 2 hours of information on Hearst and the film itself. It was an educational film that never lost our interest. This film definitely deserves its classic status. I would put it up there with Casablanca on the movie front.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The perfect film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Citizen Kane is the film that is widely considered to be the best film ever made. It tells the story of Charles Kane, a young man with barely any idea how to run a business, who decides that he wants to run a newspaper. We follow through his life from his childhood all the way up to his death, where he mutters one word: "Rosebud". The subplot of the film is a reporter who is interviewing everybody that ever knew or worked with Kane, in hopes of finding out what Kane's famous last word means. While I personally wouldn't call this the greatest movie ever made, it is indeed the perfect film. Anybody who wants to study fine acting and fine directing, need only watch Orson Welles at his absolute best.Citizen Kane is the study of an eccentric's life. He starts out as a young and cocky newspaper editor who eventually becomes an old and wise politician eccentric, building an insanely large mansion on a huge chunk of land just for his wife. The story of the film is very good, and the way it's put together makes the movie very interesting. It bounces back and forth between present day and flashbacks, weaving the story in and out as the reporter begins to get frustrated. Everyone spills their guts about Kane, but not one person can account for "rosebud". It seems no one will ever know, except the viewing audience when the classic twist ending is shown. Orson Welles' direction is very good, and you can tell that some present day director's have taken some tips. One of the best techniques is using ground shots to make Kane look larger than life.The acting in the movie is very good, especially from Orson Welles. His awesome voice coupled with his amazing on screen dynamic makes him really fun to watch. Most of the Citizen Kane stars come from the Mercury Theatre radio program that Welles was a part of, and they all do very well in their first time on screen.Overall, this is an amazing film, and though it's not my favourite personally, it is quite possibly the perfect film.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The deterioration of idealism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is impossible to sit down and watch a movie--especially when that movie is "Citizen Kane"--and not be lulled by the windstorm of praises surrounding it. The trick is to not let that influence your individual critical assessment (which is nearly impossible in "Kane"'s case). Orson Welles' tale of Charles Foster Kane, who inherits a fortune as a young man, presides over a successful newspaper, uses his political clout to run for office, romances two women, and dies alone with a literal castle filled with priceless art, is a story that still has relevance today. Welles' character study is fascinating in the way it captures the idealism of youth, and how that erodes into complacency and--in Kane's case--disenchantment; one of the characters makes a keen observation of the millionaire at middle age, making the claim that he can only accept love on his own terms, that he thought he could 'give' the public truth and freedom. Being a 25-year old male who was not too long ago a gung-ho liberal, "Citizen Kane"'s presentation of this unacknowledged self-interest that snowballs into bitterness is striking. The stigma that follows Kane is his own inability to be satisfied by anyone or anything.The pseudo-documentary style in which the film is presented seems very cutting-edge for its time, and translates well to our modern age of tabloid journalism. But what's more ingenious is the framing device: a reporter is interviewing Kane's coworkers and lovers in the wake of his death, investigating his dying words ("Rosebud"). Who or what Rosebud turns out to be is something that has been satirized on episodes of "The Real Ghostbusters" and "Tiny Toon Adventures," among other places, but I will keep my lips sealed for those who are unaware. In another film, it might have produced unintentional laughs, but in "Citizen Kane," the revelation it portends is shattering.I really didn't have high expectations for "Citizen Kane," in spite of the reputation it has earned through the years. I often think that younger generations (myself included) are going to become increasingly detached from the perceived 'classics' of cinema as time progresses (in a way similar to how the elder critics are detached from current cinema). I was skeptical at "Kane"'s overly typical beginning, but became increasingly intrigued as it progressed, to the point where I was genuinely affected by this tragic character's decline. It may not be the greatest film of all time, but it still remains a finely-crafted piece of work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visual Elements in Citizen Kane</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Visual Elements in Citizen KaneWhen a viewer watches a movie, the primary reason in most cases is probably for the overall entertainment experience of the film as a whole. Casual viewing does not always include a critical breakdown in one's head of all the various aspects that go into producing the finished product. Some might argue that if one notices too many of the "parts" that the overall value of the "whole" has lost some appeal. Nevertheless, filmmakers take great care in putting together their masterpieces; often micro managing down the finest detail that is hardly noticed. Casting, plot and script are obvious elements that almost any viewer will have a good recollection of after having seen a movie. One can relate the story, repeat the memorable lines of dialogue and tell who starred in the film. But what about the sound, the lighting, shot selection, camera angles and editing? How much of that is remembered or lost? These are important parts of the director's work. There is hardly a detail that has no meaning, right down to the set dressing. Everything means something. One may not be able to discern the meaning of every minute detail the director feels is important. However, the observer can still perceive the visual clues that set the mood and tone of scenes and story lines even if they cannot interpret the filmmaker's deepest thoughts.One film which uses some of these "less obvious" components as a key ingredient in the overall story is Citizen Kane (1941), a landmark cinematic achievement starring, and directed by Orson Welles. Specifically, the use of lighting to create shadows, and camera angles to convey the status of the characters are key elements which have an affect on viewers, whether consciously or subconsciously.In Citizen Kane, shadows contribute to the feeling of mystery that hangs over the story from start to finish. In the newsreel scene, when the lights come up there are shadows all around the smoke-filled room. Voices seem to be coming right out of the dark at times as they discuss what Charles Foster Kane's life meant and what the last word he uttered, "rosebud," may have meant. In the final scene, the main investigator admits that he "didn't find out much" and that still does not know what "rosebud" meant. His face is in shadow, as are all of the people to whom he is speaking. They are in the dark literally and figuratively because the mystery of Kane's final word is no closer to being solved. Lighting and shadows are also used in other ways in this film. For instance one way is to differentiate the status of characters in particular scenes. An example of this is seen in the exchange between Kane and his wife Susan in a Chicago hotel room. After reading the bad notices from her operatic debut, fully lit, she screams to him that she is quitting singing. Kane approaches her, casts a shadow which totally engulfs her, and insists that she will continue her career. The lighting effect reinforces who has the upper hand in the scene. Shadows are also used to foreshadow future events. One instance in Citizen Kane stands out among many. When Kane reads his "declaration of principles," which he has just written, detailing his promises to present the news honestly, accurately and fairly ? he is totally in shadow, while men on either side of him are completely lit. This indicates that Kane will ultimately, not keep his lofty promises the people.Camera angles also have a lot to do with how characters are perceived. During the political rally speech scene there is a low angle shot of Kane at the lectern, with a huge poster of himself as a backdrop. The shot begins at the back of the hall and gradually zooms in. As the shot gets tighter and tighter on Kane, he appears higher and higher in the frame, giving the sense of his rising power to the viewer. The shot angle also tells one which characters are more powerful compared to each other. In the previously mentioned scene where Kane's wife tries to quit singing, the camera angle on her is high making appear small and powerless. Kane is seen from a low angle which emphasizes his control over Susan at the time. Lighting, the use of shadows, and camera shot selection are vital parts in the total picture of Citizen Kane. Imagine seeing this film lit up like the average sitcom on television today. It would not even resemble the classic movie that Welles envisioned and produced. Many elements of the story would be changed, or lost altogether. This movie was far ahead of its time, and by many accounts continues to be the standard by which all films are measured against.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I agree that this movie was quite good when it was made because it changed the way movies were made. It is however, not a Shakespearian classic that can withstand the ravages of time. It is only even viewed anymore because it had great camera work (for it's time). Let's face it - the plot of this movie is so feeble and paper thin that I can't believe that there are still people defending it as a real work of art. I mean really - A rich guy who longs for his simple childhood on his deathbed - even the people who voted for his film don't watch it again. There are plenty of movies with far better plots than this. The only reason this movie would even be on this list is because it is well aged.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All great films are overrated. That's what makes them so great.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a great film and was recognized for that immediately. The National Board of Review named it Best Picture for 1941, the New York Film Critics Circle named it Best Picture for 1941 and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences nominated it for nine Acadeny Awards for 1941 including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Screenplay, Best Actor, Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing, Best Sound, Best Art Direction and Best Music Score. It won it's only Oscar for Best Screenplay for Orson Welles and Herman J. Mankiewicz. 26 year old Orson Welles in his feature film debut produces, writes, directs and stars in Citizen Kane, a story of a young boy whose family gives him up to be the son of a wealthy man who will guarantee a privileged life and education for the boy. He grows up to lead a newspaper empire and become the world's most wealthiest man and political pawnbroker. Welles had captivated the nation with his radio play adaptation of another Welles in H.G. Welles War of the worlds in 1938. He took his Mercury Theater Players and made the leap from radio to film and produced an epic film his first time out. He was fortunate to get some smart help to bring his vision to reality. First, with veteran screen writer Mankiewicz helped to write a story for film instead of radio. Second, with veteran Cinematographer Gregg Toland who had photographed such films as Queen Kelly, The Westerner, Kidnapped, Wuthering Heights, Intermeazzo and the Grapes of Wrath among his many films and after Kane would go on to do The Outlaw, The Best Years of Our Lives and The Bishops Wife before he died of a heart attack at the age of 44. Toland had worked with Directors Erich Von Stroheim, Mervyn Le Roy, Howard Hawks, King Vidor John Ford, and William Wyler and brought the skill to put Welles' imagination on the screen. Third, Orson Welles found a young film editor who had edited The Hunchback of Notre Dame and My Favorite Wife named Robert Wise who would go on to be an accomplished director himself with such films as The Day the Earth Stood Still, West Side Story, The sound of Music, The Haunting, The sand Pebbles and The Andromeda Strain. Fourth, Welles was entrusted with and got the best out of RKO veterans Art Director Van Nest Polglase, Set Director Darrell Silvera and costume designer Edward Stevenson to work on what would be the most important film of their careers. Fifth, Welles was fortunate to have a young composer named Bernarad Herrmann score his film. Herrmann would go on to be a favorite of Alfred Hitchcock scoring his films Pycho, The Birds, North by Northwest and Vertigo and would score films and television for directors all the way to Taxi Driver. Next, Orson Welles had fortune with RKO Sound Supervisor John Aalberg overseeing the sound for Citizen Kane and finally Welles was surrounded by a great cast in Joseph Cotten, Agnes Moorehead, Ruth Warrick and Everette Sloane among others. Vision, ambition, inspiration, skill, talent and a little luck came together for Welles who was teamed with a lot of talent that collectively wanted it to come together. It results in a 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Legend of Kane lives on after almost over 60 years.......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everything said about this ambitious and powerfully crafted Mastwork was true,and I mean every single thing.A fascinating human drama,character study and visual exploitations.Every shot here has a meaning and not a frame is wasted.From it's dialogues to it's directing and even the terrific performance by Welles is well examined and rightfully given the Honor of the most profoundly and finely made movie in America and perhaps the greatest in the worldwide cinema.It begins off with a brief biography about the rise and fall of Charles Foster Kane.A newspaper mogul who have had fair amount of success and failure. Then we see a bunch of reporters trying desperately to find out the meaning of the last word spoken by Kane,"ROSEBUD".So they interview one person after another who has worked or have know Kane.So as they interview them , his life is told in flashbacks,about how he became who he were and how he fell from grace.Kane was separated from his parents at a very young age,taking away the love of his mother.He is taken by a financier who becomes Kane's guardian.As Kane's hatred for his guardian grows ,he refuses almost everything he asks from Kane.So instead being the heir to his guardian Gold business,he instead decides to run newspaper,sounds fun for him.As his newspaper business becomes successful Kane has only one thing in his mind,that is to help the underprivileged.He spends all his young life to help the poor by insulting the rich through his newspaper.As years past by,he finds himself having everything but love.The love from his wives was never a true love,and the only friends he had were his partners.He was missing the love from his mother,that love made him a lonely man.Despite having everything he had nothing.He wanted everyone to love him,he did everything for the poor so that they could love him back.Instead they hated him in the end,after failing to be elected and keeping false promises. Kane builds a massive mansion for himself which he never completed,just like everything in his life.It was never complete.As he dies in his big mansion with the words ROSEBUD,which no one had a clue what it meant ,from the most influential newspaper chain owner.This film clearly was film way beyond its time.While in the late 30's,people use the same techniques to make a film,Welles broke new grounds.He gave a revolutionary and influential film-making technique that was followed years to come.A flawless ,pitch perfect film,where there's hardly a sign of flaw.Its dialogues,acting,editing,directing,especially its cinematography and even its music,the film is perfection.And aided by the terrific performance by Welles himself in the title role ,it's no surprise why this film was hailed as America's most accomplished works. Its unique camera work and fascinating angles really impressed me,people lurking in shadows,with their emotions mostly hidden in the dark etc.You only see Kane crying while everyone else seem to have been sentimental for him,as if there was no one in the world for him.A man in his mid 20's makes his debut in such an accomplished way,directing,co-writing and even acting in the title role,he really have achieved something with this.Pulling fine performances from the newcomers.He took courage to make something new.A character study.Though Welles,never even came close to have one of his films to be as successful as this one as a director,he still remains a master filmmaker.How many débutantes can hit the spot with their very first film ,especially when you're in your early 20's and the film is America's best film.It's hard to explain a film with such formidable qualities.Not my personal favourite,but it's on my top ten all time favourite list.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Orson Welles' astonishing directorial debut</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Orson Welles' astonishing directorial debut is a tour de force of cinematic technique, narrative innovation and ensemble acting. The story of Charles Foster Kane, a newspaper tycoon based more or less on William Randolph Hearst, unfolds in imaginatively designed flashbacks. Welles and cinematographer Gregg Toland employ chiaroscuro lighting and deep focus photography to create an evocative and rich tapestry that rewards repeated viewing. Welles, as Kane, ages 50 years over the course of the film, aided by makeup artist Maurice Seiderman's wizardry. Welles' Mercury Players, including Joseph Cotten, Agnes Moorehead, Ruth Warrick, Ray Collins, Everett Sloane, and Erskine Sanford, round out an impressive cast.Despite "Kane's" continued status as "greatest film ever," I'm amazed at how many people I encounter who haven't seen it, or worse yet, who watched it only once and thought it was just OK. Believe me: seeing it once is simply not enough! This is true of any great film, but more so for "Kane," which contains countless layers, subtexts, and details that are simply impossible to absorb the first time. In many ways, "Kane" is the Bible of modern cinema: you'll find something new each time you watch it.The greatest movie of all time? Quite possibly, though I believe that 1958's "Touch of Evil" is even better among Welles' own films. But "Kane" is more inexhaustible, and more conducive to repeated viewing and in-depth study. "Citizen Kane" has topped the "Sight and Sound" critics' and directors' polls since 1962, and its #1 status was reinforced yet again in 1998's American Film Institute Top 100 list. Can all the critics, experts, and film buffs all be wrong? Watch "Citizen Kane" - not once, but twice or more - and decide for yourself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie boasted some amazing technical advances (great montages, lighting, spatial perspective, editing, etc.), which seem to have blinded critics over the years as to how little the audience cares about the main character. It's similar (okay, I'm exaggerating a bit) to stating that Jurassic Park is one of the greatest movies ever because it advanced the technology so much. We don't care why Kane turned out to be such a miserable jerk. While the notion of "what/who is rosebud?" drives the film to its conclusion, the payoff is predictable and contrite, and doesn't add much sympathy to the character. This film is far inferior to Welles' own "Touch of Evil".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I get really annoyed at some of the reviews written here because many of the reviewers seem to be writing with some vendetta in mind. They are upset that they did not find a fast-paced but mindless excursion into programmed entertainment. Citizen Kane is not slow, it is not melodramatic, it is not pointless, and the expiration date has not passed. Citizen Kane is quite simply a masterpiece of FILM making.Every word and every gesture of the actors, every pan and zoom by the camera, every note of score, every prop in every scene, every visual focus in a frame, the timing of every edit, or to be quite exact, EVERYTHING in this film fits, has purpose and moves you to the goal of the film: telling a story with all the subtleties true to real life through celluloid.The viewer of Citizen Kane has got to be ready to watch a film, ready to note subtleties as well as blatant story line pieces, ready to think and put together all the parts of this movie to achieve an understanding of its greatness.I would recommend this movie to anyone serious about film, as I would recommend Georgia O'Keeffe to someone who was serious about 20th century art. If you seriously want to understand film and seriously want to understand life and the world, you need to have an open mind and a mind ready to place itself in the context of whatever you are viewing.You might scoff at this film, but if you do, you show your narrow-mindedness and your intolerance of expression. In my opinion this is the Greatest Film Ever Made, and at the rate of film making (or should I say mass-producing?) today, it will have no problem keeping that title well in to the foreseeable future.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although Citizen Kane is not my favorite movie, I still consider it the best movie ever made. And it's surely in my top ten. Charles Foster Kane is the best character and loneliest man ever written. Brilliant film. Flawless in every aspect. I rate it a perfect 10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I won't reiterate what has been already said about the film by countless film critics and movie scholars. As a critic and scholar of film myself, I'm well aware of the innovativeness of Toland's work, the masterful acting by the Mercury Theater players, the brashness and subtleness of Welles' direction -- as well as his portrayal of the title character.I think the highest praise I can give the film is that whenever it is on -- whether I'm playing it or it happens to be on TV -- time seems to stop. My eyes and ears belong to the movie. Even though I know every word nearly by heart, the film just DEMANDS my attention. I can't channel flip when this black-and-white masterpiece is showing. I feel like Francois Truffaut did -- the film is something Welles was never able to replicate again; the stars were aligned in film history for possibly the only time ever (though some, like Casablanca, come damned close!)I doubt one word can describe a man's life -- a thousand can't describe one man's film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie Citizen kane is centered upon a multimillionaire newspaper tycoon by the name Charles Foster Kane. The introducing scene of Citizen Kane is Charles lying on a couch holding a winter looking snow globe. He looks as though he is having troubles breathing as he holds the globe over the edge of the couch. Finally, and expectedly, Kane drops the Globe, and as he does he speaks the mysterious words: "Rosebud." Reporters around the area desire deeply to find out more about his "Rosebud" thats spoken of, so they being interviewing and meeting with some of Kanes closest friends, co-workers, and family.As these close relatives and friends share their memories of Kane, it is all done in a flashback recollection. The reporters hear much detail about kanes life, however all atempts to unlock the Rosebud mystery are a failed attempt.Towards the end of the film we see in the middle of Kanes estate there is a castle. There is a dying man examining a winter like scene within the crystal ball. He droped the globe and only one work is hear: "Rosebud." The following scene shows newspaper and magazine type clips of footage about how kame amased his fortune, and ending with a complete turn around.Overall, this was a great film!!! I can definetly understand why it is said to be one of the best movies of all time. This was the first film to ever have any type of special affects, special lighting, and the technique of flashback scenes. Also, The begining of the movie, is actually starting from the end of the story, which is a very powerfull effect. The movie was so impressive, considering its age. For its time, I would have to agree with certain critcs and say that this is un-doubtedly one of the best videos of all time!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Citizen Kane is perhaps the most original movie ever made. This movie can be credited to only one man who stared in, produced, directed, and help write the screenplay for this movie. This mans name was Orson Wells who at the time was a nobody when it came to movies was only 25 when this movie came out his now famous and highly revered film (citizen Kane).This movie was unique in many regards. One of the ways in which it was unique is in the angles in which it was filmed, wells used many different new angles to show emotion. Wells also employed numerous lighting techniques in his new film. Also (even though there was access to color film) Wells used black and white film. These decisions and the originality of the screen play lead to this movie huge success. The reason the screenplay was so original is the way in which it used time and flashbacks. The movie is about the investigation of one mans life to try and find out what one word means â??rosebudâ??. The entire movie could be summed up in that one word. Though the characters in the story never find out what â??rosebudâ?? is by the end the viewer is left with some understanding of what it means. The name of the man that the movie is focused on is Charles foster Kane. The story of his life is a some what idealistic one, a rags to riches story, but in return for his good fortune and wealth he looses every thing he ever loved even saying him self â??if I hadnâ??t been rich I may have been a great manâ?? when asked he thought he was he replied â??I think I did alright under the circumstancesâ??. These quotes speak wonders of Kane's personality it says that he doesnâ??t think rightly of the person he has become. Kane also seems to lead a double life in part of this movie. One of these lives is as a multimillion heir the other is as the operator of a newspaper. This double life is shown when Kane directly says â?? as you may have noticed I am leading a double life one as the editor of this news paper and the other as the holder of the worlds six largest private fortune in the worldâ??. He seems to be a man who has lost every thing he has ever had and everyone that is talked to points out this fact.This movie gave a lot to the film industry and is credited as being the best movie of all time many people. And though the plot may be hard to follow in the end the viewer learns a valuable lesson. This reviewer would rate this movie a 10 out 10 a perfect example of what a film should be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Citizen Kane uses lots of nifty camera work, with longer shots and such. Also, it's one of the few films I've seen that doesn't manufacture cheap answers.(potential spoilers ahead.)Charles Foster Kane, a rich and powerful man, has just died. His last word was "rosebud" and a reporter is searching for its meaning.Rosebud is the word embedded on Kane's childhood sled. It, and the glass ball, represent his childhood, his innocence, and life before fame and riches twisted him and turned his heart black.Chaw. Citizen Kane is a great movie, and anyone who says otherwise knows nothing of cinema. Perhaps not the greatest film in history, but in my books, it is the greatest American film in history.</fullReview>

Innovative story structure, great directing, solid acting, and wonderful cinematography.If you watch this film just once you'll appreciate the significance of "Rosebud." If you study it in depth you'll uncover many interesting facets of American culture, history, and humanity.You're _not_ going to enjoy this film if your idea of a great movie is "Gone In Sixty Seconds" or "Independence Day." Some knowledge of American culture and cinema during the 1920s to 1940s will go a long way to understanding and appreciating this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The oddest thing about Citizen Kane is how it doesn't seem "old" like other black and white movies with old slang, polite plot lines, and guy-gets-girl endings. Even the camera angles are surprisingly new-looking. The plot is that Citizen Kane is real rich and famous with his newspaper, praised and admired by all but has conflicts in his personal life. But the plot isnt at all important to the themes of the movie. Also, Citizen Kane doesnt strike me as a "character in a movie" in the sense that he's either A. A stereotype B. A flawless hero or C. someone who goes through a big important change in his life. He seems like a real person in a documentary. In short, I think it's was an amazing movie, more than just entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just to mention a few things that haven't been said already about this Great Film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*****Major Spoilers Ahead***** Seriously, don't read this unless you've seen the film!!!!!Citizen Kane is a film that I have seen maybe 20 times and I am always amazed at how many new things I see with each viewing. As a film student, I studied this film for 4 different classes and each class showed me different ways of viewing it. After my second viewing, my first professor told me that there were TWO meanings for Rosebud, not just the obvious one and our assignment was to figure it out using a semiotic approach. I would never have guessed that the second meaning was Susan Alexander's clitoris! Nope, I'm not kidding. Watch it again and see how subtly it is implied. This is actually a nickname that William Randolph Hearst (the man Kane is based on) had for his mistress' clitoris. See "RKO 281" (1999) for more about this as well as "The Cat's Meow" (2001) for more about Hearst/Kane.The shots are so carefully constructed and relate so well to the themes of the story, with each one telling you a lot about Kane's character. For example, during the newsreel, Kane gets wet concrete on his jacket and the camera suddenly cuts without changing angles and the concrete disappears; this relates to how his character hides his weaknesses. This is a subtle way for Kane to cover this up, yet this is left just apparent enough for the film audience to understand what Kane did to the newsreel. Yes, this newsreel was constructed after Kane's death, yet it is footage captured while he was alive and since Kane would never allow that to be seen and has a monopoly on the media, he had it cut from the original footage. You all may be thinking that I am reading way to far into this film, however these are all things that I learned in college. There are some films for which you really need an education in fine arts to appreciate many aspects of them. The story itself can get tiresome, but it is not the story that really makes this film one of the greatest; it is how well the Director conveys his ideas. "The less obviously a filmmaker reveals his intentions, the better the film." This applies for art films such as this, but not for junk like "Half-Baked." This is a film that uses the language of images, not so much the plot, to convey its ideas. Masterful direction, storytelling, and performances. They just don't get better than this! *****/*****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An unforgettable classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just a couple of nights ago I had the privilege of watching Citizen Kane, and although this may be a movie that isn't recommended for teens, I absolutely loved it. The classic masterpiece that launched Orson Welles into the film industry is easily one of the greatest films of all time.Citizen Kane has an intriguing beginning. Welles easily captures you with the scenes of Kane's province, first showing a "No Trespassing" sign that instantly let me know I was watching a great movie. The camera moves up to Charles Kane on his death bed, where he mutters the unforgettable word "Rosebud" and then drops his snow globe. When the News On The March part began I was charmed, and it was very creative. I'll admit I was fooled a bit, thinking that the whole film was going to be a news show. But instead it develops into a plot that revolves around a journalist searching for what Kane meant by Rosebud. The film shows Kane's life from the day he was adopted by a rich man named Mr. Thatcher and continues on through the many interesting debacles and triumphs that surrounded him for the rest of his days. What can I say? The film is incredible. It has many great characters and plenty of interesting aspects that make you glad you're watching it. It moves you during every second. I was amazed by the many great scenes and moments, such as Kane's speech during his run for governor, Kane watching his wife sing at the opera in disbelief, and his tantrum when he threw objects across the room after the departure of his second wife and then discovered his snow globe, which made him realize that he longed for the simple days of his childhood. Very few movies have been able to recapture the magic of Citizen Kane. I may not agree with most people on the statement that it's THE greatest movie of all time, but I love it anyway and it's one of my favorites.Overall rating: 4 out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a masterpiece by the standards of its day</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whilst Citizen Kane represented a masterpiece in innovative technique and the consummate skills of one person (Orson Welles), it stands up less well by today's standards. The story of a newspaper magnate who rides roughshod over everyone in an effort to prove that he helps the underclasses is riddled with sexism and class values that the film makes little or no attempt to dispel. There is hardly a lovable character in the whole film, the final revelation is too obscure to fathom unless you can re-wind the video, and the pacing is such that it can make tiring viewing.On the other hand it contains superb acting, a brilliant script, and enough lighting and camera techniques to keep film students in homework for years. A critics' delight it may be, but for the filmgoer, whilst well above the average, it hardly ranks the "best film of all-time" appellation that has become its fashionable accolade.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Orson Welles and his dated monstrosity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A boy is separated from his family and is abducted into a life of luxury and money. However at the end of his life he realizes that money can't buy love nor can it replace the affection of a family.So what? who cares? who didn't already know this? I mean, can this movie be any more insipid? Can this movie be any more cold, clinical or lackluster?Much has been said about Citizen Kane's technical greatness, about it's innovations, and that's the reason why most people consider it the greatest film ever done. So what are you telling me? That just because Orson Welles put his camera here and used some shadows there it makes this film superior to all the other true works of art like La Strada? Are you telling me that technical values are more important than artistic values? Because that's pretty much what Citizen Kane is: a gutless exercise in style. If technical innovations were any important why isn't The Jazz Singer the greatest film ever done. It was the first film to incorporate sound to movies and that's much more important than any of the tricks Welles pulls out of his ass throughout this movie. But The Jazz Singer gets no respect (and rightfully so since it's such a mediocre movie), so why on earth does Citizen Kane gets so much praise? It's not like it was the first film to use any of those techniques. Deep focus, low camera angles, use of shadows, they had all been used before and they have all been used after, and many times they have given much better individual results. Citizen Kane is only historically significant for being the first film to use them all in one film (since then on Orson Welles has been given the credit for something he didn't come up with). Innovations are just innovations, new things, and more than half a century later it's stupid to think they still mean anything.On top of it, Citizen Kane is pretty average in every other aspect. There's not one single memorable performance in the film. Joseph Cotton is fine but he had the bad luck of having to share the screen with Welles (belting out one of the most distastefully over-the-top performances of his career). The performances do come alive at times and that's entirely due to the great script co-written by Welles himself and Herman Mankiewicz. To tell you the truth if Herman was anything like his brother, all the witty and memorable phrases in the film are his doing. They're fast, intelligent and they provide Kane with its most relaxed moments. The rest of the script (which I suppose was Welles's work) is too melodramatic and pretentious.But more than that, Citizen Kane fails to accomplish one of the primary goals of any movie: connect with the audience. I don't know what Welles was thinking when he thought anybody was going to identify with this megalomaniac who makes life impossible for everyone around him and stills expects them to love him, understand him, and keep an open mind about him at all times. I normally wouldn't have a problem with characters that are emotionally unavailable, they make for some interesting character studies, but this is ridiculous. Normally director's have the good judgement to show both sides of the character, his bad side and his good side, but Charles Foster Kane's personality is so big and strong he comes off as a plain simple bastard. I can't imagine anyone saying: "Gee, I watched Citizen Kane and I really felt it spoke to me", maybe Louis B. Meyer did, maybe Welles himself did, maybe Bill Gates does, but all of us this side of the socio-economical spectrum can't help but just don't care. Really, I don't care about Charles Foster Kane's life, I don't care about his feelings and I don't care about a single frame of this movie.Maybe when the movie was released it was actually significant, with all its innovations but after so many years those innovations don't matter anymore, and that's when a movie really dates. Go ahead and watch it, but if you've seen films like Pulp Fiction, The Godfather, Persona, 8 1/2, Battleship Potemkin, Andrei Rublev, Rashomon, etc, then be prepared to be disappointed by a movie that doesn't live up to its reputation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a Canadian, I risk losing my citizenship for being so harsh, but I have suffered in silence long enough. By way of background, I am a hardcore cinephile and studied Film Production at university, so I am reasonably well-versed in the language of cinema. So, here goes nothing:Whhhhyyyy do people think this is such a brilliant film? My suspicion is that the accolades that are heaped on this film are offered by well-intended viewers who mistake novel cinematography for substance. Trouble is, the cinematic devices used in this film become annoying very quickly, and I can't imagine audiences sitting through a similarly shot film in the present day.Orson Welles was a exemplary filmmaker, as evidenced by 'The Magnificent Ambersons' and 'Rebecca', but I have the strangest feeling that Citizen Kane was little more than a clever inside joke on his part. Granted the story was interesting, and the performances were strong, but bizarre camera angles do not make a film a work of genius!My point is this - don't love a film because everyone else does. Be brave enough to trust your gut and speak out against the herd. And really, when a herd mindlessly worships a film like 'Citizen Kane', it's time to 'flock off'.I'd generously rate this film 6/10.</fullReview>

However, I gave this movie a 7/10 instead of my usual 10/10.This movie wasn't long, but I gave myself an intermission in the middle. I was interested and bored at the same time. There were some scenes in it that keep you in suspense, and then there are those that just make you want them to get to the point. The movie itself was acted out well. Orson Welles did very well in this movie. In fact, I liked the political issues. Unfortunately, the movie got TOO political. Not necessarily bad, but there are some scenes that I believe could have lost some of the fat. Do I think the movie is overrated? No. This movie was excellent. Putting aside the boring parts that allowed my brain to wander, I thought the movie was done very well. In fact, I liked the newsreel at the beginning. It looked very authentic. I also liked how they got into issues like yellow journalism and adultery-committing politicians. Its lasting appeal was great IMO. I wouldn't mind watching this classic again. However, if you have ADD, watch something else. I gave this movie a 7/10 because it's really for people who have alot of patience. If this is you, watch this movie. You'll love it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A breathtakingly beautiful film that is crafted and/or constructed perfectly. The acting is sensational, the direction is flawless, the writing is brilliant, and the cinematography, wow, the cinematography is amazing and perhaps the best of any film. This film lands you in a world that is both glorious and disturbing, the character of Charles Foster Kane is one that is so well drawn out and so brilliantly played (by, who else, but Orson Welles himself) that we are able to make a connection to this guy and become totally enthralled in his world and his doings no matter how corrupt the things he did were. It is never boring, it is, from the very first frame to the very last frame, one of the most intriguing films ever made and, possibly most importantly, it hasn't aged! It feels as if it were just made today but with a black and white camera instead of a color camera. If it weren't for the fact that I am forever a devoted fan of `The Godfather' and `Casablanca`, I would say that this is greatest film of ever made. I am the kind of film buff that honestly believes that there are some films out there where every word of praise is an absolute understatement, this, my friends, is one of those films, so this review is now complete.Final Grade: * * * * * (out of 5, meaning 'masterpiece')</fullReview>

		<fullReview>CITIZEN KANE is not only what I consider the finest piece of cinema ever created, but is one of my personal favorites to watch multiple times. After you get over the fact that "Rosebud" means nothing, you can enjoy the best cinematography ever captured. Okay, so you're not into the visual aspects of movies? Than you should enjoy the convoluted story-telling, as out-of-order as new independent-style films like PULP FICTION, and MEMENTO. The acting in this film is great (especially Joseph Cotten) and I enjoy the fact that Orson Wells was making fun of William Randolph Hearst (even though only a few parts of this film are based on Hearst's life). I can't understand how people can't admire, if not like this film. By the way, I'm in high school.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Greatest, for a reason</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In June 1998, on a much-publicized list, the American Film Institute named `Citizen Kane' America's Greatest Movie, sparking a controversy that rages to this day. Since then, when people watch `Citizen Kane', they've been analyzing it and dissecting to see why it made the list. They completely have forgotten what made it so great (Minor spoilers). I, for one, am one of those who think any greatest movie list is ridiculous. I believe a person should have several favorite movies and if they are asked what is their favorite, they can name one of those. But they need to know why. `Citizen Kane' is one of these I would name because it's so creative. Every scene is a delight to watch in terms of cinematography, lighting, sound, writing, music or acting. Almost everyone was in their film debuts: Orson Welles, Joe Cotton, Everett Sloane, Agnes Moorehead, Dorothy Comingore, Ruth Warrick, Ray Collins, Erskine Sanford, William Alland, Paul Stewart and George Coulouris are all excellent in their debuts and most would have long careers. It's difficult to name who is the best, but I think that Cotton, Sloane and Moorehead were the best in all their scenes. Welles and Coulouris would be the runners up.  There are other elements that make the film work: The script of Welles and Herman Mankiewicz (Strangely, the film's only Oscar winner), the music score of Bernard Herrmann, the photography of Gregg Toland (The only major team member with previous film experience), the film editing of Robert Wise (Who would have a great career as a director), and the sound created by Bailey Fesler and James G. Stewart. Blend all these elements together, allow to bake and you got a great movie.  Film Critic Pauline Kael once called Rosebud a gimmick. Indeed, this is correct. At first, it seems to explain everything, but it also explains nothing. The movie has such a great story because it gives us the inside on the life of a rich and famous celebrity, the kind we are always interested in. Rosebud is the key of newsreel reporter Jerry Thompson (William Alland), as well as ours, to unlocking the life of Charles Kane. We really never sympathize with Kane since he is a jerk. He uses people to his own advantage and he kicks anyone around who gets in his way. Nevertheless, the life is fascinating. The screenplay was also one of the first to take liberties in the plot. It doesn't have a linear narrative, but rather jumps from interview to interview, from event to event. Event after 60+ years of age, the movie is still as fresh and entertaining as though it were made yesterday, just as it will be 60 years from now. If you decide to watch the movie for the first time, do not expect it to be the greatest movie you have ever seen. Rather, don't expect anything. Expect just another movie and you will get your money's worth. On the cinema mountain range, there are few on the same height as `Citizen Kane' (Dr. Strangelove is the only movie I would place on Kane's level, for its brilliance, its acting and its creativity). Unfortunately, many of today's future directors aren't getting raised on films like this. In fact, when I told someone about it recently, they said `Citizen Kane? Is that a movie?' That's a shame, for the filmmakers of tomorrow need better inspiration than the disposable movies of today. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Mona Lisa of film...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Apparently (since I have not read any..) texts on film universally proclaim this as a masterpiece of technique, an exceptionally daring indictment of Hearst whose suppression of the film has undoubtedly added to its strange mystique. However, what was innovative quickly becomes routine and dated. What was once (overly) clever caricature eventually becomes as unintelligible and irrelevant as Shakespeare's puns. The glaring weakness in Citizen Kane that sets it apart from the handful of films that claim to be great is that it lacks a strong timeless theme. People can still relate to the eternal triangle in Casablanca, or the dutiful nobility of the seven samurai or even the pluckiness of Scarlett O'Hara. In contrast, Kane is neither a great nor likable character. His problems are too distant and portrayed too distantly, to be of much care to the common man. Hence, now that the gaudy trappings have faded, there is no heart and soul to resonate with modern audiences. To me the film is like the Mona Lisa. Crowds throng around it and gaze admiringly, listening to the commentary on their porta-guides which explain the wondrous techniques employed. Not that it isn't good, but I somehow think that those crowds wouldn't be there, were it not for its reputation and if they were to answer honestly, most would admit that they couldn't see what all the fuss was about...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great or Greatest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Citizen Kane is a great movie. Some say it is the greatest. I have discovered that such distinction is unfair and impossible to objectively support. Granted the artistic presentation is superb and was revolutionary in its time, but in the realm of greatness the way an artist presents his work can only augment the important ideas presented. We go to see Mars Attacks for the all-star cast and perhaps a few laughs, but nothing of real value is ever presented or implied in those two horrifying hours.However, in addition to its artistic power Citizen Kane does contain universal themes, which can still apply to our lives today. Orson Welles' movie shows the tragic consequences of a spiritually or emotionally selfish life. Its themes combined with the artistic presentation make this movie great. But besides this distinction I see no evidence to place it above other movies that also present universal themes in emotional and artistic ways (movies such as Braveheart or Cast Away). Distinctions of `the greatest' can only be made according to one's particular tastes. We all identify with characters and the themes and challenges they encounter for different reasons and to differing degrees. Therefore, we should merely leave objective analysis of movies to the distinction of greatness rather than risk human favoritism in choosing the greatest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Through striking imagery and well thought out camera work, Orson Welles' Citizen Kane (1941) conveys a message that has endured the generations. I still can't decide whether or not I liked this movie, but many of the themes and underlying implications had a lasting effect on me. The interesting camera angles and mind provoking shots make up for a plot that drags at some points, but ultimately I believe that this film's reputation has endured based on the timeless themes that left me questioning my own beliefs. Welles presents his audience with a character who is so consumed with gaining power and buying love that he misses making true connections with the people in his life. Charles Foster Kane suffers a lonely death in his mansion, leaving behind the cluttered piles of objects he used in his quest to buy friendship and respect. What he didn't understand was that life is measured more by the people and lives that you truly touch, not by your money or possessions. Welles constantly reminds the audience that riches are wonderful, but when you obtain them at the expense of everything else, you are missing out on living. Ultimately, these ideas give Citizen Kane its staying power because they raise questions about life and love that haven't changed in the past sixty years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A testament to the power of cinema, and the power of art</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>`Citizen Kane' is a film that begins with the death of a man's body and ends with the cremation of his soul. It is a story that is told through the memories of several people who each know only bits and pieces of Charles Foster Kane; none of them can honestly say they know him as a complete human being. The only thing they are all sure of is that Kane is a man who wanted something he could never give: love. The moment he left his mother's boarding house, his whole life became preoccupied with money, scandal, and politics. There was never room for anything else.`It's probably a very simple thing,' says a newspaper editor in response to Kane's final spoken word: `Rosebud.' We have just seen a newsreel that chronicles, on a very superficial level, the life of one of the world richest and most powerful men. The images of his huge mansion being built, complete with swimming pools, tennis courts, gardens, and zoos, sharply contrast with the dark, gloomy, empty atmosphere that was presented at the beginning of the film and will be seen again at the end. Xanadu is now a ruin, a broken home for a broken man. The testimonies of Kane's friends and family strip away the gloss provided by the newsreel, documenting the emotional spiral downward for one of America's most influential people.Kane mistakenly believes that the best way to win love from another person is through controlling them. This is best seen in the scenes where he tries, like Professor Higgins from Shaw's `Pygmalion,' to make his second wife an opera star. Of course, he could also be doing this to make her more `respectable,' so she can be placed on a pedestal like his first wife, who was the President's niece. But by this point in the film, it is clear that Kane is a very lonely man at heart, and desperately needs the honest affection of another person. He has become aware of the emptiness of his possessions.Kane's anger towards his loneliness grows into an impassioned fury, and he tears apart his room in a scene that ends by partially repeating what we have seen in the opening: he finds a glass globe with the image of a shack in it, holds it for a second, and says `Rosebud.' Then he walks away, the last we will see of him in the film. Baffled, the reporters leave his Xanadu as its contents are being either sold off or burned. One of them refers to their unsuccessful search as `playing with a jigsaw;' they have found every piece but one. The camera pans past the statues, jewelry, antiques, and valuables to see the `scrap' items that have no monetary value being burned away. Among them is Rosebud itself, the sled Kane loved playing with as a child; earlier in the film, when he was visiting Susan Alexander for the first time, he mentioned having just traveled back from his mother's funeral with a few of his childhood possessions. Rosebud was one of those toys, the last thing Kane was holding on to before being dragged away into a life of gold and silver. Love, after all, is something that cannot be bought or sold.Perhaps, then, Kane really had the ability to love the entire time. He just couldn't use it because it was buried beneath everything he had bought with his earnings. When Kane cries out for his sled in his dying breath, he is pleading for a return to the innocence of his childhood, before his life became a whirl of buying and spending. For all his financial and social power, Kane only wanted what every human being needs.`Citizen Kane' is frequently ranked by critics and audiences as the greatest film of all time, or at least somewhere in the top five. It received the `no. 1' crown by the American Film Institute when they named their 100 favorites, which impressed me since I thought they would go the sentimental route and put `Gone With the Wind' or `Star Wars' at the top (although I was still a bit upset that none of Welles' other films, including `The Magnificent Ambersons' and `Touch of Evil,' made the list). Personally, I'm not sure what my `all-time' favorite movie is; I have seen many great films in my twenty years, and sorting them out in some kind of precise order is already too difficult. But there is no doubt in my mind that Welles' masterpiece is one of the truly mesmerizing achievements of cinema, right up there with Kurosawa's `Seven Samurai,' Renoir's `Grand Illusion,' Tarkovsky's `Andrei Rublev,' Bergman's `Wild Strawberries,' Disney's `Fantasia,' Truffaut's `Jules and Jim,' and my childhood favorite, the Technicolor classic `The Thief of Bagdad.' It is one of those few films that always has something new up its sleeve every time you watch it, a different present for each member of the audience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>crap...but</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Citizen Kane is a movie that has become a legend in its own time, and done so to such a degree that I'm even hesitant to be at all critical. I have to admit that Orson Welles certainly had guts to virtually create such a transparent ridicule of a powerful Croesus such as William Randolph Hearst.Have any of you dared to read the book? Oh, well, it doesn't really contribute much more than is already present in the movie. I had a college History professor who specialized in courses on the oddballs of history. It was his contention (valid, I might add) that history isn't made by the sane or tradition-bound. History, he said, is made by the misfits, oddballs, weirdos, and just plain crazy. Both Welles and Hearst fit that description.Imagine someone with enough money to build a castle like San Simeon, with a dining hall that could feed 250 at a sitting, inviting the most prestigious movie stars, politicians, and even visiting royalty -- and having catsup and paper napkins on the tables! Then, imagine a young genius who is not only aware of his genius but so preoccupied with demonstrating it that he is prepared to alienate the entire Nation if necessary (almost successful with the broadcast of War of The Worlds), and pit them against each other.The publisher who is riddled with the privileged idiosyncrasies of the exhorbitantly rich, and the egomaniac who is determined to reveal them all to the whole world. HBO recently presented a very good (and fairly objective -- fairly, not wholly) look at the making of Citizen Kane in its in-house movie "RKO 281" which was the project number of the movie.Watching RKO 281 even made me hungry to watch Citizen Kane again, which was the most unlikely desire in the world and one which was unfortunately satisfiable because I have a copy of Citizen Kane. If this suggests to you that I am not a fan of the movie, you are correct. I am fully prepared to acknowledge the creativity which went into the making of the film. I am fully prepared to acknowledge the genius of Orson Welles. In fact, one of the female stars (Dorothy Cummingore) was my mother's closest friend in High School.Despite all this, and despite the nagging mystery of Rosebud, I found and still find Citizen Kane dark, overly plodding, and boring the the extreme. Granted, I can understand Hearst's reluctance to let anyone ridicule his illicit love affair with Marion Davies (for fear of the harm it would do her career, not his), but really now, how much damage could Citizen Kane do if it was simply ignored and allowed to sink into its own turgidity. (how's that for coining a phrase?)Anyhow, I didn't like this film, despite its inherent intellectual greatness. More, I wouldn't recommend it to my own worst enemy, no matter what provocation. If you are bound and determined to find out about Citizen Kane, and about Welles versus Hearst, check out HBO's "RKO 281" instead. Cheers....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Technically great, poor story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now that I've watched Citizen Kane, I realize that it is "technically" excellent - meaning, it is very well-acted and -filmed. Doubtless you will get a big charge out of the film if you are the type of person who is interested in the way a film is crafted. Now that I've seen the movie, I understand that many of the glowing comments on IMDB about this film are made by this type of person.If you are the type of person who likes a very good story, one that draws you in and keeps you focused on the story until the end of the movie, you'll probably be let down.I thought Citizen Kane was beautiful to look at, but I found the story and storytelling to be of lower quality than the rest of the film. It takes around 15 minutes for the movie to actually get started, and then the rest of the two hours are filled with the search for "Rosebud", while the (story-oriented) viewer is still wondering why he or she should care. As far as I'm concerned, the story isn't good enough to get the viewer interested. When "Rosebud" is finally revealed, the symbolism and the point of the movie are obvious, but so is the lack of a good story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So why do people say Kane is the greatest movie ever made?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's hard to see Kane plainly for the voices you hear on either side of you now-- the one telling you it's the greatest movie ever made, and the other one (represented by so many people here) asking, what's the big deal? Here's an attempt at an historical answer for why Kane has been regarded as supremely great-- and whether there is any justice in the claim.Throughout the 1930s there was a certain critical faction, especially in New York, that felt that the art of the cinema died with the arrival of talkies-- that movies got visually dull and politically timid in dealing with the important issues of the time (remember that the whole debate about whether Hollywood should make social problem/message movies like The Grapes of Wrath would have just happened when Kane was made). That Hollywood had sold out for the buck, turned its back on geniuses like Griffith and Stroheim and the kind of cinematic art represented by German Expressionist classics like The Last Laugh and Sunrise. The capper on the whole decade would have been the enormous hype for Gone With the Wind, a masterpiece of middlebrow sentiment that even the New York critics were cowed into tiptoeing around. (Read the NY Times review, in which future Searchers screenwriter Frank Nugent feels compelled to argue, a bit nervously, why it might NOT be automatically the greatest movie ever made.) Once in a while these critics had managed to make a certain smaller noise about a movie they felt met their criteria, such as John Ford's The Informer, which was about as good an imitation of a German Expressionist silent picture as Hollywood ever made.Along comes a New York theater figure, Welles, who makes a movie which looks like The Informer (even using a cinematographer who had worked with Ford and apprenticed under the cinematographer of The Last Laugh), but unlike the somewhat ponderously arty Informer has a much livelier American-feeling pace that links it to the tradition of American newspaper comedy-dramas. Where cameras had been mostly parked at a two-shot distance for ten years, Welles uses his like a silent filmmaker, diving through skylights and burrowing in for mammoth closeups. He plays with the medium by starting his movie with another movie, a newsreel, which he mocks brilliantly (and there were plenty of people in New York then who delighted in the mocking of the Time-Life empire). And he dares to poke its nose into the personal life of a still-feared and influential figure, Hearst, at a time when, say, Hollywood could make a movie about the Dreyfus case 40 years before and still be too timid to say the word "Jew." So not surprisingly, the critics, thinking that most of humanity thinks Gone With the Wind is the best movie ever made, jump all over a movie that seems to have been made just for them and say, no, HERE'S the greatest movie ever made. As it happened, few agreed with them at first, but starting some time in the 50s, when the film started to be seen again at 16mm film societies, its reputation spread and as a result, where it wasn't even mentioned on the first Sight &amp; Sound International Critics Poll in 1952, it has placed #1 every ten years since (though perhaps in 2002 it will finally give way, probably to Godfather I &amp; II).But you look at it today... and you say, so what's so great about it.Well, in one regard it's suffered the fate of so many innovative films-- it has been influential to death. (How many more Abysses and Mission to Marses can 2001: A Space Odyssey take before it suffers the same fate?)Within a very short time the German Expressionist-influenced look of Kane became the shadowy look of film noir. The flashback-narration structure, which seemed very innovative at the time (although the critics would have all just seen it in the French film Le Jour se Leve-- but that may have been a bonus for Welles rather than a detriment), was also picked up by dozens of thrillers in no time. (Go rent The Mask of Dimitrios if you want to see Kane practically remade as a crime thriller.) And, of course, the idea of telling the inside story of a famous person's life is no longer the province of daring art, but of glossy trash like The Greek Tycoon and The Carpetbaggers.It took somewhat longer for Welles' camera style to be absorbed. For decades only a few maverick stylists like Stanley Kubrick used the camera like a pen the way Welles did. But since the era of the music video and the Steadicam, suddenly everyone does. Welles' style seems rather staid after you've watched the camera glide through the bar in Goodfellas, chase dogs through a grocery store in Raising Arizona, and stick up a pharmacy in Natural Born Killers.So what does Kane still have to offer? Well, for one, a deep sense of mortality and moral decline and failure, an almost Shakespearean psychology, that's extraordinary in a 26-year-old filmmaker. Second, a density and richness of visual imagery that deserves to be seen on the big screen, where Welles' and Toland's black and white chiaroscuro can be at its most seductive. But before you go to it, rent a couple of ordinary movies of the late 30s-- best of all a couple of biographies or historical films, perfectly enjoyable in themselves, like The Life of Emile Zola or In Old Chicago-- and then, with their visual style in your head, try to recapture a bit of how Welles seemed to set the camera-- and the director-- free.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Xanadu of motion picture classics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though not top on my personal favorites list, it's still pretty much the greatest film ever made for a wide and varied number of fascinating reasons. The genius behind it is undeniable, and it is THE film for seeing things in the more times you see it. Welles was aiming for a high level of technical ingenuity, a goal he accomplished with brilliant aplomb as the style of the filmmaking overturns every Hollywood convention before 1941, and set the standard thereafter. The only filmmaker of stature who had dabbled in expressionistic and innovative camera angles in the 1930's was John Ford. Welles credited Ford as being his visual influence, then he took innovation to a new height, creating so many new devices and techniques to tell his story both visually and orally that every director who was an artist at heart couldn't not have admired it. There was an understandable hatred for Welles when he blew into Hollywood, the 24 year old upstart boy wonder, full of ego, charisma and a with cheerful and swaggering disregard for the Hollywood establishment. He was dangerous and a threat, and people would have known he didn't come from New York to direct a musical in the vein of The Wizard of Oz. Welles was going to do something to shock, to stir opinions and passions, and to show the world he WAS the only director in town. A tall order. After a couple of initial projects fizzled the winds of fate carried Citizen Kane to his feet. A vitriolic and condemning character study based on the tyrannical William Randolph Hearst was not ever going to be popular entertainment but it fit Welles' needs precisely. Along with writer Mankiewicz, and cinematographer Greg Toland (who had worked with Ford), he conspired to create a film so gargantuan in its aspirations, so self promoting, so wickedly sharp in its observations, and so gleefully clever you couldn't help but take notice of it, especially in it's unveiling of the meaning(s) behind the word Rosebud. Once you think of how a child usually rides a sled it strikes you as obvious. Kane as a boy is first seen riding the sled on his belly, and it's symbolic of the sexual position he would have assumed with Susan Alexander, who was based on Hearst's Mistress Marion Davies, whom it was rumoured Hearst had nicknamed an obvious part of her anatomy "Rosebud". Roger Ebert says at the end of his audio commentary on the DVD that the sled Rosebud really explains nothing but I beg to differ. It explains, like a great piece of art, any number of things. A symbol of boyhood innocence, that place he wishes he was never torn from, his regrets etc etc. Along, of course, with the more intended sexual connotation. Citizen Kane truly is a haunting, emotionally cold, and ultimately depressive piece of work. And for that reason alone it won't top everyone's personal favorites list. It is at times very hard to watch and work out. But it is the most profound and intelligent film of it's day and it pays off many rewards the more times you visit it. Fluff it was not. It destroyed Welles' directorial career in Hollywood, and no doubt shortened the life of William Randolph Hearst in his determination to blacklist Welles. It's a story that speaks the truth about corruption, power, and materialism, and how one man, however forceful, can become dwarfed by and be enslaved by them. It is a work of pure brilliance in writing, showmanship, technical illusion, and improvisation. A film for the ages. A testament to the other worldly genius of Orson Welles. And a definite must see for everyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An influential and important cinematic landmark</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anyone who considers themself a film buff has undoubtedly viewed Citizen Kane at least once or certainly heard of it. It is simply one of the most lauded and recognizable films ever made in any language. It tops many alltime greatest films lists, including that by the American Film Institute. It is a required piece of viewing in any beginning film school. It's filming techniques and cinematography redefined the way films are made. It contains one of the most famous characters in cinema history, and the character isn't even human! These and many other points help to distinguish Citizen Kane as a true classic, but the real value of it comes from who made it.Orson Welles, at the age of 26, wrote, directed, and starred in this monumental film. Showing extrordinary talent in each regard, he solidifed his place in the annals of filmlore. He was a magician with a movie camera, and using it he created many images that were considered impossible to film at the time this was made. Although impressive, the camerawork never overshadows the story, which centers around the life of powerful media mogul Charles Foster Kane, a not so subtle takeoff of William Randolph Hearst. The supporting cast is great in telling the life story of Kane, but Welles and his camera are the real stars.Citizen Kane can be viewed as THE art film, but it has entertainment value as well. Each viewing presents something new and and innovative, and it is certainly watchable more than once. That is what makes Citizen Kane the great film it is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So....Citizen Kane was voted the number one film of all time by the American Film Institute but that doesn't mean we have to like it. As a film buff in long standing I still can't figure out what makes the film so great. After a few viewings throughout the years I become bored after about 40 minutes and when its over I'm sitting there wondering what all the fuss is about. I'll go as far as to agree its a fairly good account of a publishers rise to power but not a great one although the black and white cinematography and the score by Bernard Herrmann are assets to the film. Of the players Agnes Moorehead, Everett Sloane and Paul Stewart steal the acting honors. It also bemuses me that the film was nominated for 9 Academy Awards and only won one for the screenplay. Could it be that the Academy didn't feel it was so great in 1941? I wonder why? I submise that through the years some critics and film historians decided to boost the film to classic status which ultimately force fed film fans and some critics into actually believing the film is great and not to look naive we went along for the ride. Today we realize that Citizen Kane was not a factual account and as far as I'm concerned it all boils down to artistic claptrap. By the way the film that took the Oscar in 1941 was How Green Was My Valley directed by John Ford. Now thats a classic!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Listed as one of the best movies ever made and #1 on the American Film Institute's list of greatest movies, this is a remarkable movie for a number of reasons. Wells made this movie when he was only in his mid twenties! RKO studio's gave him full run of the studio's facilities, yet he'd never made a movie in his life. Most of the cast were friends of his from his radio days in New York. The obvious real-life Kane, William Randolph Hearst, did everything in his (considerable) power to stop the movie. He nearly succeeded. Refusing to show the movie at any of his theaters, it was could only be seen at a few RKO movie houses. Had the movie played on more screens at its release, it would have been much more successful. Wells won an Oscar for the screenplay (his only one) but credit must be shared with Herman Mankiewicz.</fullReview>

My vote is, and always will be, for Orson Welles' "Citizen Kane." From where else do we learn the concept of tilt, as far as the cinematographer knows it? The man actually had his crew TEAR OUT a section of the floor of a beautiful mansion just to set a scene where he felt the leading man (Charles Kane) needed to have a commanding view of the supporting actress. Figure it out--if you don't already think that this film is one of the most influential in Hollywood's history, you really need to have your head examined.</fullReview>

The film is so amazing because at the age of 25, Welles managed to co-write the screenplay, get the film produced, direct and starred in it! The film is also a miracle it is around today for it was loosely based on the real life newspaper mogul William Randolph Hearst who tried to not only stop the film from getting released but who also tried to destroy the negative!

		<fullReview>Well, that and "Casablanca"(which is "the" movie). Where "Casablanca" is hailed by critics from all times and places as "the" movie, "Citizen Kane" is hailed by critics from all times and places as the greatest film of all time.Why? Ah, the immortal question. One of which I decline to answer. So many people have told me during conversation that they either hated "Citizen Kane" or haven't seen it. You want to be a film-goer? Then NEVER dismiss this movie!!!!!! This is the silent giant, the film that is very often dismissed and unfortunately so. There are so many examples like this, but "Citizen Kane" is the most ironic and unfortunate of all the classic examples.I urge anyone bothering to read this comment to see this movie. I say again, you're not allowed to have a favourite movie if you haven't seen it. You tell me "Star Wars" is your favourite movie, I'll ask; 'Have you seen "Citizen Kane"?' You tell me "The Godfather" is your favourite movie, I'll ask; 'Have you seen "Citizen Kane"?' You tell me "The Blob" is your favourite movie and...well, I probably won't bother asking because you obviously have no taste, but you get the idea!"Citizen Kane" is everything I had hoped for in a movie. It is not my favourite(It's number 4 on my list), but, seriously, how could movies get much better? It's one of those "before-their-time" films, it's a technological breakthrough, it's intelligent, emotional, entertaining, imaginative, the kind of film that you like to talk about. One thing it is not: It does not draw you into its centre as a kind of "out-of-body" movie experience. But, of all non "out-of-body" movie experiences, it is the best. In fact, if I had never had an "out-of-body" movie experience, this would probably be my all-time favourite film. But it's not. "The Wizard of Oz" is. Anyway...10/10.P.S.: See this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Citizen Kane is perhaps the most important film ever made. It's innovations of cinematography and plot are amazing even almost sixty years later. It is a sight to behold. It is all those things, but it is also just an enjoyable film to watch. Orson Wells tells the story of Charles Foster Kane, who goes from idealistic to ambitious, to a corporate monster. The way that Wells lets this brilliant story unfold is breathtaking, as is his entire troupe, who never push us further than we are willing to go. And the last scene, with the words Rosebud coming from Wells lips, maybe the most famous and best exclamation point in movie history.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Orson Welles' genius completed this masterpiece at a mere 26 years of age, battling the tyrant William Randolph Hearst to release the finest film he has ever and that has ever been made. Not only does the story line, the acting (carried with uncanny force by Welles,) the dialog, the photography, the lighting and the music amaze me with awe, but the fact that it broke the barrier in film in 1941 to become "art" by a young genius who had no experience in film. It is the greatest accomplishment ever achieved in film, and should remain immortal in the film world.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first time I watched this film, I thought it was terribly boring and apart from the obvious technical wizardry was not impressed. Actually, watching a documentry about the film was more interesting as it showed loads of things to look out for.The 2nd time I watched it, I think I turned it off after half an hour. I had an urge to watch it again last week(after a couple of years) and I tell you that I absolutely LOVED it. In fact I am gonna watch it again soon. I think for the people who say it is boring, they should really wait till they are in the right mood instead of feeling obligated to watch it because of the enourmous popularity of it amongst critics.This is simply a must-see film. It hasn't been this successfully critiqued over the years for no reason.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Obviously a great film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Citizen Kane will never be popular with the general public because it asks too much of the viewer: namely, that he sit still and pay attention, and periodically use his brain to process the information. There are no wasted scenes in this film, consequently no boring scenes. Years of potentially interesting material are covered in minutes, sometimes seconds, so that we see only what the writer &amp; director deem most relevant to their story. The audience is not told what to think about Kane; opinions expressed by the characters are not necessarily those of the film makers. A man's life is too complex to be neatly packaged and turned into a formula. Kane evidently wanted love, not money, but he equated love with money and material possessions - or maybe he didn't, but didn't know how else to love and be loved - and [POSSIBLE SPOILER] as it turns out, he had the long-lost "Rosebud" in a crate, in a warehouse, without being aware of that fact. Would Kane have been a different man if he'd found Rosebud in middle-age, say? Was the missing sled his real ailment in life? Certainly not, if material possessions aren't bearers of love. Be wary of the "easy answers" - Citizen Kane is a wonderful work of art, much deeper than any of its parts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Powerful motion picture that grabs you from the opening shot right to the close. Welles is amazing as director, writer and star of this astounding motion picture about Charles Foster Kane, (based on newspaper mogul William Randolph Hearst) whose idea of news opened the floodgates for giants like Winchell, who made their own news. Kane made people, but also broke people as well. It's a shattering study of greed, torment and mental anquish; all brought to us in realistic fashion with a superb script and top notch support from Moorehead, Cotten and Warrick. Snubbed by Oscar in 1941, the film only won for its taut screenplay. A haunting film that will continue to be studied by film students, directors, actors and historians for years and years to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I dare to call it overrated.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am usually wary of hyped-up films, but I usually regard old films exempt. Given the technical difficulties they had to overcome, I strive to not take modern cinematography for granted. Yet, I dare call "Citizen Kane" overrated.A movie, to be a movie, needs to be a movie. This is not as simple as it sounds. "Citizen Kane" has a solid plot, realistic characters, deep themes, thoughtful dialogue, and good cinematic effects (for what they had to work with). To one who hasn't seen it, that sounds like a darn good film. Unfortunately, on the last part, it goes overboard. I.e., the story falls secondary to cinematic sequences so overt (even cheesy) they spawned countless parodies. If one accepts my definition of a movie as a system of plots, themes and characters enhanced by its portrayal on a movie screen, Wells has this system of movies and special effects completely backwards!Maybe it's personal opinion, but I believe cinematic effects should subtly enhance the story, not drown it. Yet some of the sequences in "Citizen Kane", such as the mirrors images and jigsaw puzzle sequences, scream at my eyes. I may not catch everything, but what I do catch sure insults my intelligence. If technology indeed forced Wells to be this blatant, he may just as well have given up and omitted the scenes instead.This is not the best movie ever made. To earn that title, a movie has to be more movie than effect. It's an impressive piece of work, but it also shows how old-timers are just as vulnerable to movie hype as today's youngsters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many call this film the best American movie ever made and I happen to agree. Welles produced, directed, starred in, and co-wrote this great film at the age of 25. How many people can say they accomplished something that great by the age of 25? Welles outstanding use of mise-en-scene was phenomenal and it was a shame that it was booed at the academy awards. The lighting, sound, angles, and use of film stock is unparalleled. I love how Welles used lighting to make our eyes focus on the character that he wanted us to pay attention to. Throughout the movie we never really see the reporter following the rosebud case very well and rightly so because he is not the focus of the movie, Kane's life is. The movie started at the end, began in the middle and ended at the end of Kane's life, which sounds like every Quentin Tarentino movie I've seen. This film should be the measuring stick used by every filmmaker today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best of all time?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, I did something I haven't done in a while last night; I went out and rented a movie. After hearing all the hype and kudos that have been deposited upon this Orson Welles' classic, I decided I should watch it for its astounding accolades if for nothing else. Truly, a magnificent movie, but the best of all time? That's a stretch.Made in 1941, I can see where it puts everything of its time or before to shame, but I can't see it beating everything made since. Definitely a good movie, but it really consists of not much more than an intricate and albeit wonderful character sketch. I thought Welles' acting was impressive, but others were not quite so entertaining, and its not the most entertaining movie, either. My friend fell asleep watching it, which gives me evidence on this front.A film needs to do two things if it intends to be memorable or considered a form of literature. First, it must entertain. This means keeping people riveted, in order to not miss anything. Second, it should make its statement. If the first is not achieved, it is found that much of the purpose is lost. I can see where many experts and movie pros can keep themselves entertained watching this film, as the meticulousness of Welles is astounding. However, to the average viewer (and my friend), the film is not so entertaining. All in all, a fantastic movie for those who like to watch and expound upon the extreme care taken in its production, but not the best of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As you sit in your office, room or coffee shop, as you read this excellent review, you could quiet easily walk out the front door, and stop any passerby and ask them a simple question 'what is the greatest film of all time?' Some would say the Godfather, others would say Casablanca, but the majority would point to Citizen Kane. Is there a joke the world gets that I don't? Is there a massive party that I simply didn't get an invasion too? Because I can understand the 'some' and the 'others'- but I although I would rather point their attentions to Chinatown or Manhattan for title of greatest ever. But I'll let them off just this once. But the overwhelming inclusion of Citizen Kane on lists of the greatest films of all, is frankly ludicrous and a complete and utter head scratcher! Such was the extent of the head scratching I almost bore a hole into my skull. For me Citizen Kane is no more of the greatest film of all time, as much as you could say Zack Effron is great actor. Citizen Kane is simply the most over hyped film in the history of the universe. Orson Welles produces, writes, directs in this picture as well as playing the title character Charles Foster Kane. A newspaper tycoon who dies almost at the start of the film, and through the eyes of reporters, Kane's life is slowly unravelled before our eyes via an anti- chronological narrative. Driven by the desires to discover the significance and meaning behind 'Rosebud', the one word Kane utters on his death bed. Don't get me wrong. Citizen Kane on a purely technical endeavour is absolutely superb. With the effective use of innovative angles and stunning manipulation of deep focus lenses too represent the various viewpoints of Citizen Kane on a visual plane is absolutely staggering and ingenious. But despite this people seem to forget that film making is the art of storytelling. I repeat film making is the art of STORYTELLING. True it relies heavily on aesthetics and visuals representation of conveying of said story, but story is still the main event of any film. Narrative is substance and A list stardom whereas the visuals are merely the supporting act. Although I have to credit Welles on his heavy handed involvement in the film, but I feel the film would have reached greatest heights in my eyes, if he were to have relinquished some of the roles to people of greater experience, because don't forget the fact that Orson Welles was merely 25 at the time (Looks like need to get a move on). A fact I believe that might have been the bases of the reasoning behind the decision by American Film Institute (AFI) to place Citizen Kane at number one on their list of 100 greatest American films of all time. Which is insane, just because he was young doesn't mean he should receive any preferential treatment. Just because a kid in primary school makes a finger painting, doesn't mean is should stand in an art gallery next to a painting by Picasso. But if Citizen Kane were to still remain on the list of 100 greatest, long after I'm gone. I'm adamant it will be of no heroics on Welles part and the story behind Citizen Kane, but more from the hard work of the likes of Gregg Toland (cinematographer) and Robert Wise (Editor) and there technical achievements, that have acted as magicians and tricked the whole world into believing that Citizen Kane is the greatest film of all time ? Dynamo and David Blaine takes some notes, that's what I call real magic!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite all the hype and raving reviews from film critics like Pauline Kael, I found "Citizen Kane" to be too contrived, stilted, unreal, as if I were reading a classic comic book. The gimmicks with lighting and camera angles added to this comic-book presentation of the picture as well.The film fails emotionally. One does not feel for the central character or any of the characters, in fact. The closest it comes to the portrayal of a human connection is when Kane fires his college chum from one of his newspapers. And there it ends. Even when Kane dies, we cannot feel anything for this man. And the biggest gimmick of all contrived by Wells was the "rosebud" mystery. According to Gore Vidal, Hearst referred to Davies most private part with this term. How can the viewer connect emotionally to this gimmick, more appropriate for a hoochie-coochie carnival act than a work of art.Too stylized, too detached, too contrived, too gimmicky leaves the viewer unable to suspend disbelief and experience the reality of the story. Welles played with his audience, as he did in "War of the Worlds", like a smart-alecky kid. Consequently, reviews by critics extolling this film as the greatest film of all time have left me doubting their artistic credentials.Trust me, you won't be re-watching this film over and over; however, it is worth a first viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The "Greatest Movie Ever Made"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All critics agree, this movie is the best, not many people agree, including me. But the fact remains that the most trained eyes of judging film see this movie as the best, probably seeing more than we see. Aside from all this, there are visuals that will stay with anyone longer than the story. What comes to mind first? An opera house, six shadows falling across the room, leading to one man, a thousand Kanes walking, a snow globe, a sea of statues, jigsaw puzzles, and snow going over a sled. This cinematography is what would come to someone in a dream, or an empty thought, years after they have seen the movie. Maybe they have forgotten what it was from, it hovers on the edge of the mind, but no one will forget all of Citizen Kane, no matter what. Although many movies rely heavily on cinematography, very few have that cinematography more memorable than the movie. I am not saying that the movie is, on the whole, forgettable, I am saying that if someone forgets it, they will always feel part of it on the edge of their mind.However, cinematography is far from all of the film. First off, this film is blessed with an immortal story, not a very exciting one, but an emotional one. It is so human that we are all moved by it. We feel sorry for him, not in spite of how awful he is, but because of it. His plight is understandable to anyone, no matter how different he is. Anyone can empathize with him because deep down, we know most of us would suffer like him in his position. This beautiful story, backed by excellent screenplay, and told through cinematography so great that Orson Welles, famous for ego, allowed the cinematographer's name to appear on the same card as his, also has the bonus of great acting. It is so demonstrated especially in the scene where Kane trashes his wife's room. It is a masterpiece in almost every sense of film, and from a first time director to. To use one of the characters analogies: each aspect of film-making is just a piece of a jigsaw puzzle, fitting in with all others and, after careful hunting and searching, it all fits together to form one beautiful picture.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nothing that I, or anyone else, will ever say either here or anywhere else will ever change the immense aura Citizen Kane carries with it. Here is a film that has been voted number one of all time by the American Film Institute twice over a span of eleven years and has garnered copious amounts of praise from Sight and Sound's own decade-spaced lists. The sum of it all is; yes, the film is fascinating just as it is thoroughly engaging and brilliantly made. It's not because of the credentials that I give it a maximum rating, nor is it because it would be the 'easy' thing to do, it's purely because the film is genuinely one of my favourites on film making and historical grounds.Orson Welles knows what he's doing here, he's delivering a tale revolving around the image of one man from many others' perspectives. These people include his former second in command, his employees and at some points, one of his wives. But the brilliance is that Welles allows the audience to have the final say in what they think of this character, this character that Welles has quite deliberately cast as himself, with the most wonderful of twists at the very end rounding off the piece. Do we forgive him for what he was through no fault of his own when he was whisked away as a child? The ending doesn't exist as a cop-out to excuse his ruthless behaviour but only adds to the layers of study established beforehand.Citizen Kane is genuinely enthralling, a film that doesn't chart the rise and fall of a character but rather kills them off in the very first scene before allowing a central character, who's a reporter, to try and deconstruct the myth of such a wealthy and successful individual. 'Getting there' seems to come across as Citizen Kane's focus, but the burning question isn't how he made it, rather what he meant when he uttered the word 'Rosebud' on his death bed before smashing a snow globe, something that within that tiny dome lies the clue as to what he meant; but won't become immediately obvious until we have had Kane's childhood locales and surroundings established. As he gazed down at the small, snowy surroundings in the dome; it is a recollection of sorts of days and innocence gone by, something he was removed from rather than naturally moved away from.The film follows, in non-linear format as it shoots into the past at different spots in Kane's life, said reporter named Jerry Thompson (Alland) as he attempts to answer the question posed to him by other journalists following a newsreel presentation. Just what did he mean by his last word? Arguably, the most famous one worded quote in cinema's history. The introduction of Charles Kane himself is disorientating and fits unevenly with the rest of the film; a proud and booming newsreel detailing Kane's life in the media and politics before advancement into some sort of mental illness akin to hording. The question follows the footage and it is proposed that the myth surrounding Kane is deconstructed, immediately establishing the idea of how one person can come across as one thing through either the media or word of mouth whereas getting down to brass tacks with them opens up all sorts of alternatives.The first time we see Kane in 'real time' and indeed hear him speak, he cracks a joke and generally seems to have the audience on his side. This immediately goes against the prior opinion that he was a 'bad' man or a communist or a struggling individual. Kane seems charming, funny; even quite nice and from the newsreel to the real image Welles has firmly established it's about finding out the facts of the situation rather than settling with the fiction.Initially, the film centres on Kane's becoming of a newspaper mogul as he, Mr. Bernstein (Sloane) and Jedediah Leland (Cotten) look to buy out an existing paper firm in New York. They do so, and the expulsion of the 'old' as poor Mr. Carter is relieved of his duty and the introduction of the 'new' (complete with the 'best of' from rival newspapers) sees Welles establish his character as one who is going to take the reins and just plough on ahead as this new force to be reckoned with. With this, his ideas of 24/7 news and 'all of the news all of the time', reverberate with us due to the technological climate we live in now whereas in the film, others can only dismiss it as impossible. So while outlandish at the time, and we recognise that, we get a feel for what Kane's envisaging in that one exchange.As the film progresses, we observe Kane's subsequent divulge into politics and two failed marriages and the film takes a breather for Mr. Thompson, alá the audience, in the present time to ask further questions and really try to get under the skin of the situation. One of the film's more harrowing shots is Kane's reaction when an associate reads out the review his wife got at the previous night's opera as written by an employee. It's a progression of anger and confusion mixed with doubt as he wonders if it is jealousy, poor journalism or just the straight damn truth. Later, his wife will finish another performance and Kane attempts to cue a standing ovation, but he's lost his grip on the world and those around him ? he no longer carries the influence he once had and consequently, every one remains silent. But it's really all just scratching the surface and the brilliance of the film cannot really be summed up here; just know that while easy to dislike through its reputation, is difficult to deny its intrigue once viewed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Citizen Kane is one of the most overrated movies of all time. I admit my skepticism is biased but i have good cause; To begin i would point out that this movies is utterly boring and since the point of a movie is to entertain this movie fails. Don't get me wrong, i enjoy some pretty "boring" films such as Stalker, but this movie truly offers me nothing entertaining. Although Citizen Kane is meant to be an insightful look into a mans life, it really isn't. All dialog is witty and sharp in a way completely lacks any human emotion. The way in which Kane's life is examined is done so in such a disconnected way that no sense of meaning can be taken from it. All in all it is a very vague, long, and boring movie presented in a way that reminds me of old time radio broadcasting where a blunt story is relayed through a series of even more blunt sound effects only in this instance blunt images are used.Why is it rated so good then? The true reason is that Citizen Kane was a stepping stone in cinematography and special effects. Considering this aspect i can understand why it may have been revolutionary at the time; But in the modern day, it seems like nothing special.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I doesn't matter how artistic the movie is as long as it's not fun to watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had to watch this movie for a my film1400 in college and fell asleep three times during my first time watching it. Yes, great cinematography, great camera angles, light, bluh bluh bluh, and oh my god it was made in 1941. Bottom line is if you think about whether you'd prefer watching this movie at your leisure over a lower rated movie, like lets say Untouchables 99% of people would choose the latter. Why? because this movie is perhaps the most well-made BORING film of all time. Unless you're trying to find out all the cool movie-making techniques used in the movie, as opposed to paying attention to what's actually going on in the movie you're not going to like this. 5 out of 10 at best!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't get the point. Why is this film considered one of the best ever? I can understand that Orson Welles was pioneering in this film, but that was 60 years ago, so that can't be the reason it's rated so high... But what is? You knew from the beginning on what Rosebud meant, and I mean the symbolism as well, and the only thing left was the story of Mister Kane. What's so special about that? Does that make it a top 250 film? I don't think so... It's just a drama, I'm not saying it sucks, but to place it in the top 250... that's just overrating. I don't understand how it got there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"It's Terrific!" is an overstatement</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I am, have been, and always will be one thing?an American!" says Charles Foster Kane (Orson Welles) at the beginning of the new motion picture Citizen Kane. Buckle your lap belt because this will be the most entertaining portion of the entire film.Citizen Kane tells the story of Charles Foster Kane, a multimillionaire newspaper magnate and his death. Depressing already, I know. But when his final word is "Rosebud," everything shakes up a little bit. One reporter is determined to find out the meaning behind this word and how it relates to the life of Charles Foster Kane. As things unravel and unfold, the mystery becomes clear.Directed by Orson Welles, a.k.a. the actor who played Charles Foster Kane himself might suggest something. Welles has directed two films before this?and acted in both of them! In The Hearts of Age (1934), Welles played the character named Death. Also, in 1938, he directed Too Much Johnson and was Keystone Kop. In addition, Welles has contributed to the Swiss Family Robinson as an uncredited voice narration. Although, Welles seemed comfortable with the character and acting while having a great sense of humor.Other acting included Joseph Cotten (Too Much Johnson) and newcomers to the motion picture industry Everett Sloane and Agnes Moorehead. I believe we will be seeing much more of these two in the future.Cinematographically, the movie was narrated in chapters, which made it easier to follow. Adding a challenge to the movie was the never-ending flashbacks that could throw you off. There was the ever-popular fading in and out of scenes and creative camera angles that would grab the viewer into the movie. One major camera transition from the outside rain into a bar really flabbergasted me. I was thoroughly impressed.In conclusion, Kane did not affect me. The acting was young, the plot was not easily understandable, parts were left bare and some parts of the movie were left on a limb. Also, many character's faces were left dark. This could be taken as a signature from the director, and brilliant at that, but it was not necessary for this particular movie.I would only recommend this movie to someone who enjoys looking way beyond the face of movies. It is very political and difficult to follow. If you are in that mood and can handle back-and-forth movies, take a gander at this one. Otherwise, you may want to stay far, far away.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I concur with</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>the general view that "Citizen Kane" is probably the greatest American movie of all time.The problem for me when it comes to films that are highly rated is that my expectation prior to actually seeing the movie is already very high. So high that 8 out of 10 times, the movie falls flat of that high expectation.So it came as a mild surprise that "Citizen Kane" did NOT disappoint me when I saw it for the first time this month.What makes this movie so good in the first place is its dialog. The clever use of words by Herman Mankiewicz is both refreshing and titillating, adding a whole new dimension rarely seen in movies since or thereafter.Running a close second is the superb acting performance given by the entire Mercury Theater ensemble. Leading the pack of course is Orson Welles' memorable portrayal of Charles Foster Kane. The 25 year old actor delivers a powerful and convincing debut presentation of an entire life encapsulated in 2 hours' worth of storytelling.And what else can I add to Gregg Toland's pioneering cinematography that has not already been voiced out by so many expert and amateur critics alike?Last but not the least is the music..... Bernard Herrmann is just wonderful. Listen to appreciate. Words are not enough.Great story, great acting, great movie presentation..... are not these the elements of a great movie? I don't doubt that "Citizen Kane" will remain GREAT in the minds of a lot of people for a long long time to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My brief review of the film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An artistically directed film noir drama with arguably the best black and white photography of all time, Welles uses an extensive range of film techniques, and in particular the lighting used in the film is very impressive. Welles is also superb in the lead role, playing the title character from young adulthood to old age, with the assistance of some excellent makeup. However, as impressive as it is, none of the supporting characters are all that well drawn out or acted and the use of music in the film feels inappropriate and it detracts from certain scenes. In terms of film techniques it was groundbreaking in its time, and is still quite admirable even by standards today, but as an overall film it is just not quite as satisfying as what it could have been. Still, it certainly is interesting in terms of plot, with issues of love, fame and happiness amongst others in the film, and it certainly is a film great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This must be one of the most influential films of all time..melodrama at its best. The newsreel at the start is especially powerful as are the opera scenes towards the end. It set new standards in movie-making....but at one level it is curiously uninvolving. It lacks a truly sympathetic character.Orson Welles is magnificent in the title role, but many of the other leads are rather colourless. Joseph Cotton would be MUCH better in The Third Man.The air of gloom in the latter part of the film is particularly powerful, but the final ending is rather weak and contrived. Overall, still a great movie, but the lack of s sympathetic character is a weakness for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I believe firmly that this film contributes to every movie produced after it's release. This movie is unique and to every well read film maker it is the epitome of what an excellent film is. The drama that is portrayed in this movie is outstanding, the feel and texture of every scene brings more to the viewer than is expected. This movie just may raise your expectations of what you consider drama and entertainment. Orson Wells, only in his twenties delivers amazing direction, writing and acting in this classic movie about a media king's curious life which is loosely based on Hearst's Media empire during the 30's and 40's. This movie may be 63 years old, but for those who have a keen eye for drama it's a breath of fresh air.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am another person who really couldnt wait to watch this movie. It has been voted best movie ever in so many polls I was waiting to be blown away in some way. Dont get me wrong Im not one of these people who think a film cant be the best in the world unless it stars Arnold Schwartzawhatever, my DVD collection contains many genres from past and present. Except this one! I finally got around to buying the DVD. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, and yes it is a good film, but best film ever? In my humble opinion this wouldnt even reach the top 50. I know that for its time it was technically brilliant and well ahead of its time. But I can think of other much better films from the 40s and earlier. To Kill A Mockingbird, Cape Fear, Night of the Hunter? This will probably get remade one day, and no doubt ruined. Bizarely enough, the welles character kind of reminds me of Michael Jackson. The success, the scandle, the building of a overstated theme home, the longing for a forgotten childhood, the buying of affection etc.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Though it was one of the greatest movies of all time I didn't find it so interesting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>According to many this is the best motion picture made. Staring Orson Welles who also directed and wrote the story. This is pretty incredible considering that he had never even set foot on a stage before. I guess you could say that he is a genius at that. This interesting story takes on from the beginning. With its incredible lighting and shading techniques and the great way the beginning of the film fades from one photographic shot to another, as if each picture was blending into each other, this film was surely ahead of its time. `Citizen Kane' also introduced, to its audience, how much of an effect wealth can have over idealism. The narrative techniques add a great deal to the film, it laid out the films setting for you.The camera starts at a fence with a sign that states no trespassing, then slowly fades into a barbed- wire fence, and lastly to an iron fence with iron flowers. Kane's estate, Xavier, stands upon its man made hill surrounded by its lush landscape and a zoo as big as Noah's Arc. The camera, disobeying the sign, creeps past the castles gates and into the yard showing incredible shots of the surroundings of the castle. Each photograph fades into one another bringing you closer to the castle. Suddenly the camera reaches a window with the light on that gets turned off. The shot fades to a hand holding small snow globe, unexpectedly the man whispers `rosebud' the snow globe drops and pieces of glass and water fly everywhere. Later a woman covers the mans body as if he had died. This first scene sets the rest of movie. It shows what a powerful man Kane was. Across the world newspapers and radios were reporting this mans sudden death.Although Welles work was great, along with most films, it had its side of controversy. `Citizen Kane' was a movie strangely parallel to William Randolph Hearst's life. Hearst was known for his great writing on the Spanish-American war. His type of journalism was known as yellow journalism. Hearst felt the film was a plagiarism of his own career and wanted RKO to burn every copy and negatives they have of `Citizen Kane.' Orson Welles starred in, wrote, and directed `Citizen Kane.' Though he never made a movie or starred in one, he was commended for his outstanding work. He added much power and brilliance in this movie, which caused much controversy. Though the film in its time was great and still today rated as one of the greatest movies of all time. This reviewer gives it a six out of ten, just because it seemed like the greatest part of the movie was its cinematography. I didn't find the movie line very interesting, but if you're an old film loving kind of person, this might be the movie for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First movie for Welles, the man who revolutioned cinema. This movie is praised to such a point that I suspect that many people give it credit out of mere conformism, I mean you sound uneducated in Cinema if you don't praise "Citizen Kane". So you just go with the bunch...This very interesting work, though, is obviously not a success in filmmaking for anyone who really knows about cinema, and tries to be honest. Nevetheless it's a great premise, and changed the face of cinema for the years to come, because of its mindblowing invention, complexity and artistic values."Citizen Kane" opened doors to previously unknown ways of filming.. Visually, without Welle's work, we would probably have lived without the great cinematic visuals of Losey, Gilliam, Kurosawa, Greenaway and some others.But to rate this movie so high, despite the fact that Welles achieved much better movies with "The Lady from Shanga?", "Le Proc?s" or "Tragedy of Othello", is a matter of fashion, a snobby cultural phenomenon that is rather funny when you think about it. If you want to be taken seriously when talking about films with "cinephiles", and someone mouths the title "Citizen Kane", you HAVE to go "Aaaaaaahhh" and make a meaningful nod... very funny. Even more funny when you ask those people about "Le Proc?s" or "Tragedy of Othello", because generally... they don't even know these, or even never heard about them! *LOL*Well it' still a remarkable work, well worth watching, even with its flaws.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This could have been the greatest movie ever made except for one problem, it has no heart or soul. Like Charles Foster Kane himself, it is a magnificently empty gesture. Yes, Welles acts and directs superbly, yes the lighting and photography are beautiful, yes the story is wonderfully told; and yet...and yet... So what do we get? well, we get a collection of moments that never really make a whole. We get the " Rosebud " bit, we get Greg Toland's camerawork,we get Welles showboating performance as Kane and so on.But. I have watched this film many times and each time I feel cheated because it all comes to nothing.It is a city built on sand. It's not that I don't like the film, but like a child that doesn't fulfil it's potential, it makes me a little sad and a little mad. I suppose that I'll get hate mail from every film student and critic in the world but I stand by my opinion. It's easy to see why this film is so feted, but in my opinion it is an illusion, a three card trick. After all, Orson Welles loved illusions and tricks. Maybe you CAN fool some of the people all of the time.</fullReview>

All I saw was average character and plot development covered up by above average (pretty excellent, actually) cinematography (which, let's admit, is fairly dated by today's standards). Yes, it was a ground breaking movie. Yes, it inspired filmmakers all over the planet. Yes, it changed the industry. Even admitting all this, I still feel that Kane is over-rated. There have been much greater films made in recent times. To call Kane the 'best film ever' is to do so for nostalgic reasons and to ignore that better films have come along since. I can't pick 'the best film ever made' but I can list some that are better than Citizen Kane. How about The Godfather, Schindler's List, Gone With the Wind, Forrest Gump, or even American Beauty?

		<fullReview>Many times I've been tempted to watch 'Citizen Kane' just to analyze why so many consider it the greatest film of all time. No more than twenty minutes go by and I find myself BORED by this so-called classic. I have to admit I am not a fan of Orson Welles and always thought there was a bit of the smokehouse ham about all his larger than life performances--be it 'Macbeth' or Rochester in 'Jane Eyre' or the attorney in 'Compulsion'. But it is much more than just not liking Welles. I find there is a pretentiousness, an artificiality about the whole film. It's trying so hard to be symbolic about the "true meaning of life", much the way 'American Beauty' attempted to show us that there is beauty in a plastic bag floating in the wind. 'Rosebud' is just as simplistic--quite a letdown, in my opinion, to discover that a child's sled is at the seat of the mystery surrounding Kane. Frankly, I just don't get it. What is so profound about this film that historians say it should be shown to young filmmakers as an example of great story-telling? I would rather succumb to the charms of 'How Green Was My Valley' (also in 1941) which took prize as the Best Film of 1941 than have to view this depressing piece of cinema that is supposed to be a thinly disguised portrait of William Randolph Hearst. Intellectuals may love 'Citizen Kane' and AFI must have a number of them on their voting board--but it does not deserve the high ranking they've given it. In my humble opinion, it fails to be even credible. The direction is self-consciously arty (see those unusual camera angles) and the acting sometimes borders on the ludicrous. Does not stand the test of time.</fullReview>

But that's about all it's got. The story is far from compelling and I never felt involved in the character's tale. The use of flashbacks doesn't paint a very interesting or complete picture of Kane, as there is far too much devoted to overlong anecdotes and not enough to the overall story. The Rosebud twist is a nice way to end the film, but I can't judge how surprising or shocking it was, as I had been spoiled long ago. Oh, and way too long, even at only two hours. It just drags on and on. I can see why it's a technical masterpiece, but other that that, it's nothing special.</fullReview>

It's sad, but I believe it's true. Citizen Kane influenced film-making period. Not just a particular genre or a director - film-making. I can understand a person not understanding all its technical achievements, after all most of us didn't go to film school (I sure didn't). But giving a movie like Citizen Kane a 1 - the lowest possible rating for a movie - warrants total ignorance on the part of the viewer. I'm embarrassed for our society when I see these things happen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this movie again this morning and was struck once more by how brilliant and timeless it is. If it isn't actually the greatest American movie of all time I don't know if I can think of a better one. As a matter of curiosity if clicked on the "Hated It" category of user comments on the IMDb, just to see what anyone could find to hate about this picture. I was surprised by how many negative reviews there are, but they all had the same basic complaint: "It was boring!" I find this significant, because it's the same complaint I always get from small children when I try to introduce them to a movie more sophisticated than, say, Spongebob Squarepaints. It's unfortunate there are so many people (presumably kids) out there unable to appreciate Citizen Kane, but it's their loss. The movie is a masterpiece and it's place in cinema history is secure. Its detractors should stick to rotting their minds with video games. This movie's too good for them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's not much I can add to what's already been said about this much-discussed classic, but I would like to comment on the revisionist trend of Best Movie lists to downgrade this film from its traditional #1 position. For instance, the original list compiled by "Entertainment Weekly" critics rated "Citizen Kane" #1, but then a subsequent list moved "The Godfather" into #1 position. Well, I've watched "Citizen Kane" with pleasure at least 25 times, but 3 times around with "The Godfather" is enough for me! And if critics are just sick and tired of rating "Kane" #1, then I can think of better replacements than "The Godfather" -- for instance, any hilarious comedy written &amp; directed by Preston Sturges -- "The Miracle of Morgan's Creek" springs to mind -- or Billy Wilder's "Some Like It Hot" (#1 on AFI's comedy list). I think comedy is ultimately more profound than tragedy, so I don't see why a comedy can't be considered for the top spot. Comedies also tend to be overlooked at Acadeny Award time.But I suppose I'm unusual in that I think "Citizen Kane" has many fine comedic touches (the flustered vocal coach and prompter during the opera sequences would be one instance). I realize that, overall, it's a tragic drama, but there are quite a few comic highlights along the way. It's a very entertaining film.Finally, in the interests of "truth-in-advertising," I should mention that I have a personal reason for my interest in "Citizen Kane" --- I am related (not by blood, but by the marriage of one of my dad's sisters) to members of the Missouri branch of the Hearst family. So 3 of my cousins are, in turn, distant cousins of Patty Hearst. And my late uncle, Richard Hearst, told me of family visits by the real Citizen Kane, William Randolph Hearst, who handed out silver dollars to the kids (my uncle was one of the kids). All my Hearst cousins like the film --- but I suppose some of the California Hearsts might be less enthusiastic about this classic film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The story isn't the point</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The real importance of "Citizen Kane" is not its story, although the script is a strong character study. The strength of "Kane" is in its incredibly creative use of light, camera movement, and deep focus to create a film that at the time was literally revolutionary. It is important to remember that "Kane" was Orson Welles' first film. He had just attained both fame and notoriety with his "War of the Worlds" broadcast, and had only his radio background to sustain him. RKO studios, then in serious financial trouble, saw him as a man capable of creating a riveting story, not as an innovator.Fortunately, in Welles they had also hired a man capable of attracting brilliant men to his side. Cinematographer Gregg Toland was at the time probably the best in the business; he is given top billing by Welles in the final credits.At the time that "Kane" was made, film in America was in a rut. The ideal, which movies stuck to, was to create a "Natural" look--no obvious lighting, the camera at eye level, no obvious cuts or transitions. Welles, unfamiliar with all this, used obvious light, a VERY mobile camera, and wipes, fades--all the techniques that modern filmmakers used today. The American Film Institute, in its highly controversial "Top 100," listed Kane as the #1 American movie. Although many would disagree, I feel that its impact on the way films are made today might give it the merit to have that high place.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really don't understand - and those who disagree with this comment are probably thinking it's beyond my comprehension - I have one thing to say before you click that 'not useful' button and that is that your mind is easily led, like to go with the flow and you would be an ideal candidate for brainwashing! You're as eccentric as Mr Kane himself!In this films heyday when people lived by gaslight, and film direction was still evolving after the emergence of sound and the demise of silent movies - this film might have been an inspiration to 'budding' directors as it broke much ground back then in relation to editing/angles/utilisation of advanced filming techniques but that's just like saying we should immortalise the CRT's they were viewed on back then just because they too were ground breaking! This film will one day be recognised for what it is, utter rubbish - but it will take a few generation changes for this to fall in the ranks and I for one cannot wait. What a waste of time for me in this day and age where this film presented to me nothing I have not seen before.Yes the director did get a hold of our attentions early on with this storyline revolving around Kane's last word "ROSEBUD", and so we stick with this boring and tedious film until the very end to try and discover what in god's name was so important about his last utterance only to be let down by a revelation that makes you think you've wasted the last 90 minutes plus of your life.Citizen Kane gradually developed into a self-centred, spoilt, narrow-minded geriatric whose views of the world and the people around him did not actually match up with reality and thus as an inevitable result he ended up alienating himself left only with his material belongings which he'd collected over the years in his little castle (if you will) which secluded him from the world because he had lost the plot. Rosebud was a reference to a sleigh board from his youth which is probably where he was at his happiest.1/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While I must admit that I find this movie hardly one of the best ever made, I still have very much respect for it and consider it a great and important achievement in film making."Citizen Kane" is basically a movie about the life of a man. It might sound boring and average to you but it's not! There is never a dull moment thanks to a clever script, good dialogue, wonderful characters and an unique style! There is some phenomenal camera work and lighting, some subtle early special effects and very believable make-up for the character Kane (Orson Welles) that ages much throughout the movie.Yes, Orson Welles really has delivered a masterpiece with this movie.

		<fullReview>Orson Welles made his directorial debut and stars in this thinly-disguised expose of newspaper czar William Randolph Hearst (who later sued Welles for libel). Chronicle of paper tycoon's rise and lonely demise is exquisitely presented, with beautiful black-and-white photography and excellent performances, but second-half of the story meanders, and portions of the film are smug or callow. Welles won an Oscar for co-writing the screenplay with Herman J. Mankiewicz, the film's only award out of nine nominations. Perhaps it was felt that Welles was too talented for his own good, and indeed the picture is heavy on self-importance. Entertaining, to be sure, and voted the best film ever made by the American Film Institute in 1998.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To call Citizen Kane " A Great Cinematic Achievement" ranked #1 on many so called "experts" list simply means too many people watch movies drunk, stoned and half asleep... I did notice the cinematography. There some really nice camera angles show depth of field and the use of shade and light that were novel for that period, but nothing to call this movie, exceptional? The story line was beneficial in moral and exploration of the human condition, but you had to "hunt" for it and want to find it. Movies like "Forrest Gump" accomplish the same thing with more imagination and identifies with "everyman" not just privileged men who "gag on the sliver spoon"... To truly call something "great" in my opinion, is to have lost out if one is to never have had the opportunity to experience it... There are probably a hundred movies I would recommend seeing and calling #1 or at least worth watching and this movie shouldn't even be in the conversation... "Rose Bud" is a "Rose Dud" and doesn't mean anything to anyone except one person... an insider insult from Orson Wells to William Randolph Hurst! Why should we care?&#xfeff;This movie at least in part, is about the manipulation of citizens by the press... I think friends of the makers of this movie called it number 1 and reduced it's availability so people would simply PAY to see it and something that should be collecting minimal revenue is still VERY viable to it's producers and or beneficiaries ... which ironically is part of the plot of the movie itself... now in that way it might be worth ranking NUMBER ONE... cause we are gullible and fell for it!

		<shortDescription>The climax happens at the beginning</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Citizen Kane can be called a film with an outstanding reputation, and in addition fifteen years older than me. So I feel somewhat embarrassed that I did not watch the film before last month. This is even more so, since the political genre is my favorite. Now, after having done my duty, there is the mission to write an original critique. Hopefully at least my loyal followers will pardon this stale addition to the plethora of reviews. Actually the climax of Citizen Kane happens right at the beginning. A boy lives with his simple parents. Although the couple is not really degenerate, there is a hint that the father is a somewhat violent educator. Anyway, the mother is glad when a benevolent Maecenas offers to adopt the boy. Thus Kane is separated from his elderly home, which causes a mild shock. Nevertheless, he succeeds in making an excellent career for himself as a newspaper tycoon. His stories are dynamite (take a flea out to dinner; do you still enjoy my review?). The pen is mightier than the sword, and considerably easier to write with. But the love that he receives from other people can not fill the emptiness due to his lost childhood. He lives in a conspicuous wealth, but this fails to bring meaning to his life. He becomes adamant (the very first insect). But why continue to dilate (= live long)? In the end the bitterness has grown upon him, and he dies in total isolation. Thus the film is quite melodramatic. Maybe in those days the film producers still had a knack for theatrical techniques. Or perhaps some years after the great Depression, that is so thrillingly portrayed in The grapes of wrath, there really was a class society with appalling differences. True capitalism is survival of the fattest. And of course Orson Welles is a giant, the man who said: "There is one thing worse than celibacy: marriage". Don't forget to leave comments. I love it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would have to say I wasn't particularly impressed with the story told through this film, even if it is based on a real one, but much more was I impressed by the manner in which it was told. The film was rather unique for it's time in how it sets up the plot at the end of the main character's life and then continues to tell the story of it through a series of flashbacks. Not just how the story was told, but also how it was filmed. The cinematography in this movie is probably one of its best features. The lighting, camera angles, special effects, fades, and pans are all very well done, present throughout the entire film, and all add to the complexity of it. While the story fell a little short for me (not saying it was bad just not my taste), I thought the meanings presented in it (wealth doesn't = happiness, powerful man can't keep/control everything, etc.), and the examination of a man through the people he knew throughout his life were all pretty cool things.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From the very start, this film is interesting. The dying words "rosebud" from wealthy Charles Kane start a massive search for what that means. The reporters try all film long to try and figure out what that means. What is good about this film is that the overall feel (mes-en-scene) of some of the scenes was spot on, other times not so much. As a general plot, it tells about the rise and fall of Charles Kane through flashbacks. Not that common for the time, it was actually pretty cool. At some points I did find it hard to keep my full attention on the screen, it was not always interesting. Different from anything thats been regularly shown, it is like a reverse story, starting from death and going from there. Interesting, but not for the entirety of the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is one of the best films of all-time. It's really amazing how we can interact with the other characters in here. There is a lot of stuff that people remember from this film. The one thing I remember best is Kane's last word, "Rosebud..." It was the biggest moment from the movie that I remember. With the other characters, they really do a nice job of communicating with each other. At the end, I can't believe that the departing staff at Kane's estate burned down Rosebud, which was mentioned earlier. I love how the audience sees Rosebud as a sled in the end. This is considered a masterpiece in American cinema, and it will still be remembered for a long, long time. This is probably the best film that RKO Radio Pictures had ever made!</fullReview>

Such thing can make you develop really high expectations that won't be met. At least that's what happened to me. I'm not saying it's a bad movie, but it isn't that "terrific" either. The story isn't very interesting and I couldn't find myself emphasizing with anyone, not even Charles Foster Kane. While I admit the dialogue was clever and the use of light give the movie an interesting, eerie atmosphere, the story is boring at many points, and its message has been heard a thousand times over. It may have been revolutionary for its time, but it feels rather outdated now. It's considered a classic movie but it didn't do much for me (and I do like classic movies). Don't get me wrong, all in all I believe it's a good movie, but it doesn't deserve the title it has been given. You either agree with it or you don't, with no inbetweens.</fullReview>

Orson Welles is known for his unorthodox camera work. Welles manipulates the space on screen in this movie in a beautiful and hypnotizing way. Low angle shots are prevalent in the film, providing a unique spatial effect. Orson Welles used the zoom a lot in Citizen Kane.

The story started when he was a kid and followed him all the way to his downfall. The story is told primarily with flashbacks and memories of Kane. The director Orson Welles edited the movie flawlessly to gather suspense. HE also was very sound on techniques used in the film industry. For example, in one of the opening scenes he shows a light and as you get closer the light remains in the exact same area based on rule of thirds. His camera shots are very captivating and direct you exactly to the place he wants you to look. His outstanding film has made the word "rosebud" a staple in American Cinema.</fullReview>

It was so out of the loop and not really expected in the film, which is why I liked it because it was so unexpected. My teacher pointed out that they had microphones that were in the ceiling, and you could hear the change in volume as the band would walk underneath the microphone and then walk away and it be suddenly different in volume.

		<fullReview>Citizen Kane was written and directed remarkably well. The films consists of outstanding scenes and performances, cinematic and narrative techniques and experimental innovations, including sound and photography. The film was quite controversial at the time, having unflattering parallels to a real-life publisher. The film consists of a number of long takes, which create more meaning behind the actions and characters. These long takes draw the viewer in, because it's obvious that shots aren't edited together. The soundtrack is another important part of the film; it provides clues to Kane's behavior as he ages. One of the most notable scenes is when Kane walks (almost zombie-like) down a corridor lined with mirrors, where his reflection is multiplied. In this scene you realize that we all project a certain personality to people, and we often leave impressions behind. Here you get a sense that Kane is reflecting on who he has become. This also shows how well Orson Welles was able to perform, in addition to writing and directing the film, totally proving in today's world why he was so famous.</fullReview>

I thought the screen time was way too long and the characters didn't really do it for me. As I said I found Charles scary his first wife ditsy and annoying, Charles mother in the beginning very mean and heartless and only out for her money, and his father seemed like a child beater to me. With that said this may have been the feel the producer and directors were going for.

		<shortDescription>How to watch Citizen Kane</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I watched Citizen Kane, it was at a revival showing on a big screen at the Fabulous Fox Theatre in Atlanta. Unfortunately I was too engrossed in trying to get into my date's pants to notice what the film was about.I say 'unfortunately' not because I missed the film but because I never got into her pants.Years later it was released on DVD and I bought it, expecting to see, as the American Film Institute calls it, "The greatest movie ever made". I was very disappointed.But then I watched it again with the Peter Bogdonovich commentary, then immediately after that with the Roger Ebert commentary, and wow, I had a revelation. There is so much to this movie, I couldn't begin to tell you. No, it's not the greatest plot nor the greatest subject, nor does it even have the greatest acting (though the acting is quite great). The brilliance of this film lies in tiny, insignificant details which you'd probably miss on the 1st viewing. Seemingly trivial things like the placement of certain objects, people and lights combine to tell a visual story within the story. The sum of these tiny details equals a masterpiece.So I recommend you view it exactly as I did. See it once to get a feel for it. Then watch it again with the DVD commentaries. Watching it with a date whose pants you're trying to get into is optional and, frankly, not recommended. But other than that, there's a lot to see in this film. It may not be "the greatest film ever made", but it is indeed great.</fullReview>

The film is great, the fast-past plot that jumps from past from present almost every other scene. Normally that would be sort of confusing to the viewers but this director did it. How he did that may be the reason this movie is considered so great but there's more. The cinematography in this movie is done just as well as the film jumps from past to present. In fact the wonderful cinematography is one of the main reason it jumps from past to present so well. The cinematography really makes you feel like your looking in on this actual mans real life. The story its self also makes this a great film. Who wouldn't be interested in a story about an extremely wealthy man who ends up with nothing. The acting is also top notch in this film. From Orson Welles character to the butler who was with him at the end all deliver powerful performances. All these things I picked up on and enjoyed yet Citizen Kane(1941) still didn't live up to my expectations. I wish no one would have ever told me about this film before I saw it, but overall i defiantly enjoyed this movie and will be watching it again.</fullReview>

One reporter goes on a wild goose chase, trying to piece together the pieces of Kane's life in order to understand truly who the man was.Orson Welles shines as the title character Charles Foster Kane, his performance is one of the most remarkable in the history of film. The main reason Citizen Kane is such an unforgettable experience is for its technical mastery. The cinematography, makeup, art direction, costume design, etc., is among some of the best I have ever seen. Though this film would have been nothing were it not for writer/producer/director Orson Welles's vision. This was Welles's masterpiece through and through. Welles managed to create what I think could be considered as the first modern film.Even though Citizen Kane may not be my favorite film of all-time, it still is undeniably one of the best made films of all-time, and is worth seeing for all of its innovation and beauty.I give Citizen Kane a 9 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's easy to get sidetracked by the modernism and innovation of the film. I found it enjoyable because of the fresh and frisky storytelling. Kane is an archetypal tragic-protagonist acquiring vast wealth in order to try and fill the reciprocally hollowing vacuum inside. It's an old story but sold to us with verve and comedy.Orson Welles strides through the film eschewing the wearying and embattled self-pity until the very last moment. Surely PT Anderson took as much notice of this when preparing There Will Be Blood as he did of the malignant Noah Cross in Polanski's Chinatown? I found the deeply overlapping dialogue a little contrived and trying at times, but if it's sole purpose was to lend realism or, rather, a realistic dynamism to the film it succeeds. Sharply observed in script and inventively committed to film, the movie's value is in its oft-aped legacy as much as in the matinée auditorium. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's unbelievable that, even after all these years, 'Citizen Kane' still possesses all the qualities of a modern movie, save for the special effects. This movie is, in acting, camera and storyline, sublime beyond comparison. Even though it's a little long at some points (hence the 9 i gave it), some parts of the movie moved me. For example: When Susan-Alexander left him, en he was yelling "I'm Charles Foster Kane!!", I really knew how he must've felt. Orson Welles wrote down his own name in history by simply playing this role. Would he have lived today, me thinks people would have honoured him like they would Elvis. Or if he would have been a young actor, I think he would be able to play multiple roles, multiple genres, etc... I admit, 'Citizen Kane' is the only movie i've ever seen featuring Orson Welles, but nevertheless, i can state that he was one of the world's greatest actors.One of my favourite scenes was when he was walking through his mansion, 'Xanadu'. Suddenly, he walks into a hallway with mirrors on both sides. result: you see Kane endless times over. By the gods, i thought my eyes were about to pop out.... Me thinks the normal person would not know what was meant with this scene, but if you think it through, you come to realize it resembles his loneliness, the fact that he truly cares for no-one but himself, and that he's alone in his own little world. Honestly, this scene held more hidden emotion than i've ever seen, even more than 'Gladiator' (when Maximus sees his family dead. If that doesn't stir emotion within oneself, then oneself can be called heartless)The story, overall, was intriguing. But, as I mentioned before, it was a bit long at some aspects. It started out a bit slow. Don't hate me for saying this, it's what i think -_-".Overall, this movie is legendary, even more so than Lord of the Rings, or Star-wars even... OK, it's not polite to compare 'Citizen Kane' to movies like them. Hell, I wouldn't even dare remake 'Citizen Kane' for the fact that the public now wishes movies with action, sex, and special effects. But the grand audience who's seen 'Citizen Kane' when it first was released back in '41 or those who, like me, seen it only recently and are awed by it, will never forget this movie.I rest my case</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Classic Sets The Pattern.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Who wrote a better Elektra, Sophocles or Euripides? At this point it probably doesn't matter, but they set the pattern for a future Shakespeare. The brilliance of Citizen Kane is its source: The Mercury Theatre. Wells notched up cinema by making this play set to 24 frames per second. It also is early post-modern: It is made for the viewer, not the glory of the author. The viewer has complete understanding of what is going on, and the characters in the story are lost in a fog wondering what is Rosebud? Each character is stuck in their fixation of their relationship with Charles Foster Kane. Kane is the stage manager of this story. I first saw this film on a late night LA television station in 1966 when I was ten years old. I was alone. I knew I was watching something unique and special like no other film before, old or modern of that time. Later on in college in a film class I was re-introduced to it as a classic masterpiece, the choice viewing of the class. What has to be accepted is its uniqueness. The style can really only work for this film. You have to give Orson Wells great credit of theater to film vision. Another great example is his "MacBeth" done on a shoestring budget. I am not sure if it is important that this is the best film of all time. It is the only film that does what it does for its time. Theater vision burst through the camera lens, and if you watch it you never forget it. I think it is better to say that it is a classic best of classic cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Citizen Kane is the best photographed film in the history of the art! Its dramatic uses of angle and lighting to create moods forever changed the industry, and has been the foundation for the best-filmed movies from its time forward. This alone should make it number one on the list of every movie- lovers "movies to see". However, the acting also makes it worthy of a number one rating. Orson Welles is brilliant in his role as a media mogul who rises from less than modest beginnings but never finds satisfaction in achieving the "American Dream". His poignant portrayal of the saddest conflict in literature "man vs. himself" is truly acting at its best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't like to number films and name one the "greatest film of all time." To me, every film is different and unique in their own way. But, if there had to one that was, it would be Citizen Kane. Orson Welles' genius shines through in all aspects. It is filled with remarkable acting, especially by Agnes Moorehead and Welles, as well as cinematography and camera work that is considered to be the standard today. Of all films I have seen, this is the one that I simply enjoy to watch the most. It isn't perfect, but it is so groundbreaking and exemplary that I can't help but be in awe no matter how many times I see it. See it simply for the story and acting. If you have already, see it for the technical achievements. Each time you watch it, it will captivate you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too much of generational gap for many of us to enjoy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's kind of hard to call myself a lover of movies, or critic when I haven't seen what has heralded as one of the greatest film accomplishments of all-time. "Citizen Kane" was one of those movies that have slipped through my fingers as a kid and before you know it, you've never seen it but have only heard about it. In fact, usually you hear so much about some films, you have no motivation to see it. There are people out there (and we meet them all the time) that haven't seen the "The Godfather" yet, so situations like this do exist. So, after finally getting my hand on a copy of "Kane", I gave the film it's due attention.A little overrated. Although this film belongs in IMDb's Top 250 and agree "Kane" should be considered a benchmark for movie directors, I had a tough time watching this movie. I can see how this movie was groundbreaking in 1941, as the characters (especially Kane himself), writing, acting, storyline and even the cinematography were ahead of its time. But, seeing this movie 60+ years later after its release was like taking a Model-T Ford out for Sunday drive. I literally had to force myself to watch this film, waiting and waiting for me to grasp it and I just couldn't do it.I really don't think the problem is with the film itself, I think the problem is major generation gap and the fact that we have seen characters like Kane in other films and in real life. Older films like "Casablanca" and "Gone with the Wind" are extremely tough to watch when you get older, as your taste for movies is used to today's masterpieces. As mentioned before, Kane's persona was controversial at that time, maybe making him very intriguing and influential. It's hard to embrace this character when he have moguls like Donald Trump in our lives everyday or other films like "The Aviator" out there.For me, for a film to be heralded "One of the Greatest American Films of All Time", is needs to stand the test of time. There needs to be a good balance of entertainment that's captivating at the same time. We shouldn't have to pay attention or scrutinize a film to get it. Films like "The Wizard of Oz" or "The Godfather" are these type of masterpieces. Who knows, after our generation, maybe know one will get the "The Matrix" or "Return of the King." Time will tell.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Charles Foster Kane. What an amazing name...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I confess that I didn't know anything about the film except for it's name before I had watched it. But I wasn't regretful to watch it and spend two hours. The film basically explains a man's life who had to leave his family with their wishes.Think a man. He is promised to take over big companies after an age and he chooses just a newspaper that's name is "Inquirer". Starting as an unknown newspaper, its' circulation reaches the summit between USA newspapers thanks to Kane's amazing applications which especially concern labour unions. This makes Kane happy but this happiness doesn't continue for a long time. He gets married with the President's niece and most people believe Kane is intended to be the future's President but on the contrary he criticize politicians and even the President. This marriage finally comes to end at an interesting moment. This point is that his ex-wife doesn't support him against a blackmail of an immoral politician and thereupon Kane divorces her and gets married with a bad-voiced singer. He works to make her famous but it doesn't work and this marriages comes to the end, too. While all thoses happening, he also loses his best friend Mr Leland with a dramatic fact. Upon sacking him, Mr Leland sends him Inquirer's principles which had been noted by Kane and hidden by Leland.After this huge paragraph, I'd like to note especially that Kane is addicted to live lonely along his life whether it is in his power or not. Also it's very attractive to achieve displaying a media boss' life....and of course Rosebud. Rosebud is a code that represents the childhood of Kane.Citizen Kane should certainly be watched by the fans of ancient time films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Orsen Welles Period Piece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an intelligent film, but it is more of a period piece than it is a classic. My apologies to AFI but as the memories of William Randolph Herst fade, this movie will fade too. That it has lasted this long amazes me. In fact, a poll of college students today would rarely put this in the top 10 films made. The AFI is not composed of college students.This is a solid film, not total trash. It successfully tells a good story, has a fine cast, and shows a lot of Orsen Welles creativity in trying things on film that had not been tried until this film.The hypnotic effect it had on the generation it was made for, made it one of the most revered films of that era. It even got lampooned on SNL a few years ago. But over-all, in time the legend of Hearst will fade out entirely &amp; so will this films classic rating.There are technical masterpiece touches in this film. Welles was always known in Hollywood as being difficult to work with &amp; controversial. Because the studio he made this film with desperately needed to sell tickets to a blockbuster film, they gave Welles a creative freedom few film makers got a chance to savor.Welles took full advantage of it, &amp; made a big hit for his generation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Citizen Kane an Impostor?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Number One film of all time? Easy to see why. Brilliantly photographed (Gregg Toland), staged (Orson Welles) and performed, with a then radical out-of-tense script (Herman J. Mankiewicz and Orson Welles) that flashed backward then forward in time (edited by Robert Wise), one is virtually overwhelmed with its brilliance, on every level.One's blinded to a couple of chinks in the armor which, in turn, lead to other chinks. They, in turn, lead to the emotionally hollow yet technically impressive response "Citizen Kane" ultimately evokes, decades later.Charles Foster Kane dies alone. He utters the word, "Rosebud." A nurse comes in, covers his head with the sheet. Fade to silhouette and then to black.Fine. Wonderfully effective, visually.Except the premise for the film rests on reporters somehow "knowing" his last word was, "Rosebud." Uh, how would they know since nobody was around to hear it? It's a false dramatic premise we're expected to ignore in light of all the "brilliance" that follows.Confronted by one reviewer, after "Citizen Kane's" release, by this fact, Welles paused and said, "Don't tell anybody." Sloppy plotting and screen writing? Arrogant attitude that, "Nobody will notice because we're going to blow them away with our technique?" Easily correctable in post-production. Simply have the nurse, or somebody, overhear "Rosebud." But no.The excitement of displaying their talents must have overtaken everybody, so eager were they to display their creativity, that the Director, Screenwriter(s), Producer and everybody else failed to realize the premise of "Citizen Kane" is based on a clumsy plot-point flub: NOBODY HEARD "ROSEBUD." That's a gigantic mistake. Understandable, one guesses. Except that professionals in Hollywood in those days rarely let something this egregious make it into their theatres. Minor flub details? Sure. A film's entire premise? Not so much.Equally problematic? The ending. A direct steal from Alfred Hitchcock's concluding image in "Rebecca" a year earlier. Flames engulf Kane's childhood "Rosebud" sled just as flames envelop Mrs. Danvers' lovingly handmade nightgown case with "R" embroidered on it in "Rebecca's" final shot.Difference? One shot is organic. The other is phony and plagiarized."What?" we ask incredulously. "The big revelation is that 'Rosebud' was the name of Charles Foster Kane's sled? We've been through all this brilliant movie-making to arrive at ? what? Who, at life's end, remembers the name stenciled on their childhood sled? And what's that supposed to mean?" Compare that stolen final image with Hitchcock's previous image in "Rebecca," where the flames devouring Mrs. Danver's coverlet "R" not only recall and evoke every theme in the film ? the hovering ghost of Rebecca ? but finally consume her last remnant and free our protagonists (the DeWinters) to live and love.Organic and full of meaning. Certainly not stolen from another director's film.One watches "Citizen Kane" with appreciation for the talents involved, and the wonderfully realized scenes. All "work." Yet it doesn't add up. It signifies nothing, gives unrelated insights into several characters and finally devolves into a pseudo-sentimental false childhood image to evoke some "emotion." Maybe "Citizen Kane" was the best film ever made up to its time. But it's brilliantly talented people showing off technical chops absent any real cinematic heart. Individual scenes are evocative and moving. Add 'em up.A sled named Rosebud. Huh? Keyword: "Showing off." "Citizen Kane" if you go along with the story that "Rosebud" was actually William Randolph Hearst's nickname for an intimate part of his mistress', Marion Davies', anatomy, sort of works. But then, the burning sled image is meaningless. (Hearst and Davies were supposedly the models for Kane and Susan.) Maybe "Citizen Kane" functions best as a demo-reel of the finest young talents in Hollywood at the time.Not as "the best film of all time." That would be "La Dolce Vita." A film as full of life and truth and revelation about individuals and society as "Citizen Kane" pretends to be.Where "Kane" trumpets style over substance, the hallmark of Orson Welles over his career's wincing downward trajectory . . .. . . "La Dolce Vita" eschews fancy pretension to strip away artifice and reveal character. Watch it again and again. The directorial and cinematographic technique is there in spades. The composition of shots equals anything Gregg Toland achieved in "Kane." The shots just don't call attention to themselves (i.e., detract from the characters' revelations of themselves). The seemingly minimalist and improvised script is anything but. Fellini was famous for post-dubbing lines. There is not one word, one syllable, in "La Dolce Vita" that doesn't relate to and develop its themes.Nobody is barnstorming in "La Dolce Vita," cinematically. Yes, the actors as their characters do. But this is not a film that begs, "Look at how brilliant I am!" It studiously avoids calling attention to its cinematic brilliance, focusing instead on character arcs.Result? "La Dolce Vita's" final, non-derivative, closeup is perhaps more devastating (summing up the previous three hours) than anything since Gloria Swanson's final closeup equally overwhelmed audiences in "Sunset Boulevard" in 1950.Yes, "Kane" and "La Dolce Vita" and "Sunset Boulevard" are essential to any collector.Enjoy and study them for what they truly are.Of the three, only two still have the power to disturb and upset (i.e, are still emotionally relevant). "Sunset Boulevard" reveals lives you and I will never lead."La Dolce Vita" reveals lives, 50 years later, ALL of us now lead, small or large, clinging to the celebrity media circus that has replaced individual integrity and substance.All three represent peaks of cinema achievement.One of them stinks from the head (and ending), becoming an artifact of artifice and plagiarism in the name of celebrity ego (Orson Welles').The other two are self-effacing (they sacrifice technique for character and story)."Citizen Kane" is a blow hard impostor to "best film." But what a demo-reel!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>..at least, I liked the opera..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although only "one-of-one" reviewers thought "Elle S.A.'s" comments were noteworthy, please read that comment to understand all the technical innovations "Citizen Kane" pioneered. I appreciate Welles' genius, but liked him in "The Stranger" much better than this movie. All through his career, he started many "masterpieces", but never completed them. THAT, as much as Hearst's campaign to prohibit "Citizen Kane" from being distributed to theaters (he even tried to buy the original print from RKO, but it was owned outright by Welles), no doubt hampered his being able to get funding for future work.I am amazed that people consider 1941 as having been in the dark-ages of film-making......wouldn't 1921 be a more appropriate era ? There were many wonderful movies made before 1941...."Gone with the Wind" ?? "Kane's" re-release in 1950 - after ten years of rampant curiosity over the controversy about it - had as much to do with its popularity as Welles' brilliance, simply because black-and-white movies were old-hat by then. I'm sure I saw its original release, but I don't recall being smitten with anything near "best picture I've ever seen". I guess I also saw it on TV; same comment. It wasn't until 2006 that I bought the VHS from eBay.........I've watched it twice since then (once last night) - and while I certainly agree it's a great movie - I truly can't say I'm flabbergasted by it. Maybe the DVD will give me a greater appreciation for it. I saw the floral "Rosebud" on the kid's sled and recognized all through the movie Kane was looking for the happpiness he could never buy with all his money. He was ruthlessly narcissistic.Am I mistaken that Kane's "mother" (Agnes Moorehead) gave him up to "Thatcher" (George Coulouris) after the property they owned became worth a lot of money - like gold ??? - 75 million would have made him a billionaire, today. I DID like the opera-scenes, and suffered right along with "Susan Kane" (Dorothy Comingore), off-pitch and all. I'm impressed that this movie was Joseph Cotten's (Jed Leland) American debut as I am with Welles. Ruth Warwick (Emily Kane) impressed me not, but was good for the role. Ray Collins' (Boss Gettys) acting was right-on, as was Everett Sloane as "Mr. Bernstine" (?). The cinematography was great, but some camera-angles had been used in other movies.As for Welles' aging make-up, does anyone remember the fantastic make-up jobs done by Lon Chaney in his horror-films - "Phantom of the Opera"? I have to constantly remind myself that people who are younger than the film usually are more easily astounded than we older folk are, who have seen it all develop. I'm sure I'd have to argue with "Citizen Kane" being proclaimed as NUMBER ONE on any list - my enjoyment is mine, others' are respected, but it has no influence on me. The movie did not make me cry, I wasn't shocked, I wasn't frightened, I wasn't impressed with everything looking so huge and forbidding; in other words, I've enjoyed other movies more. I only mourn that artists get so wrapped-up in themselves - as Welles was - they are their own worst enemies.Declaring movies (and movie-making) as being "perfect" and "the best film ever" are different for every individual. It's my opinion a lot of that is because Welles had total control of the film - he must have done an amazing acting-job to get that privilege. It doesn't mean that he didn't have many techs working with him. Bravo! to all, but most of that "greatest" obsession is uncalled for, in my opinion.</fullReview>

Xanadu is a castle, amassed with millions of dollars' worth of statues and other worthless objects which were never truly appreciated. It is evident already in the first scene that despite his great fortune, Mr. Kane was never truly happy. Our first introduction the man himself is seeing the dying man examine a crystal ball. He drops it and it smashes, and one word is heard - "Rosebud..." Immediately we see quick scenes of newspaper headings of Kane's death, all on the first page, showing the obvious importance of this man to society.The rest of the movie consists of reporters interviewing people close to Kane in order to find out the meaning of his last words. From his ex-wife to his butler, they all tell their stories, flashing back to Kane's life and showing us how he built himself up to greatness in the newspaper world. However, nothing is revealed about the word "rosebud," possibly indicating that like life itself, some things can never be explained.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have just seen this movie, and I must admit, I am disappointed. All my life I have heard that this is one of the best films ever made. So as I watched this movie, maybe I just expected too much out of it. This film portrays the life of a prominent political figure who owns several newspapers and wants to run for public office. I can not give too much more detail without spoiling the movie, but I must say that this movie did not do much more then tell a story about a journalist who is trying to figure out what Kane's(the prominent figure I spoke of earlier) dying words meant. The movie makes no effort to give the viewer a feeling of connection with any of the characters. This was a film where I was unable to connect to any of the characters. There is very little character development, and very little plot advancement. If you want to watch a classic, go with Gone With the Wind or Casablanca. If you want to watch a movie where Orson Welles does a wonderful job of acting, you may want to skip over this one and go with The Third Man. This one is still worth a look though, because if this many people like it, I am sure there are many more who would also like it.</fullReview>

A small boy who is taken from his mother and told he is now rich and that he must act rich ... when all he wanted to do was be a boy and play in the snow. The photography was stunning and the related effects were magnificent. Judging by some of the shots and what they were meant to convey, you can see what a brilliant man was Orson Welles.

		<fullReview>What else can one say about a movie that everything has been said, and better? Although not my favorite movie, "Citizen Kane" represents a force of will never expressed quite so well by an American filmmaker. "Citizen Kane" educates not only filmmakers but teaches discerning viewers how to watch a movie of personal expression. The first hour is so good that I keep watching when the plot drags after his affair with Susan Alexander is exposed and costs him a governorship ("Candidate caught in love nest with 'singer,'" is a wonderfully inspired headline; note the single quotes around "singer," implying that Alexander is not to be confused with Maria Callas). The news-reel sequence remains fresh and exciting upon repeated viewings, using techniques that Woody Allen employed to dulling effect in "Zelig." The movie is watching simply for the dialogue, for which Herman J. Mankiewicz and Orson Welles received the film's only Oscar; note Mr. Bernstein's speech about a girl in a white parasol; Welles reciting his "declaration of principles" with Joseph Cotten's reminder, "That's the second sentence you've begun with I;" Welles, as Kane, completing a drunken Jed Leland's negative review of Alexander's Chicago operatic debut because, says Leland (Cotten), "he wanted to prove he was an honest man; an aging Welles telling his financial adviser from youth that he still should be addressed as Mr. Thatcher "because you're too old to be called anything else;" but most of all Cotten with Welles on election night and proposing a toast to "love on my terms, because those are the only ones you'll ever get." And we haven't mentioned "Rosebud," Gregg Toland's cinematography or Bernard Herrmann's score. All the more reason to watch this American original. And when the credits roll, remember that Welles made it age 25!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Groundbreaking classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found Citizen Kane to be a technically innovative and fairly engaging film. It is a great parable about what is really important in life: a childhood filled with love (ie. Rosebud). I wouldn't say that it is necessarily in my top one hundred films of all time but I can appreciate the arguments of those who say it is. What is undeniable is that it is a classic cinematic masterpiece whose pioneering techniques of visual storytelling influence filmmakers to this day. Recommended mostly for historical significance, 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overflowing with symbolism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Citizen Kane , though not the most entertaining film, it is a remarkable landmark in the film industry. All for its first time usage of more advanced camera angles and many other filming techniques. Though Citizen Kane lacked what is now by audiences perceived as entertainment, it actually overflowed with metaphors and symbolic meanings in every scene. On example is in the way the first scene begins, which is at the end of Kane's life (Orson Welles) the entire movie plot is centered on his last word `Rosebud' Thus commencing the search for the meaning of this word. Rosebud has an incredible meaning to Kane's life. The Audience later on discovers it is the name of his childhood sled. By making that word his last it set an enormous symbolic meaning of what his wished his life would not have become. Also during the same death scene Kane is holding a globe in his hand which drops and brakes as he dies, symbolizing the messy and scattered life style that was ending then. As far as film techniques go, Citizen Kane is also full of meaning behind the technique used for different and specific scenes. During some scenes in order to create a mindset on the audience Kane is placed by camera angles above the rest of the actors, immediately making him the scenes dominant subject. This is only one example of the very well thought out techniques used in this film. It is believed that Citizen Kane is a representation of William R. Hearst's life. For Kane (Hearst) buys a major newspaper and his life very well portrays Hearst's life. Kane is a person seen and described very differently by those around him. His ex-wife and his closest `friends' were interviewed to discover the meaning of his last word and about his rich and happy life. Even though that is what his life was thought out to be full of Kane was a poor and miserable man, who failed at two marriages and didn't own anything that brought full satisfaction to him. Citizen Kane possesses so many hidden things throughout the entire film that it is necessary to watch many times just to catch small and detailed symbolic events , and even objects. This film is sure to make one think and become an observer of what is very easily overlooked. A downward spiral of a miserable man's life is how Citizen Kane can be best described as.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoiler Alert Citizen Kane, started in a new way that most movies back in the late 30's to early 40's never really started. It began with the death of citizen Kane in his home by himself uttering the last word of rosebud. Then throughout the film a reporter was trying to figure out what Kane's last word meant. He interviews his old wives, friends, employees, he starts to figure out how Kane really was a man with out feelings, just power hungry and wealthy. While I watched the movie I went through many feelings, such as disappointment, anger and sadness. I was disappointed that Kane never came to realize why all of his wives left him, and why his friends slowly departed. He worked to hard and always wanted to better himself and not anyone else. Anger because he treated his friends and wives like their feelings did not have any meaning. But sadness because he never came to be happy he started his life unhappy and through the film he tried to buy his happiness but never succeeding but of course how did this man die, by him self. With no one, to even say goodbye to, that man must of had a very dark life. This mans life was dark, and the film portrayed that, not just by his actions but also by the lighting and music when he was alone or even the time when he was in his large home with the singer with he sat way away from her in the dark and she was by the fire doing a puzzle. The films last scene was Kane's ex-employees and reporters packing everything up that way they could get rid of it and sell it. They never figure out what rosebud meant but we did as the last shot was a sled with the name rosebud burning in the fireplace. I enjoyed the film it takes you through the life of someone you never knew, and it had pretty good detail and accuracy. Not only that but shows how different the films were back in the early forty's.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Imitators Idolization</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One major question comes to mind when watching Citizen Kane. How can a 25 year old newcomer write, direct and produce one of the greatest American films of all time? It's amazing, it boggles the mind. It may be unbelievable, but Orson Welles did this very thing. And, all the way back in 1941. Very few filmmakers have accomplished such a feat. Although directors like Quentin Tarantino and Paul Thomas Anderson have tried, they can't top the original. Citizen Kane is a technical masterpiece and for very good reasons. The cinematography is brilliant. The style is revolutionary and very engaging. Unique camera angles are sprinkled throughout the film, such as the very low floor shot angles and other great techniques. Also the special effects in the film are superb. All the effects that we take for granted today were created and used here. The lighting design is some of the best ever, playing with light and shadow to create a variety of moods. The shadows are used to great effect to convey emotion with the black and white film style. But the one thing that makes Citizen Kane a great movie even to this day, is all the symbolism. A conversation could last hours discussing all the hidden meanings in the film. What do all the aspects represent? What do the metaphors mean? Is it a semi-biography of W.R. Hearst? You know it's a great film when you can watch it multiple times and find different meanings with each viewing. Is it the best film of all time? Maybe. That's debatable. But it's definitely good. You'll have to find that out for yourself. But movie fans and newcomers alike will enjoy this fantastic piece of cinema for all the things is has to offer. A definite must see to all the aspiring film makers out there. See the original and then criticize the imitators. You don't know good film until you've seen Citizen Kane.Overall grade for Citizen Kane: A+</fullReview>

Left dying with the memory his "ROSEBUD," early age when once loved by his mother. Usually, mother's love like a rose with tough love thorns along it.

		<fullReview>Citizen Kane...I was really anxious in watching this film, as it is considered one of the best, if not the best, movie ever. These considerations are not made upon nothing, and I do agree Citizen Kane is one of the best movies I have seen.SPOILERSWe have the idea, especially in America, that even a poor kid can become the president of the country. That anyone can work his way up to fame and fortune. But what happens when you have all the money you might need? People degenerate. Kane is the kind of character who degenerated. It is always about himself. He is the one who rules, he is the one who commands. He wanted a newspaper, so everyone could hear him...but no one could really know him. After the dies, the press asks itself what his last word might have meant. Rosebud. A reporter, named Thompson, is assigned to find out its significance...as if they could understand him after finding out that the sense of that one word.I believe it really does mean something he has lost. All his life, Kane suffered...without really knowing. All the ones around him, really were there to love him, because he needed someone to be able to go on. Like in Casablanca... His false idea was that he could get anyone with money and presents. He had to be in the center of all things. For him, he was all that really mattered.Kane was a disputed figure, someone who never quite knew what was right. Someone who thought that because he was rich, he could do anything he wanted with the ones around him. He kept his respect though for the whole American population, and he wished that they found out the truth about what was happening around them. You might say, he did accomplish his goal...but his methods, and his whole life, were messed up. His second way, poor miss Alexander, was forced to live a life she could not. A life without love, a life without real essence. She had the role to love Kane, without being loved. No friends, no nothing...all she liked were some jigsaw puzzles, and that was all she had to live with. Kane's friend, Jed, is just another person in his company...his friendship with Kane, is not of real essence, so it ends at a given point. Was it because the article? Or was it because he was drunk? I am not sure...maybe both. Maybe only the first. One more thing would be, that Kane always needs to do something with a reason...all he does, he does with a reason. How many people act so now? Can you act in such a way? Only with reason? Might be. But to always need to prove something, that is a thing that few people do. It shows how strong a man's will actually is. Kane is a figure which gets lost in this world. His needs are to high to be fulfilled. "Citizen Kane" tries to make himself loved, through his abilities, through his humor, or through his way of thinking. Yet, he never gets to know the people around him...and thinks merely of himself. How can you write to people you do not really know? The thing that Kane never had, was a happy childhood and that's where man sets his limits. In this case, it all revolved around money.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Orson Welles has his greatest film and portrayal with this legendary 1941 RKO release, a film that is generally considered by many to be the greatest film ever made. It is a great film but I wouldn't go that far in my ways of praising it. This film is loosely based on the life and times of William Randolph Hearst (who originally threatened to sue Welles and RKO if they dared to release this film which he had considered to be insulting). Welles portrays a fictional composite of Hearst. He also supplies the writing and directing for this excellent character study. In my view, several films ranging from "Gone With The Wind" to "The Godfather" surpass this one in levels of greatness but this film certainly deserves a very high level of respect.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know what to say or write about Citizen Kane at this point. Frankly I don't know that I'm qualified to write about a movie of such grandeur. Two points I can make though, one about AFI and one about user comments.Firstly, regarding AFI and this being their number 1 film of all time, I assume that this is to be taken in the context of AFI as the greatest American film of all time. If so, I can begin to relate to how it's portrayal of the American dream is very signifigant. Otherwise, don't get me wrong, by no means do I not realize the legacy of Citizen Kane, but I feel by the discrimnating AFI holding such a title to this film, they should definetly write a comprehensive paper to accompany this.Additionally after reading the user comments, it seems like most people are just blindly throwing praise at this film for no reason, jumping on that bandwagon, with no true opinion or ability to appreciate art within themselves, and by doing so, only regurgitating AFI's opinions and those of a generation before them. By this I do not mean one's ability to enjoy a film, I believe that most are true to their own feelings on what films they enjoy and which they do not, but what I mean is all the pretensious comments saying things like 'This is the greatest film ever' without a firm thesis. Have you no opinion of your own?I don't think that many people who have made their comments on Kane are qualified to make their comments, because I believe they have most likely only viewed the film once or twice and have done no research in any attempt to further appreciate or understand the times or the film.</fullReview>

An opening sequence allows us through a window into the Kanebedroom where we witness his sudden heart attack. A snowbubble falls to the floor and the camera moves in close,transporting us back in time to Kane's childhood in the snow. Abrilliant and imaginative way to make the flashback both seamlessand mesmerising. But it's just an opening taster. This entire film isbreathtakingly constructed.We may have the technology these days to produce remarkableeffects. But what we so rarely enjoy is an imaginative and trulycreative approach to scene construction that Citizen Kaneachieved all those years ago.Without any doubt one of the most visually creative movies evermade.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like Citizen Kane. There are many comments made in this section by people who "just don't get it". Well I sympathize and even understand where they are coming from but ... consider: This was the FIRST attempt of a 25 year old man who up til this time was famous for radio ("War of the Worlds", Mercury Theater, Campbell Playhouse and The Shadow) and also for NY stage productions. He came to Hollywood and he was given absolute control over a picture (unheard of since the end the silent movie era). He brought with him from New York a group of radio and NY stage actors with NO prior film experience. He also brought to Hollywood the innovations of broadcast radio. He allowed experienced but stifled Hollywood camera experts (Toland) to be creative. He did the same with lighting (but he had some of his on thoughts from the stage as to this).If you buy the DVD version you may hear the very insightful comments of Roger Ebert as to this movie. In my opinion, Mr. Ebert's commentary will help those of you that "just don't get it" and will still be very insightful to the rest of us as well. Peter Bogdanovich (besides being a director in his own right, wrote a biography on Orson Wells: "This is Orson Welles" - available at Amazon.com) also does a commentary, but it is not as insightful as Ebert's. Listen to Ebert's commentary but read Bogdanovich's book. This is NOT the best movie ever made, BUT it is the best first attempt at film making ever and by far the most innovative film ever. Wells was a genius who tragically peaked too early in life. After seeing this movie watch The Third Man, an even better film.</fullReview>

"rosebud" is, ultimately, the failure of the american dream:pretty women and wealth only promote and quicken spiritual decay, and success in society can leave a person unbelievably impoverished and unworthy on the inside. watch the movie, but don't buy the hype.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Incredibly overrated, but still very good. That's how huge a chasm has been created between fantasy and reality since the Brussels World's Fair Jury voted KANE the #1 movie of all time back in 1958. No movie can live up to such unending praise.Those 14,000 voters who rank Kane a ten have been brainwashed, as surely as the 900 or so who rank it a One are slightly clueless. The truth lies somewhere in between, around a 7. But I must admit to a kind of admiration for the Outcast 900; they're closer to right than they might think. Audacious, only slightly derivative, landmark, indelible, smarmy biopic of Hearst in a fictional guise, utilizing the justly lauded Newsreel opening and flashback storyboard, in one reporter's search for the Meaning of Kane's last word. If you've read Hollywood Babylon, you know that Word has a double meaning, in Life and in Art. Makes the movie more fun. But, since Kane is alone when he dies, it's a puzzle how everyone seems to know his last word.My favorite scene is Everett Sloane's Girl on the Ferry Boat speech. Beautiful and nostalgic old man reminiscence, played to perfection. I'm sorta old now myself, and my Ferry Boat Girl is Lynn Mahoney, 1951. Meanwhile, leave us not lose sight of the fact that Citizen Kane wasn't even the best movie of 1941. That'd be The Maltese Falcon. However, both are infinitely better than the Academy's choice, How Green Was My Valley.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good...but not the best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>According to the American Film Industry, "Citizen Kane" is the greatest movie of all time. After seeing this film, I found that a bit hard to believe. "Citizen Kane" has been patted on the back so many times, that its name alone has become a juggernaut. But is it deserving of so much praise? Let me first give you a quick rundown of the movie. Charles Foster Kane is dead. He was the richest man in American. Now that he's gone, everyone wants the scoop on his troubled life. One group of reporters decides to take a different angle. The last word Kane uttered before death was "Rosebud". No one knows what that means, and so these men set out to find the big secret behind this puzzling word. They proceed to interview all of the people who supposedly knew him best, yet they never uncover this secret. At the denouement, however, the audience is able to see what "Rosebud" is before it is destroyed. I must admit that I already knew what "Rosebud" was before I saw the movie, and most people do. But, in the event that someone out there has no clue, I won't spoil it for you. There are some greats aspects to this film. Orsen Welles did a good job as both lead actor and director. Joseph Cotton (Shadow of a Doubt) was wonderful as Jedeiah Leland, Kane's oldest friend. There were quite a few scenes which I enjoyed. Perhaps I would have enjoyed it even better had I not already known what "Rosebud" was. In addition, its reputation as the greatest movie of all time made me expect much more of it, which might also explain my disappointment. I personally look for movies that draw me in completely, strike my emotions so that I either laugh or cry or, even better, laugh and cry. I like to identify with the characters, and I love great dialogue and symbolism. I would give "Citizen Kane" 3 out of 4 stars because I was aware of the presence of some of these elements to a certain point. This was definitely a good film. But the greatest film ever? I think not! </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the greatest American film but an interesting one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will probably shock many when I state that this is not the greatest American film. It is a very interesting one. The acting is excellent, the deep focus cinematography by Greg Toland unique and the narrative structure ground-breaking. The deep focus style was different than standard studio photography of the era which featured soft backgrounds in close-ups to model the lead actors and actresses and make them attractive. Toland's photography makes everyone razor sharp and has an infinate depth of field but the actors do not look attractive with these custom lenses which suits the grim story. The editing by Robert Wise and transitions are also innovative.After having said all this, what do I find lacking in the film? Character empathy. In my favorite films, you have tremendous simpathy with the lead characters and become emotionally involved in the picture. Titles like "The Wizard of Oz", "Gone with the Wind", "Casablanca" and "The African Queen" come to mind. You experience what the characters on screen feel. In "Citizen Kane", the lead character is so self-centered and enigmatic, you don't care about his fate. You watch "Citizen Kane" objectively not subjectively. While you can marvel at the technical skill that went into it, you don't care about anyone.As to the "Rosebud" ending, it was memorable but not plausible. It's meaning is muddled and not clear from the narrative. It should've been. If you study the film carefully, you also realize that many of the interviews contain information about Kane that the person couldn't know because they weren't there during the incident.Welles was a good actor but undisciplined director. This remains his best picture in part because he actually got his act together long enough to finish it. The rest of his career encompassed half finished projects or muddled completed ones. He needed a strong producer to focus him but insisted on shooting movies in his own chaotic manner. He was lucky he had RKO behind him on "Ciziten Kane".I highly recommend seeing this film to study technique but don't expect to come away emotionally drained or exhilerated.Richard W. Haines</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film for study, but not for entertainment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching `Citizen Kane' is analogous to reading `Moby Dick'. Both are seminal, American masterpieces that lend themselves well as preceptive works for analysis. They are both respected for their innovativeness and influence. You can appreciate literary technique in the later just as you can the masterly camera angles and lighting in the former.But in the end reading Melville is interesting and engenders discussion, but I'd rather sit back and indulge in `Wise Blood' or `Portnoy's Complaint'. And given a free evening to throw in a video I'd take `The Godfather' or `Fargo' over Kane any day. The direction is flawless of course. Wells deserves all accolades that fomented from this film. A movie that should be studied by students of film but left on the shelf when entertaining on a Friday night.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A perfect mix of famous final twists</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Surely a revolutionary movie, a classic, an above that a quite entertaining story about a real man's (Hearst's) fictitious life. The ?Rosebud` element rules the movie, for someone who doesn't know it, at some points it's the only reason to go on watching. The final solution is similar to the one in ?The Shawshank Redemption`, so to say the perfect mix between the ?Usual-Suspects`-twist and the ?Sixth Sense`-twist: it gives answers to questions one hasn't asked but also satisfies the viewer by telling him ? in the very last moment ? what kept him watching impatiently.I don't have to mention that Orson Welles did a great job as director, showing stunning visual creativity (by 1940), but also his acting performance is remarkable because I think he was 25 years old and played Charles Foster Kane over a period of more than forty years and was still convincing, unlike other young actors later who won Oscars for ?elderly` roles.?Citizen Kane` is not the best film ever made for me, but it has some great moments and it was done by a talented young man in spite of many difficulties, so it became a legend.</fullReview>

The story (which some have the audacity to call "boring") is about a man who had everything...except what he really wanted, love. Why didn't he have love? Because he spent all his time trying to accumulate more power, more wealth, more fame.WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILER AHEADContrary to what many have said on this site, Rosebud not only symbolizes Kane's childhood and other superficial things like that, it also symbolizes the life he missed, the life he could have had, the joy he could have had, the love he could have had, if only money and power hadn't have gotten in the way. We all have rosebuds in our lives, and unlike Kane we are still alive to try to find them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why people don't like the greatest movie ever made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>True, Citizen Kane isn't the most gripping story ever told. However, a movie isn't defined by the story it tells. I bet most of the people that trash this movie absolutely love Pulp Fiction, another phenomenal movie. However, in neither movie is the plot particularly relevant to the point of the movie. The difference is that young people constitute the majority of movie goers and whereas Pulp Fiction is really "cool" and quite hilarious, Citizen Kane is slow and very arsty.When judging movies, there are two key considerations: entertainment and cinematic merit. They aren't well defined and often overlap, a film such as American Beauty comes to mind. However, it films are like novels. We live in a time where John Grisham and Tom Clancy are premier authors and Oprah Winfrey decides what's good and what's not. However, while certainly entertaining, John Grisham and Tom Clancy write mostly trash compared to F. Scott Fitzgerald et al. The point is that movies are oftentimes the same way.Tommy Boy is one of my favorite movies, yet it ranks nowhere near what I consider to be a great movie. It's a bunch a mindless, yet hilarious, junk barfed up onto a film reel. Citizen Kane is the polar opposite. While certainly not hilarious, it represents everything a great movie should be: it has perfect acting, directing, camera work, lighting, editing etc. Not to mention the story. The story is perfectly told. It has a message to get across and it does it extremely well, even if it is somewhat slow. So what if it doesn't put you at the edge of your seat.I'm not saying that you should like this movie. What I am saying is that it is the greatest movie ever made and I personally believe that opinions to the contrary are misguided, naive, and 100% wrong.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Those who say this is the greatest film of all time simply love it for its technical genius. A film has to be a lot more than that to be truly great. It has to have an emotional bond with the viewer. Something that's truly great could be shot on a 1987 Sony handycam on a tripod the whole time, as long as the message gets through to the viewer. Not saying that CK shouldn't be studied for technical framing and achievement, but it lacks the connection it needs. Watch a movie like Shawshank Redemption and you'll see this connection I'm talking about. And all those little things like beautiful cinematography, perfect dollies, and framing just add to it to give it balance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, I for one never got why this movie got so popular. It's okay, but there are so many better movies out there-from that time period. What about "Rebecca" that won Best Picture only the year before, and "How Green was my Valley" the one that "Citizen Kane" LOST to? Orson Welles came across as such a pudgy faced snob. I much prefered the performances of the supporters in this film. Joseph Cotten and Agnes Moorehead - you know, the ones that Welles kept trying to overshadow? They later both proved themselves. Joseph Cotten was never better than with Jennifer Jones in "Love Letters" "Portrait of Jennie" and "Since You Went Away." Welles later proved what a ham he really was by his horrible Mr. Rochester in "Jane Eyre." The guy never looked dummer. Agnes Moorehead, (whom Welles had already known from the radio show "The Shadow" certainly had a fabulous career. Most memorable to me as Endora on the show "Bewitched." Watch some other movies from the time instead of always watching this one again. You might be very surprised.</fullReview>

Orson Wells rewrote the rules for film-making and was the first to master so many film techniques. However, the formula that he created has been polished and improved upon over time. While it remains a great movie, Citizen Kane is not deserving of the title of "Greatest." For that honor, check out The Godfather.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not quite the greatest ever, but pretty darn close.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seeing Citizen Kane for the first time, my expectations were difficult to define. On one hand I was seeing a film lauded by many as the greatest ever, while my natural cynicism told me I was destined to be disappointed. I wasn't. Mind you, I don't think this IS the greatest film in history, but it is an outstanding character study of one man's bid to find happiness. As a wealthy tycoon, Kane had it all, yet died alone and unhappy in a decrepit, abandoned Xanadu. The final word to pass his lips spoke of his dear wish to return to the one time he was truly happy: as a child before he was introduced to his life as a wealthy man. There are many facets of this film which make it great: Welles' direction is superb even by modern standards (which is spectacular in 1941), his brooding plot which slowly draws out more of this fascinating character also envelopes the viewer. The controversy caused by the obvious fact that the film was based on (the very real) Randlof Hurst also increases its allure (as only controversy can). But all things aside, even though there are so many great aspects to this film, it just would not have come together were it not for the brilliant performance of Welles in the title role. He brings such a stunning array of emotions to one man that his inner conflict and struggle are painfully obvious (yet gloriously understated) to any who watch.It may not be the greatest film of all time, it certainly isn't the greatest story, but the character of Kane makes it ONE of the best ever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Citizen Kane (1941)Genre ? Drama, Mystery Standout part ? Narration, Climax"Rosebud." The movie is about the finding of the meaning of the last word by a wealthy newspaper tycoon found dead in his mansion. But as you go through, it turns out to be more than just that. Citizen Kane not just gives you a brilliant story to admire, for which it won an academy award, but the movie narrates the story in a way that was never done before with the most engaging music to give you an experience of film making at its best.The origins of Citizen Kane are well known. It is loosely based on the life of William Randolph Hearst - a powerful newspaper magnate and publisher in the United States. Hearst was Ted Turner, Rupert Murdoch and Bill Gates rolled up into an enigma. The film had to face ruthless suppression through intimidation, blackmail, newspaper smears, discrediting and FBI investigations before its release. The film starts with a "No Trespassing" signboard on the gate of an ominous castle with multifarious possessions. The death of Kane, shown in the following scene, cajoles a group of news reporters to find the mystery of "Rosebud" and the film-a-clef is told in flashbacks as they seek Kane's forgetful friends one after another. The investigation is led by William Alland as Mr. Thompson in a thankless performance as his face is barely put to camera. Thompson starts the investigation by searching for Walter Thatcher's memoirs, in the hope of finding something handy in Kane's legal guardian's narratives. Through Thatcher's memoirs Thompson comes to know of Kane's childhood. A scene follows where a young Kane is shown falling on snow and throwing snowballs as his parents determine his future. Though there is no explicit family love on display, you somehow relate to the boy with solicitude. There is incredible use of strange camera angles and shadows. The story evolves and a jubilant, exuberant, affluent and successful Charles Kane turns into a morose, grotesque, and tyrannical monster. As the film goes on and you become unsure if you will ever find the true meaning of Rosebud, the "revelation" at the end gives you the paramount satisfaction that you just watched a quintessential cinematic masterpiece.The film has praiseworthy quality humour, while not being too much in quantity. The actors have done justice to their part. Orson Welles' portrayal of Charles Foster Kane looks well-rehearsed but vulnerable at times. He is awesome when he is firm but he is shoddy when he lets his emotions go. His zingers are important to his character and he makes them look tailor-made for him. Dorothy Comingore is stunningly beautiful as his wife. Everett Sloane shines as Mr. Bernstein, more so when he narrates the past. Joseph Cotten is convincing as Jedediah Leland, Kane's only friend. The music never detaches you from the story and makes the film indelible. If you haven't seen the American Film Institute's "Greatest Film" already, you must, for it is made "pretty well in the circumstances".</fullReview>

But now a days I found this to be good, but in no way great. It was some what depressing and did not really have a solid enough message or good enough plot/entertainment value to make up for it's somber conclusion.6/10 it's still a decent flick but it's age was apparent and it is somewhat hard to relate to the character or sympathize with him which I feel is necessary to give this a higher rating.His problems were either too extreme to relate to or too common to base a movie off of...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So, I'll give this film credit for the message it sends with the importance of youth and the whole searching for rosebud idea. It seems like an overplayed film theme but Citizen Kane does a decent enough job with it. With that said, I will now proceed to rake this film over the coals. I hated it. I felt like it was dull and incredibly uninspiring. Like I said before, it had potential with it's message but it never delivered. There's an incredible lack of focus on his youth and most of the film falters in my opinion as it doesn't make Kane out to look like a confused man, it makes him out to be more tyrannical and sinister. He; cheats on his first wife, beats his second wife and forces her to perform an opera to prove that HE is not a failure, and on top of that he fires his "best friend" from his paper for writing an honest review of his wife's pitiful performance. Oh and he never sees his son, so what kind of youth is he providing for him? Now on top of all of this, how is this film innovative? I've been taking History of American Cinema at my college and I don't see anything that is new and adds to the way movies are made. I was expecting a real masterpiece and boy was I ever disappointed. I just don't understand how this film is so well spoken of.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rebuttal to The Great Cinema Swindle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I was about 12 years old, my father a political science professor and amateur film buff called me into the den. He said to me, "I want you to watch this film. It's one of the greatest movies ever made." So, I did. I watched the film with my father, and I was in tears by the end -- genuine, sobbing tears. This was usually an indication, at that age, that I had liked a movie. But my father asked me anyway if I liked it. I was only able to nod my head yes. He asked me why, and my response was, "I don't know. It was just so sad." How can a 12 year old express the great depth of the message and themes of a film like Citizen Kane? Especially when that greatest message of the film is so simple and universal.From the time this film was first released, it has been immortalized by the critics and panned by the people. It did not do well at the box office overall, despite the erudite, "ground-breaking" praise heaped upon it, and the praise overall has been about the film-making itself - the cinematography, the lighting, the performances, the unique narrative structure. As a professor of film, I teach it in all my classes. There is no way around it. As an example of film-making technique, there are few films that can compare to it on every level, but this has been talked into the ground.Film theorists, historians and movie buffs from all generations have turned Citizen Kane into the holy grail of film-making. By analyzing the complexities of the film, I believe the most simple and most powerful aspect of this film is often overshadowed, as it is very symbolically within the film ? the quest for true love. Not that love is ever simple. This is a film about a man who almost knew love but had it taken away from him before he could really hold on to it, and the rest of his life is spent trying to get it back. It is a tragic story of love lost (and truth be told, the greatest films are almost always about love lost or found). That has always been it's true strength to me.If you go into this film with the expectation of "the greatest film ever made," then you need to understand the context of that comment. It's not just about story but about the techniques of storytelling and film-making. It means that you will be watching it, for the most part, from a distance. You will be watching it for Toland's cinematography, or Mankiewicz and Welles's parallel narrative structure, or Welles's performance par excellence. And as long as you are watching it from this perspective, you may never be able to connect to the humanity of the film. And that's okay.Or you can watch it through the eyes of a 12 year old in 1981?before MTV and the internet. Simply allow all the separate techniques of film-making to come together as one, and just watch the movie. Let go of expectations...I have loved this film since I was 12 and unable to articulate why I loved it. I loved this film before I cared about cinematography and lighting, art direction and editing. I loved this film because the story of a man searching for love spoke to me, even at 12.God, I love this film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Greatest film of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even people who have never seen Citizen Kane know its the greatest film of all time. Orson Welle's debut has become an undisputed cultural benchmark - the celluloid equivalent of War and Peace, the Mona Lisa, Hamlet, Moonlight sonata, or seargent pepper's lonely hearts club band(the Beatles album, not the beegees movie). But how did it achieve and maintain this exalted position as a cinematic sacred cow? From the start, the critics were on Orsons side. The Hearst press refused to carry ads or reviews for the film, thus fatally damaging it's box office potential(Kane losing $150 000), but elsewhere the notices seemed to recognise an instant classic. 2the most surprising and cinematically exciting motion picture seen in many a month... it comes close to being the most sensational film ever made in Hollywood," gushed the New York times. Other journalists placed Welles in the revered company of legendary figures Charlie Chaplin and D W Griffith, saying,"this one film establishes him as the most exciting director now working." However, such hoopla, coupled with a relative lack of Oscars, made little difference to Welles in the years immediately following Citizen Kane. Attendant ticket sales and industry cachet would have justified the free hand Welles was given to make his debut, and placed him in a far stronger bargaining position in subsequent battles with the studios. But, with neither box office dollars nor gold plated statuettes for protection, Welles was vulnerable:follow up picture The magnificent Ambersons was taken away from the director and given an upbeat ending , and his bold ideas for future projects were treated with a mixture of suspicion and contempt. A critical canon was established with Kane firmly placed in top spot of best ever films in sigth and sounds 1962 poll and has remained at the top of greatest films ever since. Perhaps this is because although it was made in 1941, it still feels remarkably modern. Indeed, that it centres on the power of the media moguldom generations before Murdoch;takes on numerous genre meldings(detective story, biopic, backstage musical, film noir and a stunning newsreel parody) and rejects linear storytelling (yet still remains both clear and gripping make it more 90s than 40s. Yet, what separates it from modern multiplex fodder is its old school magic showmanship, intelligence and risk taking crafted into perfectly realised, stunning cinema. Devoid of the pretencion that usually permeates critic's choices, Kane unravels with intelligence, biting wit and a real sense of playful ambiguity. The big themes-the perversion of idealism, the corrupting nature of success, the impenetrability of human beings- are carried off with the lightest touch as Kane descends from vibrant newspaper man to manipulative Svengali to bloated, distant husband. While all the cast turn in great work- Cotten i breathtaking as Kanes cohort Leland-it is Welles' own performance(often overlooked in lieu of his other talents) that really grounds the directorial razzle-dazzle with substance. To revisit Citizen Kane is to experience the infinite possibilities of movies being realised right before your own eyes. The sheer audacity and delight Welles takes in flouting conventions and inventing new ones is what keeps it fresh. Itt is that unique movie, chocker with great bits-the breakfast table marriage montage. Lelands "girl on a Ferry" reminiscence, that camera ascent to the theatre rafters that solidifies into a totally satisfying whole. Considering all it appended academic apparatus(be sure to work "deep focus cinematography" revolutionary use of ceilings and he was only 25!" into the pub conversation), it remains a gloriously entertaining classic.</fullReview>

Kane's carefree childhood is interrupted when a lawyer takes him away from his parents to his new adopted family with a lot of money.From their he begins his journey with a small time newspaper and becomes a rich and powerful man.After Charles Foster Kane's death a group of journalists decide to find out the meaning of his last word Rosebud.They are shown to be unsuccessful in their quest.Rosebud is written at the back of Kane's childhood sled.This could imply that Rosebud was Kane himself as usually people write their own name behind their childhood possessions.Rosebud has a deeper implication as Kane was taken away from his parents and thus his childhood was nipped in the bud.As once a rosebud is uprooted it can never grow into a rose.One journalist says that you can tell a lot about a person by his last words.Maybe Rosebud was an expression of the fact that Kane felt like despite achieving a lot he still was a rosebud and could not become an individual.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rosebud, Even!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Citizen Kane is the story of Charles Foster Kane, a man very similar to that of William Randolph Hearst. Kane has it all, a multi-million dollar business, a mansion named Xanadu, and a celebrity that rivals the President of the United States. Even with all of this success, he dies alone and old uttering the mysterious word: "Rosebud." What does the word "Rosebud" mean, you ask? Well, that's where the movies begins. In flashbacks, we hear all about the life and times of this very rich man called Kane. It's up to the reporters and you to figure out what it all means.A very interesting plot, but that's not the best part. You see, a movie like Citizen Kane has to have a lot more to be called the greatest movie of all time. Believe me, it has everything. I was lucky enough to see this film in the theater at a classic movie screening. The great thing is that it was my first viewing of this masterpiece. I'd heard a lot about it and over the years it got its massive reputation, but I didn't think it could be this good.One cannot describe in words how a movie could be so great. A film directed by a 25-year-old doesn't sound like a classic, but Orson Welles was able to change all that. His script is one of the greatest of all time. He had so much creativity that it all oozed out of him and onto the film. His portrayal of Kane is so realistic that you forget you're only watching a 25-year-old. The make-up artists can also take credit for this. All of the technical achievements are a marvel. This is the first movie to actually use a ceiling, so you know it has to be good. Another unforgettable use of scenery involves a dining room table. Kane and his wife have been growing farther and farther apart. To show this, Welles has a montage of dinners with the table getting longer and making Kane and his wife physically get farther and farther apart. That's just one example of the genius that this film is.It's too bad that 1941 audiences weren't able to really see this movie. The character of Kane was so close to Hearst that the famous newspaperman caused the film to fail at the box office. Hearst didn't want this movie to be seen. Luckily for us, we now have this film forever and can view it when ever we want. I highly recommend this milestone in film-making history.</fullReview>

Small things happen that lead to big things, and the joy of watching this movie is in paying attention to every little detail, and getting to know a life. Personally, I believe it is the greatest movie ever made for this very reason (though many hate it for the same.) If you don't like life, don't watch this movie. If you don't like watching characters develop before your very eyes, don't watch this movie. If you can't see the greatness of the insight provided by quite a young man, then *please* don't bother rating this movie.

		<shortDescription>A 20 year old film student on "Citizen Kane"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In terms of the narrative as well as the plot arrangement, the genre of this film could be well considered as "mystery". This is in reference to the "hunt" provided by the utterance of the word "Rosebud" by the lead character Charles Foster Kane that gushed forth the investigation of a group of journalists regarding the mystery behind this last word of his. This film is very rich in symbolisms. Some of which are the following: 1)The sled which had the word "Rosebud" on it was the symbol of the great fortune that entered his life which he, on the other hand, greatly despised in the end. It also stood for the naivety he lost as a child and the joy that only his real family could've brought him. 2)The crystal ball that had a winter scene inside it which he dropped upon losing his very last breath, on the other hand, was the symbol of the poor yet happy life he was born into. 3)In the scene where he was told that he had lost his position, he was seen descending the spiral staircase. It was a great shot from the top of the stairs that symbolized his life or rather, his career spiraling downward. 4)In the scene where he was finally turning over his empire, he stood by a very tall window. It was shot from a distance accentuating how small Kane is compared to the grand height of the window. I thought it symbolized 2 things: The tall window was his empire getting bigger than ever and him shrinking into this very small individual losing grip of the things he once had. 5)The film opened with a very dark and gloomy Xanadu which after seeing the whole film made me realize that it must have been a symbol of Kane's life at that point- nearing its end and extracted of the beautiful things it once had. 6)Lastly, one of the last few scenes of the film was a gliding shot from the top of his things (mostly in boxes) lined outside Xanadu ready for disposal. At first glance, I thought it was a view of NYC from the top. When I realized it was actually a shot of Kane's things ready for disposal, I thought that maybe it was another symbolism offered by this great film. Perhaps of the great city he thrived and succeeded in now already distant from his reach if not LOST from him already. Orson Welles being the producer, lead actor and director of this film proved to many that such great efforts are duly given great responses. This film, as what many of us might know already, is considered as one of the greatest if not THE greatest film ever made by seasoned movie critics and ordinary moviegoers alike. I, however, have not yet seen that many movies yet for me to make the same conclusion although I did witness for myself the greatness that this film is. The film enthusiast that I am, I am waiting to see more great films like "Lawrence of Arabia", "Gone with the Wind", "Out of Africa", "A Streetcar named Desire" and many more of these "great films" tagged as such by movie critics all over the globe. Only after seeing these other films could I believe it right to finally make the conclusion regarding which is the best and perhaps, which also is the worst (that is, if there actually is one). As of the moment, I could only speak well of "Citizen Kane" which I was thankful to have finally seen. Aside from the great mystery and many symbolisms it offers, I second the motion that this film did break new grounds for storytelling in film as it started with the ending, told the story through a series of flashbacks and ended with where it started focusing, in particular, on the "NO TRESPASSING" sign on Xanadu's tall gate. I would say that this film requires deep thinking on and perhaps, appreciation of the subtexts and rich symbolisms it has for its viewers. Another merit that should be rightly given to this film are for its achievements in special visual effects- the "mirror scene" after Susan Alexander left Kane where the latter stood parallel to a life-sized mirror showcasing a fantastic shot of "several Kanes", the ridiculously huge fireplace in the similarly ridiculously huge mansion and the many other eye-pleasuring scenes showcased through exceptional camera shots and angles. All in all, "Citizen Kane" is a truly astounding achievement in film-making and a thought-provoking masterpiece in the field of storytelling. It's no wonder why it is considered as one of the best films ever made, if not THE best, in the history of worldwide cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An in-depth look at Citizen Kane</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the newspaper mogul William Randolph Hearst, Citizen Kane takes us along a news reporter's quest to discover the mysterious meaning of "Rosebud," Charles Foster Kane's last words, by piecing together important chapters of his life in a series of interviews with the people who "knew" the man best. It may not be considered the most universally entertaining film, however Orson Welles's Citizen Kane is among the most interesting and revolutionary works of art of the film genre.Orson Welles learned the taste of success very early in his career as an actor, writer, and director. Some of his first major successes include modern renditions of Shakespeare's Macbeth and Julius Caesar with the Mercury Theatre. Soon after such box office hits along with the famous War of the Worlds radio broadcast that gained him national notoriety, Welles landed a deal with Hollywood. They were so confident in him that he was offered Carte Blanche to do what ever he wanted with no limitations. Welles seized this opportunity not to make a move for his career but to make a move for the art of film. The end result was Citizen Kane.One of the central themes of the film is the difficulty of interpreting a life. After viewing a film biography containing bulleted achievements of Charles Foster Kane's life, its producer asks his reporters, "Who, really, was Charles Foster Kane?" implying that a man is more than the sum of his achievements, material wealth or even actions. Thus reporter Jerry Thompson, played by actor William Alland, takes on the mission to find meaning in Kane's last words. However, his daunting task leads to another obstacle and central theme to the film: the unreliability of memory. In interviewing those who had been closest to Kane, Thompson finds that he can dig no deeper than biased/blurred perceptions of Kane's actions: one storyteller, Susan Alexander Kane, played by Dorothy Comingore recounts her life with Kane, her late husband, in an alcoholic rant. Another, Jetidiah Leland, a former friend of Kane played by Joseph Cotten, doesn't complete the puzzle either in his senile recollection of his relationship with Kane. Because of this, the image of Kane's life can never quite come into focus and Thompson ultimately fails in his mission.One of the most notorious devices of Citizen Kane is the innovative cinematographic technique. The use of new camera angles, deep focus, and strategic contrast has a subtle but profound effect on the mood, thematic direction, and overall story. The combination of camera angles in the floor and ceiling along with deep focus allowed Welles to morph size and perspective making the audience very aware or unaware of the characters' size in relationship to others and their surroundings. The fact that they had to build ceilings into sets also added an element of realism. The contrast of light and dark is used to give further emphasis of importance or meaning on specific elements of a scene. One example is the blinding white snow against the dark, sullen young Kane right before he is taken away from his home. Another is the frequent radiance of Kane emphasizing his grandeur next to the inferior reporters who are cast into shadows.Welles had been at first reluctant to enter the film-making business because of the little respect it received from the art community. But after Citizen Kane, he had single-handedly transformed the industry and revealed the true artistic potential of film. This coupled with its multidimensional layers of innovations in technology, acting, and story structure constitutes Citizen Kane's place at the top of almost all movie critics' list of film masterpieces.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>That which is required</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Power, control, conspiracy, manipulation, method acting, madness, malevolence, domination, dictators, and directors. We all at one point crave power, and some are lucky enough to get it. Inevitably that power will be abused as history teaches obsessed men no lessons, but on occasion great things can come from the obsessed mind. Orson Welles is such a character. His drive and determination to conquer every medium from radio to theater to film yielded one of the most superbly crafted films in history in Citizen Kane. The opening scene with the abundance of fences telling the audience that they are about to tread where few have gone before. Showing a man who has seemingly all the power in the universe only to be left in the end wishing for the simple life that could never be. Welles used every trick visually and narratively to get his points across and it shows to a somewhat heavy-handed "I'm going to beat you over the head with my brilliance" extent, but none the less gets the job done. Charles Foster Kane cannot simply be a larger than life character, he must really be larger than life as nearly every scene featuring him is shot in low angles and he always appears to be towering over everyone else. One must wonder if he was standing on a soapbox half the time. Citizen Kane is a film that tries to be many things at once; a serious drama, a hilarious comedy, a vicious satire, and it succeeds brilliantly. Just like Welles knew that war of the worlds would cause a panic he knew that Citizen Kane would cause controversy.....bravo. William Randolf Hearst was the most powerful man at the time, and what better way to get your foot in the door of the entertainment empire than to attack him. Hearst made a living out of destroying lives and for all intents and purposes he deserved to be ruined. Though Kane is loosely based on Hearst he seems to have more in common with Welles in the years of isolation and loneliness that awaited him in his latter days. Kane is a man who has this abundance of power and is obsessed with acquisition, but for what? In the end Kane has all this material wealth but he really has nothing; no friends, no family, living in exile without the warmth of human comfort. Citizen Kane is a portrait of self inflicted sorrow, and as shown in The Battle Over Citizen Kane, its director is as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Orson Welles masterpiece; a cinematic gem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The title alone speaks for itself. Almost every movie fan will have heard of Citizen Kane as being the greatest movie made. When one movie is best of its genre, it's sometimes referred to as 'the Citizen Kane of musicals or horror' or whatever you like. I saw this finally after waiting for so long. I wasn't let down.The story is about Charles Foster Kane (Orson Welles), who when he dies, utters a single word "Rosebud." Soon after, a bunch of reporters interview Kane's closest friends and work colleagues to try and find out what the word means. Kane's life unfolds in a series of flashback's as we draw closer to what "Rosebud" really is.There probably isn't much I can really say that hasn't already been said hundreds of times. This is a GREAT movie. Not my favourite of all time, but it is I'm my Top 10. I can see why this is hailed as best picture, it is truly an achievement, all the more that it was made in 1941 and it Welles' was only in his early 20's.Orson Welles' performance is absolutely flawless, his portrayal of Kane is perfect. The supporting cast is also fine, considering their careers were just starting. The use of lighting is done perfectly and the musical score, done by Bernard Herrmann, is perfectly suited. Even though the plot runs through a set of flashbacks, not once is the story too confusing or complex.The movie runs for quite a while and may seem to drag in one or two places, but that shouldn't be a deterrent because ultimately, the movie pays off. This is a highly recommended movie for fans of cinema.5/5.</fullReview>

When I was a kid (around 12) I thought that was one of the coolest looking things ever.- "NEWS ON THE MARCH" I love the way they made the newsreel look old in spots.- The way the light from the projector cuts through the darkness and smoke and only barely illuminates the reporters.- The echo at the Thatcher Memorial Library from the librarians voice and footsteps and the way the light floods the table where the reporter reads Thatcher's journal.- When Agnus Moorehead (Kanes mother) yells "Charles". The slight crack in her voice breaks my heart every time.- When Kane tells Thatcher that his paper will lose money and will have to close in sixty years. I love how it is an uninterrupted take until it cuts to Welles saying the line: "at the rate of a million dollars a year, I'll have to close this place - in sixty years."- When Kane says "I always gagged on that silver spoon" and these exchanges: Thatcher: You're too old to be calling me Mr. Thatcher, Charles Charles Foster Kane: You're too old to be called anything else.- When Bernstein tells the reporter: Bernstein: Well, it's no trick to make a lot of money... if what you want to do is make a lot of money.AndBernstein: A fellow will remember a lot of things you wouldn't think he'd remember. You take me. One day, back in 1896, I was crossing over to Jersey on the ferry, and as we pulled out, there was another ferry pulling in, and on it there was a girl waiting to get off. A white dress she had on. She was carrying a white parasol. I only saw her for one second. She didn't see me at all, but I'll bet a month hasn't gone by since that I haven't thought of that girl.AndBernstein: Old age. It's the only disease, Mr. Thompson, that you don't look forward to being cured of.- The Mr Kane song- The breakfast scene that succinctly shows the deteriorating relationship between Kane and Emily, his first wife. - When Leland Keeps asking the reporter for a cigar and when he saysLeland: I can remember absolutely everything, young man. That's my curse - that's one of the greatest curses ever inflicted on the human race, memory.- The way you see the same scene at the opera twice giving the viewer another perspective- When Kane and Susan Alexander meet. Also this line Kane: I run a couple of newspapers. What do you do?- The Shot of Kane giving his campaign speech- When Leland and Kane discuss his defeat and this line Kane: A toast,Jedediah, to love on my terms. Those are the only terms anybody ever knows - his own.- Bernard Herrman writing an opera that's supposed to be bad.- After the opera tour scene we see a close up of a light bulb dissolve into the shot where Susan took an overdose or a poison while Kane bangs on the door.- Susan's jigsaw puzzles.- The huge fireplace.- The weird back round during the everglade picnic scene.- Kanes destruction of Susan's room.- The mirrors he walks by after he picks up the snow globe. - At the end of the interview with Susan, The reporter says he feels sorry for Kane, Susan: Don't you think I do.- The credits at the end.- Last but not least, Orson Welles and his great direction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An above-average film, yet massively overrated.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Citizen Kane is a mostly engaging story of Charles Foster Kane brought up by a wealthy banker after his parents couldn't take care of him, and then blossoms into a mega-rich newspaper tycoon.Orson Wells is excellent as the main character, and the special effects are exquisite, but unfortunately these two points carry the majority of this empty film.The film was far too short, moronic characters other than Kane and a bad soundtrack(Which really couldn't be helped anyway). Had the film improved upon this I would have no doubt the film would have been perfection. They didn't scratch the surface enough on Kane, and I felt empty once again viewing a supposed masterpiece.In case you are wondering and disagree with me, I do not judge how old a film is, and I detest today's movies because of the evil-minded love for money. I don't want to get political in a review but the people who own the show and make the movies (Including the Directors) reap huge benefits from a dumb-downed population. This is a movie which defied this fascism, but it still doesn't reach a standard I would want to expect cinema to aspire to.However, it was an influence on other films, it has several excellent scenes that impress you and Orson Wells is an excellent actor. I was touched in several scenes and no doubt Orson Wells can be an exceedingly brilliant movie-maker. Whatever it was, actors not up to Wells's 'ahead of his time' mind, lack of movie time or some other factor, it cannot be all end all most have praised it.Very Worthwhile, but not to the extent other people have placed it in my opinion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The greatest dull movie ever made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When watching a film, the average viewer comes to expect a few things. They expect a beginning, a middle, and an end. They expect building drama and a climax. In this film, they get both, only the film itself is the drama and climax--the beginning, middle, and end--and not the story.Orson Welles takes all of his talents in radio, theatre, and writing and tackles a new genre, the cinema. In the process, he does things unheard of in contemporary techniques and stuns critics... well, a few of them. Most of the critics and the general audience "didn't get it", so to speak. That of course doesn't stop its fame, for it has another pull that keeps it alive for years before it becomes embraced fully: a nice helping of controversy, both with the "outrageous" techniques and the, uh, political commentary.Today, we have a film that will never die and shouldn't. Breaking traditions in more ways than one, Welles has assembled celluloid with more poetry than what has come to be expected of cinema both then and now. Still, poetry isn't always liked, and contemporary audiences may have issue with the general dullness of the story, for after all, the career of Welles and the controversy of the film are sparks and explosions, the Rosebud mystery is the intrigue, and the importance is the art-value, but the movie itself trudges along, hardly leaving room for any entertainment.Part of this is intentional, and used to great effect. The movie is, after all, about failure, and regardless of how many times we watch it, it is begun and end with "No Trespassing". One problem modern audiences may definitely have is understanding that this film doesn't even pretend to answer its own mystery, despite the so-called revelation at the end. It's an exploration film where the exploration is the finale, without goal. Because of the perfection of the failure theme, the movie leaves the audience just as empty as the characters... and then what is the audience supposed to do with it? Thus, it all becomes a matter of approach. This film should be seen, but it doesn't necessarily have to be appreciated. It's worthy of its place as a critically-acclaimed classic, and yet it's still debatable whether it is worth it.--PolarisDiB</fullReview>

The photography is wonderful and superior to any movie made, going ahead over 40 or 50 years ahead of it's time, by the way,in mostly all the movie,every element displayed in screen is in deep focus. According to Orson Welles,this gives the possibility and freedom to the viewer to see what he wants and not what the director dictates. The special effects are perfect,of course we're not going to see big explosions or computer made effects because in 1940 this wasn't possible, so every special effect was made by photography techniques, editing or hand made. Citizen Kane is also a display of master acting performances,and a controversial script based on the life of newspaper authority and millionaire William Randolph Hearst, reason which almost shot down the film for the audiences forever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Movie Ever...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A movie that shows all the greed, vanity, pain and suffering required to attain the American dream. Kane wanted power and money so bad, that he was willing to end up a lonely bitter man because of it (reality may have dictated fiction in the case of Wells and his later dealings). The drama is amazing. The story is original. He used effects never seen before, like the boardroom scene, and the Eicher-like snow globe scene in the beginning. Not only is it a hallmark of a film, Orsen Wells wrote it when he was only 25 years old. Can you remember what you were doing at 25? Anyone who rates this movie less that a "10" should not be rating this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>`Citizen Kane' is ranked one of the best movies of all time, and with good reason. Between the lighting effects, the great talent, and the symbolism, every person could be happy watching this movie.The symbolism that is shown in this movie is truly remarkable. In the beginning scene, there are at least three examples of symbolism. First, there is a `No Trespassing' sign. This shows that Kane did not like people entering his private life. Next, there is an iron `K' on the gate. This, along with the fact that his house is built on a man-made mountain, shows that he wants to be more powerful and `set above' everyone else.The talent selected for this movie only added to its greatness. Orson Welles plays Charles Foster Kane, a politician, and owner of the newspaper The Inquirer. Throughout the movie, Orson Welles shows the emotion of every situation. One example of this is when it shows Kane as a child. When he finds out that he is being taken away he pushes the man over with his sled.The lighting in this movie is absolutely fantastic. Because `Citizen Kane' is in black and white, the lighting plays a very important role. One scene that was particularly effective was when Charles and Mrs. Kane go to talk to Mr. Gettys. When they are having the meeting, you cannot see Gettys' face, only his body. This is effective because it puts a `revenge' feel to the conversation.Overall, this movie is suitable for most viewers. It includes every aspect that makes up a good movie. Good talent, great special effects, and fantastic symbolism, just to name a few.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>pretty good but not great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>`Typical rich guy'. that's what comes to mind when watching this movie. The plot line is simple and predictable that acting is good but not spectacular. (But then again what makes an actor spectacular?) These are things that this reviewer thinks made the movie not such a hit at its first release. However, the artistic value along with some of the `scandal' involved in Citizen Kane is what made it a classic years later. Citizen Kane is a story of a man's life from childhood to death. His story is told through the flashbacks and memories of the people who knew him. The movie starts with showing him on his deathbed when he utters the word `Rosebud' and then the announcements of his death hit the newspapers. When a group of men are reviewing a newsreel that they want to put into action they realize they want some meat to the story and that's when the search begins to find out what `Rosebud' means. The men obviously can't ask Kane so they travel around doing interviews and trying to put the puzzle pieces together. This plot idea is a great way to put the story together but can sometimes become confusing with the many different characters that come in and out during different flashbacks. All in all this story is very interesting when you want to devote the time to try to fully understand the character of Kane through the flashbacks of others. As before stated: the acting is not spectacular, there are moments of stiffness and unrealistic acting like when Kane is trashing one of the rooms in his mansion because his wife left him. However kudos must be given to Orson Welles who not only starred in, but also produced and directed this movie, then on top of that is was such an artistic film as well. Citizen Kane was the first movie of its kind. Many innovative camera angles were used, such as placing the camera on the floor, and also lighting and placement of people were big parts of the artistic and value of this film. At times the lighting tricks are less effective because an actor will be talking and all the viewer can see is their outline and the actor's face is completely in darkness. This can have a distracting effect on the viewer since it's not very often that people talk to each other in complete darkness. Citizen Kane was speculated by some as to have been tracing the life of real life yellow journalist, William Randolph Hearst; who also coincidently experienced some of the many things that Kane did. Years later this has attracted the attention of many people when the stories of how Hearst was willing to buy all copies of the movie that were made in order to prevent them from being released. Citizen Kane is a great artistic film and certainly the greatest black-and-white film this reviewer has seen. Worthy of being #9 on IMDB's top 250? I'm still not sure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As great as this film is, it has one glaring plot hole: why would Kane squander his political fortune and public standing on someone like Susan Alexander? After all, this is no Clinton-Monica relationship; once it's discovered, Kane doesn't deny it or try to hush it up. Instead, he openly brandishes it against his enemies, both real and perceived. The film attributes this to his megalomania, but doesn't explain why a man so craving of public affection would throw it all away on a mistress.I rank "The Treasure of Sierra Madre" as the greatest film in history. And for what it's worth, I feel that the greatest portrayal of a character was Alastair Sims' Scrooge in "A Christmas Carol."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great film, but not the greatest.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILER I finally got to watch this film and found it quite interesting. To sum it up, a famous, extremely rich Charles Foster Kane dies in his castle home; his last spoken word `Rosebud' - a snow-shaker glass ball falls from his now lifeless hand, shattering on the floor.A news media company producing a 1941 newsreel on his life wants to find out what `Rosebud' refers to, so it assigns a reporter to find out by interviewing significant people in the man's life. Flashbacks in the man's life show a happy young boy (in a humble 1871 setting) playing in the snow who gets basically sold off by his mother for an enormous amount of money (for mineral rights to a gold mine) to an aristocratic guardian, is raised by that guardian, gets access to the money, buys a some-what stagnant newspaper against the guardians wishes, becomes overbearing to others in his pursuit of personal indulgences and pursuits, supposedly starts a war (not shown in the film), cheats on his wife for a floozy with a toothache, runs for Governor, makes enemies with a local city boss, the city boss blackmails him regarding the affair with the floozy costing him the Governor's election, gets divorced and marries the floozy, makes the floozy sing opera and builds her an opera house (even though it's obvious she can't and doesn't want to sing), makes more enemies, builds an exorbitant castle for the floozy, the floozy can't take it anymore and divorces him (significantly, she states that this is the only thing in his adult life that he didn't make the decision on), trashes the floozy's room after she leaves - picks up the snow-shaker glass ball and says `Rosebud', becomes a recluse, then dies a lonely old man longing for "Rosebud". The reporter never finds out what `Rosebud' means. The final scene shows workers burning most of the things that Citizen Kane saved in his lifetime. A snow sled is thrown into the fire as waste, symbolizing what this man did with his life and available resources. As it turns out, `Rosebud' is the brand name of the sled he played on as a boy, and his reference to it is the only happy time in his life, which was simplistic and fun.A good film, rather dark, but worth seeing. A great performance by Orson Wells. He was quite young at the time and performed the movements and mannerisms of a middle aged and elderly man to perfection. Another good note is that this picture is the first time radio performers of the likes of Joseph Cotton and Agnes Morehead were first seen by the American movie audience. 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well done, but not #1</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>About six years ago, I came across a list put out by the American Film Institute. It was the top 100 movies of all time, and I made it my personal goal over my lifetime to watch every movie on that list. Every now and again I watch one of the movies on the list, and check it off my yellowed piece of newsprint.I got to see quite a number of those movies, and the list was beginning to fill with red checkmarks. But there was one odd point. I had never seen movie number 1. The top rated movie of all time by the AFI. I had never seen Citizen Kane.Now I finally have a red checkmark next to number one. What's my take? It's an enjoyable movie, well done and well presented. As a movie by today's standards, it's simply a good film. The best movie of all time? Not even close. Revolutionary, influential, and important - yes. The aura that surrounds this movie, the scandal and the social commentary give this film its credibility. The style of the filmmaking is ahead of its time, and its presentation influenced countless productions after it. Even though I had never seen the movie, I knew what 'Rosebud' was by the time I was seven years old.It's not the story that puts this movie in the number one spot; it's the aura and influence that surround this movie. And I have to give credit where credit is due - Citizen Kane may not be the best film ever, but so far I believe it may be the most important.</fullReview>

I think there has been a hype about this movie which lacked any reasonable ground.(Not new in Hollywood! Think of "Shakespeare in Love"...). Orson Welles did a good job directing, but the story is not appalling at all! The character of Kane is not heroic, not tragic enough, he´s not villain enough either. I think his life was not even really interesting. And some of the actors were horrible, e.g. his second wife. When the movie ended, I thought: "What now is the point of that movie?!?"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Greatest Movie Ever?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most of the IMDb-comments singularly focus on whether or not this film is the Greatest Movie Ever Made. To me, the question is completely irrelevant. I feel you can't appreciate movies without somehow connecting them to your own system of experiences and resulting convictions. Since everyone has different experiences (that goes for the movie viewing experiences as well) we all connect differently to different films. I believe it's impossible to look at a film from an objective perspective external to yourself. Even if you could scale the variables there's no objective way of saying this film has the Best Script, the Best Acting or Directing or whatever. What such judgements frequently represent is some form of idea that objectiveness is attainable. What they really mean is hard to determine. Does this film with its story of a man having every physical possession anyone could ever want, but not that which he truly desires, (still) strike a chord with that many people? Or is it a self-fulfilling prophecy in that when people watch the film known as The Greatest Ever, they will see exactly that?Maybe it's a little bit of both, but a definite and undeniable important factor is how it revolutionized moviemaking. We can in the least and objectively say Orson Welles' debut did that. Everything from its non-linear story structure to its visual ambitions were extremely novel at the time (especially in American cinema), far more so than what we're used to hailing as 'revolutionay' moviemaking nowadays. Cameras that seem more mobile than ever before, extraordinary use of Gregg Toland's deep-focus photography, brilliant make-up and innovative editing (the shot fading into a newspaper picture) are some examples of the film's technical inventiveness.The inventiveness employed in writing Citizen Kane is slightly less impressive if you look at the film retrospectively, as it did not revolutionize moviemaking as much as the film's techniques did. However, the script still stands tall above most others. It paints the life of Charles Foster Kane post-mortem, as a collection of visually-represented memories of him related to an investigating reporter by the people who 'knew' Kane best. In this manner, the movie builds brick upon brick of an idea of who Charles Foster Kane was, but only in our heads. The film continually shows him not from his own perspective but from that of others. This does not necessarily lead to contemplating in how far there still is an 'real' Kane, and in how far he is just the product of the people's subjective memories. But it does lead to starkly contrasting perspectives of the man. A foolish arrogant businessman, a ruthless megalomaniacal man uncapable of love or a enthusiastic young man brought down by his own success? The character of Kane is all and neither and only in our minds do the differing views of him coalesce to an idea of the complete man. Important for forming this idea is the grounding of the story in the newsreel which starts the film. It serves as a media perspective on the man, a perspective created by media he himself helped to create. It's completely over the top with its narration and totally believable as an actual newsreel, and here it serves as a skeleton.Central to the story is its plot of a faceless reporter trying to find the meaning behind Kane's final spoken word 'Rosebud'. When we find out what it means we don't. We find out what if refers too, but are we ever told why is it exactly this word he chose to use as his last one? No, because we're meant to fill it in ourselves. In my mind it refers to the only time in his life where he had but did not consciously acknowledge the one thing he really wanted, namely love. The rest of his life he pursues it but finds he himself has none to give. What he has to give is money, charisma, talent and more money, but as a man he's as emotionally bankrupt as he could be. Therefore he never receives any and dies a bitter man. The most important question this always raises to me is why did Kane have no love to give? For me, the answer lies, at least in part, in the ridiculous ammount of assets entrusted to the man. Kane is a man who, from a certain (early) point in his life was trained to be of of the leading men in the world's economy. But also a man who was given the resources to indulge in anything he might want to do. A product of and for the industrial age if there ever was one. 'Regular' people growing up in 'regular' environments have to develop a capacity for loving other ones, independent of whether or not the are known to them. Kane never has to develop this capacity. To put it in his words:"If I wouldn't have had so much money, I would've been a great man. Under the circumstances I think I did pretty well."A term like Greatest Film Ever may sound like nonsense to me, but that doesn't mean I have no opinion. There's no doubting Citizen Kane's importance in the history of cinema and there's no doubting how intricate this film is in presenting a picture of a man (who, of course, was to great extent William Randolph Hurst - Orson Welles even uses dialogue that quotes the man!). I enjoyed it tremendously, also not in the least due to the expert performances by Joseph Cotton and Welles himself. And I feel it's techniques are dynamic enough to stand up to most of today's efforts. It did never connect to me in a way that made me think it's the undisputed masterpiece people say it is. Indeed, it found it emotionally too distant at times. For me, not The Greatest Film, not My Favourite Film (something I do believe in), just a really good one.Rating: 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The dark side of the American dream</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Citizen Kane is truly an excellent film. Before you mistake this review for another empty "This is a classic, see it, best movie ever made" rundown I advise anyone who hasn't seen "Citizen Kane" yet to read on, because I'll be very informative about what makes this a fantastic movie. You see, people who write vague reviews are only supplementing their true opinion with what they are egged on to believe by other people. "The Godfather" is a prime example of that, as every positive IMDb user review with the exception of two or three comprehends what they really thought of the film. The rest is simply rambling from twits who were either enamored with the hype or simply excited by those Italian accents and sadistic violence. (As you will see, I do not recommend "The Godfather." see my review. Although I feel exactly the opposite about "Citizen Kane", I'm sure it has (and will continue to have) the same amount of vague comments.) I saw "Citizen Kane" on the impetus of its tagline as a landmark film and that Orson Welles' directed it. I did not know it was on the IMDb Top 10 or how many awards it won. Citizen Kane is an early examination of the American goal of industry. Charles Foster Kane starts out as a not so successful child, nurtured by connections and networking into one the richest publishers ever to walk the face of the earth. Loosely based on the career of William Randolph Hearst, who faced a similar not so glamourous remainder of his life, but unlike Kane he was a Nazi and an anti-Communist. As an actor Orson Welles is a chameleon and extremely unforgettable in the role of one man who had everything but one thing money can't buy. I advise you to watch Citizen Kane if you have not seen it already and to keep in mind that it was made in a totally different time period in America. Every decade (and century), a one of a kind movie will be released, and while I can't say Citizen Kane is the best movie ever made, it deserves Top 5 recognition as one of the best films of the 20th century.</fullReview>

We never really see the face of the reporter. I kind of liked that. I really don't know what the director was trying to accomplish, but I liked the mystery behind it. I would see this movie again.

		<shortDescription>Very far from the greatest film of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw Citizen Kane at the Arts' Cinema here at Cambridge the other day, and I cannot see why people rave about it. Quite honestly, I don't even think it is a particularly great film, let alone "The Greatest Film of All Time". There are a few redeeming features of course (as you'd expect from Orson Welles) such as Welles' acting in some (not all) of the scenes, some excellent shots from the ground when Kane has just lost his campaign and his friend is drunk and they're talking for the last time in a long while. These few redeeming features hardly make up for the fact that it is poorly conceived and poorly executed. Most of the acting is fair to middle whilst some of it is downright bad, the plot could have been quite interesting; the downfall of Kane from idealistic youth to power crazy old man. However it is stretched well beyond its limits, each scene being told as many as 3 times. Some might retort that telling the scene 3 times is good (I've heard people mention the fragmented story, but just look at Pulp Fiction which does a considerably better job of this), but really it is nothing special and has been done much better by other films such as "Rashomon" by Akira Kurosawa where the story is retold by each of the participants each time significantly differently. And to top it all, the whole business of "Rosebud" is disappointing. Having an interesting twist at the end of a film is a good thing in general, but in Citizen Kane it is rather a pathetic twist. So the reporter says "I don't think one word could ever explain a man's life" and the word does in fact explain his life. Great. ONE good feature of this film, possibly enough for a short film, but not more. Okay, in a historical context, maybe that was something new and amazing at the time, but now it is old hat. Films like "The Usual Suspects" put it to shame, and if Citizen Kane is supposed to be the "Best Film of All Time", it can't by definition be taken in a historical context. A Touch of Evil is an infinitely superior film on every account and also by Orson Welles, and in my opinion a far better contender for the title of "Best Film of All Time" than Citizen Kane. If anyone can come up with some genuine reasons why this film is the best of all time, or even very good by modern standards, then please mail me, I'd love to know them, but if it is only good from a historical context, then fine, very interesting, and it's time to move on now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Citizen Kane is one of these films that one feels obliged to watch in order to be able to discuss it with other film fans.I found that as sound take is still 1941 technology the low quality of the sound makes the dialogue nearly impossible to follow. Am I unfair? Possibly, but when Orson Wells rejoices in background noise over spoken dialogue, not so muchActors are awfully static, and they do not convey emotions, they do not raise empathy, I found it impossible to connect with them.The shooting is sometimes innovative, fairly modern, but I do not judge the merits of a film for the impact it had on other films, nor how good or how new it was when it came out, I judge it for what it produces on me now.As for the story, the "mystery" of Rosebud being the sort of philosophical thought that a man always longs for his childhood happiness, sorry about that, but it does not justify 90 minutes.I resent the lack of clues towards that mystery too. It seems that Orson Wells thought "I'm going to do the biography of a media tycoon, what could I do to pretend there is a story?" and then came up with some sort of vague philosophical idea about the meaning of life, et voila!If you disagree with this opinion and think "He did not get the true meaning of the film", just remember this one thing: I judge a film for what it brings to me now, not for what it brought others a long time ago. By today's standards, Citizen Kane has fallen into the "old boring film" category.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good movie, but only average for its time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was a good movie. For many years I avoided this movie because all my life it was touted by "elite" movie critics as the best movie ever made. I finally saw it in January 2006. In its original uncut form. It was a pretty darn good movie. However I thought that the screenplay and acting, especially by Orsen Welles, was rather stiff, formulaic, and contrived. I think that the only reason it received high acclaim was the fact that it was very controversial at the time, was not a hit at the box office, and was generally not liked by the general populace. Remember the context of the time in which it was filmed. World war II was in its infancy. People were just not in the mood to see this kind of autocratic genre, particularly the opulence of Xanadu. People just were not in the mood for this type of movie. There was one movie, however, that the people were looking for that was very relevant at the time, family oriented and emotional. To the credit of the Academy, this other movie (go ahead look it up) won the Oscar for best movie in 1941, beating Citizen Kane. It also won other Oscars. If Citizen had been produced in the 60s, I would have rated it higher than 4, but I believe it has been vastly overrated. Gold standard, not hardly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie, yes, the greatest, no</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you want to make a movie seem even better than it already is, don't ever tell someone it is the greatest movie ever made. Not only will you most likely be telling the truth, you will also avoid setting a potential viewer's expectations far too high.Over the years, countless professional and amateur film critics have been herolding Citizen Kane as the greatest movie of all time. It is logical, then, that when I watch it in 2002, it should be the greatest movie I have ever seen. As you have already guessed, it is not. This movie is for a certain breed of people. It's dark realization on screen and an obvious lack of a character the audience can readily sympathize with can easily turn off many-a viewer. I found myself making a serious effort just watching the TV, obviously something that rarely happens.Potential viewers be warned: you will not be blown away the first time you watch this. The "killer" ending has been spoiled for everybody and the many great themes contained in this rich (maybe too rich) story will not be picked up when first watching this. My advice to anyone watching this for the first time is to wade through the twisting, often uninteresting plot, then rewind and enjoy the characters and images without having to worry about following the story.In conclusion, while Citizen Kane must have been the best movie when it came out, contemporary viewers might find it unappealing at first viewing and anticlimaxes thanks to the now-unsurprising surprise ending (not its fault, but something to consider), which in my opinion makes it fall short of best movie status. For a movie to work on many levels, which Citizen Kane does (but certainly isn't the only one) it must first work at the most superficial and let the viewer dissect it on his own. If you want to watch a fun classic that also has something to say, I recommend Casablanca.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still Pretty Impressive</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Still impressive after all these decades, today "Citizen Kane" is probably more admired and analyzed than it is enjoyed, but there is plenty to admire. Even for those who just want to watch a good movie, not to analyze one, there's a lot to see. True, it's not really 'the greatest film ever made', especially because there isn't really such a thing, anyway, as 'the' one greatest film. There are a lot of great films, and by almost any standard this is one of them.Welles used his own skill and creativity along with his talented cast and crew to create a story that is a compelling character study and a thoughtful look at some significant aspects of life. The main character was based on a notorious figure of the era, but Welles made it much more than a story limited to his times, by bringing out what was behind his characters, and making the audience understand what the characters did not see about themselves. There are Kanes in every era (and also equivalents of those around him), some as large as the character himself, and others merely small-scale replicas. Since the story is based on characters and on ideas, rather than on action, it can seem slow if you are expecting more activity, but it's a story that has something to offer. Its outstanding technical accomplishments and historical importance may not be so obvious now, only because Welles's ideas and techniques have influenced so many later movies in one respect or another, making much that was imaginative then seem commonplace now. But it was quite an achievement all the same, and worthy of the attention it is still getting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>WHY?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm 27 years old. I first saw this film in first year film studies at Carleton University. It was required viewing for the course. I hated the film then. I thought that maybe because I've had five years to grow and mature that I would give this film another chance and watch it for the third time in my lifetime. Guess what? My opinion has changed. I hated it then and now I just dislike it quite a bit. And the question that I have is why? Why is this film the masterpiece that people say it is? Is it really because it revolutionized film back in the 40's? Okay, so it invented the wipe and it had lots of different styles of lighting. That may make it brilliant on a technical level, but come on people, you cannot tell me that this is not one of the most boring films ever made on the face of this planet or any other planet that has theaters to watch movies in. How can you get excited about a film that creeps along like a snail moving across a highway in the middle of nowhere? I really feel like Welles is taking all of you for suckers. Because I think he set out to make a boring film just to see if audiences would have an orgasm over it because of its technical brilliance. I still think he is laughing. I know I would be.There was really nothing to like in this film except for one thing. I can honestly admit that Welles' acting will stand up well today. He does play Kane with energy and he is believable. Almost all older films have cardboard actors that speak to fast, have little emotion, overact or are just plain bad actors. Kanes's second wife in the movie was so laughable that I eventually fast forwarded most of her lines in the film. She whined and cried and moaned and she was boring. You ever seen Aliens? Remember Newt, the little girl that Ripley takes care of, well that is Dorothy Corningmore's character as a little girl. What a joke.Citizen Kane has pulled the wool over everyone's eyes for six decades!!! Critics, well I can understand them liking this piece of garbage, they have to or they look like they are incompetent fools. That is their job. But the general public? Are you people on a really bad acid trip? I welcome any emails that would please try to explain to me the greatness in this film. Please, contact me. I really am dying to know. Why is this a tragic film? Why is this an American masterpiece? I am begging for some insight, because I haven't heard anything or read anything that says how great it is. All I have read is a bunch of people conforming to popular opinion that this is THE MOVIE to see.I can name about 500 films that I have seen in my life time that are better than this and some of them I probably don't even like that much. I would even go so far as to say that a really good Friday the 13th film is better than this joke of a film.Well, I guess diplomacy is not one of my strong points, but I really don't understand the beauty, importance, tragedy, wonder or any other compliment that has been bestowed on Citizen Kane. It just doesn't do it for me. You want to watch a great film that has everything that this film apparently has? Watch Jaws, JFK, Apocalypse Now, Aliens, Mississippi Burning. That is just a handfull of films that are what I consider to be the best films ever made. I don't think that this is on my list of worst films ever made anymore ( it used to be ), but it easily tops my list of most overhyped, ridiculous boring films to ever disgrace our screens.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Most Overrated Movie Of All Time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here goes! Citizen Kane regularly tops the list of American critics' best films of all time lists and runs in the top ten in European critic ratings, despite having been a huge commercial failure at the time of its original release. It is a serious, well-acted and groundbreaking film certainly, but to describe it as the best film ever made is ludicrous; in fact I would rate it the most overrated movie in the history of film. Because I don't like Welles? Not at all. Welles had one of the most original and creative careers in world cinema and Othello (1952) would probably rank in my own top ten list. So why my scepticism? One of the biggest problems I have with the film is that, like Apocalypse Now, it requires a certain political position in order to fully appreciate it. Pauline Kael, the doyenne of American film critics, is on record as saying that the film was an important cultural statement for left-wing Americans at the time, and that is certainly true. But a film which has that kind of appeal usually makes assumptions that are far from universally shared, and often ungenerous ones at that. Hearst was a bete-noir of the American left whose newspapers had decades earlier encouraged a jingoistic war in Cuba. Did that give Welles the right though to dissect his life without even knowing the man (he later met him once in a lift) and, in particular to characterise him as cold an ungiving at a personal level? (It is worth remembering, in this context, that when Hearst later fell on hard times his wife apparently so starved of love sold her jewels and remained with him). The film has too much the feel of a hatchet job. Someone could make a similar movie today about Rupert Murdoch and it might be well-acted and beautifully shot but you see the problem! Welles was only twenty-five when he made this movie and it shows. Certainly he had a right to an opinion and a right to state it, but life is a little more complex than you would know from this movie.Defenders of the movie often point to the originality and quality of its cinematography and the influence it has had on American cinema in particular. This is undoubtedly true. In the same way that Eliot, Joyce and Nabakov changed literature, Welles helped to change cinema. But Picasso was unquestionably the most influential figure on twentieth century art and yet his influence would not necessarily be universally accepted as benign.I am not suggesting that the influence of Citizen Kane was malign, but influence and quality are discrete concepts. As for the cinematography itself is it really as original as many American critics seem to think? What about early Eisenstein or, at the risk of being non-pc, the extraordinary cinematography several years earlier of Leni Riefenstahl's Triumph Of The Will? A serious film? Yes! An important film? Unquestionably! The greatest film ever made? Move over! It is simply too cold ever to be that.</fullReview>

The storyline is boring, everything about this movie makes me want to hurt myself. I do not comprehend this movie being anywhere near the top 100 movies of all time, of all the movies our class watched, this was hands down the worst. Nothing we watched ever came close, this movie makes you want to die. If you want to make someone fall asleep almost instantly, put this movie on and it's a guaranteed rem cycle. I wouldn't watch this movie again if I got paid. I had offered 50 dollars to any of my family members who wanted to see if they could watch the movie in length without sleeping, none of the 3 have succeeded. If anyone you know says "Hey Jack, come over and let us watch Citizen Kane" you should break any ties to that person immediately and reconsider who you let into your life. For entertainment value, this movie scores a flat zero. I would rather chew both of my arms off to the shoulder blade than watch this movie again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Citizen Kane. Here is a movie that has been almost universally acclaimed by every expert worth his salt as the greatest of all-time. The American Film Institute chose it. On the Sight and Sound Poll it was a near unanimous choice. Yet there is still a very large amount of people who have not seen this movie. It's not as mainstream of a Best Movie Ever as, say, The Godfather, but still this is inexcusable.The most likely reason for this is that Citizen Kane is a black-and-white film from 1941. This may turn off modern movie-goers but not me. Convinced that the Godfather was the greatest movie ever and wanting to see for myself if Citizen Kane was as good as people claimed, I rented it just yesterday, February 28. Let me just say the first word that comes to my mind.Wow. I'll say it again. Wow. Here is a movie that is over 60 years old, from the year America went into World War II. This film came out before Pearl Harbor, when Adolf Hitler was Fuehrer of Germany. Yet its direction is still unparalleled in the industry. The main reason for Citizen Kane's place in movie expert's hearts is for its insanely innovative technical prowess. It is almost impossible to explain just how revolutionary this direction is. Just about every movie since Citizen Kane has taken something from this movie. Yet it is still the golden light among movie direction. I was so stunned watching this film. Despite all the technical limitations of his time, despite the very simple methods of making movies that were prominent in the early 1900s, this film is so technically perfect that it is impossible for any reasonable man to deny its place among the very, very greatest movies ever. I just cannot explain in this space the perfection of this movie's direction. Orson Welles is an absolute genius when it comes to the cinema.And apparently, not only did Welles orchestrate the technically finest film ever made, he is also a superb actor! Watching this movie I was immensely impressed with Charles Foster Kane and the actor who immortalized him. The entire time I was thinking, who could this be? I concentrated during the credits and found out that Orson Welles himself played the star in his signature movie. This is honestly one of the best acting performances I've ever seen, and Kane is the most memorable character this side of Vito Corleone I've ever met in my experiences with the cinema.Charles Foster Kane was a world-famous newspaper tycoon, the most powerful media puppetmaster America had ever known. It is generally accepted that this character was based off of William Randolph Hurst, but that's beside the point. When he died in 1941 with his empire in shambles, he uttered one last word before falling. "Rosebud." One reporter is assigned to find out what this word meant. To do so he interviews the most central figures in Kane's life. It is through this story that the movie comes alive. Through this Welles displays all sorts of flashbacks, which are essentially the movie itself, of Kane's life. All of the important chapters in his saga are covered in an attempt to find out what Rosebud really means. In the process, we see a frighteningly deep display into a man who got everything he wanted in life and then subsequently lost it, his lust for material possessions to replace something else he had lost, his determination to have everything he desired what drove him through life. This all culminates in the ending which has to rank as the greatest and most thought-provoking I've ever seen. It is this ending that pieces together the puzzle of Kane's life and his struggle. It lays everything to rest, and at the end there is not one stone unturned. The ending makes everything make sense.The acting in Citizen Kane is not especially memorable aside from Welles, nor is the soundtrack, but give us a break, this is 1941. Aside from that Citizen Kane features some of the most memorable scenes and subplots ever told. Three that particularly stand out are Leland's review, Kane's attempt at politics, and the attempt at turning his second wife into an opera singer. I won't spoil the story any further than this.In conclusion, Citizen Kane is a movie that no intellectual human being should go their life without seeing. It is, simply put, a masterpiece, one of only two movies at this point I would give a 10 on IMDb. But is it the best movie of all-time? My opinions have changed in this matter. I now understand why all of the critics acclaim this above all else. In my heart I would still choose The Godfather, and as you can see I am giving Coppola's masterpiece a slightly higher rating, but in my mind these are the two greatest motion pictures ever created and nothing else can approach this pair of colossal giants. Perhaps it is because the Godfather features a wider cast of subplots and characters, rather than Citizen Kane focusing on one man, but in reality it is near impossible to point out any flaws in these two pieces of perfection. This is a movie that is both technically perfect and intellectually dazzling, a film that is both superb at face value and within our mind. It is a stirring piece of cinema that is and deserves to be more revered than any of its brethren. 9.7. There is nothing more to say, but, "I'm Charles Foster Kane! I am no politician who tries to save himself from the consequences of his own crimes!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Citizen Kane is the most overrated movie in cinema history, with the possible exception of Battleship Potempkin.CK is a movie about a millionaire, and Americans are fascinated by money, so it's really no surprise that they'd be fascinated by this film. However, make the lead character an encyclopedia salesman, without a fancy house or a newspaper and I think the fascination would quickly dissapear, as people start to see him and the film for what both really are: an utter bore.Kane is insipidly shallow, as the identity of "Rosebud" plainly shows. But, far from being an effective satire of expose of upper class society, the film is puddle deep. It also fails to get the audience interested in the paper-thin characters, or snoozer of a plot.You might be surprised that a film so mediocre would be rated so highly, until you took a look at what passes for Oscar material, or what gets voted to the top here. People have no taste or clue. So it's really no surprise at all.</fullReview>

At this point my love of movies was nurturing and had heard about the superlatives pointing in Citizen Kane's direction. I saw about 1 hour and turned it off.Last year, I became inquisitive again about Citizen Kane and resolutely watched it all the way through. I just about managed it.Movies are about entertainment. No amount of technical ingenuity can gloss over a weak script, dull supporting characters and, most of all, a lead character so bereft of appeal. Read positive reviews about Citizen Kane and you'll probably see whole paragraphs taken up with how technically superior it is.But this isn't what movies are about is it? Should non-critics really appreciate the techniques employed in this film and casually ignore what lack of entertainment they have witnessed?Citizen Kane is to film-makers what a video of a Batista operation is for heart surgeons - very informative, but are really not easy viewing for those outside the profession.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This may not be the greatest film ever made, or even the greatest one made in Hollywood (the latter nod goes to The Godfather, in my opinion). But 60 years after it was made, it still stands up throughout, from beginning to end, as a great film. Most of the films of that period have serious flaws that have become more apparent with age, parts where you have to make allowances for the time and the place and say, "well, despite the handicaps they were laboring under, they did pretty good." Citizen Kane asks for no quarter and gives none. It's as fresh today as it was when it was made. In the final analysis, it's not the much ballyhooed technical innovations like the ceilings and the depth of field shots that make it a stunning achievement, it's the story and the characters and the magnificent portrayal by Welles.</fullReview>

Knowing this, I watched this film for the first time with a probably unattainable standard than I do with other films. I wouldn't say I was disappointed with the film, I just expected too much. The story itself is interesting as we get a glimpse of Foster Kane's life piece by piece as he runs a newspaper that reaches people all over the country, Foster Kane was a man who seemingly had everything but eventually lost it all due mistakes and the envy held by his enemies. I enjoyed many other aspects of the film as well including the scene in which the newspaper men are seen in a photograph and then filmed in the same exact position, then stand up and walk away: I thought it was a neat effect. I also enjoyed the scene from Kane's childhood showing his home and the snowfall which has an impact later in the film. Overall, I though Citizen Kane was a good movie but in my eyes would not be considered as the greatest film of all time.</fullReview>

I read a little back story on this film because I think it makes movies inherently more interesting if they have history. The fact that it was based off of William Randolph Hearst and that Hearst tried very persistently to stop it from coming out made the movie much more fascinating. The striking cinematography was the most enjoyable part of the movie. The camera tricks and lighting techniques were new and unprecedented for that era. Orson Welles' style truly shined in this film. The fact that the entire movie was based on trying to figure out the meaning behind a dying man's last word was what really threw me off. It seemed unrealistic and I think there could have been better ways to tell the story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just don't give me Vertigo</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some thoughts on the recent vote by that collection of pretentious nobodies called Sight &amp; Sound critics. They've replaced Kane with Vertigo. Insane. While there may perhaps be about 5 films that are "better" than Citizen Kane, there must be at least 50 that are "better" than Vertigo, that farrago of zilch. One fairly interesting suggestion has been made that Kane is about Truth, where Vertigo is about Fantasy. For me, Truth is a million more times more interesting and much stranger than Fiction. Kane is a great, great film: creative, courageous, original, deep and gripping, mentally stimulating, superbly shot, written, acted. It tells you things about the world and yourself. It is youthful, vigorous and vital. Vertigo meanders along like superannuated sludge, baffling from beginning to end, telling you nothing. Incipient mental decay. Stewart is not too bad an actor; Bel Geddes is very good; and Novak is abysmal. All the actors in Kane are beyond excellent. But Charlie Kane is hard to take: the Truth hurts. Vertigo is merely soporific: a puzzle not worth solving.Kane is about America, and the American Nightmare. Barbarity to Decadence, via Hypocrisy, without Civilization. Vertigo is about San Francisco, and the Flimsiness of Tinseltown. Sidling into Eventide. However, it is arguable that the theme of both films is an attempt to recover or re-discover the past. Blade Runner is more brilliant than either of them. The memories of the replicants are simply faked.Here are a dozen films no better than Citizen Kane, but far, far "better" than Vertigo: Chinatown, The Seventh Seal, The Pianist, Un Flic, Breathless, Badlands, Once upon a Time in the West, in America, True Romance, The Hit, Hard Times, Sweet Smell of Success. I could easily think of forty more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Undoubtedly one of the best films of its time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On first viewing "Citizen Kane" may appear to lack a certain stunning quality which appears to be a requirement of movies in the modern era. However each time the movie is viewed a greater appreciation of director Orson Welles and cinematographer Greg Toland together with writer Manckiewitz make this film a winner on every level.Ever asked yourself the question: Why is there so much unhappiness in the world?. Look deeper and you will find the answer in this movie. Kane's life plays out as some kind of moral and political crusade. Why his obsession for collecting things and people? Why his rough handling and brutality to those closest to him?.. Rosebud provides the answer?Try thinking back to a time when you were young and a favorite toy or object brought you simple happiness...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best film ever?...Hard to argue against that accolade.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's perhaps pointless to eulogise too much more about a film widely and eternally regarded as the best ever made because it's hard to add anything original to what has already been said.What I would say is that although it's not really possible to quantify what makes anything "the best ever", this comes as close as it's possible to imagine. Particularly given the technical and cultural restrictions and modus operandi at the time it was made. Citizen Kane is a masterpiece of cinema in every way. A wonderful story told in a non-linear way (itself very unusual for it's time), yet the viewer never loses the plot or the power of the unfolding tale. Fantastic central and supporting performances and such majestic cinematography that it truly does deserve it's Everest like billing.Citizen Kane, while a product of its time is still absolutely genius filmmaking.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off, it was spoiled to me what "rosebud" was and meant so that part of the movie got ruined for me but I still appreciated it. I thought Orson Welles was a really good actor in it and I like how he produced and directed it as well, making it as much like his vision as he could. I liked how it showed the whole life span of his character's life. I'm not sure if the whole thing after his death was necessary, though. I think it would've been just as good if they had left that part out and only made a biographical movie. I also liked the ending for what it was. Overall I liked it and thought it was good. I wish more directors could do what he did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Arguably the greatest of American films, Orson Welles's 1941 masterpiece, made when he was only 26, still unfurls like a dream and carries the viewer along the mysterious currents of time and memory to reach a mature (if ambiguous) conclusion: people are the sum of their contradictions, and can't be known easily. Welles plays newspaper magnate Charles Foster Kane, taken from his mother as a boy and made the ward of a rich industrialist. The result is that every well-meaning or tyrannical or self-destructive move he makes for the rest of his life appears in some way to be a reaction to that deeply wounding event. Written by Welles and Herman J. Mankiewicz, and photographed by Gregg Toland, the film is the sum of Welles's awesome ambitions as an artist in Hollywood. He pushes the limits of then-available technology to create a true magic show, a visual and aural feast that almost seems to be rising up from a viewer's subconsciousness. As Kane, Welles even ushers in the influence of Bertolt Brecht on film acting. This is truly a one-of-a-kind work, and in many ways is still the most modern of modern films from the 20th century.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Orson Welles' magnificent cinematic masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Citizen Kane (1941)Number 1 - 1941Number 1 - 1940s Top 30 - All Time 'It's Terrific!'When facing the task of writing a review about 'Citizen Kane', you are burdened with the question: 'Is This The Greatest Film Of All Time?'Many will say yes before you finish asking the question, but In my opinion I do not think it is the number one film of all time, although it is comfortably cemented in the top 30.'Citizen Kane' is far ahead of its time. In a period where sentimentalism, over the top acting and romantic extravaganzas dominated Hollywood, here comes a 25 year old, first time filmmaker with a bold and admirable courage to be different.Orson Welles' first film was so good it could have been destructive. Ironically, 'Kane' was Welles' career peak and there was only one route to follow - downhill; and in fact Orson Welles' never reached the magnificence of 'Citizen Kane' again, rather like Charles Foster Kane in the film, his life spiralled towards destruction in a way like Welles' real life.Tackling corruption, the derivatives of power and the flaws of a democratic nation, 'Citizen Kane' had some resemblances with the life and career of newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst. This caused controversies in 1941. Hearst used his media power to crash Welles' project, he went as far as calling Welles a communist. Some cheered others booed the masterpiece. Thankfully the film survived and managed to launch its status among critics and fans around the world as one of the greatest films ever made if not number 1.The story of a young boy who is adopted by a rich banker and grows up becoming an obsessive newspaper tycoon, wanting to give honest news to the average person and nearly becoming President if it wasn't for an extramarital affair that governed all newspapers the next day.The opening shots of the film are magnificent, as the camera examines an old palace, the Xanadu, the residence of ageing and frail Charles Kane Foster. We see Kane lying there, hunching over and uttering his last word 'Rosebud'...The film is told in a series of flashbacks as a newspaper editor seeks to find the meaning of Kane's last utterance. Was it a woman he loved? An artefact he didn't buy? A meaningless word from an old fool? No, none of this; the origin of the word, which is only revealed in the last seconds of this triumphant film is that Rosebud was the name of Kane's sled when he was playing in the snow as a young boy, showing that was his only truly happy time, when he was poor and normal. As we see Kane's fortune being claimed and destroyed at the end and a man throws the sled in the fire, the camera closes-up to the sled and the word 'Rosebud' on it and then do we realise, grinning at the astonishing closure of this film.Orson Welles' achievement and contribution to 'Citizen Kane' is immeasurable. Not only did he play Kane from his fresh twenties to his dying hours, but he directed the film, produced it and co-wrote its screenplay. Another thing that deserved praise is the cinematography of the film - one of the greatest works ever on film.One of the greatest works ever in the world of cinema, if not the greatest and one of the most authentic, revitalising, bold attempts in the art of entertainment and storytelling.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film is an autobiographical work loosely based on the life and death of W.R. Hearst, although he was alive at the presentation of the film. Through a series of flashbacks, the film tells the story of Mr. Kane's life and loves. Both on his terms. We are left with the mystery of "Rosebud." Many clues turn to dead ends, but do we really find out what his last words meant? Watch and see. In other polls, this film ranks as the "Best film ever made." A sad commentary to the fact the Motion Picture Academy didn't vote it as "Best Picture." The fact that this picture didn't win for best picture denotes that politics in the film industry existed long before Michael Moore and "Brokeback Mountain." It was Hearst's campaigning that kept this film from winning the "Best Picture" award.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Classic????</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What makes a classic? "Citizen Kane" is considered a classic, because it was a black and white film. The film was also one of the first films made that had the fading effect. It was also considered a very high tec. for 1941. In the opening seen showed a locked gate and behind the gate was a big mansion. That whole seen was a model. Then the fading came into effect, there was so much that it became boring right off the bat. It would have been fine if they maybe had them fade faster or not so many of them. The cinematographer did a great job putting together a seen. Kane (Orsen Wells) was dancing with the dancers then the shot goes to a group of men talking about Kane (Wells) in the back ground there is a window in the window you can see Kane (Wells) still dancing away. The acting was a little dramatic. When ever the men were speaking they projected their voices so much and so loud that it was hard to hear what they were saying. Some times there was music playing when the men were talking all's you heard was blasting music. The music however was fitting to the time period, and the womens clothing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the greatest film I have ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What the. are you telling me that this is the best film ever made? Go ahead and call me dumb, but I think if you transmit `Citizen Kane' to outer space and declare this is the best film ever made in human history, there will be an alien invasion very soon. I do not intend to dismiss this film, for it deserves to be called a classic. It was made in 1941, and the fact that it hasn't aged much since proves its power. But is a film that revolutionized the way people make movies necessarily the greatest movie ever made? Yes, you may say. I am not going to argue with you, but my answer is a firm negative. `Citizen Kane' assembled almost all the advanced filmmaking techniques of its era and added a few more of its own. There is the shot where we see the objects through their reflections on a glass globe. Later, the camera travels through a signboard, pans down on a building's glass ceiling and then the people below. Transitions are also handled cleverly with the use of diffusions, which replace part of the current frame with part of the next. If you are not impressed by all these, that's just because there are fancier stuff in the cinema today, and you don't appreciate the fact that many of them actually originate from what we see here. The story is told in retrospective by the friends of our protagonist after his death. He is Charles Foster Kane (Orson Welles), a rich guy who has all the money he can spend but whose self-indulgence finally makes him lose all his fortunes, friends and wives (yes, it's plural). Does this sound familiar to you? Forgive me for my ignorance if `Citizen Kane' turns out to be the film that spawned this kind of crap in the first place, but I would have expected something more intelligent and less stereotypical in what has been hailed as the best of the best. Mean rich guys do not die alone in their villas, more often than not, they get all they want and have hot jungle sex with models every night. Fashionable techniques aside, I find little interest in this film, and I feel sorry for all those other great movies that frequent places #2-10 on critics' top ten list, for `Citizen Kane' looks pretty sad when compared with them.

		<fullReview>The film,"Citizen Kane"(1941)is considered the greatest movie ever made on the American Film Institute's list of the top 100 films of the twentieth century. I think this is a bit of an overstatement,but "Citizen Kane" is a fine,worth while drama that tells an interesting story. The film is based on the life of journalist,William Randolph Hearst. The beginning of the film starts out with news reels talking about the death of a 70 year-old,newspaper tycoon,Charles Foster Kane. Many reporters are wondering what "Rosebud",Kane's last word meant. One such reporter,Jerry Thompson,decides to find out what this means by interviewing people who knew him best and looking in records about his life. Thompson's interviewees include,Kane's second wife,singer Susan Alexander,his good friend,Jedidiah Leland,and Mr. Bernstein,a man who worked with him on his paper,the "Inquirer". Thompson also looks in the diaries of Walter Parks Thatcher,the man who adopted him from his parents to give him a better life in society. Thompson starts to realize that Kane,who seemed like he got everything he wanted in life,was not completely happy. We,as the audience,see Kane's life in a series of flashbacks. Except for the beginning,which drags,the film runs quite smoothly. All the actors fit their parts perfectly. Orson Welles does a fine job of directing the film and playing the part of Kane. He's a character you can love and hate. I do prefer Welles' performances in "The Stranger"(1946)as an escaped Nazi,who poses as a teacher and as the conniving Harry Lime in "The Third Man"(1949). He gives a more believable performance in these two roles. In my opinion,the supporting players give the film its' spark. Joseph Cotten does great justice to his role as Jedidah Leland,a man who probably knew Kane best. Agnes Moorehaed gives a small,but memorable performance as Kane's mother. Dorothy Comingore draws your attention every time she's in a scene and adds a little comic relief as Susan Alexander. The film in no way is a classic,but worth a look once in a while. I give it 7 1/2 out of the 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Upon being bombarded with descriptions of "greatest movie ever" and "if you plan on dying tomorrow, see this movie today," I was somewhat dissapointed with the ending. I expected something profound, what I got was something trite and cute. By cute, I mean it has a great outward appearance, but after that...Perhaps I've been hanging out with too many far-leftists, but the messages like, "the best things in life are free," and "you can't buy happiness" are so ordinary and commonsensical that you wonder why an entire movie would be based upon them. Maybe the modern or not so modern materialist would feel a euphoric epiphany and call this movie a great, but not I.Besides that, there were other aspects of this movie to make it atleast worthwhile, or even good. Though it did move rather slowly, the characters were usually entertaining and the dialogue interesting. Moreso, the camera work was extraordinary and revolutionary, for its time. So you're constantly saying, "This isn't great, but for its time..." I'm not sure if I'm glad I saw this. Seems to be I only saw it so that I could say I saw it. Perhaps viewing this movie as a relative great and historical curiosity would be a better perspective to take and make the experience more enjoyable.</fullReview>

It is incredible that Welles was able to do this when he was only 25 years old and it is incredible that this was his first attempt. But it isn't the greatest film of all time. It is impossible to truly believe that in 60 years of filmmaking nothing better has come around. I was very pleased to see that IMDB users have picked The Godfather as Number One.What I advise all of you to do is pull your heads out of your inner reigons and watch this film without the influence of all the film goers in their berets and black turtlenecks who only venture down to the film center to see black and white foreign films. The beauty of film is the ability to create something like Kane and still be able to turn out mindless entertaiment. All you people who only watch artistic statements, independant films and anything made before 1950, you have no right to review movies. An open mind is required to honestly review movies.

I feel that most of people were mindcontrolled by the fact that Citizen Kane was chosen by AFI as the greatest American film that has ever made, and have given this film such a high rate without judging by yourself. In my opinion, there are lots of film which are better than this one. I believe Citizen Kane is selected as the greatest American film not because of the quality of the film itself but because of its meaning for the history of American cinema. Orson Wells was the first director to be given the almost full contorl of the film production, and it means alot in the American film history, as well as the new technics he used in this film(eg,pan focus) I watched Citizen Kane and Howard Hawks' Bringing up Baby on the same day and honestly, I was more impressed by the later film. I'm not criticizing that Citizen Kane is such a bad film, but I doubt if this is the greatest American film ever made. It's more plausible for me to acknowledge that this is the one of the most important films that has ever created from the historical perspective of American cinema. For me, Orson Wells's masterpiece is "Touch of Evil".</fullReview>

Cinematography was great, but it really wasn't my scene. I understand how people can love it, but i really don't. I didn't really connect with the mood of the film, and the shadows. Sometimes I found it looked too overdone, and extreme, that it took away from the film. It somehow makes me feel like it is a film that instead of being art, is trying to be art. It is just too textbook, every scene and shot is in your face, this is how you should feel and there's no subtlety. The film doesn't let you react in your own way, but it guides you a little too far. The emotions are already created for you by the director. I enjoy taking more participation in a film I'm seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Citizen Kane - Technically Delightful But Terribly Dull</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can watch any film from any year. I like films. That means that I like films because they are entertaining, not just because they are to be applauded for their technical merits. It's A Wonderful Life is my favourite film, because I enjoy it the most. In the same way, I like The Adventures Of Robin Hood, Casablanca, The Night Of The Hunter, Kind Hearts and Coronets, Dead Of Night, White Heat, The Italian Job, The Godfather, Taxi Driver, Star Wars, The Big Chill, Pulp Fiction, Babe, Starship Troopers and The Truman Show because they are entertaining. Citizen Kane, however, is dull. It may have enough technical genius to fill a hundred books on the subject, but as a film that can hold my attention, it fails miserably.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Technique Good! Plot Bad!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Add me to the list of movie-lovers who dare to call "Citizen Kane" flawed. Enough has been said about Welles's innovations and his being a prodigy. I suppose all of that to be so.All that being so, how am I to appreciate fully the techniques when the story is so ordinary? I apologize to those who love this movie but the writers came from radio and, to judge from this work, should have headed directly to television. I suppose that I might criticize Welles as an actor but, given the caricature he was supposed to "realize," how great could his [or anyone's] performance in that role have been?Rather than ramble on, let me conclude my review with a summary of the above: if a movie has a prosaic plot and a caricature for its protagonist, all the cinematography in the world cannot make it great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Movie, But Not THE Greatest......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw Citizen Kane and thought it was an excellent movie. Not only was it good for 1941, the fact that Orson Welles wrote, directed, produced, and starred in it at the age of 25 was even more surprising. This is actually a very depressing movie, especially the Rosebud thing at the end. Another thing that makes this movie so true (well, besides the fact it was based on the life of a true human being, William Randolph Hurst) was that Charlie Kane was such a human character. He was someone who was very nice, intelligent, and caring, yet on the other hand, he was also selfish, rude, and a spoiled brat. The way that Welles is able to use the camera and lighting in this movie is excellent. Although this is a very good film, I just don't think that it's worthy of the title "The greatest American film of all time." But, I really shouldn't say that, because, um, I have to admit I can't think of a film that IS worthy of that title! I think everyone should see this film, and just enjoy a good story about good characters, and forget about special effects for once. If all movies had a story as good as this, the Hollywood industry would be a lot better. See this movie if you can!!!!-2001Rulz :-)</fullReview>

What really detracts from this movie is Orson Welles, the actor. Look on any list of a hundred best performances and his name is never on it. For a reason. His directing is magnificent, as is his writing, but his acting does not deserves accolades. Joseph Cotten, however, is nothing short of remarkable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I normally enjoy older movies, especially those from the 1940s, but after finishing Citizen Kane, I couldn't remotely understand why it is praised so much. It has to be without a doubt the most overrated movie I have ever seen. It seemed to me that it was well-filmed, maybe even exceptionally filmed for its time, but the story itself is just a drag. There's none of the drama, suspense, wit, mystery, or humor in Citizen Kane that made so many superior movies the classics that they are. It's just incredibly lacking in so many ways. The payoff is skillfully done, but it doesn't excuse the rest of the movie because there was never any reason to care about the protagonist. Kane is supposed to be some kind of tragic character but he's unsympathetic, he's neurotic, he's depressing,and worst of all he's dead. It's baffling that this is considered a great movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Citizen Kane</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is acclaimed by critics and film-makers everywhere as the greatest film ever made, topping many polls and lists, so naturally I had to see this essential classic from Oscar nominated director Orson Welles. Basically one of the richest and most powerful in America, if not the world, Charles Foster Kane (Oscar nominated Orson Welles) has died in his mansion Xanadu, uttering his last word "Rosebud" (number 17 on 100 Years, 100 Quotes). Reporter Jerry Thompson (William Alland) is trying to find out what Kane was referring to when he said this last word, so he goes to all the people who knew the multimillionaire newspaper tycoon. Through many flashbacks we see Kane marry the niece of the Presidential candidate, buy many big city newspapers and grow to assume power in many other business fields, to the point where he loses soul. In the end Thompson never finds out what Rosebud was and the reason Kane said before dying, but we see what it was when all his stuff is being burned, it turns out to be his prized childhood sled. Also starring The Third Man's Joseph Cotten as Jedediah Leland, Dorothy Comingore as Susan Alexander Kane, Agnes Moorehead as Kane's mother Mary, Ruth Warrick as Emily Monroe Norton Kane, Ray Collins as James W. Gettys, Erskine Sanford as Herbert Carter, Everett Sloane as Mr. Bernstein, Paul Stewart as Head Butler Raymond, George Coulouris as Walter Parks Thatcher, Fortunio Bonanova as Signor Matiste, Gus Schilling as Head Waiter John, Philip Van Zandt as Mr. Rawlston, Georgia Backus as Bertha Anderson and Harry Shannon as Kane's Father. I was impressed with Welles' acting and directing skills, the then experimental camera angles and movements that have become staples, and it is a story with some great moments to keep you hooked. So while I can't see fully why it is excellent and most recommended film, it is certainly one I would recommend, and it deserves to be in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before. It won the Oscar for Best Writing, Original Screenplay for Herman J. Mankiewicz and Welles, and it was nominated for Best Art Direction-Interior Decoration, Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing, Best Music for Bernard Herrmann, Best Sound and Best Picture. Orson Welles was number 16 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Men, and he was number 45 on The World's Greatest Actor, the film was number 19 on The 100 Greatest Films, and it was number 1 on 100 Years, 100 Movies (twice). Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better Than Its Reputation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Citizen Kane (1941) **** (out of 4) The rise and fall of newspaper tycoon Charles Foster Kane (Orson Welles) is told through the eyes of his second wife (Dorothy Comingore) and a friend (Joseph Cotten) as a reporter tries to find the meaning of his final word "rosebud". I think it's impossible for anyone to walk into this movie without knowing its reputation as being the greatest film ever made. Do I think it's the greatest? That's hard to say as it probably wouldn't get my vote but at the same time I wouldn't argue with anyone who called it the greatest. In fact, as I watched the film again I noticed that every single shot in the film is so grand and beautiful that I too might in fact call it the greatest. If not the greatest then perhaps the grandest film ever made as everything from the acting to the direction just stands out as something truly incredible. Everyone reading this will already know all the historic achievements this film reached in 1941 so there's no point in going over them. The visual style Welles brought to the film certainly makes it the greatest looking of any classic film. The editing from future director Robert Wise also stands out in its excellence From the visual viewpoint there are so many great moments but I'd have to say my favorite is the political rally, which just amazes my eyes no matter how many times I see it. Another great thing about this film, and one I don't think gets talked about enough, is the opening newsreel and how this was such a brilliant idea to get the viewer interested in what was to come. The newsreel was so well done that the viewer immediately gets drawn into the film and then we get to see that story filled in with the feature itself. The screenplay by Herman J. Mankiewicz and Welles is also one of the greatest ever written due to how it actually tells the story at hand. The amount of time the film covers is also a rather nice achievement by the duo screenwriters. Some people think that new viewers might be hurt by walking into this film knowing its large reputation but I'd somewhat disagree as I think the movie is so beautiful that it would be hard for people not to see its importance.</fullReview>

Even though Citizen Kane was based on an actual person who's name escapes me, it still could have been much more interesting. Even being one of the most revolutionary movies in Cinematography ever made, I don't see what the big hype over it is. It had the most boring storyline I've ever seen.

		<fullReview>This movie was not good. It had no explosions, no naked women and no car chases. It expected me to have patience and an IQ above 50. What's up with that? The characters in this movie weren't likable. I couldn't relate to them. They didn't cater to my adolescent, self-indulgent fantasies about being a super-human cyborg avenger who does ten different women a day. Can you believe that? Also, the plot didn't follow the video game paradigm. You know: good vs. evil, macho hero kicks butt and becomes master of the universe. In this movie, the story wasn't linear and one-dimensional. It started to make me think that the world might be more complex than the back of a cereal box. I hate that. Whenever someone tries to make me think about stuff, I usually just call him a butthead and punch him good. I didn't really feel anything watching this movie. I like to be jerked around emotionally like a Doberman getting milked by a dog breeder at a stud farm. If a movie doesn't force me to laugh or cry, it just reminds me that I can't feel anything about anything unless it's about a bunch of bogus sound and images that never existed in the first place. And speaking of laughing, this movie wasn't very funny either. There were no scenes of people having sex with inanimate objects or vomiting on domestic animals. And why wasn't this film in color? Was it trying to be artistic or something? I think Jay Hope was right; Welcome To Spring Break was a much better movie because of the big fat guy who screams, "Gators!" Okay, Orson Welles is a big fat guy, but all he says is "Rosebud." What kind of catch phrase is that? You may not agree with me on this, but you have to admire me. It takes special courage to announce to the world that you're a bottom feeding retard with the intellectual and emotion capacity of a lab bred spider monkey.</fullReview>

But the thing is that the story is just unbearably dull! The characters are too hammy and look like they are acting and fail to get the sympathy of the audience at any time. Kane is a jerk who has about as much self-understanding as a two year old kid. How can most people relate to him? If you are really into the history of film or cinematography, this movie is of immeasurable importance and it should be studied.

		<fullReview>The first time I saw Citizen Kane must have been a little more than a year ago. I, a devoted film lover, took it upon myself to see the "Greatest Film of All Time" just so I could really consider myself an expert. Of course, I didn't agree with the gazillions of critics and film buffs on the quality of the film after my first viewing. But, I was positive that I had missed something, and that I would have to see it again to appreciate its excellence. So first, I took a few months to catch up to classic film history. (I must have seen a third of the films on the AFI's 100 Greatest Films List since the program aired last spring.) And, I honestly appreciated most of the old films that I saw, e.g It's a Wonderful Life, Psycho, High Noon, and the modern masterpieces that are already some of my favorites, e.g. Pulp Fiction, Fargo, Forrest Gump, Schindler's List.So, after I felt I had learned something about classic cinema, I had a second viewing of Citizen Kane---and I had the same feeling about the film. Good writing, good camerawork, good expression of moods, but, the film has no juice. It takes us on this journey with Charles Kane. It manipulates us so we know some things about him, and then we don't, and we hate him, and then we like him, but the biggest problem is we don't understand him. We don't feel with him. How can a film's protaganist be someone who is not understood by the viewer? It just doesn't work. The protaganist in a movie should be someone who we feel with, laugh with, and cry with-as in Rocky. In the end, Citizen Kane tries to move us with the story of a boy who gets estranged from his family, a man whose dreams were crushed by fate, and in the much talked-about ending, a man whose childhood ended abruptly with his sled. Citizen Kane, although great in its own right, is not a masterpiece, and Orson Welles would have done a better job if he had portrayed Charles Foster Kane the way that Francis Ford Coppola portrayed Michael Corleone-a truly tragic figure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Citizen Kane laid, in 1941, the visual foundations of movies as we know them today, with groundbreaking shots, travellings and other matte paintings, as well as the flashback based non linear storytelling structure which has been used over and over since then, and this technical and innovative aspect is probably why this movie is considered by a lot of critics and institutions "the best of all time".Because if you think about the content, this is far from a masterpiece. The script is a long, disjointed and ultimately little interesting retrospective of Charles Kane life, where even the "Rosebud" plot turns out to be a letdown.If a remake, similar in every way, of Citizen Kane was made today, it would be considered average at best, which shows well that the historical context and the movie being some sort of pioneer influences the judgements a lot, at least more than the inherent quality of the film and its script in particular.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant....# 1 move of all times</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Citizen Kane is said to be the greatest film ever made. I haven't seen all of the films ever made in the world, therefore I couldn't make a decision but if the greatest film is out there and even slightly resembles Kane, it is nothing short of sheer brilliance. The intense Orson Welles, the mastermind of the film, was a perfectionist and it showed. He did not confine his film to the limits of the period it was made in and it helped to revolutionize the film industry with Kane. The lighting, editing and cinematography were all basically new to the world. Based on this, it shocked the film industry into being the greatest film ever created.Charles Foster Kane played by Welles himself rose from humble beginnings to become one of the most famous and powerful people in America. At a very young age, Kane's mother inherits a gold mine and becomes suddenly wealthy, sending away her son to live with Walter Parks Thatcher (George Coulouris), his mother's banker. Proving something of a disappointment for Mr. Thatcher, Kane shows little aspirations for success until the age of twenty-six, when he decides to head the 'Inquirer,' because he "thinks it would be fun to run a newspaper." Kane eventually becomes rich and powerful through publishing "yellow journalism" which, though frowned upon by most critics, proved immensely profitable.The most remarkable thing about 'Citizen Kane' is its narrative structure. The film opens with Kane's death. As the image fades into a large "NO TREPASSING" sign on the gate of Kane's "Xanadu" dwelling, we progressively cut to images closer and closer to his house, witnessing the vastness of Kane's wealth, and yet all his riches seem to be in disrepair. A lone lit window stands eerily amidst the snow, before the light inexplicably goes out, the figure hunched within suddenly plunged into darkness. We see Charles Foster Kane's withered hand clasping at a snow-globe, and his lips utter the mystifying words, "Rosebud." With a sudden crash, the snow-globe slips from Kane's hand and shatters on the floor. A maidservant enters the room and covers the dead man's body with a blanket. The remainder of the film is largely comprised of flashbacks.Despite the film's pessimistic outlook, it is studded by moments of joy, beauty and emotional truth. The supporting cast of characters, most of them regulars from Wells' Mercury Theater are also superb. Joseph Cotton is memorable as Jed Leland Kane's close friend who believes in him more then he does. And Everet Slone is wonderful as Kane's would be mentor Mr. Bernstien. There had never been a picture like "Citizen Kane." It openly satirized a wealthy and powerful living American, it deliberately antagonized Hollywood's ruling elite, and it bravely ignored conventional cinema technique? Innovative, aggressive, and fascinating, "Citizen Kane" electrified a complacent industry? Welles dominated Kane? He had become, in a single stroke, the most admired, envied, praised and detested man in Hollywood? Unhappily, the movie industry never learned to utilize Welles' quixotic genius, and his career never rescaled the heights it had reached in 1941.Other than the acting and story part, what does it take to make a great movie, yup the cinematography and the editing. I consider the best filmmakers to be great cinematographers first. And yes Citizen Kane has it all great great photography and slick editing techniques used that too in those days. So is Citizen Kane the best film ever created? I am not the world's biggest film buff, but I do know that it is incomparable to anything that I have ever seen before. It is truly original and that is what makes it so incredibly brilliant.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There is a reason this is a MUST SEE for all Cinephiles</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Orson Welles effectively employed writing, cinematography, mis en scene, directing, sound, editing, acting, and even ideology to bring us his masterpiece Citizen Kane.This script was written to provide an immediate "button" by which we're engaged to continue watching. The button is an old man dying, dropping a glass ball, and uttering the word "Rosebud". This soon becomes, what Hitchcock called, "The Mcguffin", an object, in this case 'information', that is pursued throughout the picture. The audience, like the reporter on the screen, becomes curious to find out who or what "rosebud" is. Another element of writing that was used effectively was the exposition of the newspaper tycoon's back story via a newsreel and at other times the newspaper headline. A great use of subtext was displayed in the wife's constant building of jigsaw puzzles. It was a metaphor for the life of Kane and the jigsaw builder was the reporter. Cinematography and mis en scene worked together to give the picture a timeless quality that allows for a film student to be taken back to the early 20th century and experience Kane's life in the first person. The smoke-filled rooms and silhouettes of the news guys make us feel like they are in the theater with us while conferring and asking their questions. Close ups and soft lighting allow us to feel comfortable with Kane as he falls in love with the "singer". The mis en scene of the Kane mansion was excellent (for that time). I had difficulty determining if the establishing shot of the large mansion was an actual house or just a painted set. The dramatic point of the movie when Kane was tearing apart Susan's (Dorothy Comingmore) bedroom was perfectly dressed and perfectly destroyed before our eyes. Other moments of mis en scene: Kane as a boy in the setting of pure white snow bespeaks his innocence. The crowded room of statues at the end had me looking closely to determine if any of the statues were genuine! Another noteworthy mention is Orson Welles makeup, however much he wore, was so realistic it was frightening. He looked as he did at his ACTUAL late age prior to his passing.Sound and editing worked well together to bolster the drama of many scenes in this film. From the scary, sad music establishing the Kane mansion and Kane's death to the screech of a cockatiel marking his wife's departure, sound was a consistent element of dramatic support. The continual audio overlaps like Kane's clapping for Susan's private performance to the public applause of his nomination, laughter that steals in as Susan attempts to perform her operetta, a scream from a party outside the room as Kane slaps her, and the shrill shriek of the cockatiel as she leaves Kane, all made for great exposition. Also, the deep resonating echoes in the Kane mansion tell us how open, cold, and lonely the house must have been.Editing was smart and, as the great editing genius Dmytrk taught, invisible. Economic use of quick cuts and swish pans during the Dinner table scene between Kane and Mary, transitions from Kane and Susan in her room, to Kane and his political friends at his nomination, and from this to his grand public acceptance speech allowed for much information and the passing of time to be delivered effectively and quietly.William Randolph Hearst, the famous newspaper tycoon, whom this film is purported to portray, was so insulted by its similarities to his life, he banned its mention in any of his many newspapers (sounds like something Kane would do). According to Dr. Jack K. Ringler, historian and professor of history at CCSN, Mr. Hearst was widely known to use his newspapers to stir up agitation from the American public towards the Spanish government just prior to the Spanish-American war. This, Hearst believed, made for good stories and GREAT circulation. The fact that Kane is found to harp on his editors and writers declaring, "We will go to war against Spain" clearly demonstrates Welles' ideology through his character Kane, whose life, at the very least, parallels Mr. Hearst's. The ideology of twisted news reporting that is bent to flow the way of the personal views of the media 'owners' (i.e. Ted Turner) clearly comes across throughout the movie. Kane's declaration, "I determine what the people need to hear" exemplifies the media's ability (and sometimes willingness) to editorialize instead of report fact.The directing of Citizen Kane was so tight that it is difficult to believe that it was accomplished by a 1st-time director, and by a director that acted the lead role at the same time! His choice to make an unorthodox choice of staging, acting, editing, and framing the dinner table scenes with his wife Mary (Agnes Moorhead), his movement and blocking of actors in the opera performance scenes, and his presentation of the Hearst/Kane dwelling were brave for 1941! His vision of the finished piece is the only explanation for the successful integration of so many film elements.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really old, Really boring, Really overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, I decided to finally watch this movie seeing as it is the AFI's #1 movie of all time, right from the get go I knew it was gonna be really boring and uninteresting. The movie opens with a really annoying voice screaming crap at you, and you can quickly tell this is the oldest movie ever, I got about 40 minutes into it and felt like shooting myself in the head just to end the misery that this movie was putting me through. I seriously doubt anyone actually thinks this movie is really good, just because something is innovative, doesn't mean it's not a piece of crap, kind of like the zeppelin. I saw Pluto Nash with Eddie Murphy which was really bad, yet not as bad as this steaming pile of boredom, I say in about 20 years when everyone that was actually around when this movie was made is gone, people will finally realize it sucks. I've never felt so disappointed in my life as I did when "rosebud" faded into blackness. I'd rather watch Torque. 0 out of 4 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exceeded my expectations, but still overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I picked up Citizen Kane from the library with a preconceived critical attitude. I had heard, from other young'ns (I'm currently 25), that Citizen Kane is an overrated film thats greatness depends entirely on the context within which it was originally made; it's a landmark in cinematography and film technique, but the plot is lousy and the movie is overall dull. Its fanbase is mostly crusty old people or young people who want to appear cultured to the aforementioned crusty old people. I wanted to see for myself: Does Citizen Kane stand the test of time?Having finally watched it, I was actually pleasantly surprised by the plot. It was not exactly gripping, and certainly not original by today's standards. But it was interesting to me and it does pose a number of questions for pondering.What would you do if you had all the money in the world? What exactly is it that you want in life? What do you want to achieve in life, and more importantly, why? Do you want the right things for the wrong reasons? Is who you claim to love more a reflection of yourself than the "loved" person? Are you going through life with a chip on your shoulder, with something to prove, that affects everything you do and every decision you make?Nevertheless, an okay plot and groundbreaking cinematography alone can't carry a movie. In general I felt the acting was average, occasionally bad. Likewise, the script had its memorable lines, but then again at times was downright corny, even campy. In general the characters feel distant and impersonal, like you're reading about them in the paper instead of watching them in a movie.When I think of a great film, films that are on my top-20 list, I think primarily of films that I would enjoy seeing over and over. I think of films that have scenes that I never tire of. I think of movies that draw you in, connect with you, and leave an impact. Frankly, Citizen Kane is not one of these films. I'm glad I finally saw it, but I won't be rushing to buy the DVD for my collection. It might, just maybe, make my top-50 list, but certainly not my top 20.I think that movie organizations such as AFI ought to have two seperate rankings. There are the "Greatest Movies," and THEN there should also be the "Most Significant Movies." Citizen Kane would be listed highly in this most-significant list. It would also be in the "Greatest" list, but not nearly as high. It's just not very entertaining.All in all, in IMDB, where I rate the overall "greatness" of a movie, I give it a 7 / 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Greatest Movies of All Time? Or Just a Lot of Stuff That Happened?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this for the second time in my life, with my oldest boy. Although we love stupid movies, there is also a soft spot in our hearts for well-crafted older movies as well...Was this movie well crafted? Yes, although not on an empirical level. Welles seemed to be producing this film on a gut level. He seemed to know which rules to break and when to break them. Indeed there wasn't a single likable character in the entire movie. Most of the women in the movie are better thrown back into the cast of Macbeth. I understand that the women are intentionally bad to illustrate what Kane experienced with the fairer sex after his mother gave him away. Brilliant casting of Agnes Moorehead in that role, by the way...Kane's two best friends are a gad-about and a sychophant. The only reason that you feel anything for these men is that Kane turns out to be such a dastard...I think, though, that basing a movie upon the psychology of a man was a very dangerous premise. Let's face it: Welles was a genius. Not only in his production of the film, but in his acting. His scene with his second wife where he begs her to stay with him is utterly amazing. He has an age in his face that makeup could not possibly have been responsible for.The movie world was growing up. This movie walks a line between older dramas and modern dramas. It is a dark and unhappy movie; however, in many cases that will be overshadowed by the sheer brilliance of the production as a whole.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even though I have studied this film numerous times and fully appreciate its artistry ? for which it deserves praise ? the basic pace of this film and its script leave me wondering if so many 'critics' place it as the best simply because it is the 'enlightened/snobbish' thing to do.Although it has a deep, sad story within it; the film, to be blunt, is boring. Each shot truly is a wonder of technical staging, special effect, and cinematography, but the film itself lacks life.The scenes are presented one at a time as different pieces in the puzzle of who Kane really was, but there are too many pieces and so little connectivity between them that they become a confusing blur from which little understanding is gleaned. The individual scenes themselves actually can be distracting from the overall film in that their rich qualities, lavish sets, and dramatic lighting often overshadow and overpower whatever information they contain. Even though the audience is supposed to be going through the same dilemma as the investigator, there are far too many lengthy subplots and red herrings. By the time the final scene is presented, the significance of what is seen is easily lost on an audience that has to think back across the entire movie to determine how it all fits together. So many with whom I have seen this film were asleep before that last scene.The film was so well hyped at its release - and has such a great story of Hearst trying to destroy it, that it is a kind of legend in film history. I simply fail to see how it is the 'greatest' film ever made. Technologically beautiful, yes. An overall great film, no.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A riches to riches tale, sadly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is rightly lauded for its technical work and for the incredible visual impact it delivers, but I'm afraid it is ultimately dull to sit through. Fortunately, the energy and inventiveness on screen are (just about) enough to sustain our interest in the face of the intrinsic yawn-fest that is the basic plot. The trouble is, it's a riches to riches tale, so, honestly, who really cares? As it happens, the wife's story has potential for a really strong narrative, but is not explored. The fact that Citizen Kane takes a fairly savage swipe at an individual still alive at the time also makes it a rather cynical effort. I daresay the intellectual establishment of the forties would have lapped up all the in- jokes and satire but that makes it a film for its time, not for all time. Film students by all means study the wonderful technique; anyone after a really good, involving story, look elsewhere.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know that this is supposed to be the greatest film of all-time, but I just don't see it. Was it an enjoyable film, mostly, but if I were to make a list of my favorite films I can't say that this one would even be a consideration. Therein lies much of the debate regarding what is considered the "best" films. On a technical level Citizen Kane sure does impress. The camera work progresses the story, the music is engaging and the editing is top notch. They all do an amazing job of elevating the story. The problem is that it felt like work watching the movie. Good movies should never have me looking at my watch wondering how much longer it has to go. I can appreciate the innovate nature that this film provided, but I don't sit in awe of a wooden wheel just because it was the first of its kind. That might be simplifying it a tad, but on my first viewing of Kane, it just didn't speak to me in the way other modern technical marvels do.Context is crucial when reviewing films of this nature and I just don't have enough of it to fully appreciate the necessary details. Most of the dialog was engaging, but overall I just wasn't that interested in the of Kane. The flashbacks were creative and engaged me enough that I felt invested, but most of the time I was just waiting for it to all end.I can't say that I disliked Kane, but like most films, my expectations were set so much higher than they really should have been for a film of this nature. Good film, not great. I liked it enough to not regret watching it, but it will be sometime before I choose to watch it again.</fullReview>

I'm thinking "Casablanca", "Out of the Past" or "Rebecca". That being said, the bland face and sombre voice of Orson Welles are always worth the small price of a movie ticket or rental. What I like most about "Citizen Kane" is that it takes us back to a time when newsprint mattered and the written word was a power to be reckoned with. The cruel incident of the opera review begun by a drunkard and finished by a madman is priceless. It's a story within the story, one of the many pieces of the puzzle that is Rosebud.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I did something I never do....I watched this movie twice, in the same day! Roger Eberts commentary is excellent, he points out things that I thought I noticed, but wasn't sure what I was seeing, and much, much more.The film is really timeless in it's plot and story development. Essentially the story is that we all tend to love ourselves too much, and presented with too much money we demonstrate this fact abundantly, and to the excess of exactly how much money we have. People obsesses about the parallels with Hearst. This film is NOT about Hearst! It's about you! It's about me! Stop trying to analyze pictures from the outside looking in. These films are intended to move you....let them.The technical aspects of this movie are really quite astounding as well! To this day there isn't many films that can even come close to it's photographic wizardry. The depth of field in every shot allowing the viewer to look all over the screen (like a digital picture), and using backlight and forelighting to move the viewers eye from one area of the screen to another is nothing short of brilliant! The visual juxtaposition is....I'm sorry, it's good. Let's just leave it at that! Watch it on DVD in HD, watch the commentaries to truly understand everything that's happening....if your not amazed at the accomplishment of this film from 1941....burn your TV!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Citizen Kane is a good example of man corrupted by his own lust for power and wealth!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie had powerful characters. Mr.Kane started out wanting to be honest and having what seemed to be good motives, but how does it go- absolute power corrupts absolutely?! Anyway, life is full of choices and along the way he made some wrong choices which led to more and more wrong choices. As in real life if we make wrong choices but recognize that we have and repent of them and learn from them then we are not doomed to repeat the same failures. Kane became so absorbed with controlling those around him. I think this might have come from not being able to have control of his childhood. He lost the guidance and love of his parents at an early age and that he was traded in for the money was very hurtful. This definitely left a hole in his life and a feeling of a lack of affirmation. So as life started becoming more complicated he began to try to fill that hole and gain that affirmation in a very unhealthy manner. The "rosebud" phrase was very intriguing and mystifying. I wondered about that myself and read some IMDb comments. When you think about it his life went from the innocence of the "rosebud sled childhood" to a life of making it on his own and being his own man at a very early age. How much trauma is experienced from so many all over the world who lose their parents through whatever circumstance. All the things in the world can not replace the love of 2 parents that unconditionally love a child. This world would certainly be in better shape if everyone experienced that kind of love!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Good Movie, but not the Greatest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As we are now three years into the new millenium, the movie industry has become all nostaglic about films, and wanted to put polls of the greatest movies ever made. Due to this, the Orson Welles movie "Citzen Kane" has been rated highly in these charts. However does it really deserve the actual ratings it has been awarded?The plot is quite simple, and I must warn you that there is some spoilers involved in this review. The story of this movie is like so; A rich and influential man named Charles Foster Kane, is on his deathbed. He mutters his final words "Rosebud" before kicking the bucket. Since this man was extremely rich, powerful and famous, his last quote has perplexed and bamboolzed the public and journalists alike. Was Rosebud a girl he knew, an associate he worked with? What does it actually mean?Due to this, an investigative journalist wanted to find out the meaning behind the word. The associates and the girlfriends that have been interviewed give a vivid story of the rags to riches of Mr Kane. From the humble beginnings of Charles as an orphan, who was looked after and raised up by a couple of merchant bankers. His fame and influence grew further and further as he began to become a news editor of the Inquirer, with promises of providing honesty and truth in ever print. However, as his influence grew, so did his ruthlessness. By the time he became a media bigwig and delving his hands into poltics, he began to lose his friends and associates. His love life did not suceed much either, with two divorces in his lifetime.I will choose to stop here, so that you can know what the ending of the movie is like. The acting is quite good, especially the main star, Orson Welles. His portyal of Charles Foster Kane was a gem to watch, even when the character grows older and older. Also the camerawork was groundbreaking at the time, which seems to be commonplace in movies nowadays.However I did find some flaws about it. One flaw I found was this movie was a bit melodramatic. It seems that the actors were overacting and it did seem a bit annoying. Also I found that the movie was a bit too long and could have been edited a bit.In conclusion, this movie is a good movie, however I personally do not think it should have a big rating in the polls of the greatest films ever. To be honest, the only reason it is seen one of the greatest movies is due to the American influence, that this is one of the greatest movies, since it was American. If so, why is the Italian Job nor The Seventh Samurai are not voted as one the greatest movies ever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the beginning scene of this movie we see a multimillionaire tycoon by the name of Charles Foster Kane die alone in his extravagant mansion Xanadu. When Kane passes, we see him drop what appears to be a snow globe, and one word is spoken: Rosebud. Attempting to figure out what this Rosebud means that is spoken of, many reporters tack down family and friends of Kane. The close ones tell their stories and memories to the reporters in a flashback; however, nothing of this Rosebud is ever mentioned. Never is the riddle of his dying breath reveled. The story of Charles Kane in the middle of his castle estate is a man dying while examining a scene in the center of a snowball. As he drops it, the globe smashes and just one word is spoke: Rosebud. What follows is pieces of newspaper footage showing us how Kane revealed his future, and there is a huge, unexpected ending. One that will surely prove your theory of this Rosebud to be wrong.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good film, but not a great film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Citizen Kane" has been a famous movie for a long time now. This reviewer had no clue as to why before watching the film, and even now after having seen it with her own eyes this reviewer still does not know why it is so famous. Like every movie it has its impressive areas and it's "I just don't want to pay attention to this" areas. "Citizen Kane" is a film with little entertainment value. Entertainment is an important factor in holding an audience's attention. It did have some rather, dare I say it, boring parts. But there were a few scenes that made up for the lack of entertainment value throughout the film."I think it would be fun to run a newspaper." That quote was the best line in the whole film. It, itself, provided a great deal of laughter and entertainment for the watching audience. If there was one thing about "Citizen Kane" that should never be forgotten, it is definitely that line. In this film, there is a scene that takes place at the Inquirer. It is very busy and noisy. Kane (Orson Welles), Leland (Joseph Cotten), and the Inquirer's Editor-in-Chief (Erskine Sanford) are all trying to talk at the same exact time and it gets rather confusing. It is really very interesting. A viewer could go from a sleepy pose to a wide awake pose just from watching this scene. It certainly grabbed this reviewer's attention.The acting in "Citizen Kane" was actually very believable and realistic. It didn't seem like the actors/actresses had a movie camera stuck in their faces and were talking on cue. It seemed like you could be looking in through a window and just see everyday life being carried out. This reviewer was very impressed by the acting jobs. The actors/actresses were not half-bad, except for one. Susan Alexander Kane, Kane's second wife, was being pressured by her husband to be an opera singer. Well, she got bad reviews on her singing and I'm afraid that Dorothy Comingore, the actress who played her, would have to get bad reviews on her acting from this reviewer. She was overly-dramatic and just plain annoying. She was constantly screaming at her husband and this reviewer just wished the noise would stop! If Comingore's character was meant to come across as loud and obnoxious then she did a wonderful job portraying that! But if the character was meant to be anything else then maybe the casting director should have found another actress to play the part.Special Effects! When people these days think of special effects they think of things blowing up constantly or even things that you see in "The Matrix" trilogy, like time just stopping or people flying through the air. That is what special effects are in the year 2003. But back in the 1940's that wasn't. "Citizen Kane" was probably full of special effects, but since they aren't anything really noticeable or unusual for our time period, most of them probably wouldn't be noticed. This reviewer caught two types of special effects used in the movie, and actually one of them was probably over-used. Fading from scene to scene or from picture to picture was a brand new thing back then. These days it's used all the time and it's hardly even noticed, but when "Citizen Kane" was made fading was huge! That's probably why it was used so much throughout the film. It's like when you get something brand new and you use it over and over again until it's worn out. That's what this film did with fading. It used it so much it started to become over-used. Although, this reviewer will admit, it is pretty nifty, and "Citizen Kane" used it well. Another special effect this film used was pretty awesome. In some scenes when one character was meant to be the focus of the scene that character would be lit up so you could see them perfectly, and the other characters would be in the shadows, so the viewer wouldn't want to pay attention to them. This reviewer thought that was pretty cool.The costumes in this film were fitting to the time period. The men mostly wore suits and hats and the ladies mostly wore modest dresses. Unless, of course, they were a dancer, then they were wearing short dresses that drew lots of attention to the women wearing them.There was a great deal of music in this film. There was music in the background, music that you could hear playing on a radio in the scene, music being played by a band, and music being played on the piano. There was opera singing and just regular singing too. This reviewer loves music and seeing that much of it in one film is great!Overall, "Citizen Kane" is a good film. Not great, but good. This reviewer wouldn't say it was the number one all time best film ever, but then again, this reviewer's understanding of the film doesn't reach as far as others. If a viewer of my age was given the chance to buy this film, they most likely wouldn't jump at the opportunity. If a viewer of an older age who fully appreciates these types of films were offered that same chance they probably would. "Citizen Kane" was a film not to be easily forgotten.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Finally I get to see the most 'groundbreaking' film of all time, and I'm not sure if I'm so impressed. It may well have changed how films were made, and I can see a couple innovations that were intriguing. One was the much-discussed shot of the camera going past the hotel's sign, though the roof windows, to the table. Another is the really innovative camera angles. It seemed that the lower moments in Kane's life were captured in a low angle, which contradicts the feeling of the viewer being inferior when lower than the character. I must admit that my knowledge of what 'rosebud' was ruined the mystery somewhat, and I had that knowledge because of spoofs, of all things. If I had not known, I would have been more captivated by the character's quest to find out the significance of 'rosebud'.</fullReview>

This is one movie that did not live up to the hype of being "the greatest film ever made" in my opinion. While I found the character of Charles Foster Kane extremely interesting, I did not find the movie overall to be great. For me a movie is great when it moves and entertains. Too me this movie did neither. A real test for me is also whether or not the film makes we want to see it again. Citizen Kane doesn't do that for me as it apparently does with so many others. Maybe I'm just missing something here. For it's character development and some humorous moments in the film (the opera teacher) I gave it an overall score of 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A GREAT film....but, THE best?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw CK for the first time last nite. I, too, was impressed by the story, camerawork, acting, etc. But, i don't think that i would say that it is "THE best film of all time".....ONE of the best, but how can ANYONE reduce it to ONE?"Gone With the Wind", as good as it was, is much too long; "Wonderful Life" is terribly depressing, and films like "Man Who Came to Dinner" are extremely overrated. But, out of all the films i've mentioned, CK is THE BEST!Without giving it away, what was meant by his last word, "Rosebud"? I know WHAT it (physically) is, but was the reason it was so important to him a reminder of simpler past, which he secretly longed for all his life? Or, am i mising something here?I'd appreciate it if anyone could enlighten me on this, as i'd like to make sure that my interpretation is correct.Thank you, Norm Vogel</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm no student of film and certainly not a qualified critic, but I try to judge every film on its own merits. This film is a multi-layered gem which is relevant in any time. It deals with questions of human nature. It makes you think. Timelessness, to me, makes any film great. If you can pull a film out of its temporal context, and it still tells a relevant story, then it is a great film. Citizen Kane does just that. Watch and enjoy a masterful piece of movie history, one that certainly does deserve mention in the company of the 'greats'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has been placed #1 in so many of the lists that I have seen that I was really eager to watch the movie. However the movie was a slight disappointment. I had hoped so much more from a #1 movie. I guess that may have been the problem. The movie was more unusual than amazing. The movie does hold you through to the end, but the end is not really that satisfying as you would like it. However I do believe that it was a movie that was years ahead of its times. Lots of cinematic techniques, shadows and angles are what make it really captivating. Go ahead and watch the movie but don't expect it blow you out with its story line. The characters are really dark, and actors have done an excellent job. You wouldn't believe it that it was Orson Welles' first movie both as an actor and director. And he was really young when he made the movie. Makeup and other technical aspects of the movie are amazing!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic, but not the best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How anyone could call this the best film of all time... just ludicrous. There can be no "best", but Citizen Kane is a fine film. Before I experienced it, I had heard all the praise and saw the 100 best films of all time. Then one night my film school showed us a brand new 35 mm print. I wasn't blown away... in fact I thought it was just ok, and wondered what all the fuss was about. But Citizen Kane is a film that grows on you... much like Kubrick's work. I find that the best films are ones that grow on you over time... they're almost like living organisms that demand your attention. I rented it again on DVD a couple years later and I slowly began to realize (with the help of maturity) what all the fuss was about. Not only does Citizen Kane use many film techniques that were FAR ahead of it's time, but it also managed to grow a beating heart under all the celluloid. It's a sad film, especially towards the end. The scene where Kane goes berserk and destroys the room is very unsettling... I can't imagine what it was like the to see it for the first time back when it came out. Incredibly, this film also manages to hide the fact that the story is sprung from a GIGANTIC plot hole... probably the biggest in cinema history. Kane's dying words, "Rosebud", are what set the wheels in motion, right? But Kane was the only person in the room, so how could anyone have known his last word? Sure, there may have been someone else there, but Welles never shows them... and in movies, if the camera or soundtrack doesn't reveal it... it don't exist. The characters are very 3 dimentional, almost TOO real... and it takes a few viewings to "get" all the subtleties this film has to offer. This film is loaded with subtlety and it's one of the best staged movies I've ever seen. Every camera angle, movement... the staging of the actors... it's all flawless. The acting is amazing. Welles' transformation into Kane, young and old (the makeup) is almost frightening, it's so real. What more can I say?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Articles have recently appeared in film magazines and newsletters about how many critics are lazy and unoriginal. Many movies have recently been revealed as completely invulnerable to criticism because they are very daring in subject matter or have been labeled as classics (Though I may be one of the first to apply this to Citizen Kane). The truth is, no one dared say anything about these films until now(--I salute every original critic out there who dares to go so far out on a limb just to share their ideas, inspiring many to think differently--).I never saw myself as a hypocrite, but I guess I once was when I would force myself to believe that Citizen Kane was far above any movie I had ever seen. I have seen many movies far more entertaining than this immortalized title. The easiest thing for me to say would be 'Citizen Kane; best movie ever' and I would be somewhat accepted into the society of two-faced film commentators. But I won't.Don't get me wrong. Citizen Kane is a delightful film. The story is original, the acting was good, and the directing was superb, especially for its time period where most movies were flatly staged. Maybe the epic-like storyline didn't stick, or I saw it just for the sake of seeing it, or I was tired, but it just wasn't as moving or emotionally shaking as a '#1 movie in the world, ever' should be. It seemed like any other studio movie I had ever seen. I just wasn't satisfied. My expectations must have been too high.I guess you should see it, just don't make the same mistake that I did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Greatest Movie Ever - Or One Of The Worst?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember when I was a kid and I really started to get interested in movies. Fifteen years ago I wanted to see as much film as I possibly could, and I still watch 1-4 movies a day. To watch a movie is for me to disconnect everything that's on your mind and walk into another world.My favorite film was The Good, The Bad &amp; The Ugly. (It still is top 5 for me.) Since I was so young, I had problems watching Black&amp;White movies. I didn't like dramas, thought they were boring. I asked my dad; "Which movie is the greatest ever?" He responded; "Citizen Kane is considered to be the best." We watched it the same evening. I think i fell asleep for a while. It was Black&amp;White, it was boring. It didn't seem to go anywhere. I never got the point of it. OK so it was a sled, big deal? Now fifteen years later I have grown a bit. I love Black&amp;White movies and have no problems watching dramas. Yet when I try to watch Citizen Kane I realize that it doesn't matter how much I have grown. I simply can not understand why people like it.I can not describe my feelings for this film, but I can try... I would rather watch paint drying on a wall than watch this movie. It makes me nauseous.My recommendation to you is to pass on this movie, unless you want to go to sleep or need to vomit. Watch "Pulp Fiction" or "One Flew over The Cuckoo's Nest" instead. You will thank me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this movie before reading any reviews for it, as I do with any movie I absolutely plan to see. To be honest I didn't see any way it could possibly live up to its extremely lofty billing as the greatest movie of all time. But with such widespread sentiment saying otherwise, I figured at the very least it wouldn't be awful. To say I was disappointed would be an understatement. Yes, I do have some appreciation for the films technical merits for its time and what have you, but those alone never carry a movie. Anyone who claims that the acting is superb must themselves work for the New York Inquirer. I mean the performances are so devoid of any real humanity, it's as if some human emotions were entirely taboo. I was never led to feel for any of the characters, as we never learn much about they're motivations or convictions. At times I was bored to tears. This is a prehistoric relic that does little to entertain, and while it certainly isn't the worst movie I've ever seen, I'd have a hard time recommending it to anybody but the most hardcore of movie watchers. My only advice for those who claim that this is even one of the greatest movies ever is quite simple, SEE MORE MOVIES!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Citizen Kane was way beyond its time. Watching it you get the sense that you are really viewing a film made in today's time but in black and white. In it's time, it was viewed as an outrageous film and even ignored by critics. Orsin Welles himself probably never imagined the film would become such a huge influence on today's cinematography.the way movies are made period. Even in the process of making it, he didn't think it would succeed at all.The stars out with a sign reading, `no trespassing' on a large iron gate outside of a castle looking estate, as the camera draws closer and closer to the castle a light is seen in a window. It burns out and a hand seen dropping a snow globe while a man utters `rosebud.' It turns out the gloomy scene was set inside the snow globe. Charles Foster Kane's who is played by Orsin Welles is narrated in a short film made by a couple of newspaper reporters. As funny as it seems, the movie starts out at the end and goes back in time, breaking out of the traditional film storyline. The newspaper reporters set out on a mission to out the hidden meaning of Rosebud, and in the process of researching this by interviewing key people in Kane's life. The story is told in many different perspectives of his life giving the viewer's brain a little work in the process. The film follows Kane's life from his start at the New York Inquirer to Kane running for governor to the building of Xanadu, which eventually leads to his own demise brought upon himself.Overall the film was absolutely amazing for its time. The excellent camera angles, lighting and special effects were way beyond its time. Citizen Kane is regarded as one of the most important movies in U.S history, basically setting the stage for Hollywood, as we know it today.Orsin Welles (Charles Foster Kane) gives a wonderful performance accompanied by Ruth Warrick as Emily Monroe Norton Kane, George Coulouris as Walter Thatcher, and Everett Sloane as Mr. Berstein. The acting was fantastic; the chemistry was good and their performances all complimented each other. I give the movie 7.5 stars out of 10 because it is not the best movie I have ever seen but it impressed me. It blew me away at the time and work and overall creativity put into this movie. Orsin Welles is a genius in my eyes for making this movie. He had no major influences, nothing to look off of or copy to make the movie the way he did. I definitely recommend this movie to anyone who truly enjoys and appreciates great cinematography, directing, and just a good film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The word should have been "Losebud". I don't see what was so great about the film, though I enjoy anything made in black and white. Everything seems so pressed, forced and overdone. I had to watch it as a mockumentary in order to justify my time. I can see where some film makers have gotten ideas from over the decades. Watch dear viewer for these little nuances. Kane reminds me of Dr. Frasier Crane's character in Frasier.Some interesting effects achieved, especially the scene when Susan Alexander Kane progressively rises to fame. The only thing that I would change is that all copies of the film should lose that stupid white bird that appears for a split-second as it adds confusion.The story itself is enlightening in that it is before modern day Solomons. People who are globalising and conquering via private enterprise. Kane is a bit like an American Hitler. When you control the media, you control people's minds; you control the world, frightening, when I think of it. Another symbol is what happens to Susan Alexander Kane as a man-made star of that time. These themes are all typical of the things we are facing in our world today.The overall lesson that I took from the film is to recognise the detachments of your youth and not live your life from the consequences of those detachments.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greatest movie in the whole wide world? Hardly. Definitely at the time of it's release but nowadays, after 62 years of movie making...well, matter of an opinion. One of the best ever made? Hard to say, depends completely on the individual viewer. Terrific and in every sense of the word perfect movie? YES! There's still nothing wrong with "Citizen Kane" and there's no reason to argue about all the abovementioned issues. I admit that when I first watched it as a kid everything went totally over my head but today I can only marvel how ingenious, fascinating and well-made classic this is. Orson Welles' performance as Kane is powerful and touching and right from the beginning seeing that exciting, dark sequence of him muttering the word "rosebud" sends shivers down my spine. I understand this can be a bit disappointing experience for people who really expect that watching "Citizen Kane" for the first time will be a revelation. If you haven't seen it, don't look at it as a miraculous masterpiece (it clearly is one but still) just look at it with an open mind and enjoy.</fullReview>

Quite a complicated film (or maybe just too dark) for many people, but for me it is just right for the drama presented. Brilliant, but (unfortunately) over-hyped to be the greatest film ever while being a great achievement despite. Only Oscar went to original screenplay (out of 9) for Wells and co-writer Herman J.

		<fullReview>Citizen Kane is consistently in lists of the best movies of all time. After watching it several times, it's clear that this ranking is no longer deserved. Sure, Orson Welles was a great innovator, and, FOR THE ERA IT WAS MADE IN, Citizen Kane had groundbreaking cinematography. It is well-written, very well-acted. But the cinematography, which many reviewers here and elsewhere dwell on ad nauseum, looks contrived and amateurish by today's standards. A good example is the often described slow descent of the camera into the nightclub. What makes other movies true classics (Seven Samurai, The Third Man, Casablanca, etc.) is some combination of excellence in script, acting, cinematography, music; but the key is that that amalgam of features withstands the test of time. It is as engaging now as when it was made. If you are a film student interested in the history of film, by all means study this film. If you are a film fan, the cult of admirers this film has will make you feel guilty for not liking this it and ranking it #1. It is worth seeing once, but that's about it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(spoilers) I've seen Citizen Kane several times now, and I still learn something new about it every time I see it. I've come to the conclusion that this film is so highly acclaimed because of the sheer brilliance of the direction, as well as the excellent acting. This isn't exactly an original idea, but when I say that, I mean that the story of the film itself was nothing particularly groundbreaking. It's about a newspaper mogul who basically runs himself and his newspaper into the ground because of his incredible stubbornness, but this story is unbelievably well presented. Citizen Kane is literally an encyclopedia of film technique, because every single shot in the film is completely packed with visual information that goes far beyond just pointing at the action to show what's happening. However, it's not the fact that Orson Welles utilized these techniques or the idea that he created or invented them, because nearly all of these techniques can be seen in films that came before Citizen Kane. The amazing thing here is that there are dozens and dozens of those techniques that can be found in various earlier films, but EVERYTHING is here, and there is so much going on and it is presented so carefully and with such a calculated result that its style dwarfs anything seen before or since.Citizen Kane is not a movie that is likely to thrill or keep an audience on the edge of their seats, especially a modern audience. It is definitely a drama, and it does move fairly slowly at many points, but it is such an amazing thing to watch if you know what to look for. The first time I saw it, I was bored out of my skull. But as I read and learned more and more about it, I realized what things symbolize in the film and I learned about angles and distance and character position and frame composition, which has made me come to realize more and more why it is considered to be the greatest American film ever made. Watch it more than once, because no one can see all that there is to see in Citizen Kane after just one viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Greatest Film Ever Made? Who Am I to Argue?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there was a ever a film that became a trail-blazer for every other great film of its kind, it is "Citizen Kane". Oh sure there were great films before "Citizen Kane" ("All Quiet on the Western Front", "It Happened One Night", "Gone With the Wind"), but none of those films, as great as they were, struck a nerve within the viewer like "Citizen Kane" does. Orson Welles (Oscar-nominated in acting and directing, Oscar-winning in writing) shows unmatched talent at the ripe old age of 26. A young reporter tries to discover what was meant by "Rosebud", Kane's last word on his deathbed, by interviewing those that were closest to him during his life. What follows are flashbacks into Kane's past. Kane's ambition leads to success, money, and basically anything he wants. He marries a beautiful young woman and they have a son almost immediately. However, as time passes Kane's ambition destroys his marriage. While Kane is making moves to get into high political offices, he is caught in a web of circumstance (being in a lady friend's apartment) and loses his wife and son. Then they are killed in a automobile accident. This knocks Kane down even further into an abyss of depression. He marries the young friend and tries to turn her into a star, now realizing that he is basically ruined politically. His newspaper still flourishes, but at what cost? As he gains material possessions, he loses all those closest to him and becomes a recluse at his elderly age. He rarely leaves his huge mansion, he ages terribly, and in the end not even Kane can escape the grips of death. Through it all, everything is explained about Kane with his final word "Rosebud" in the end. The film is dark, heartrending, and overall brilliant in every sense. Orson Welles was the catalyst, he drove everyone to the limits. Gregg Toland's cinematography is revolutionary, nothing like his camera-work had ever been done before. So many great films benefitted from "Citizen Kane". The list is almost endless. "Citizen Kane"'s timing was both a blessing and a curse for the film-makers. World War II probably kept the film from being as highly-acclaimed as it should have been in 1941. Oscar turned his eyes toward films like "How Green Was My Valley" and "Sergeant York" instead of the dark "Citizen Kane". However, the film's greatness puts it into a realm that Oscar will likely never be able to comprehend. It is one of the greatest achievements of the cinema and one of the greatest achievements of mankind. "Citizen Kane" is one of those things in this world that makes life great and worth living. 5 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, I can't stress how great a movie "Citizen Kane" is. I swear that it has no bad qualities. Telling the story of Charles Foster Kane (Orson Welles), a William Randolph Hearst-like magnate, the movie broke some taboos when it first came out, and was unfortunately a flop at the box office.Now to talk about other things. For starters, this was Agnes Moorehead's film debut. She is of course best known for playing Endora on "Bewitched". That means that Samantha Stephens and Charles Foster Kane have the same mother! Ironic, since the two have practically nothing in common (she has no bad qualities, he has no good qualities).And, does anyone remember that time when "The Simpsons" opened with a spoof of "Citizen Kane"? Mr. Burns was lying in bed remembering his teddy bear Bobo, the way that Kane was lying in bed breathing "Rosebud".Oh well. The point is that you just gotta see this movie. Very few movies have been this good. On a scale of one to ten, "Citizen Kane" is a twenty.</fullReview>

Really, the movie is extremely boring, I really couldn't care about the "secret of Rosebud" and the "revelation" at the end wasn't anything exciting either.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another dull film, built around a second rate artist. I wonder whether Kenneth Branagh built his Harry Potter, 'Gilderoy Lockheart' performance around Orson Welles in this movie. Arrogant, incompetent, hammy, self-fancying ... yes that's Welles. Lighting which would be embarassing in an 11-year olds' school play, dialogue which George Lucas would have found cheesy and a badly mixed musical soundtrack.If you care what happens after 30 minutes, you must be involved in the illegal drugs business, because no one else does.A dreary film from a pompous "actor".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Towering accomplishment from wunderkind Welles</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Citizen Kane, created by a twenty-six-year-old Orson Welles, is one of the most durable and praiseworthy films in the history of the medium. And quite rightfully so. With its incredible deep-focus photography, fractured narrative, fluid camerawork, and many other superlative aspects of filmmaking, Citizen Kane moved both the industry and the art form into previously uncharted territory. A colossal achievement, the film richly deserves its place among the most revered and respected works of cinema. In much of the critical writing on Kane, Welles often receives the lion's share of credit, but I cannot imagine the film without the contributions of Toland, Mankiewicz, Herrmann, Cotten, Sloane, and so on. Even after multiple viewings, it is easy to discover new, previously overlooked details that are completely astonishing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Claiming Citizen Kane to be one of the all time greatest just because it broke new frontiers and set new standards is like claiming the T-bird to be the greatest car in history for the same reasons. Like other people have pointed out, I too can't seem to find one single aspect of this film that other subsequent films haven't portrayed or dealt with in a better way. There is no doubt that this movie has a great historical and educational value, but to hold it as one of the best movies ever is, in my opinion, a plain insult to the art of film making. ps. what the heck is up with that 10-minute dancin scene in the middle? d.s.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Possibly the most overrated movie ever...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw Citizen Kane (CK) some years ago, but the sense of deep dissappointment still lingers on.Some points.1. The storyline in CK: Inching ahead, tiresome, drawn-out, and at some points directly boring. Other movies from this era (and other eras) are far better. When "Rosebud" is mentioned the umpteenth time, I lost all interest - simply too thin a plot for my likings. This doesn't have something to do with the age of the movie or that is it black/white, simply my opinion about the story.2. CK as a portrait of the archetypical "Great man, who ultimately fails".This is done a lot better elsewhere. Need I mention Michael Corleone in the Godfather series. Doughboy in "Boys in the Hood" also makes for a far better and more believable "Great man, who fails at the personal/relational level" as well. Of course, I realize that CK came before these movies, but that doesn't quite make up for all of it. I simply don't find CK believable or interesting as a character.Some of my disappointment possibly stems from all the "hype" CK has received thru the times, but not all of it. Usually I tend to like what serious critics acclaim as "great movies", but this time I found myself completely at odds with the moviewatcher "establishment".3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Citizen Kane is a film made in the 1960s often voted as the greatest film ever. Sadly, this is not the case and i'll tell you why. Citizen Kane stars Anthony Hopkins as the newspaper mogul who goes on a steady downwards spiral as the film progresses. However Marlon Brando, whom i find to be a great actor, does a poor job in directing this supposed 'epic'. First of all opting to direct it in black and white as well as devoiding the film of laughs. There is no comedy here and i like to at least laugh when i'm watching a film, who does'nt? I guess, long story short, i really advise against seeing this film unless your looking to be bored for an hour and a half (though it feels more like 8 hours! lol).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me start of by saying that I understand that this movie was important when it was released, and that it had great influence, and I respect it for that. I found it extremely dull though, I can't believe people claim this is the best movie ever made. It sure isn't. I would probably have fallen asleep if it had not been for the hope that it would come up with something of interest before ending. I might as well have fallen asleep though, cause not much happened. I watch a lot of movies, and I don't mind artsy or unsual ones, like El Topo, Breaking The Waves, Santa Sangre, Satyricon etc. Citizen Kane completly failed to interest me though, and even though it's far from the worst movie I have ever seen, I would not even dream of calling it the best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When many films from the 1960s now seem ridiculously dated, it's amazing how modern 'Citizen Kane' still feels after over 60 years. The scene composition, the lighting, the credits, the discontinuous narrative, the moral ambivalence of its 'hero', all seem to belong to a much more recent era. Even the themes - the power of the press, celebrity, ambition, etc. still all seem pertinent - and what is Xanadu if not Disneyland? Of course, some of the dialogue inevitably seems clumsy, and the final conclusion is slightly weak, but few if any films can have so expanded the cinematographic vocabulary of their time. Still much more than the greatest ever film about a man in love with a sledge!</fullReview>

But that is about all you can say, ya know? It's a LOT, but.....I can't imagine putting Casablanca, The Searchers, or the Third Man beneath this. Welles was NOT believable as a 66 year old lurching around his mansion wrecking 'Singer'-wifey's old room. I thought that scene was laughable. You could just see the make up lines etc on him, Cotton, 'Thacker'--it was great at times, but others-clearly dated and applied with a trowel.I don't think that the story of Hearst here actually did WRH justice. Having read a rather decent, thick bio on the man this past winter, I can tell ya, there was much more to him than just a cold distant mother, being spoiled, and buying up half of the European artworks available. He was a combo of Murdoch, Trump and Willie Wonka, if you think about it. Plus Marion Davies was Not a singer, but an actress who actually had a fairly decent star run in the 20's on screen. She did wind up a drunk etc but c'mon.....This film is done w/ tons of conviction, style, very impressive to look at. I'm not so impressed w/ the overall effect though--I didn't care that much about Kane, I didn't quite see what made him into such a 'Monster', as compared to, say, Harry Cohn, for example, nor am I sure that all of really adds up to much.I put this up there w/ other movies like Annie Hall, the Gold Rush and Vertigo. It's a very well made movie, it is more than worthy of having in your DVD collection and reading about; but it's also frankly guilty of being a Sacred Cow for critics and writers too. I don't see how this is all THAT great. Putting it over even something like 'Notorious' or 'the Third Man'--doesn't hold water for me.

		<fullReview>90% of the positive reviews written on this movie say the same three things: Citizen Kane is an amazing movie because (1) The cinematography was pure genius (2) It was way ahead of its time and (3) Orson Welles was only 25 when he created it.I get tired of people saying that a certain movie was "ahead of its time." Usually that means the movie isn't as good anymore. Truly great movies don't lose their luster over time. I would argue that "It's a Wonderful Life" is every bit as good today as it was 60 years ago. Citizen Kane, on the other hand, has certainly lost something. Even people who love the movie usually concede that point.Citizen Kane was certainly revolutionary and was an extremely important film in the sense that it inspired so many future directors and cinematographers. But when it comes right down to it, it's just not that interesting to watch. You shouldn't love a movie because of what it used to be. A truly great movie is timeless. And great cinematography does not make a great movie (see "The Thin Red Line", the 90s version).</fullReview>

Some of the fancy-pants types out there may relate to it, but not the common man. When a movie accomplishes the tasks of being great art and connecting with the average folk, then it shall be the greatest. In my mind, that is the Godfather. The Godfather is about a family. One with problems that all families face. It just happens that the family has their own family business. Citizen Kane is about a wealthy bachelor. How many wealthy bachelors do you know? This film has good acting, and a decent plot. But, it may bore those who it doesn't connect with on a personal level.My rating: 4 out of ten.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like Orson Welles as a person. He was warm, witty, intelligent, a great conversationalist. So, why do I have such an intense dislike for his entire body of work? I find his films nauseatingly morbid and draining. These very, very dark films make the darkest film noir look like a light comedy. My least favorite of his films is "Citizen Kane", a veritable compendium of everything that should be avoided in films: time spans that are too long, villainous heroes, insufferable pretentiousness and gross overreaching. This film unintentionally glorifies Hearst. He did not merit such a hatchet job. It honors him by implying there is complexity in the man. One gets the feeling that Welles secretly admired Hearst, and that behind the critique is a bit of envy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Citizen Kane is entertaining, contains good performances, is visually rich, and is technically ground-breaking. I have enjoyed watching it each of the three times I´ve seen it. That said, its over-rated. Its the critics darling, and is usually at the top of all the lists of greatest films ever. Usually the justification given for its high rating is that its ground-breaking. Jean-Luc Godard said that "we will always owe (Orson Welles) everything," and that may be true, but its not sufficient justification for its being considered the best movie ever made. Others have said that it is considered the greatest film because no one has offered another film worthy of top spot. Well, how about The Godfather, Lawrence of Arabia, Gandhi, The Seventh Seal, or even the overlooked masterpiece Ordinary People? Citizen Kane is a really, really good movie, and I highly recommend it, but it is certainly not the best film ever made. You should read what Ingmar Bergman says about Citizen Kane (do a search at rottentomatoes.com). Very interesting.</fullReview>

But that was Welles for you: ayycee deeceeing his way from moment to moment through some of the most brilliant and boring stuff a great film maker could conjure up, his soon to be likewise guy Fellini another. But I guess they couldn't help themselves. Only near the end, say the last thirty, thirty five minutes does the film start to revive itself, and become truly great again.One thing that the other reviewers have left out here: turn the sound off and you lose half the brilliance of this film. Kane has one of the great opening and closing themes by Bernard Herrman. Without that score it would lose much of its seductive power. So an absolute ten for the first thirty, thirty five minutes: four or five at best until the final thirty minutes, then back to ten again. Overall I have never been able to give Kane more than a six, tops. But make no mistake, when it is great, it is astonishing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I was growing up, I heard about various films that were considered "Classics". Citizen Kane was one of them. Eventually, I got round to watching it, and Orson Welles follow up, the Magnificent Ambersons on TV. Both of them I found tedious, and the products of an over inflated ego. Whereas his radio broadcast of The War Of The Worlds was an excellent piece of radio history, I do not believe that his "genius" was much in evidence behind the camera, rather, he should have stuck with the medium of sound, or to working for other directors, such as Carol Reed on The Third Man. As is the case with so many "classic" movies, Citizen Kane suffers from great expectations being thrust upon a mediocre picture, with the resultant effect that the film seems even worse than it actually is.</fullReview>

But it's not an amazing movie, and hardly has any reason to be considered the greatest movie of all time. Plus it's also a very BORING movie. I saw this movie because of all of its hype, expecting it to be magnificent....but I was disappointed and unimpressed. Perhaps all the techniques that Welles used in the making of this film (cinematography, lighting, editing) may have been revolutionary in 1941. But that alone is not enough reason to consider this film "great". The plot is simple to understand, but it's not remarkable--nothing about this story would make it superior to other films. As a matter of fact, "Gone With The Wind" was made two years before "Citizen Kane", and technically, it was a groundbreaking film. Certainly, "Gone With The Wind" is a much better film than "Citizen Kane", by a landslide.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>But ... the king HAS no clothes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whenever I read about what a great movie 'Citizen Kane' is I am reminded of the story of the king who wore invisible clothes. The king had this suit of clothes made which the tailor said "could only be seen by honest people" , in fact there were no clothes but the tailor relied on no one admitting that they could not see them. So as the king paraded by everyone commented on how lovely the king's new clothes were though they could see nothing. Finally, a child pointed to the king and said ..."But he has no clothes, he's naked!" ... and everyone understood that they were not dishonest people but that the king was a dunce.That's exactly how I feel about this movie. EVERYONE says this movie is the greatest thing since sliced bread and I think half of them simply don't want other's to think they are artistically challenged, a remaining fourth have been convinced that they do like it even though down at the bone they don't, and the rest really see something good in the film.I have tried repeatedly to find merit with this movie because everyone else says it's so good (so they must be right and I must be wrong) I have studied the reviews and looked for all the devices within the movie that supposedly make it so great ... but I have come to one conclusion .... the king is really naked.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Citizen Kane - A Flop?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Rosebud." Charles Kane's last words. The whole movie focuses on finding out why Kane's last word was "Rosebud." If you're into the flashback and mystery movie, it's for you. I disliked this movie because it is very hard to get into. I personally did not like this movie because I would get confused with who everyone was and when it was happening. One second he was a little boy and the next he was a grown man dealing with newspaper troubles. You learn all the mistakes he has made and how he grew up. He struggled with building his newspaper empire and keeping his affairs under wraps. The movie goes back through all of the most important events in Kane's life, like when he was adopted, building his newspaper empire and through his marriage. The movie was released in 1941. I didn't like the how the scenes and dialogue flowed. I also didn't like how the camera angles where and the actor choice. If you are into all the new advancements, like those, this movie is not for you. If you like the black and white, flashback, and boring movie, Citizen Kane is for you. I would rate the movie and 1 ? out of five stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All my life I've heard how great this film is. All my life I've heard that this is *the* masterpiece of cinema. Finally I get a chance to watch it. I hated every second of it. I found *NO* redeeming qualities to it whatsoever.From the opening "let's do painfully clumsy exposition in a really bad, really loud, really obnoxious faux newsreel" to the painfully obvious identity of Rosebud this film was a dog. The only thing that kept me from falling asleep while watching it was the annoyingly loud, nasal voice of (I think) Joseph Cotten. (It may have been Everett Sloane. I lost track through sheer ennui....)It's possible that I'm just "not connected" to the era or style of Citizen Kane, but I pretty much have to rule that out. I like many movies contemporary to Citizen Kane. (Casablanca and Key Largo leap to mind immediately.) I've also enjoyed several movies made by and/or starring Orson Welles. (Touch of Evil leaps to mind in a big way here.) I just found this movie annoying and irritating.This was probably the second-largest movie letdown of my entire life.</fullReview>

Of course, the technic is great, and inspired many and many great filmmakers... but it is so heavy and pretentious sometimes, as if the director of photography was telling you" hey, see how great my style is!" I should also add that camera angles and original lightning don't make a story, and in the case of "the best film ever made", it is plain boring... In a way "Citizen Kane" is like "the phantom menace".

		<shortDescription>It's gotta be a tough life when your best work is behind you at 25!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's no denying that 'Citizen Kane' is Orson Welles's greatest achievement as a filmmaker. Made when he was only 25 (it was released the same month he turned 26), he wrote, directed, and starred in it as newspaper magnate Charles Foster Kane, seemingly a man with everything one could ask for. Maybe everything but true happiness? Very early we see that Kane dies, and his last words were only a whisper, "Rosebud." But who, or what, was Rosebud? No one close to Kane had any idea. And, as the movie ends, only the viewing audience has a clue.It always amazes me when a person, or a group, puts any effort into the argument of "which film is the greatest of all time." The way I see it, there's nothing riding on it. There are no generally-accepted criteria. The "experts" will never agree. It is a battle which has no conclusion. So I don't worry if 'Citizen Kane' is the number one. Most significantly, it was a pioneer of a number of different movie-making approaches, and has influenced countless films which came after it. It is perhaps ironic that Welles was 25 when he made 'Citizen Kane' and, while he had roles in over 100 movies, directed 38, and wrote or produced a large number, he will forever be remembered for this one.I didn't have the opportunity to see 'Citizen Kane' in the theater, but I have seen it recently on DVD. While I appreciate the movie for what it is, I don't care too much for the political issues surrounding it in 1941. It is not the type of movie I will re-watch every year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For the record, I despise writing reviews for classic films, particularly the old ones. For one, it is impossible for me to write this in perspective to the the time it was released as my parents weren't even born yet, much less myself. Two, it's impossible to enjoy it to it's fullest because of the inherent aging of the techniques and effects used. With that taken into consideration, "Citizen Kane" being a film sixty-three years old, I was immensely impressed with the environmental and makeup effects. It's simple amazing that they were able to do what they did in that time period. I have seen recent low budget movies that don't even hold up to this, and that's sad. CK set a massive number of precedents when it was released; not only technical precedents, but precedents in the amount of control given directors in that time. Welles basically had full and complete control which was simply unheard of and it seems to have worked to his benefit. However, given the many precedents it set, the film didn't totally and completely impress me, and I have no doubt in my mind that it's a result of my growing up when I did and seeing the films I have seen. Many, many films have used the same techniques since, many that are more entertaining. While I found most of the story and screenplay extremely interesting, it drags it's feet in several places which was distracting. And although the acting performances were fairly impressive, I had serious problems with Dorothy Comingore's performance as Thomas' wife. She didn't convince me. Her performance was forced at times, and simply satisfactory at others. Welles was easily the standout in the acting department, I'll say.I will also be willing to admit that maybe my expectations were a tad higher than they should have been; me expecting to be blown away. I liked it, I really did, and I have nothing but respect for the precedents it set....especially in comparison to other films made in the same era. It just had problems with entertaining me at times. However, despite my problems with it, I feel "Citizen Kane" is a truly great film, just not one of my favorites. I think most of it's fame comes from it's technical brilliance as opposed to it's entertainment value. With that said, I'll give it 8/10, generously.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is about a man who has a vision to open a chain of florists called 'Rosebud' across America. However, his efforts are thwarted by another company, Interflora.Kane(Welles) decides to fight against the multi conglomerate and becomes a one man army. He isolates himself in his apartment and begins training himself for the inevitable bloodbath to follow.Meanwhile a young prostitute catches his eye and he promises to deliver her from her life under a seedy pimp. His descent into madness continues when he decides to eliminate a political candidate.The film wallows in the seedy side of the floral business and eventually erupts into a violent climax in a brothel.Kane is shot in the neck and collapses to the floor. A man without hope. A man robbed of his floral delivery service. A victim of a national conglomerate prepared to do anything to stop him. The common man once again contained.Lying in a pool of blood, Kane has a vision. A solitary rosebud, which haunts him in his final moments of consciousness." Rosebud...rosebud...we nearly made it...Damn you, Interflora...Rosebud... Rosebud." An average movie, drowning in it's own weighty legacy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hate this film. I really do. Its currently number #21 in the top #250. I remember when it use to be like #3 or #4.Its obvious that people born after the war have started watching it. I think we can thus all agree that the show is completely crap. I call it a show because it doesn't remind me of a film really. More of a show.The plot is based on a single word. Rosebud. Once you learn the meaning of "Rosebud" you spoil the film for yourself because the plot of the film is working out what a rosebud is. Its obviously not the bud of a rose; but it might be. Thats the question this thought provoking film raises to the intelligent viewer.Thats the intended magic of the film; is it or isn't it an actual rosebud. Or is it something else; say an important prop to the main character. Doesn't that sound like a fantastic idea for a film? NOT More like a bad idea for an episode of on a unpopular TV show. The academy had it right ignoring this film. Critics letting time be a positive judge on this film is a 65 year old mistake I am correcting in this review.If you have not seen this film consider yourself lucky. Don't watch it. Unless you want to see over-hyped and overpraised personified. Because thats what this junk is. Its crap really. To like it is to jump on a bandwagon and be stupid. I don't know who the first guy to praise it was but people been jumping on that band wagon ever since and it makes me sick. This film is awful junk.</fullReview>

If you're one of those types of people or you're looking for that type of review, then I would consider you stop reading now. This mini-review is just written from the perspective of someone who enjoys watching films.Sadly, the average cinema viewer is not going to enjoy or appreciate this film. By today's standards, it is over-rated. This goes for my standards too. Yes, the film has been produced very well, and the photography is excellent. It is even a sad film; the ending is particularly sad, even when we do learn the source of Kane's dying word...with the knowledge that no one will probably ever know. Rightfully so, this film was considered a great film. It's still a good film, albeit over-rated in my eyes.I would watch this film again, but I would not recommend this film to the average audience. I think they would find it slow-moving and unimportant by today's standards...especially when the film has been hyped up as much as it is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This WAS a great movie, and every film student should see it. But the audience today is more sophisticated and new technology nullifies the work that was put into it. For instance, getting depth of field by matting in the telephone in the foreground.. so what? This is like saying the IBM AT is a great computer (it had it's day, but by today's standards it's just not that good anymore - nobody continues to rave over it). The camera work that once created the dramatic tention is now blatant and sort of breaks the "third wall", becoming more distracting than dramatic.As for story, it could have been packed into 30 minutes and had the same punch. There's not much in terms of plot points going on here (shall we say 2: one in the first minute and one in the last? ..or do you want to consider finding "Joseph Cotton's character has aged over the years" as a plot point??). Sub plots? ..you'll fall asleep waiting for one. The theme of "a man working his way up to filthy rich/what he pays for it and what he holds meaningful in life" is worth about 30 minutes ..tops. The ride there is visually stunning, if you haven't seen a movie since 1941.A film student really needs to study this film because of the techniques and attention to "film making" - the ability to get exactly what you want: the "production value" (just like an engineerig student should know and understand basic addition and subtraction). But to the average audience today there is ABSOLUTELY NO ENTERTAINMENT VALUE in this "classic".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Citizen Kane has always been regarded as a great movie and even makes the IMDB's top 250 list. But friends, from the viewpoint of this twentysomething, Citizen Kane is a long, drawn-out, torturous film. Perhaps it's because I'm from a generation where 100 million USD budgets are commonplace for any "epic," but CK lacks what makes a good movie for me. The "new" editing and filming techniques Orson Welles used were fairly uninteresting, his story was mildly entertaining at best, and all the focus on "Rosebud" was simply ridiculous. The scene where Kane says Rosebud moves fast and is edited jaggedly, yet the whole film revolves on it for people. I find that curious.So beware of all the hoopla for Citizen Kane, I find it misplaced. It is a relic of the motion picture industry and should be stocked away accordingly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Citizen Kane is undoubtedly a masterpiece for it's time but age has caught up with it a bit. Nevertheless, it is definitely worth seeing and not just for the fact it's a classic, it remains a great movie even next to modern cinema.Wells would hold his own acting wise even today but sadly the rest of the cast wouldn't, and that's the first thing you'll notice. The script is also slightly overdone in the typical old-fashioned way, although it's still good, but the thing that really has stood the test of time is the directing, it's an extremely well photographed movie.There's some great scenes in Citizen Kane, but there's also some forgettable ones. The film loses some momentum in the second half although it still manages to hold your attention. The ending is goosepimple stuff.To be honest, I was slightly disappointed with Citizen Kane after hearing so many good things, although maybe I should have reminded myself this was made when FDR was still alive, a long time ago in the early days of film. When I think of it that way, I can't give it anything but praise.</fullReview>

Sure, it may have been a "pioneering" and "revolutionary" kind of movie in its day. But does that alone qualify it for the tag of "The Greatest"? I think not. The Wright Brothers invented the aeroplane. They were pioneers. They revolutionized transport. But a lot of others came along afterwards and did it much better. And so it is with movie-making. Citizen Kane and GWTW should be accepted for what they are - groundbreaking in their day, but twee and dated by modern standards.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While I admire what they had to go through to get this movie produced, only the stupidly intellectual could call this a great film. Ask yourself: do you really care to find out what happens to Kane? Do you ever identify with the character? Like him? Root for him? Or are you just all caught up in the amazing camera acrobatics? All those people who voted 10, have they ever actually WATCHED the film or are they just doing what their teachers told them to do? I have to wonder. Try watching it at 11pm and see if you're still awake by midnight.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie takes them all...!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*** Slight spoilers ahead, but already well-known ***Get ready for another review rating this movie on the extreme. This movie is quite simply... unbelievable.But not the way you might think; this review will be rating to the other extreme. Simply put, it's unfathomable that this movie cracks the Top 250. It's absolutely awful. The main reason it's awful is mainly because it's UNINTERESTING. It has nothing to do with "boring" or "slow moving" or anything like that. In fact, I thought the "movement" was fine. It's just plain uninteresting (and a little weird.)There is nothing in the movie that grabs you and makes you genuinely interested in Charles Foster Kane. Nothing. There's nothing to cause you to dislike him or to feel especially endeared to him (or to any of the other characters.) The famous, one-word death breath of "Rosebud" turns out to be nothing more than gimmicky, and 30-45 minutes after watching him saying it, hoping that somehow the movie would really develop something around that phrase, you finally decide you just don't care why he said "Rosebud."There exists not one redeeming factor about the movie that makes you care at all about the outcome which is one of the very reasons, I would suspect, that many movies are watched through in their entirety. And some of the scenes and scene transitions, aside from being uninteresting were actually a little weird.Needless to say, my wife and I (who have watched plenty of other "boring" B&amp;W movies and are quite tempered to doing so) couldn't bring ourselves to care enough to finish it. Again... Amazing that this movie cracks the Top 250 or receives the kind of reviews it does. It belongs in the BOTTOM 250 worst films ever made. It takes them all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have no idea how Ed Wood, or anyone else for that matter, gained any inspiration from this movie, unless it was inspiration to drink heavily and hope you forget what you just saw. The opening scenes are paced quickly, but contain nothing interesting, after that the rest of the movie is pointless and boring. If you can stay awake for the end, you must have a very high tolerance for pain. To think that people rate this as one of the greatest movies of all time is absurd. Try watching Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas if you want the greatest movie of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this was a very poor movie. It definitely isn't the worst movie that I've seen, but it's no where near a classic. I agree with most people that it was good for its time, but other than that it's awful. The acting is very poor and after the first 10 minutes I knew exactly where the movie was going and what was going to happen. The movie also is a very poor movie for entertainment. Yes, it was supposed to show people that you shouldn't be greedy and all of that, but that's no reason for the movie to be boring. "It's A Wonderful Life" was a movie that was made to show people something, but it was still entertaining. All in all I think that "Citizen Kane" is very overrated. By the way, yes I did actually watch the whole movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every film critic says this movie is sooo good. That is an absolute out-and-out LIE! The techniques and junk used in this film were revolutionary and garbage like that, but the movie itself SUCKED! The story line: dung from a dog, the acting; blech! Vomit-inducing! All-in-all, I want my two and a half hours back. You might as well poke yourself in the eyes and save yourself the "pleasure" of seeing this movie. Garbage, refuse, and trash! Since the feedback requires ten lines of information, more slamming is coming this horrible excretable mass's way. There is no redeeming value in this movie. The movie should be rated on the actual MOVIE, not the techniques used in shooting it. There is no way that this should even be on the shelves at BlockBuster, it should be behind the dumpster at McDonald's. In the words of Jay Sherman, "It stinks!" Are you happy now?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My comrades and I have been on a mission to watch most of the movies on the AFI top 100. Most haven't been outstanding but they have been worthwhile, so we were quite excited to watch Citizen Kane. However, it sucked. It is definitely in the top 5...for worst movies. It was not entertaining at all, so immediately I started looking for the things that supposedly brought it such great reviews, but there weren't any. Everything seemed average, at the most. Even though it was made in 1941, there were movies at that time that were quite a bit better: The Wizard of Oz, Casablanca, and a couple years later It's a Wonderful Life. I watched this movie with 6 other people and by the time it was done only two of us were conscious. The point of the movie is so stupid and it takes an incredible 2 hours...which seems like 80 hours...to get across. I gave it a 1 on a scale of 1 to 10 and that's only because I couldn't give it a 0. If you're trying to watch all the movies on the AFI list, you're going to have to watch this one, but brace yourself, you're in for it.</fullReview>

But this is not the pleasant, Quigley Down Under type of boring that peacefully puts you to restful sleep. Citizen Kane is like one of those dull, pounding headaches accompanied by dry heaves at 3 in the morning, please, Lord, let me leave this life, sort of miserable suffering. Half an hour into this movie, I was ready to reveal government secrets and abandon my family and religion - that is the kind of torture I am talking about. You know why so many people vote for this as the best movie of all time? Neither do they. They have been indoctrinated and tortured by film professors who force them to watch this movie until they capitulate and call it genius just so the *(&amp;^ing movie will STOP, for the love of God, stop!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Quite simply, the most over-rated film in history. I get the sinking suspicion that the reason this film regularly appears on the best films lists is because people think that's what they're supposed to say. It's like saying you enjoyed wasting the better part of your adult life suffering through Tolstoy's groaner, 'War and Peace.' Or worse, nodding appreciatively as you endure the ear-drum piercing agony of anything Philip Glass has composed. Because, your cool friends say it's a master-work of music. Egad, spare me. Look, you can appreciate the innovative camera work of young Mr. Wells. But, that does not mean you cannot admit this is perhaps the most painful film-watching experience of your life. If I hadn't fallen asleep the first three times I tried to make it through this tedious movie, I would have found myself, as I did when I finally made it through the film the fourth time, wishing I'd done something more enjoyable..like cleaned the grout in the shower.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How could the AFI put this in the top 100, let alone at number one! Oh, wait, all the AFI's top 100 movies are really awful, with the exception of Pulp Fiction, which is one of my favorite movies.I mean, I fell asleep in the first 20 minutes! Nothing happens, just a millionare who owns a few newspapers. The film details his life, which I was only recently notified that it was the life of William Hearst. Who wants to see that? It's a couple trillion matte paintings and a timeline spanning 100,000 years and yes, I am exaggerating quite a bit. Sorry, but it really seems like that! It's so boring!And just last week, I saw RKO281, which was about the making of it, and a supremely more entertaining film. I heard Orson Welles say "It's all about the art! People go to the movies to see themselves!" What? If I want to see myself, I look in the mirror. If I want to see someone else, then in my own imagination, pretend I'm that person, I go see a movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I chose to watch this film solely because it was in the IMDB top 4, and with only one or two exceptions most of the top 20 are brilliant.My first two attempts at watching it saw me fall asleep after about 20 minutes. The third time I made myself not move until the end, and it couldn't have come soon enough. It really is the most boring film I have ever seen.There is no major criticism of this film, purely because it must be one of the few that are about absolutley nothing. OK it concerned somebody's political and media career, but then so have a thousand other TV shows and films. Are they really subjects interesting enough to warrant making any film about, let alone one as popular as this?It lacks any action, suspense, humour or anything else a film needs. You can turn your brain off for two hours to watch this drivel as you won't need it. That is nothing to do with it being from the 1940's or in black and white. So were The Wizard of OZ, And Then There Were None and Casablanca and they are all brilliant.I couldn't think of anything worse than a film being made today about Robert Maxwell or Rupert Murdoch's life. It would be as painfully dull and boring as this.2 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It took me 3 tries, each attempt at least ten years apart, just to make it thru this one. Then the only reason I finished it was because I was in Mexico, and it was the only thing on TV in English! I'm convinced this is Wells' joke on Hollywood. No one could take this bunch of tripe, poor acting, lousy editing,and non-existent production values serious. I think Wells chuckled to himself every time someone lauded praise on this movie. As for myself, I'd rather watch paint dry, or given the choice again, something in Spanish!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ummmm...Citizen Kane may indeed be a mystery. I looked up top mysteries on this site and Kane was one of them. But I do not feel the solution to the "mystery" in question is very satisfying, nor does it make any sense with the rest of the picture. So, Kane turned into a terrible newspaper tyrant because he lost his precious sled when he was a child?? BIG DEAL. Obviously, all its innovations in the making of films are very nice, and film students should be required to watch. But the story is its weakness because it leads you to believe that there will be some great revelation about the meaning of Rosebud, and there's not. Look at The Usual Suspects for a film with a satisfying ending. Each film focuses on a question, Kane just never finds the right answer. It's not really a 1/10, but it angers me that critics call this film the greatest of all-time. Not even close folks, not even close.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What? Oh I see. The film was first with this...and...that. and oh don't forget about this...and that..blah blah. OK! Maybe so. But, well let me put it this way, the Flyer 1. Wright Bros. plane was first with a lot of things (for instance it actually flew) but compared with a Boeing 747 it is nothing. I think you agree.Just because the movie was first with its thing, for 65 years ago, does not mean it shall be celebrated as a master piece today (as we do not see Flyer 1 as a plane of our choice before the 747). Today it is not worth it's time (nor dime) unless you are interested in movie history.I do not say that old equals bad, for instance Bach, Beethoven and Mozart still are the best. Cervantes, Shakespeare and Dumas are still going strong. But they all were genius. Orson was not. He was skilled, as the Wright Bros. But built on their work even more skilled engineers and directors made something better and far more joy able. It is spelled development (As a Swede I must say that I'm not quite sure about English spelling at all, so honestly the last sentence is quite presumptuous)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Top 100 BORING Movies!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember listening to the critics once before...it was a movie called "In The Bedroom" it was a waste of time and money. Critics always seem to like boring shows and CK is no different. Yeah, it's "artsy" and yes the story has a lot going on. But, so did Momento. Momento was slow, but it kept me on the edge of my seat; not to mention that killer ending. If you are going to make a slow movie at least make it go somewheres, give me a good ending right?Rosebud...awww who cares? really now, he could have said anything and everyone one would have said "hey the critics liked it, it's artsy, we'll like it too". Remember the movie Crumb? that got rave reviews...and it sucked! I'm not a critic, i like to be entertained...this movie didn't entertain me.So CK is in the 100 best huh? I challenge you to sit through this show 10 times. Can't do it? Why I've sat through Braveheart at least 10 times...and i could do it again. BOTTOM LINE: CK didn't make my top 100, not even close!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is not even close to being the best movie of all time. The acting is mediocre, the visuals are outdated, and the plot is JUST PLAIN BORING!!! A rich recluse mutters "rosebud" right before he croaks and two very bland crusaders try to find out for some stupid reason why he died whispering something so ambiguous. Does this really sound like the plot to the greatest movie of all time? 1941 has come and gone, viewers. You can't keep arguing that Welles' moving of the camera makes this movie superb. If new cinematography techniques or technological breakthroughs constitute the world's greatest film, then Citizen Kane was dethroned long ago by Creature from the Black Lagoon and more recently by Terminator 2 and Jurassic Park. The other even more ridiculous defense of this movie's integrity is that Charles Foster Kane was the big-screen version of newspaper tycoon William Randolph Hearst. Couldn't the same reasoning be used to crown Primary Colors, which features a Bill Clinton-like character, the greatest movie of all time? Give it a rest. Stop declaring this "movie" a masterpiece simply because everybody else is hopping on the CK-lovers' bandwagon.</fullReview>

Evil Dead kicks this movie to hell.Citizen Kane needed more zombies and people with shotguns, when we buy a DVD we want action, we want to enjoy the movie, but instead we were just drowned in a silly BORING plot about Rosebud. You've got to admit, this is an awful movie to say the least, I shoudn't have wasted my money on such monstrosity. The characters were boring, the plot was boring, the setting was boring, the whole movie was just PLANE BORRRRINGGGGGGGG. I cannot visualize people actually liking this movie, honestly i can't. I never want to watch this movie again. I have wasted 10 minutes of my life sitting through a boring poopy smelly movie, I would rather spend my 10 minutes sniffing penguin poop.It needed Zombies, David Hasselhoff, Bruce Campbell, David Lo Pan, Shotguns and Agent Smith. THEN it would've been a better film. Good day.</fullReview>
