		<shortDescription>More "Where's Waldo" than Jason Bourne</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Actually reviews are not supposed to be based on wishful thinking.Nonetheless for those members who gave this a high rating more out of frustration than anything else, I do feel your pain.The original Bourne trilogy was not merely good, it was superb. As a top reviewer here with some 1200 reviews under my belt I said more than once that the original was the best spy trilogy I had ever seen and I am unashamed of the fact that I have seen each film in that series four or five times since original release. They are an adrenaline rush, the perfect mix of story, form, and effect.Even 2012's Bourne Legacy -- a feature where it was ever so clear that Damon had been offered a fortune just to walk-on and smile at the camera, but refused anyway -- was a solid movie, great script, held the attention, and Renner did a great job.However, now that I have seen Jason Bourne 2016, I cannot help but wish that Damon had agreed to participate in Legacy, rather than be lured back 4 years later for a part he clearly no longer likes, in a production he would rather not be in.I tend toward "purist" reviews, that is to say, I don't really care WHY a film was made as much as I do about how entertaining is it to watch ...? (That said, I have to "assume" that Damon broke his vow and came back simply for the cash. And Greengrass agreed to take hold of the camera one more time only if he could get a writing credit too. Ugh!)So, speaking of entertainment, there is almost none in this movie. The script is a mess. Written by the director for the clear purpose of showcasing his action and camera-work skills, there is no attempt to build connection from the top.The script is so bad that even viewers in love with the original trilogy -- like this one -- have to keep reminding themselves who Bourne is supposed to be, and what is supposed to motivate him.(Not to mention major plot holes here and there. Am I the only one who noticed that the most WANTED MAN IN America attempted to enter customs under his own name with no advance certainty that the computer would be "fixed" in time? Remember, from the second film in the series, this is a man who "never guesses and never makes mistakes." Other than accepting to do this film, that is.) A good film makes the viewer feel good. The scientists call it endorphin production. This 120 minute endless chase, from the top of the movie to the ending, merely produces a caffeine buzz and sets your nerves on edge. Yes, Greengrass can use this production in his own personal highlight reel to showcase his moving camera skills. But his writing skills? Not so much.Tommy Lee Jones delivers possibly the most superficial performance of his excellent career and the money he was offered cannot begin to make up for the indignity of the closeups.Newcomer Alicia Vikander acquits herself well. Then again, she is a newbie with a whole string of good movies ahead of her, career-wise, whereas the actors in this film seemed more interested in taking the money ... and running.Finally, dear reader, before you start to monkey-hammer the NOT USEFUL key -- which has somehow morphed into an I Don't AGREE key -- I will add that the variance between the score here and the score on Rotten Tomatos is the widest I have ever seen for a major release. Over at RT, this mess barely made 60%. Here at IMDb, the "fans" just can't seem to get enough...?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lacks intelligence of all previous</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lacklustre story line lacking intelligence, dialogue, and character development. I am a big fan of the franchise and my expectations may have been too high for this sequel. Was hoping for same kind of substance and kept waiting for something impressively unexpected, like previous. Legacy was a better film. Even fight scenes and car chases from all previous had a different "feel" than typical action films, but formula made these redundant and confusing, not fun like others. The predictable plot had me thinking, hoping for intelligent twist that did not happen. It's a good rental I suppose.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jason Bourne walks for 2 hours</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie made me want to leave after one hour, and kill myself after 2 hours. I am a huge Bourne fan I was very exited for Matt Damons return to the Bourne franchise. Also there was fresh face of Alicia Vikander and not so fresh face of Tommy Lee Jones and Vincent Cassel as the bad guy so what can go wrong? Well it turns out if you have a horrible script, plot that only a person who wears helmet indoors can consider exiting you are left with the biggest disappointment in the cinema this year.Spoiler alert everybody! Jason Bourne walks for 2 hours, sometimes he remembers things sometimes he doesn't - the end.So to conclude : Do not see this movie! I had to watch the trilogy the next morning just to get over the disappointment of the new Jason Bourne.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pathetic!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Any true fan of Jason Bourne knows Matt Damon said that the next Bourne after Ultimatum should be named The Bourne Redundancy. He was right! The story line is stupid and lazy. The directing is also lazy. The special effects are good. Bourne is no longer a meticulous planner, his actions are ridiculously reckless and would make you wonder WTH !!!!! The technology used by the CIA is fantasy technology imagined by the kind of people who don't know anything about technology or even science, you would probably laugh at the programming language used by the CIA in the first few minutes of the movie, and it only gets more ridiculous from there. This movie also serves as a advertising tool for some very wealthy and infamous businesses, and those scenes showing the business names are so painfully long and awkward. The story line also has to serve those special interests.Go see it and you'll know exactly what I'm talking about. In general, don't waste your time, other people's time, and money to see this piece of junk.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As an action movie, it's great. As a true Bourne-like thriller, not so much.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original Bourne trilogy of Identity, Supremacy and Ultimatum were brilliant displays in effective storytelling and great action. Jason Bourne, however, isn't quite as proficient in both of those areas. On the one hand, it's action-packed to the brim, and provides for a hugely entertaining watch, but on the other, it's a disappointment as far as bringing yet another intriguing and truly thrilling mystery to life is concerned.Let's start on the bright side, however, with the action. Paul Greengrass does yet another sterling job at directing some hugely exciting action sequences (including a thrilling chase in Athens that harks back to Ultimatum's Tangier chase), and in tandem with yet another excellent performance by Matt Damon as Jason Bourne himself, the action is definitely the best part of this film.Where the story lacks, Jason Bourne more often than not gives you some insane action to revel at. Sure, it's not the work of storytelling geniuses, but if you're the sort of person who can turn their brain off for two hours and watch wall-to-wall action and explosions, then this film will have you in dreamland. It's not a Michael Bay movie, and Greengrass' style lends a lot to making more vibrant action sequences, but there's no doubt that fans of big action will love this film.On the whole, I did enjoy this film, and I was able to recognise its flaws and just watch it as a big blockbuster. However, I can't escape feeling disappointed at the film's total failure to tell as intriguing a story as the first three films in the series.The enthralling mysteries and gradual revelations about Jason Bourne's past were what really separated this series from any other spy thriller. In this movie, however, everything felt a lot more generic, with a much bigger emphasis on action than clever storytelling and patient, gradual character and plot development. Unfortunately, it's that that makes Jason Bourne look pale in comparison to the original trilogy, and those who are expecting yet another engrossing and intelligent thriller will certainly be disappointed.That said, there are bright moments in the story too. It's not a horrifically dull film, and there are a few details that relate right the way back to The Bourne Identity. What's more is that Matt Damon, Alicia Vikander and Tommy Lee Jones all put in very strong performances to add a degree of gravitas to what is in truth a very clichéd and repetitive story, which was good to see.Overall, I am disappointed by Jason Bourne, in that it doesn't manage to tell such an enthralling and intelligent mystery as the series' original trilogy, but its top-quality action and strong directing and performances still allowed me to have a lot of fun for two hours.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as the "Bourne" trilogy but a good action movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Bourne franchise started with "The Bourne Identity" back in 2002, continued with "The Bourne Supremacy" in 2004 followed by "The Bourne Ultimatum" in 2007. I do not consider "The Bourne Legacy"(2012) part of this franchise because Matt Damon didn't take part in it and because it has much lower quality in script and filming. "The Bourne Identity"was one of the best action movies I had seen at the time and it really made an impression on me. The sequels were almost as good as the original, although they didn't have the same vibe. I will not go into details about this year's film since I don't want to spoil your fun. If you enjoyed the previous "Bourne" movies you will find "Jason Bourne" at least entertaining.About the 2016 movie "Jason Bourne", it is an American movie directed by Paul Greengrass(director of "The Bourne Supremacy" and "The Bourne Ultimatum")based on a script by Greengrass and Cristopher Rouse, it had a budget of $120.000.000 which definitely paid off in the movie quality. The movie has a solid cast(Matt Damon, Tommy Lee Jones, Alicia Vikander), good plot, not so good script, no cliché lines, great action/visual effects, it has common sense and it does not defy logic like most action movies do. "Jason Bourne" definitely lives up to the expectations. In this movie we have Jason Bourne knowing who he actually is, cured of amnesia, and battling an even larger enemy than before. There are car chases, well choreographed fight scenes,shootouts,explosions and everything else you would want from an action movie. Even though we are used to seeing Jason Bourne being chased by a government agency we still love it. Unfortunately, this movie has a weak script and plot holes, it is far from the quality of the "Bourne" trilogy. "Jason Bourne" still is one of the best movies released this year and I would confidently give it a 8.0/10. I have watched over 1200 movies and this one is for sure a good one. I advise you to go watch "Jason Bourne", you sure will enjoy it! This review may be altered by the fact that I am a "Bourne" fan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a shame, Just plain boring. (my review doesn't give any plot away)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How do you make Bourne boring? The original film is probably one of my favourite films. This one however, I just found myself rolling my eyes every few minutes especially during the first 30 minutes. After about 1.5 hours I had given up and was just waiting for it to finish.When are these film makers going to stop it with the totally unbelievable computer hacking rubbish? In one scene they execute a program by typing "run predictive algorithm". In another scene, they spot someone on a surveillance camera and the female character actually says "enhance". Come on! How cliché. What is this, the 1980's?? It isn't total and utter crap. It is as well made as the other Bourne films, except for that annoying, erratic fight scene camera work that seems to be in every action film at the moment, So you can't actually see what is going on. It has some OK action scenes but they do nothing to make it interesting. Nothing really happens. The plot is weak and the film is just plain boring. And I'm a fan of the trilogy! (Not the odd number 4 film which incidentally is better than this) Matt Damon is as good as he can be I suppose. Tommy Lee Jones, who I like as an actor, doesn't really bring anything to the film because his character is boring as well. I just can't help but feel they cashed in and made another one without really caring if it was any good or not as they knew everyone (me included) would go and watch it because all the others are so good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surgeon's warning: Don't watch this from the first row</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The last Borne entry is just OK. Summer entertainment movie, no more, no less. On the bad side: The script is pointless and tricky, Alicia Vikander sounds really like a bad actress and the fist fights are poorly staged. But the worst problem here is the direction: one gets really tired of that shaky camera. I watched the movie from the 5th row of the Multiplex (escaping form the pop'corn munchies) and 5 minutes into the movie I was feeling dizzy alright. I cannot imagine what could be the effect of watching it from the first or second row.Just two more objections: Can anyone tell me what car is Bourne driving in the final chase? I definitely want that brand, as it seems kind of unbreakable after all it goes through!! (even if it has a major drawback: air-bags don't seem to work at all). And the last one: Really??? Can a SWAT truck do that??? C'mon, guys!! You really stressed out my suspension of disbelief muscles with that!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a good dish of leftovers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jason Bourne wants so hard to believe in its own supremacy, forces an ultimatum of thrills and spills, but ultimately lacks identity. The original trilogy still stands out as one of the most intelligent post-Cold War spy action thrillers and it mostly succeeded in being the last word in the genre. Its huge success and relevance also gave the Bond franchise a big wake-up call. Amnesia-assassin Bourne is the real thang!So 9 years later, Paul Greengrass and Matt Damon decided it is opportune time to inject a dose of Bourne-adrenaline and his extreme ways into us. The only problem is that instead of innovation and reinvention, it serves up last night's fried rice paradise. One shouldn't mess with paradise! Greengrass regurgitates out plot points from the three predecessors. From Operation Threadstone to Operation Blackbriar, we get yet another black-ops organisation called Ironhand that wants to stay hidden and will whack anyone to Kingdom Come to prevent its knowledge from getting out. It once again exploits Bourne's amnesia as he glimpses yet another piece of his jigsaw mind-puzzle. We get the same old CIA foggies uttering "Where's Bourne?" and everyone wearing pained expressions as Bourne evades everyone in Athens, Berlin, London and Las Vegas. We get yet again a woman who thinks she know best but Alicia Vikander has none of the gravitas of Joan Allen because she is too young to be convincing. The screenplay does offer up an promising post-Snowden scenario but it still feels a little too familiar. These issues aside the movie is still a pulsating ride. The pace is relentless and Damon's taciturn Bourne still represents a driving force of reckoning. The spycraft and action set-pieces ooze uber-coolness and you will want to see it again just to catch how they did it. However I have one major complaint - I absolutely abhor the schizophrenic editing and jumpy hand-held shots. The camera never stays still for more than two seconds for you to marvel at the fight choreography and the vehicle mayhem-chases. In my book, hand-held shots coupled with split-second cuts are the cheapest type of cheat codes in action thrillers. With these type of cinematic trickery anybody can be a martial arts exponent and a world-class spy. No class. This is a good dish of leftovers. It may harken you back to the days of the original trilogy but it never truly pushes the character to a new frontier re-examining his psychological state. In the end, a dish of leftovers will still serve its purpose, especially when you are famished.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poor story and even worse directing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen the other reviews of Jason Bourne and I am starting to question my own judgement, maybe I am too biased to write a review for this title. But I can't help it as I absolutely hated the movie. And I hated it after I had low expectations for the latest title, since I heard Tony Gilroy wasn't involved in the script. The story is atrocious, I realize that it is supposed to set the basics for another 15 Bourne movies, but the story is so bad that they decided to overcompensate for it with prolonged action scenes, which are just terrible. It reeks of desperation to watch nothing happens for so long periods, just throwing dust in the eyes of the viewers with effects and low quality action. I realize that this goes beyond Ludlum books, but Greengrass is pretty much willing to do anything to fill the movie, other than to continue with the traditions of the original Bourne series known for Ludlum's excellent story-telling and spy- craft realism. The fight scenes, they're just terrible. Too fast camera shifting, even more than previous Bourne series, leaves you thinking that those actors are good for nothing amateurs who can't act a fight scene, so you need to make sure the viewer never really sees it.I loved the first 3 movies, even liked the Bourne legacy, and I adore the books. But this movie is so bad, that it shouldn't be even put anywhere near them. The acting is good, the story is bad and the directing is just painful. And btw, when you're doing realism spy thrillers, don't make hacking look like a freaking Pokemon hunt. It's just pathetic and unbelievable. Go watch Mr. Robot and think again how hard would be to present the "hacking" with at least proper interfaces instead of embarrassing yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Avoidable Garbage</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The biggest let down. I love the Bourne series including legacy which was without Matt Damon. This movie is poorly thought out and has a weak script which we all have seen and heard before. Camera work is what really put me off - show me perspective, not in your face cameras with flashing lights. The camera work is so poor at times that even the car chase on the Vegas strip with tanks and RVs is less exciting and a poorer construct than the slow little red car chase in Paris in Bourne Identity. Tommy Lee Jones looks like 95 years old and the woman trying to get his job looks like 25 !! How believable is that ? The only thing good was the movie moves quite quickly from city to city - sometimes without reason. Save your money and watch something else.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst of the Bourne series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a big fan of the Bourne trilogy and was really looking forward to this one. Disappointment would be an understatement. Bad story and bad direction along with a really shaky camera to make it worse. Not sure what Paul Greengrass was thinking when this movie was being made. I guess this movie was made with just one thing in mind i.e. make as much money as possible on the back of one of the most successful trilogies ever made. Matt Damon was no where close to the Bourne we are used to see. Tommy Lee Jones (one of my favourites by the way) did not really put in much into his role. Alicia was OK'ish but I felt like she could have done a lot better and she seemed too young for the role she was playing. For the lack of a zero, I am giving this a 1 rating.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A worthy successor to the Bourne universe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Matt Damon returns as Jason Bourne, This time he's well aware of who he is and he is determined to expose the government's secrets, As the intelligence agencies from Interpol to the CIA are in pursuit, Greengrass delivers a movie that is both intelligent and intense. Which sadly is what seems to be lacking in recent movies, But as we witnessed in his previous work, Greengrass only builds upon his work. Adding depth to the story and instead of investing his money on CGI, he focuses his lens on a more pressing issue, Which in this case is Bourne. What took me by surprise was Alicia Vikander. I am one of the few people that haven't seen "The Danish Girl", So her performance in this came as quite a pleasant surprise. If you enjoyed the previous installments of the Bourne series, Then you can take a breath of fresh air, As Greengrass does what he has done all too well before, As he brings out yet another successor to a growing series.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lack of intelligence in the intelligence community</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greengrass returns to the Bourne franchise and brings with him the same cameraman with Parkinsons that he has used all to often in the past. The shaky camera thing is so old that it ruins what is an already pretty average movie. As with all previous Bourne movies this one suffers from credibility gaps but even more so than in the past. Even the Jeremy Renner version was better than this effort. The biggest problem I have with this offering is that even though Bourne and Nicky Parsons are portrayed as sharp as tacks and well versed in all aspects of covert ops and computer surveillance, especially facial recognition capabilities, they still run around with faces uncovered and wonder why the bad guys keep catching up with them. They keep making rookie mistakes all through the move. The first half was agony to sit through. Unless you are an intellectual midget with no eye for detail I'd save my bucks and wait for the free to air TV showing if you must see it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>WHY is VOMIT CAM still a thing in 2016?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I want to watch spy thriller. I don't expect superb plot, just classic Bourne quality will suffice.Instead, I got served some boring, stomach churning, UN-WATCHABLE 3rd grade thrill rides......with pointless intentionally extra-grating violent chaos sound effect to top it off!Seriously? This is how people win awards and next big projects these days? The camera simply refuses to let you ignore its SICKED, EVIL PRESENCE - even during quiet restaurant latte-sipping white table cloth discussion scene! No, the camera cannot STAY STILL! The sound has to be cranked to 11 so that old grannies can hear cars and humans in the process of being DESTROYED!Apparently, someone reckons bad sound and bad cam work equals bad-ass! Because the camera guy is so ruined by 90's drugs and partying and golfing his hands are shaking from premature arthritis!Oh wait maybe Vomit Cam treatment is actually a necessity! If the cam stays steadily focused on scene subjects, we will notice how EMPTY the plot and character design is?You know, the insecure but loud types, how they refuse to speak properly, refuse to let you look them straight in the eye and make big pointless gestures to distract you from their vacuity?Oh it's not some little insecure guys doing this to us? It's actually some OVER-CONFIDENT OVERPAID BIG NAME director and his VIP cam guy buddy showing of their so freaking cool over-the-top latest hottest virtual reality style run-down-everything- in-your-path destruction joy rides? Their sons should introduce them to VR360 car racer games with 100X more smooth and steady cams? Who let the grit-craving flabby-brain aging cowboys out of the retiree golf clubs? Hollywood degenerating into pseudo-angry old man town stuck in (their still unresolved) teenage angst mode?Is this how they try to relate to young people? With their mental vomit and noise plus plus?I would just laugh this off if I didn't pay extra to watch Bourne in the premier theater! Plush sofas and HD sound system just made the whole dizzying ugly audio visual experience all the more vomit inducing and painful!Sheesh, Matt Damon, what have you done to your baby franchise? It's growing into a loud ugly monster and you don't care?I'm not even that fussy. I'd pay to watch anything entertaining, just for the ride. It doesn't matter if it's Zootopia or shallow mainstream aging cowboy spy thriller like James Bond. Bourne series a few notches of plot realism integrity above James Bond series.But now it is hijacked. a freak show of VIOLENT CAM MOVING THROUGH THE "BEST" MOST GRITTIEST DESTRUCTIONSSS!Maybe I'm just too soft, I don't understand the fun in that sort of mental ejaculation.Maybe spy thriller means random excuses to simulate speeding through explosive riots in European public square full of perishable human meat. Maybe there's a positive angle in psychotically jamming the latest product placement posh car into hotel lobbies and unsuspecting CBD pedestrians. Maybe it's cool to do ANYTHING it takes- including risking the lives of the commoners - all in the name of catching your personal villain.LOL Matt Damon. Project Greenlighting anything these days? Feeling broke?So heroic and worthy. It is important, I'd risk everything. I'd come out of my unnecessarily brutal and muscular and sweaty existence, back into the limelight of spy cams. Because? I WANT ANSWERS! I don't have to worry too much, the agency is obsessed with me, because I'm The Only One. Those spy chicks, they always risk their own lives for me, for really personal reasons. Because I'm hot, so muscled up for my age, I guess. Tom Cruise in Mission Impossible has more humor and humanity than the latest Matt Damon. I mean Bourne. Tom's hero actually laughs at the ridiculous one man anti-hero trope, actually team-play, actually tries to do good, actually mocks the (fantasy pretending to be realism spy) genre. Bourne? Now he tries not to run over too many dogs and pedestrians while he pulls his self-serving stunts.How noble of the new Bourne. Noble enough I guess, in the half blind half deaf perspective of aging cowboys co-producers.Matt Damon totally wasted his clout, esp when he charges a million a line. Surely he would notice how awful the production quality is, how pointless violence brings him down.But never mind, it's not Damon's job to save the franchise. This genre is a glut of cliché upon cliché? If Damon is retiring Bourne then I understand. The aim is achieved.Tommy was a yawn and the visual rep of post-addict post-arthritis aging cowboy directors with nothing but gritty bravado to offer. To watch it or not, depends fully on your tolerance for Vomit Cam. Not for pregnant women that's for sure. I wish I watched it at home, so I could frequently go to the fridge when the most exciting as in boring Vomit Cam sequence start.Warning: there are 3 of those too-long bore Vomit Cam sequences.Those undeterred, watch it for Matt's new born physique, Cassel's sharpness and the subtle lethal Vikander, the sole redeeming thing of this cowboy wasteland effort.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a great Bourne movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To me Bourne movies changed the face of a genre. After the Bourne movies James Bond couldn't remain the same and had to morph to meet the new standards. In this movie, I found that there was nothing new. Head of agency is again evil. Him and the asset that is going against Bourne are conveniently the ones who also killed his father. Female lead was not well developed. We are not sure what her motives are and where she is coming from. Chases and fights were stale and we have seen those in previous Bourne movies. Overall this will not be a movie that will live up the reputation of other Bourne movies. It feels like a movie that was made in haste to cash the reputation of this series.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For any fans of previous installments, do not see this movie. It ruins its own legacy with ridiculous and incoherent plot, bad acting, unnecessary characters and totally repetitive action sequences we all seen before. Especially acting in second-hand and I am surprised by wooden performances from usually great actors like Tommy Lee Jones. Matt looks fat, uninspired and totally lacks any energy which was so captivating in previous movies. Vincent should be most un-scary killer in the history of cinema. Alicia is utterly unbelievable as a CIA cyber-chief. Previous episodes, while stretching imagination a bit ( this is Hollywood at the end), at least tried to portray all action, reasoning behind it and technology as possible. Jason Bourne discards this completely and transforms it in Marvel-type action hero movie. Again, do not see it in theater, save some bucks and rent it for boring evening with fast-forward remote nearby.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love the Bourne trilogy, specially the Paul Greengrass ones, he has a very specific way to conduct both action and story in a engaging way. I skipped Legacy and when it was announced that Greengrass and Matt Damon would return, I was instantly thrilled.And by the most part, the movie works. Damon nails yet again, Bourne is now and old and not-so-calm character and his performance was fantastic. The action was really good, various well made and sharp sequences. My issue with this movie it's the story, not quite good as the previous one (that whole subplot was boring) but the formula of the franchise is more visible than ever.A MASSIVE SPOILER ALERT. FROM NOW ON I WILL SPOIL ALMOST EVERY MOVIE ASPECT.1 - Bourne contact is shot in the beginning: In Supremacy Marie got shot in head, in Ultimatum the journalist got shot in the head. In Jason Bourne Nicky gets shot obligating Bourne to return2 - - CIA evil boss: Every movie had an important CIA agent whose only agenda in terminating Bourne. In Identity we got Chris Cooper, In Supremacy we got Brain Cox, In Ultimatum we got David Strathaim (and Scott Glenn too) and now we got Tommy Lee Jones portraying Tommy Lee Jones.3 - Head of Bourne chase is not into killing Bourne: in the last two movie Pamela Landy while hunting Bourne was unveiling the truth behind his hunt and started to help him. Alicia Vikander character also does this, with a little Nicky element once she enters the action. 4 - The asset: this point is a improvement. The killers lives by Clive Owen, Karl Urban and Edgar Ramírez were under explored character and a waste of their actors talent. Vincent Cassel asset is more fleshed out, but it's the old vengeance cliché.5 - Encounter in a crowded place: In Supremacy Bourne meets Nicky in a German manifestation, In Ultimatum Bourne meets the journalist in a English station, now Bourne meet Nicky in a Greek riot. 6 - Flashbacks: in every movie Jason Bourne remembers more about his past. It's impressive how the writers are capable of coming up with new things, thankfully, the new flashbacks are pretty coherent but still it's just there to gets Bourne upset. 7? In this last topic I'll include expected moments, I basically watch the Bourne franchise because of them: - Hand-to-hand combat w/ objects (Greengrass shaky cam in these scenes is always a weak point, it's required to be over-focused to not get lost)- Big car chase in the end (getting 'better and bigger')- CIA trying to bulls**t Bourne, but he outsmart them (personal favorite)- And, of course, Extreme Ways at the end with a awesome Bourne move. Don't get me wrong, Jason Bourne is a terrific time at the theaters, entertaining as hell, probably a better summer blockbuster than anything playing right now. The issue is: it's getting repetitive. P.S.: English is not my native language, sorry about any mistake you may found.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not only a good sequel, but finally great action not dependent on CGI.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Matt Damon returns to the franchise that made him an action star, Jason Bourne follows the eponymous character on a revenge flick where he discovers something personal about his life that lead him to the man he is today. Let me get this out of the way first, I love the Bourne trilogy...it is literally perfection (especially The Bourne Supremacy) so my expectations were sky high. Many will be comparing this to other films, in which case you might be slightly disappointed with the story. But, if you view this as just an action film without even acknowledging the previous films, you will be in for a treat as this is absolutely entertaining. I'm glad Matt Damon is back and director Paul Greengrass, the directing style is very realistic and even though he uses 'shaky cam' it is done extremely well that it is not disorientating. The supporting cast of Alicia Vikander, Tommy Lee Jones and Vincent Cassel were great, playing very professional yet broken characters. The action though, is just flawless. In an age where action films rely heavily on CGI, it is refreshing to see real stunts and real car chases. Sure the main car chase sequence set in Las Vegas is no where near as good as Supremacy's Moscow chase (which in my opinion, is the best chase scene ever), it is still energetic, fast-paced and will keep you on the edge of your seat. The story feels very suited to today's news stories with hacking and cyber security, the only problem is with have seen it all before in Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation and Spectre. Overall, this is a solid sequel that expands the character's tainted history with great action, a good realistic story and plenty of suspense. Ignore the critics on this one and you will not be disappointed.- Review at: http://www.themoviediorama.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This. Is. Very. Boring. The plot is drab, starting with a woman in Iceland (blond who is a regular in this series but I forgot her name) hacking into the NSA or some other US intelligence agency. After this there is (no joke) a 25 minute scene which I can only describe as action porn, nothing else. The dialogue is repulsive, trying to sound impressive by saying things like "it's worse than Snowden" and Tommy Lee Jones telling people to stop things (he does that a lot). I should clarify, the plot is not repulsive because it is non existent. If you Googled "stupid action movie Matt Damon" you would probably get this because this is all that it is, a stupid, clichéd, snooze-fest with far too much shaky-cam. Do not watch this, it is just not good. Oh yeah, and Matt Damon hits people a lot and Alicia Vikander kindve just acts like a robot. This story lacks nuance or subtlety in any and all forms. The action is not particularly good either. Also the tech company sub-plot is somehow less interesting. The writing sounds as if it was done in a day (as in it is simplistic at best). Also, there is far too much coincidence in this movie. The editing is also disorganized and choppy at best, with an average of a cut every 1 to 2 seconds. I almost fell asleep in this film more than once because it simply is too boring. At all points in the movie I just thought "LET IT END ALREADY!".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>could have been great but was terrible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>first off I couldn't wait to see this movie,just love seasoned actors like Matt Damon and Tommy Lee,this movie had great potential the writing wasn't bad the story line kind of followed the original trilogy some of the actors acted a bit robotic, but the thing that really ruined for me and the people with me was the extremely bad camera men and the over use of extreme close ups and the shaking of the camera. 70 percent of the movie was not watchable you literally had to shut your eyes and just listen to it.in my opinion if you are a Bourne fan as I am and must see it, take some motion sickness pills with you and something for a headache you will need IT! the Director should be punched in the head and those drunk cameramen suffering from DT's should be shot! makes me wonder if the makers of this bad film bothered to view it before they released it? I am still a Matt Damon fan anyway.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Matt Damon is Bourne again...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After a long absence, and a rather forgettable fourth film, things get back on track with Matt Damon returning as the character these movies are *truly* about and who most people want to see (sorry, Renner). 'Identity' still remains my favourite of the entire franchise and I highly doubt it'll ever be surpassed. Unlike many, I wasn't as fussed on 'Supremacy', though both it and 'Ultimatum' were certainly better than 'Legacy'. While it's certainly good/a relief to have Damon back as Bourne, that doesn't automatically mean this film is 'great'. I'd say this one ranks somewhere in the middle. Matt Damon has always been likable in the role of Jason Bourne/David Webb. He's believably tough (his first 'fight' in this has him knock out a guy with one punch), selling the action scenes (he once again shows off Jason's proficiency for driving vehicles down lots of stairs), credible as this highly experienced/intelligent but tormented person, and I've always felt for the guy. I liked pretty much everything regarding the first film, the action, story, characters, relationships and especially the directing. A shame Doug Liman never returned as director of these films. I was really saddened/annoyed when the woman Jason had been through so much with and later formed a relationship with, Franka Potente's Marie, was unceremoniously disposed of in the film's first sequel. That made me like that film less. However, I was pleased that Julia Stiles' Nicky Parsons got more to do later on. As I'm sure people will have been spoiled for by now (seriously, don't read unless you WANT to be spoiled. Consider this fair warning), poor Nicky suffers a somewhat similar fate to Marie in this movie. I completely understand the outcry over this. I felt a similar way when Marie was only in a small part of 'Supremacy' at the beginning. It's a testament to Julia Stiles, that she's managed to take a character who hadn't much to do early on and made her so memorable/someone the audience formed an attachment with. Here she gets a 'badass' moment, looks out for Jason/helps him until the very end, and is part of the movie's first action scene, which is quite a memorable one. Like Marie, her demise in unexpected (well...unless you've read spoilers), a total gut-punch and a completely unfair way to go for such a likable character. Having said that, Jason was warned early in the series that everyone around him/associated with him would wind up dead, and Nicky's death cements this fact (as if Jason wasn't already aware after Marie). When so many films are tempted to bring popular characters back repeatedly/use them until they've outlived their welcome, there's something depressingly 'real' about this film's 'nobody's safe' statement. It's just a shame we lose the Jason/Nicky dynamic (and the chance for any answers to questions surrounding their history) in the process, as Damon and Stiles worked so well together.That's not to say that the new characters are a waste. Tommy Lee Jones is good, like Chris Cooper and Brian Cox were before him, though possibly doesn't have quite as interesting material to work with as they did. Oscar-winning actress Alicia Vikander plays a strong, intelligent, ambitious woman in CIA agent, Heather Lee. You think you know what sort of role she's fitting into (ie. taking over from Joan Allen's Pamela Landy), then later seems like an ally for Jason, buy she is in fact much *more* than that. She's crafty and can go toe-to-toe with those who are higher up than her, as well as Jason himself. I wouldn't mind seeing Heather Lee and her black plastic claw hair clip return if there's another movie. Vikander conveys SO much that's going on underneath with her character via looks/micro expressions and proves the film's biggest asset. Ironically, the character who's simply credited as 'Asset', played by go-to bad guy Vincent Cassel? Not so much. Sure, he looks dangerous, and there's some backstory given as to why he's so hell-bent on offing Jason, but for an assassin...he's rather sloppy/not very 'clean' about it. He's no Karl Urban, he's not even Clive Owen. He just simply shoots people all willy-nilly in public without any consequences. Like with Urban's character, I certainly wanted this guy dead by film's end, and his climactic fight with Jason is the movie's most memorable hand- to- hand action sequence. Speaking of, while the Paris chase in Marie's little red Mini Cooper coupled with the use of 'Ready Steady Go' on the soundtrack in The Bourne Identity remains my favourite, the car chase in this film does bring on the public destruction...and how! The amount of cars a SWAT vehicle plows through, flipping them into the air, is really something, as is the conclusion to the chase. Although, there doesn't feel like there's as many memorable action sequences as some of the previous films had, which may disappoint some people. The directing can get a bit too shaky at times (which it to be expected with Greengrass directing), but on the whole I was at least able to make out most things when they were focused upon, despite the constant zooming in/out. The film does feel relevant to today, with issues of privacy vs security, etc. While it may not seem as 'thrilling' as the first few films, nor as interesting, the movie's not a complete write-off. There's some intriguing stuff regarding Jason's father, though like with the other interesting elements, the movie doesn't seem to explore things enough. I quite liked the film's ending, and the use of the 'Extreme Ways' song once again was most welcome, but it's possibly time the franchise wrapped up. If this film's the last, then I'm cool with it.</fullReview>

If you like the way Blair witch was filmed you will love this movie. plot was weak I was looking forward to a great movie didn't happen If Matt had played in the 4th one and stopped there or either put more thought and effort into a better story with less hand held shots then it would be OK but not the case I bought all the all 4 on disc I wont be buying this one.to post a review you have to write 10 lines I ran out of stuff to say but I wanted to post this because I.ve been a Bourne fan up till now very disappointed</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just had to express my frustration/anger at this movie. It sucked so badly; this is made for brainless f-tards. I don't know why I had hopes for this, cause everything these days is just empty. Going from one mindless thing to another and one convenience after another; it's like macgyver convenienism. Everything is just flashy and filled with effects for the sheep; there's really nothing here. Also, technically speaking, half the stuff they do here, is so wrong that you have to be a total noob to go along with. They really missed an opportunity here. Jason Bourne, the story, got really a lot to go with, if you have a good writer behind it and it could really challenge James Bond, which is also going downhill these days.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The worst Bourne movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I re-watched the old ones before going to see this in the theater, and in my opinion, this is the worst Bourne movie. My 2 main problems with this one:1) The plot is stupid. The whole "hacker" part was probably written by somebody who's still using a typewriter. All the previous films had a computer room full of furiously typing agents too, but those were thankfully never the main focus. The focus used to be on Jason Bourne's ability to creatively solve seemingly hopeless situations. This film has it the wrong way around. It tries to be about computer hacking and data privacy, and does all of that wrong too.2) The cinematography is awful. Watching this on a big screen will give you motion sickness. You can never tell what's going on during most of the action scenes, because it's all shaky cam close-ups.Do yourself a favor, and watch the 3rd one again instead. The perfect end of the trilogy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While watching Jason Bourne, I glanced at my watch. Over an hour in, our hero had yet to do anything but broodily walk, until he finally did something (they thought was) cool: set off a bunch of fire alarms. Yep. This is how the almost-super-human spy agent uses his abilities in this latest installment. That lackluster thinking makes this film feel more like Greengrass and Damon's Green Zone than their Bourne films. Don't remember Green Zone? Exactly. Stultifying, sullen, and characterless, this should've been called Jason Boring. Much like the other amnesiatic spy's adventures, this film is basically just two worlds cut together: corrupt agents staring at computers and having charismaless conversations, and Bourne running around broodingly beating people up. Greengrass takes his refusal to keep the camera still to frustrating heights, as the camera is so close and incomprehensibly shaky, it's like what's happening in the combat and chase scenes is none of our business. Outside the terrible action, there's corny computer-hacking secondhand; a dizzying amount of location jumping; dispassionately convenient flashbacks; and a generic, drum-based action-thriller score Its biggest problem is it serves zero purpose within the Bourne franchise, or within movies at large, that we can get better of elsewhere. The other Bourne films and even the recent Captain America franchise have covered similar themes of governmental oversight and privacy to much stronger effect. What we're left with is a Jason Bourne who is now more angsty than he is awesome. So while some may be happy to revisit this series, I'm getting sick of watching Damon wear brown clothes and a one-shoulder-backpack walk around exotic cities with a sad look on his face.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The movie should be renamed "Boring Police Chatterboxes 5"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nothing cool about a movie that's supposed to be about a fierce assassin turned instead into a boring sit through on "the cops" talking about things. Or the CIA, whatever. Same thing at the end of the day. They're both just as lame to watch, really makes me dislike Tommy Lee Jones. If not for Batman Forever I would have written him off as one of the most annoying screen faces you can see. He did nothing but make the movie boring and miserable. I couldn't tell what the hell was going on because the camera was so awful and there was no story. Bourne is about him and a girl Marie on a life threatening chase as they try to recover his memory of who he is. What the hell is this movie supposed to be?I'm not a cop hater or CIA hater, BUT WE DON'T WANT THEM. We want the assassins, the ninjas, the barbarians, the sorcerors, that's what we want man. Gondorian Knights charging in Lord of the Rings, Jedi charging on Geonosis. A lone guy who can speak European languages on a bench taking out two armed officers in the first Bourne movie. That's Jason Bourne. He's one of the cool people. He's not some CIA geek who jabbers nonstop about "how dare you blablabla that violates blalalball the constitution says blablabla we're in a crisis blablabla" like jeez just throw a kick or shoot a bullet already. It's not that hard. Dweeby directors in the 50s could do better. The movie is nonstop boring things.And what's with the iPhone in his hand? Is Jason that pathetic that he would use an iPhone? He's supposed to be DIFFERENT and SLICK. The idiot walks with it out like he's a kid with his diapers off &amp; his private part out. Jason is a flipphone kind of guy. FLIP PHONE. HE'S SUPPOSED TO BE COOL. And why is he shown so much to be in fight clubs? Wth? When did he ever take an interest in fight clubs in the first 3 movies? So random and evident that these were kids behind the movie.And WHY, OH WHY, WAS THERE A "APP DEVELOPER" IN THE MOVIE. That Indian fellow who made some thing or social media program. Why is he in it? Does that really seem like Jason Bourne material?And why is the movie called Jason Bourne when he's hardly even in it? You'd think if he's got the whole movie named after him (which to begin with, is already stupid) he'd be in it all the time. Or it'd be about his life. This was just stupid.Overall a worthless movie, complete trash. Was waiting for it to end so badly. My legs and arms started getting numb tingles from boredom. Not like the hyper tingly jitters you get watching Mission Impossible 3 or something. This was just crap.0/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bourne Again?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, at least it was waaay better than Legacy.I'm a huge Bourne supporter. I loved the first three and until the ugly stepchild, or The Bourne Legacy, came to pass, it was my favorite franchise. Unfortunately, greed caused Legacy and ruined the only complete series I gave a solid 10/10 stars to every entry. So, when the fifth installment was announced, I was 50% excited it marked the return of the fantastic duo of Director Paul Greengrass and Matt Damon and 50% unhappy since the story, to me, ended perfectly with Ultimatum.After the movie, the first percentage went to 0 and the second to 100. This film was unnecessary.The movie did have some major problems. The script's pretty lousy, it contains a ton less action from its predecessors and the film once again retreads the same old story. Further it was thoroughly predictable, had laughable and obvious from the get-go villains and the expected shaky-cam trademark of Greengrass made reading the countless phone screens impossible until it finally settled down?each and every time. That said, the one main action scene ? la Spectre's one main action scene, was enjoyable, albeit barely original and admittedly, it was nice to see Matt Damon right back in Jason's shoes.After the movie starts off with the funny "Previously on Bourne?" rehash, it shows Bourne in hiding and someone pulling him back out to discover more about his past. People all around him have multiple agendas and though Bourne's isn't solid, he does want to fill in some of more gaps of his past. Again.The first three movies were much more focused with ten times the emotional connections and direction. Sadly, this one, is all over the place and no one is too enthused to be here, namely Tommy Lee Jones.I understand Jones is about to turn 70, but he looks really tired here. There were only a few sparks in him to remind us on how great he used to be. While the movie isn't a complete waste ? I really did like the movie's last few minutes, it's not worth the extra "adventure" of Bourne. Like Terminator who should've bowed out at the end of #2, Bourne should've stayed in hiding after #3.***Final thoughts: (Mild Spoiler Alert) DAMN IT, they got Vegas wrong again. First off, let me say, I was there when they filmed it. Only, I didn't know they were closing down the strip at 3AM or I would've been out there. I was right there at Caesars Palace, in bed, asleep, just a block from them filming this. Too bad I missed it live!Secondly, boy did I throw up my arms when I saw this Vegas chase scene. They have this "extended" car chase scene on the Strip that would've been more fantastic if they didn't spend the 4 minutes of drive time in one block of the strip. If you watch from behind the cars chasing each other, you'll see the same background the entire chase. Further, when the inevitable crash comes, they crash into Bally's and end up in the now defunct Riviera Hotel???almost 2 miles away. Yeah, yeah, it made for a great scene, the car crashing into an actual casino, but it didn't make any sense that outside it was Bally's and inside was almost 2 miles away at the Riviera. But, that's just me. It's one of my biggest pet peeves: 99% of the time, they get Vegas wrong and horribly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very enjoyable fifth (technically fourth) entry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jason Bourne is the fifth entry (technically fourth, as The Bourne Legacy is really a spin-off) in the Bourne action spy thriller film series. While I still consider The Bourne Ultimatum to be the best in the series and nothing else will ever to top it, I think this one is still an enjoyable follow-up. It never felt contrived and added some more interesting backstory for Jason Bourne's character.Set a decade after the events of The Bourne Ultimatum, Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) emerges from hiding to find out more about his past. However, little does Bourne know that the CIA have activated Operation Ironhand, the successor to both Operations Treadstone and Blackbriar, in an attempt to hunt him down and bring him back into their hands.While the film still follows the typical Bourne format, that's how I like it best. It is filled with some great action scenes and some very poignant moments involving Jason Bourne trying to remember who he really is. Matt Damon is once again excellent in the title role, even after fourteen years of playing him. Director Paul Greengrass' trademark shaky-cam also returns in this film, which was noticeably absent in The Bourne Legacy. If you enjoy the Jason Bourne series, then I'd say check this one out.I rate it 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Jason Bourne" Obtains A Triumphal Entry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Call it what you want: reawaken, reinvention, reboot, revival or resurrection; Jason Bourne is back with iron fists, pectorals of steel and narrative and visual firmness. After the massive and commercial product from 2012 starring Jeremy Renner and directed by Tony Gilroy; Matt Damon reprises safely the role that gave him big recognition at the beginning of the century, he comes back with his favorite director Paul Greengrass, who after nine years does not neglect the soul of the franchise and however, delivers action sequences to rise to George Miller or Sam Mendes.Bourne is born from shadows with a past as turbid as latent; he has sunk his experience in street fights and loneliness that accompanies him makes the passing the days like years, so to recover his memory entirely, he will be confronted face to face with CIA and will discover the vague past that overwhelms him.Paul Greengrass has initiated a reciprocity with Damon, in fact, the actor demanded to Greengrass to get his participation in the film. The director already has experience in action movies ( he has directed "The Bourne Supremacy" and "The Bourne Ultimatum", respectively), therefore, he firmly demonstrates his radical progress in each frame. Damon and Paul are a mechanical clock, a machine warily synchronized, which allows a consistent and palpitating progress; besides, it is the first time that Damon is producer and Greengrass is screenwriter with Christopher Rouse, resulting in a script aggressively complex (even indecipherable), with fast-paced and sumptuous action scenes.The incorporation of new characters is not superfluous nor unnecessary, in fact, the arrival of the new Oscar winner is sublime, Alicia Vikander plays Heather Lee, a young analyst with a double role- playing game within the agency that comes together the audience almost immediately, this is a role that Vikander needed to do, which is like a breath of fresh air to her dramatic and award- winning career. Tommy Lee Jones, Vincent Cassel and Julia Stiles are part of the fatal attraction around the plot and with no doubt whatsoever, these three characters molded the bulky action sequences around the film; it is important to emphasize in the conclusive decision of the director about exterminate some of his famous actors, undeniably, there will be drama."Jason Bourne" initiates in a diffuse context, the film begins to setch around to a stifling political environment, amount of unknowable terms and values for the audience; digital privacy, financial crisis and social disorders synthesize the issues of the atmosphere in which begins the exhilarating plot, nevertheless, it is not problem since after the first fifteen minutes, Greengrass commences to clarify his objectives accompanied by the opening of his specialty, the full of adrenaline and impressive action scenes.I am aware I have employed "action scenes" repeatedly, precisely because is what leaving "Bourne" engraving after leaving the movie theater. Nowdays, see a sequence that shake with such exquisiteness , it is almost unprecedented, however, the choreographies and practices of the movie dazzles security. The adventure goes from Athens to Las Vegas, jumping from here to there while retaining the originality and intrigue. The night chases full of perspectives and explosions are acclaimed, nevertheless, the movie has conceived one epic sequence, the colossal knock down of automobiles in Las Vegas, I loved it and will stay engraved in the memory of the audience, perennially.Universal takes maximum advantage of the fifth installment of one of its franchises more long-lived; "Jason Bourne", occasionally, reminds us to franchises such as "Mission: Impossible" or "James Bond" and gradually it gives us one breathe from the frantic passing of story. This film returns strident, with far-fetched action scenes but with narrative fatigues evidenced in the few alternatives that having the protagonist, with respect to delve into his past; undoubtedly, franchise continues, nevertheless, it must consider a different approach to clear argumentative exhaustion.</fullReview>

It appeared that Noah Vosen was a very stupid Antagonist more than it has to be for a CIA official .- Comparing to The Bourne Supremacy , I think it's obvious to the blinds that Jason Bourne screen-editing is a lot more competent than that for The Bourne Supremacy which it has fatal error made its story-line somehow redundant (Matt Damon (Jason Bourne) facing Marton Csokas (Jarda), in order to forcefully (insert) a hand-to-hand combat in the movie to give some Martial Arts taste in it , But without any signs of how Jason Bourne know the existence of Jarda in the first place , that an outperform point for Jason Bourne .- Comparing to The Bourne Identity , I think any one realize the funny fighting &amp; car chasing in The Bourne Identity to know the superiority of Jason Bourne , But It is okay for 2002 The Bourne Identity .- Comparing to The Bourne Legacy , There is no doubt that the absence of Matt Damon stun The Legacy with Loss of Heat , But it is not only Legacy defect , But also Jeremy Renner unfitting to play the role of a Black Op Assassin , The Overreaction of whole crew in various situations to insert by force a FAKE Drama in The movie .- for the first time ever in Bourne Movies , Jason Bourne represents multi-level antagonism with a lot of suspense &amp; quite surprising events , that deserve to be praisedJason Bourne is much more competent movie , although it has some defects :- the insist of relying on Shaky action scenes to dispense CGI or make up for some unrealistic Action sequences or incompetent Action scenes , which is an old way &amp; also prosaic solution .- Lack of Drama &amp; Touching moments ... &amp; That demands longer Duration ... but for me ... lack of Touching moments is a lot more bearable than overacting or Dramatic Scenes Insertion .The Conclusion If You are a (Real) Bourne Fan , I advise you to watch that movie , You'll feel the difference &amp; You will love it , without losing The Bourne series spirit .I warned of spoiler contents in my review just in case of unveiling any scenes of the movie to explain my point of view ... thanks for your patience .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Bourne Series-Part 5:Jason Bourne.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite finding her performances in Testament of Youth,The Danish Girl and Ex_Machina to be extraordinarily expressive,I have never got round to seeing Alicia Vikander on the big screen.Keeping an eye on Tommy Lee Jones's credits since catching his deadpan manner in the first Men In Black,I was thrilled to discover that Jones and Vikander were to star together in the latest of the Bourne series,which led to me getting ready to meet Jason Bourne on the big screen. The plot: Working with hackers, Nicky Parsons hacks into the CIA website and downloads documents related to black ops projects,including ones related to Jason Bourne (whose not been seen by the CIA for years). Finding out that he is in Greece,Parson decides to go and reunite with Bourne. Identifying Parsons as the hacker,CIA Director Robert Dewey and CIA Cyber Ops Division head Heather Lee decide that they must track Parsons down,as they start to suspect that Bourne is about to make his return.View on the film:Taking over after Julia Stiles (who along with Damon is the only cast member to return to the series) cameo,the alluring Alicia Vikander (who looks a bit young for a high level spot in the CIA,but fits in with the NSA staff age group that Lee is based on) gives a terrific performance as Heather Lee,by giving Lee a considerate/cerebral approach,which Vikander uses to make Lee nicely stand out from the more robust "old school" agents.Having a leather face which the makers look like the human version of the Grand Canyon,Tommy Lee Jones gives an excellent performance as CIA Director Robert Dewey,whose fingers have been worked to the bones that Jones chumps on with a scene-stealing gruffness. Joined by a snarling Vincent Cassel as assassin Asset,and trying to protect Riz Ahmed's oily social media head Aaron Kalloor,Matt Damon gives a very good performance as Bourne,who Damon spikes with a sharp,restrained anger that shines,even when most of the other cast grab most of the attention on the screen.Taking over from series writer Tony Gilroy,the screenplay by Paul Greengrass and editor Christopher Rouse cross wires modern tech fears with icy spy thrills. For the tech espionage,the writers take some real leaps in making the hackers and CIA be very stupid,with regular features such as "search proxy" and virtual private network (vpn) being unknown things to the "whiz kids." Whilst they take a bumpy with the tech,the writers use it to fuel a tense paranoia of everyone being linked to the same system.Name checking Edward Snowden a number of times,the writers firmly bring Bourne back to the present after a 9 year gap,and also neatly tie up threads from the original trilogy.Opening up Bourne's past in flashbacks,the writers smartly pull Bourne into being a deadly,silent spy.Lighting the fuse,the writers keep the flick moving at a frantic pace-each explosive action scene is met with mountains of ice cool hide &amp; seek spying.Shot in Tenerife due to "problems" getting permission to film in Greece,director Paul Greengrass and cinematographer Barry Ackroyd set the title in a blazing path with a tremendous opening set-piece. Turning down some of the past shaky cam,Greengrass,Ackroyd and editor Rouse display a sharp eye in putting each part of the Greek protest in perspective,and also delicately keep each individual plot thread caught in the chaos clear to see. Not placing everything on one action scene,Greengrass gives the espionage scenes a rich slickness,which get run over from a lavish action atmosphere hitting brittle,hand to hand combat fights and dazzlingly stylised chases round the Las Vegas Strip,as the Extreme Waves uncover Bourne's identity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fast paced, action filled and not forgetting the Drama of it all.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, after the X year gap it's nice to see Bourne back on our screens. The partnership between Matt Darmon and Paul Greengrass is clear to see in this action pack fast paced movie. The action is back up to the standard we saw in the first 3 films and the range of locations is overwhelming. I am glad to see that the story is fairly up to date with modern subjects such as hacking and also about government forces trying to sneak into the backdoor of consumers technology (see Apple and FBI case). With the classic Car chases and fist fights around every corner, this is one Bourne film not to be missed. All characters are played very well and the story comes across clearly and has lots of movement to it, the cinematography is great and shots are well chosen and in keeping with the style and pace of each scene. I am very much looking forward to the next film (if there is one) and looking forward to seeing what's next in the life of Bourne.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jason Bourn the king of thriller movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jason Bourne is the king of thriller movies. Matt Damon reprized his role as Bourne in the fifth installment in the Bourne trilogy. All of the Bourne movies are great, but this has been the best one so far. For all of the Bourne fans out there I think you will really think this is a great movie in the series. The movie had a lot of twist and turns that will have you on the edge of seat the whole time.Parents this movie is rated PG-13 for language colander and sequences of violence so if you think that is strong and don't want to expose your little ones to that and they want to see it let them see it when they are a little older because they will love it. I knew this was going to be a great movie, but it turned out to be better then I expected it to be. This movie was great</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A waste of potential</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A fan of the original trilogy I went into this film optimistic that somehow something good has happened since the terrible incarnation that was "The Bourne Legacy" and after watching the original trailer thought it could be a good film.Turns out I was wrong...Nicky Parsons, completely underused and only really there as a catalyst to kick off the middle act. Tommy Lee Jones... Ugh! "The Asset" boring.Choreography was good, some good fight scenes, however encompassed with all so familiar shaky camera!However the tech side of the film, considering its mostly played out in cybercrime of the CIA is terrible. Its laughable how bad they can mess up something they are basing their structured story on.**Spoiler Warning**There's a scene in the film where Bourne sticks a USB drive into a computer that then pings a location via malware to the CIA... this would be viable if they hadn't then shown the layout of all electronics in the area as "offline" except for a mobile phone, of which they then "hack" to create a wireless link to that said laptop!So how does offline laptop send location data to the CIA? Magic is the only answer.**End of Spoiler**In short there are some great set pieces but the story line, acting and so called "twist" are terrible and are nothing short of a movie designed to grab some cash and limelight from what was a good original trilogy.Wouldn't waste your money on the cinema watching this, I'd wait till its out on DVD or Netflix/Amazon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst cinematography Ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jason Bourne hurt my eyes.I had to look away from the action sequences because the blurred confusion of light and colour gave me a headache. The almost steady establishing shots were way too brief, and were gone before you had a chance to marvel at the city of Rome or Athens laid out before you.I've rated it awful because it is the only movie I've thought about asking for my money back - the camera work is really that bad.The same old story is getting very old. Surely the CIA would have brought Bourne in by now, instead of wasting all their time, energy and agents, trying to kill him?Does the CIA have external enemies, or does this series of movies suggest it is a self perpetuating entity that spends all its resources fighting among itself?As for the way the agency can see and hear everything, that too is getting old. The fog of war is real, and should play a part in the story. If only Uber drivers could get to you as fast as the agency can get to Bourne, in the middle of a city, during rush hour, it would be amazing.This tired old horse of a movie series died from flogging quite a few movies back. It is time for Bourne to move on, and with a much better cinematography director.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bourne Free</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll say straight up that I'm a big fan of Bourne. This is his 4th proper outing as our forgetful hero, if you ignore 2012's "The Bourne Legacy" with Jeremy Renner and Rachel Weisz: a 'parallel time-stream' drama that - rather against the stream of opinion I think - I also quite liked. Here Matt Damon's Jason Bourne is set free of the torture of his memories of the past. Or is he? In a Snowdenesque opening, rogue agent Nicky Parsons (Julia Stiles) is in Reykjavik hacking into the CIAs database of black ops files and uncovers materials that allow Bourne to regress to memories before he was indoctrinated to become the one-man fighting machine: memories that come very close to home and hearth.For Bourne is still a tortured soul in this film, drifting from country to country off the grid and making cash by flooring opponents cock-fighting style in bare knuckle fights.By being contacted by Parsons, Bourne appears on the radar of ambitious CIA cyber-intelligence officer Heather (#ratherboringname) Lee (Alicia Vikander) and new CIA director Robert Dewey (Tommy Lee Jones). In familiar fashion now, Dewey dispatches an asset with a serious Bourne grudge - Budge? - (the excellent Vincent Cassel ("Black Swan")) to eliminate the troublesome couple. Much mayhem and bloodshed ensues.Bourne has always been the silent but deadly type, and in this film he goes to extremes with the director (Paul Greengrass, back in the saddle again) only giving him an alleged 25 lines in the whole film (I wasn't sad enough to count them but I can believe that to be true). Centre stage in the acting stakes again though is my favourite actress of the moment Alicia Vikander who just radiates class with a mesmerising screen presence. Tommy Lee Jones - an actor who has always had too much skin for his face, now going into overdrive with age - is also superb, and as they spend much of their screen time together, the combo is compelling.But most people go to see Bourne for the action, and again the film doesn't disappoint, with a sequence set round Paddington being particularly thrilling and a Vegas-set car chase to die for (literally if you were unfortunate to be driving the strip that night!). For there is carnage a plenty in this film, with probably the highest body count of any Bourne film to date.Technically the film is really well put together, although you need to pay pretty close attention. The traditionally jerky-camera approach makes reading computer screens and text messages stressful for the viewer: the motion pauses for about 32 nano-seconds for reading purposes, so this film must be very hard work for dyslexics.There's some really nice featuring of new video surveillance technology picking out identities from the crowd (which you might think is science fiction, but is not since my 'day-job' company - Verint - develops such solutions!) I have seen other reports that Bourne fans were disappointed by this outing. I was not. I thought it was well up to standard. True there is a certain sense of re-tread (or perhaps that should be re-treadstone, arf!) to this, but the same could certainly be said for similar franchises (like Bond, and all of the current stock of superhero films). I personally can never get enough of Bourne - even the music and the pleasantly familiar end titles are a joy - so for me that's just fine! Recommended!

		<fullReview>I don't know but it's the only "bourne" movie that made me bored and just want it to be finish. There were too many chasing that happened, but there's almost no action in the places they went, even if there was, the actions will likely not satisfy you. Too many chasing that it made me dizzy and tired for being too long. I was expecting more highlight about Jason "bourne" past since it is his story. The confrontation/battle was not entertaining and I think the ending was not powerful to affect the viewers. The antagonist was not that interesting and didn't give many challenge to the protagonist. The ending has nothing special. I also think the protagonist didn't showcase his skill that much.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a big fan to the series and i enjoy such action thriller movies. The actors play good and do their job pretty good. The soundtrack is true to the series so another good point. The story line is not bad, it feels loose at times but it's not that bad. And the good things ends here. The directing is very very bad, Paul Greengrass probably did not watch the movie himself... Action scenes are pretty poor, there is no good fighting scenes like in the old movies with wing-chun like fights or innovative aggressive moves. Camera is shaking all the time, and you can't understand what is happening on the screen, i was unable to recognize Dodge Charger even that they say it is a Dodge. The whole point of this kind of movies is the action, and when the action is bad, everything falls apart. If you are fan to the series, you should wait for Blu-ray to watch it.Poor fight choreography and shaky action camera ruined this movie for me.</fullReview>

It ruined the whole movie.Beside where did Bourne and the killers get all those swipe cards to open up everything? Are we in that bad a shape? Was it worth killing all of those people just to eliminate one man? Some of the scenes were impossible to see really well. especially the scenes in Los Vegas. I liked the way you eliminated the women that he worked with in the other movies by shooting her.I did like the new woman though. She played a very good part! I ask you?

		<fullReview>I could only say wow after I have seen it with one of my best friends in the theater. The car chases were amazing here. Seeing these scenes on the large screen is a great experience. The shaky hand camera didn't disturb so far as written so often in these reviews. The story is simply told with some little flaws that didn't influence the high pace and the perfect timed entertainment. At the end even a sequel could be possible. To the actors I can say that they all delivered a credibly top performance. Matt Damon especially is for me one of the best actors. Vincent Cassell was interesting to see in his villain role. Give this movie a chance and enjoy it. For all these reasons it merits 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bourne is Back</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And so Jason Bourne returns in the best spy movie series. And it was great. I really enjoyed it and it had a ton of the action and suspense that the others have. Characters The characters are good. I enjoyed seeing Nicki again and felt sad when she died. I liked Heather Lee and I think that she is the best new character in this. The rest are well portrayed and good characters. Hero I think that I'll watch anything Matt Damon is on now as he kills it as Jason Bourne. He also does well at showing how dark this character can be and he is just a bad ass. He is a very compelling character and I enjoy every time he is on screen. Which isn't enough. For a movie named Jason Bourne it should really have more Jason Bourne in it. Villains Tommy Lee-Jones is great as Dewey and is a genuinely punch able character. He is mean and just really horrible. The Asset is also great and I like how he has a grudge against Bourne. And when the big twist happens you can see how much anger there is between him and Bourne. Action The action is absolutely phenomenal. Especially the first chase and sewer fight but by far my favourite car chase from all of the Bourne movies is the Vegas chase. It is absolutely amazing. Plot The plot is great. There are many twists and turns. It does many great things and is very engrossing. It sucks you in and makes it very difficult to stop watching. It is a bit hard to follow but it's a Bourne movie so what do I expect. Summary What I liked: Hero, villain, music, characters, acting, plot and stunts What I didn't like: not enough Bourne and a bit hard to follow. Rating: 8.4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being a fan of the Bourne series may or may not determine whether you like this new installment. Jason Bourne (the film) boasts much of the same formula from the series' first 3 films, yet doesn't give us a whole lot of new direction.We left off in the last one with Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) finding out his real name and finally remembering joining the Treadstone program. Here, it's 10 years later and he's been living off the grid. Resurfacing for miscellaneous reasons, he's now trying to figure out even more about his past.This one offers us something that the previous films don't really give us: a twist. It's a pretty decent one, too.We also get some interesting new characters. A CIA director, Robert Dewey, played by the always-respectable Tommy Lee Jones. Jones gives us a CIA villain to truly despise. He's so believably evil, that he makes the film just about as much as Damon does.And while director Paul Greengrass creates a film that could be mistaken for any one of its predecessors (which is a good thing), we're hoping for a little bit more than just finding out more about Jason Bourne's past--something that could probably have been covered in The Bourne Ultimatum.It's not that Bourne's character has no depth, it's just that we've already seen it all in the previous 3 films. There's not much left to discover about his personality. And basically nothing new added here.Oh yeah, and there was this whole fourth movie featuring Jeremy Renner, called The Bourne Legacy, which was basically not touched on at all in this film. The thing I was most excited about was getting a follow-up to a cliffhanger-filled movie.But we don't. However, one can still hope that this sets up a neat tie-in between the two stories.There is one moment, however, where we actually consider that Jason Bourne's death is possible. It's probably the only moment (besides the end of Ultimatum) where we think this.Though many might consider this new film unnecessary, it's still just about as entertaining as the best unnecessary films out there.Twizard Rating: 86</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Let Me Think About It</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Bourne Trilogy is one of my all-time favorite film series. Between the action, romance, government corruption, Matt Damon, and the concept of "who is Jason Bourne?", it basically had everything an action movie junkie could ask for. Admittedly, I have not seen The Bourne Legacy as I thought the concept of the film, while interesting, was unappealing. Having a Bourne film without Bourne is like the next 007 not being James Bond, it just doesn't work in my opinion (though I have heard decent things about the film and may one day check it out).Jason Bourne is a film that ties up portions of the original trilogy while leaving room for further installments, very similar to The Force Awakens did in regards to Return of the Jedi. While it is not my favorite Bourne film (I need to watch all three of the originals again before I can chose which is), it definitely got me excited for Bourne's story to continue. I know that the book series has many more installments than the films do, and based on that I would love to see more Bourne stories in the future, and I believe this film allows for that to take place.Matt Damon, Tommy Lee Jones, Alicia Vikander, and the rest of the cast did a fantastic job and while I have read some reviews that paint Damon and Jones as not enjoying this film, I don't agree. These are characters who have been at each other's throats for years now, even though they haven't spoken in just as much time. Bourne is tired, worn down, and much like Ben Affleck's Batman in Batman V Superman, has seen and discovered so many things over the years to the point where he's not sure he wants to continue the fight. Spoiler alert, he does. While Dewey (Jones) on the other hand is at the end of his career, very similar to Vito Corleone in The Godfather, and he's trying to hold onto all the cards he has. Some say this is a wooden performance by Jones, I don't agree. I see Dewey as a man who, although old, tired, and almost out, is holding on to every bit of life that he can. I thought the cast did an excellent job.I will say I was confused about what Bourne's ultimate goal was during portions of the film, though I was never lost whenever he was on the move. The reason I can't say Jason Bourne is my favorite Bourne film is because honestly I don't believe the story is as good as Identity, Supremacy, and Ultimatum's; though this is not to say that I didn't enjoy Jason Bourne because I absolutely did. There has always been a LOT of truth in the Bourne films, and this one is no exception.The action sequences were fantastic, between the hand-to-hand combat fights, the gun shoot outs, the riot sequence with Nicki, and the end car chase, I was hooked from the start of the film to the end. I guess I'm just a sucker for action flicks, and Jason Bourne.</fullReview>

Surprised me at the end. I understand that Jeremy Renner is in the next motion picture and it will be out in 2018. Some of the street automobile, etc. chases (crashes) were spectacular.

Instead of action being strategically placed with dialog and scenery, it was thrown at us most all the time. However, on the side of caution, the makers of this film did not include aliens, vampires, werewolves, zombies, or giant albino monks!The plot revolves around the clichéd controversy of security versus privacy but it is full of holes and improbabilities -- in one sequence a SWAT team truck is driven through heavy traffic like a knife through warm butter.Save your money for this one and watch the old Bourne films on re-run.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most bland Bourne movie yet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After nine years of waiting, Matt Damon is back in the role that really put him on the map. If you ask someone about him and what movies he was in then they will most likely talk about one of these. So when this was announced the hype was real. Not only did they get their star back but they got their director back. Aside from 'Identity' Paul Greengrass directed the three films that star our titular character. Like the others, this film revolves around Bourne trying to figure out aspects of his life. Instead of trying to piece together what happened to him, he is now attempting to figure out why it happened in the first place. Considering these films, this is the kind of story we really didn't need.We don't really need to know about why he became an agent or what drove him there. What was so compelling about the original three was that we knew as much about him as we did. Nothing. And now that we know what kind of person he is and why he was face up in the ocean, this story feels obligatory. I think the biggest reason it feels this way is because Bourne has been sidelined in his own movie. This didn't feel like a Bourne movie for say. It felt like another 'Kingdom of the Crystal Skull'. Another passing of the torch type film. While the story at the heart of the movie really isn't that bad, benching the main character certainly did a number on it.Tommy lee Jones and Alicia Vikander have far more screen time than Damon does. That being said, the B story is pretty bad. It attempts social commentary directed at social media. And every time this sub plot surfaces in the film, it grinds the movie to a halt. This story could work in another writers hands but for a Bourne movie, I think this story was destined to fail.There are so many different threads that go into this sub story that they are impossible to keep straight. If you can't keep them straight, then don't fret. Most of them don't really make sense any way. There are also a variety of little details that are quite stupid. Like how the CIA was able to see camera footage through the scope of a sniper rifle. Was the camera placed in the dudes eye ball or something?There wasn't a lot in this movie that really impressed me. However the one thing that I really loved was the action scenes. Most of them weren't exactly as involving as some of the other films, but they were still pretty great. It had the good sense to not just start an action scene because it could. Whenever one took place it felt like there was a genuine reason for them to exist. And they were the only moments in the film that felt like the film makers put effort into. Specifically in the closing car chase. Not only did we get to see cars get mulched but we got to see it with nice helicopter shots. That last scene will unfortunately be the only one that I remember from the whole film.The rest of the movie is so uneven and lacking in a compelling story. I just couldn't get involved in this film. Even with the original cast and crew on board, it fails at recapturing the vibe of the trilogy. While the cast may offer solid performances and the action is as good as ever, it's hardly enough to redeem 'Jason Bourne' from it's short comings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not terrible but pretty boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm writing this review a few days late but I got to see Jason Bourne the day it came out and I was super pumped because Iove the first three movies and the trailers made it seem awesome. Within the first twenty minutes of the movie I was hooked because there was a huge chase scene that involved a sniper that was pretty fun to watch. It also introduced a handful of new characters including Oscar winners Tommy Lee Jones and Alicia Vikander, who were pretty good in the film. But after the chase and sniper scene you start to realize that this movie is plot less. It still follows Jason Bourne trying to find his past but it didn't progress the story at all. The main plot is about an online application or something that's like facebook that wasn't really explained. Like I said it's plot less Tommy Lee Jones and Alicia Vikander were good but you didn't care about their character at all, every scene was filmed so dramatically that it felt like you were watching the same shot over and over again for a minute or two straight, it was just Matt Damon walking around a corner over and over again. The action was great though, it was filmed very nicely as usual. But the thing that sucked the most for me is that the title is Jason Bourne, to me that made me think this was it, this is where Jason finds out exactly who he is and it all ends here. But nope, it sets up another sequel which I was really upset about. Is this movie The Bourne Legacy bad, no it's not, but is it as good as any of the original three Bourne movies, not at all. Jason Bourne was very disappointing but entertaining at times. If you're the average movie goer who just watches movies purely for entertainment you will probably be fine with Jason Bourne, but if you're a fan of the past Bourne movies or a critic it's not worth your money.

		<shortDescription>A bad sequel, but on it's own it is just a mediocre action movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Matt Damon is back as the titular character in Paul Greengrass' latest movie 'Jason Bourne'. This time Bourne is brought back into the world of espionage to discover the secrets of his past while trying to avoid being caught by the CIA.The movie basically starts of with one of the best action sequences I've seen this year. Through the use of quick cuts and shaky cam the chaos of the entire situation is brought to the screen in an amazing way. This does not work all that well in other action sequences however as it causes the action to become very hard to follow. Moreover it quickly becomes apparent that Bourne can pretty much fight his way out of every scenario which makes it very hard to become invested into Bourne's journey. This journey itself is also not that interesting as in the previous Bourne movies. Bourne's motives to come out of the shadows aren't all that strong and when his story is ultimately wrapped up it just wasn't as satisfying as it was in the original movie. Bourne's main antagonist is also not that interesting. In the previous movies the agents Bourne came across all seemed to have some character to them and it was very clear that they were just following orders. This time though the agent is a very stereotypical bad guy who has no problem killing civilians and other people of the law.In the end 'Jason Bourne' is a very mediocre action movie. On it's own I probably would've enjoyed it a little bit more, but when compared to the other Bourne movies it is a slight disappointment.My rating: 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>it seems Tony Gilroy was the true talent of the Bourne series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's be blunt. Jason Bourne (2016) is awful.Made as a lazy, cynical cashgrab, conceived when Damon's career was in freefall and inspired by a childish feud with Tony Gilroy - the writer of the classic Bourne films.Greengrass tries to take on writer duties himself, revealing another cinema discipline that he has no talent for.Damon looks bored, Cassel looks fed up, Stiles looks old and Tommy Lee Jones looks very, very ill.The plot is a composite of the previous Bourne movies. Bourne's -or rather David Webb- story was finished in the Bourne Ultimatum ( some would argue it was finished at the end of the Bourne Identity). There is nothing original here in terms of story or character. Just a lazy retread of what has gone before.As in the Bourne Supremacy , an attempt is made to generate some drama by summarily despatching Bourne's "girl". No-one really cared about the death of Marie all those years ago, and the death of Nicky is even less interesting. This is not helped by the fact that Julia Stiles seems to be reading her lines from a card, and the manner of her death is a blatant rip off of the female death in Supremacy.There is , as usual in a Greengrass movie, way too much shakycam . There was too much shakycam in Greengrass' previous Bourne films , but the use of shakycam has increased tenfold. The climactic fight scene was ruined by the inability to see what was going on.The car chase- which must have cost millions- is unwatchable because it looks as though it was filmed at night during an earthquake.Wait for it on TV</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having just (regrettably) seen the new Jason Bourne Film? I vehemently call for the director of photography and producers to be shot.I'm serious though, the film was so bad that I even used my emergency supply of vodka to try and make the passing easier on the brain.And not only was the DoP to blame (who I suspect was on ketamine). Everything from the script, to the art design, to even the grading was subpar and even nauseating. I have seen YouTube minecraft lets plays which have had more direction and progression in terms of character and story/plot changes! I'm sure my performance in the year 6 school play where I forgot my lines on stage and awkwardly shouted even intimate emotional lines was tiers above the acting of the cast! (Of which the lead literally said less than a paragraph throughout). Oh and you know that DoP I was calling out? Pretentious prick must've been having his camera operators imitating an epileptic fit there was so much camera shake! The editing was awful-my English PowerPoint presentation on all my sons was leagues above in terms of continuity and inspiration HA! The entire script as well felt copied and pasted-not from another franchise but from itself! "CIA agents try to kill Bourne in Reykjavik/Greece/Berlin/London/Vegas but narrowly fail!" And the absolute contempt for even basic technological knowledge was insulting! What kind of flip phone has NOT ONE BUT THREE firewalls?!?!? And htf is it possible for the CIA to be able to control the electric supply to any building in the world? Oh and of course the dreaded: "oh what's that blur in the picture? (Points at a few pixels) ENHANCE ENHANCE ENHANCE! (Few pixels "enhances" to a high definition photo several times its original size)" there was so much wrong with it and it honestly felt like the producers just were trying to make as much money then run! Alas what cost over $120,000,000 dollars to make? at least half of which went into funding the drugs the crew must've taken in all stages of production?ultimately was worse than a no budget Albanian documentary on paint sniffing! Because it certainly felt like that was what I was doing as I felt my eyes and brain physically and emotionally abused throughout 2hours of conceited in-continuous lazy unstimulated trash. Honestly I could write a book on how terrible it was. Please DO NOT watch this film! You will be more stimulated culturally/intellectually/emotionally if you were to eat sawdust while watching the Jeremy Kyle show high off your head on cyclophosphamide!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bourne back to find new truths.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Matt Damon, once again returns as Jason Bourne, and Nikki Parsons brings him out of hiding to reveal hidden truths, does he accept this from an old operative from his past, Well if it was me i would be happy to let this one go, but for Bourne he still has unfinished business and you would of needed to of watch the last two Bourne films to understand that some of his memory flash backs where not uncovered at all, and so he must find out what Nikki has left for him. Now many might think this film lacks and that there is no story line what so ever, but this film is all about bringing him in, because Bourne is still very much threatening the agency everyday he is still out in the cold, sometimes the films we watch tend to lack somewhere in the sequels as they need to express the story behind the main character more so viewers get the fuller picture, and this is very much what they have done here, yes the plot could be better but so can be said for every single film, not just Bourne films, but this is still better than your Bond movies, and its still packing a deadly punch with very fast action scenes, great performances from new actors, and even more car &amp; motor bike chase for which we know Bourne is good at showing us his skills as a rogue operative, you would think as the film went on over the 2hours that he was close to biting the bullet even more in this film that any other. Overall then, if your expecting Espionage thriller with more story based around his next assignment, then you might not enjoy the film as the other reviewer thought in July, but if you want to learn more about Jason Bourne and "Connect the dots" you will find this is very much the film that was missing from early on, when everyone might of been asking for more about Bourne, rather than just watching back to back action, this film does keep you on your seat, and does give the majority of film goers a look into what we all don't want to believe is true but we kinda all know is happening with the world today and that's agency wanting to be Big Brother and watch us all. So do you watch this film or not, well i think you should as this is the build up to the final film, yes if your asking that question in your mind, its been left open for maybe one more, the last chapter in the Bourne saga.So please do go and watch it and learn about Bourne and other new actors who bring out the best in this non stop action packed 2 hours, as i think many will like this story line.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A violation of the Bourne Trilogy's reputation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The main story in the trilogy was all about Jason trying to find out his true identity. That search came to an end in The Bourne Ultimatum (2007), answering all the questions and bringing the series to a satisfying closure. The negative critical response on The Bourne Legacy (2012) should have been a warning for any filmmaker with plans for a reboot or spin-off. When they announced the release of Jason Bourne (2016) I did not have high expectations of it. I found it unnecessary and close to impossible to create a successful installment without infecting the reputation of such a great movie franchise. And my feelings were right. I almost fell asleep in the cinema. The forced plot of tempting Jason Bourne to come out of his retirement was lame, the characters were boring, the acting was nothing special and the car chase scenes were too exhaustive and boring. Save yourself some time, don't watch this movie, even if you liked the Bourne Trilogy. It will ruin the way you'll remember Jason Bourne.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The cinematic equivalent of a broken pencil....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The tagline reads 'you know his name'.Well if the script is anything to go by, you'd be hard pressed to forget it, because a character must utter the titular characters surname almost every minute in this film.In fact, you could play a drinking game with this film, take a finger of alcohol every time Bourne is said, you'll probably have a lot more fun.Years after the events of the wonderful Ultimatum, former CIA assassin Jason Bourne resurfaces just as his former employers are implementing a new program aimed at hunting him down. Now fully recovered from his amnesia, Bourne teams up with Nicky to uncover the truth behind his father's death, while simultaneously exacting revenge and evading the government forces hot on his trail.......Now whilst the film was far from terrible, it just seemed such a pointless exercise to make another Bourne film with Damon. Ultimatum finished with such a belter of an ending, there was no need to revisit this particular character. This is like Murray and Johannsen filming a short sequel to lost in translation where we find out just what was said.Greengrass keeps the tension reasonably high, but the score really takes you out of the film. It's just so urgent and so dramatic, you may as well have had a Voice over shouting 'this is a tense part, Bourne is in danger, that's why he's wearing a peaked cap and putting something into someone's pocket for the umpteenth time'.Damon is fine, but he says less than Arnie did in T2, so he has nothing more to do than look broody, perplexed, injured, and run quite fat at times.Granted, the final fifteen minutes are pretty spectacular, and the car chase is wonderfully choreographed, but a spectacular set piece does not make a good film.Jones is Jones, he's been playing the same role for 23 years now, he may as well have been auditioning for The Fugitive 3 (or would that be The Fugitive..........Free?), but he's always watchable, so you can forgive his shortcomings.Shaky cam is back with a vengeance, as is the fast editing, and it really takes you out of the final showdown between Damon and Gallo.So while it's not a terrible film, it's a pretty irrelevant film, showing hypocrisy toward elements of the wonderful trilogy.If you are desperate to see What Bourne Did Next, there are a two very good book ending set pieces, and it does have throwbacks to the trilogy, but they are few and far between, and in turn make this rather 'still Bourne'.So all in all it's the cinematic equivalent of a broken pencil.........Pointless....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seriously, whoever thought that shaky camera work would enhance any action should be banned from making any more movies, ever. Even static scenes had "shaky cam". I think this was the first time I had the urge to throw something at the screen.There is no plot. How hard is to come up with a plausible plot that would force Jason Bourne to confront the CIA/KGB/WWF/? The whole computer "scenes" were poor. "Enhance"? Are you kidding me? Tommie Lee Jones probably spent more time thinking about the payday than putting anything into the character. He showed more depth in his Japanese commercials than this movie.Cassel who is usually very good, was pretty mediocre in his portrayal of the "Asset". Vikander tried, but she's just not believable as a CIA-anything, much less a computer whiz.Matt Damon did what he could. I'm hoping he's sitting somewhere in LA wondering where the other half of the movie he filmed went. I'd be shocked if this is the script he signed on for.This is seriously not a good movie. Wait for it to come up on PPV/On-Demand/etc if you're curious. This will be last Bourne movie I'll see in the movie theater.</fullReview>

The movie really play up the idea that the CIA has the technology to track anyone anywhere anytime, with amazing software and methods. Why heck they can shut your laptop down in Iceland with a single click from the US. It is just an overplayed completely empty cliché at this point. The plot is thin while most of the action is bang up car chases ala Hollywood cheese fest. The actors unconvincing, including the walking dead Mr.Jones. Seriously, that dude is the same person in every movie he makes. The only thing different is his name and more wrinkles.

Subplots which have no intersection with the main plot exists for a lot of the time..The story is senseless as in different plots don't come together. The guy playing CIA director sucked. No energy, old, dull as hell. The Technology, the Op center and support guys who looked so cool in ultimatum is amateurish, like out of a toy shop. There are some really stupid scenes Bourne walks through the airport with a ordinary passport with his actual name and is not flagged. Nicky is a nervous mess. The CIA which was so central to the previous movies, is like a cartoonish agency with people running it delivering bland lines. Where is the intrigue, the frenzy, the tightness of the CIA from Ultimatum ?? The asset is again a disappointment. 100% of the story is predictable from the start. This is a crushing of fans expectations, not a Jason bourne movie more like a watered down transporter movie. Hell legacy was a 100 times better than this. Sorely disappointed.</fullReview>

Then there's a profusion of random, extremely tight, oh-look-at-the-pores! closeups, for no reason. And then there are occasional flashbacks, varying slo-mo with blur and filters and... it's just TERRIBLE camera-work.The titular character, Jason Bourne himself, is no more than a cipher ? grim and humorless, no personality, nothing to connect with or care about. He's simply an agent of pain and death. In fact, there really are no good guys. The only person with the ghost of a sympathetic motivation was the bad guy, a cold-blooded murderer.I apologized to my whole family for taking them to this waste of time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing for the talent and budget available</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having loved the original three, in particular the first one, found Jason Bourne pretty disappointing.The Paul Greengrass films Ultimatum and Supremacy are great, but are very much built on the template that is set in the Bourne Identity. Minus the mystery of neither he or the audience knowing who he is, or the brilliant character of Marie, and the love story.SPOILERSSo as with Ultimatum and Supremacy, we find a new even higher up boss we were previously unaware of, and Tommy Lee Jones is very good. Then we've got Nikki linking us back to the originals with the beginnings of a fascinating story of what she has used her CIA skills for relating to Snowden and online privacy. Then 15 minutes in, they kill Nikki. Wiping out any connection to the original trilogy, and what Bourne and Nikki's back story had been. Previously hinted at in Ultimatum.On top of that we see how upset Bourne is at her death, at the same time knowing that must be what, a thousandth of what he felt for Marie's death? Happening so early her death isn't even driving the narrative along. That leaves us with Bourne and a pile of characters we have just met, and don't care about, and a script that wouldn't be out of place on a Pierce Brosnan James Bond film. Yes there's lots of action, and shaky camera angles, but the fantastic car chase in the original film, is fantastic because of the charm of the beat up old mini in Paris. He's the anti-hero making do. There are other elements of the script that are odd.At the beginning he is involved in boxing. Other than to show Damon's physique, what was that about? Nothing else is given of his private life the last few years, and if he is staying hidden from sight, why stand out like that in front of so many people?The final scene, where they repeat the use of Moby's Extreme Ways to demonstrate someone being caught out by him, is very weak. Much like the rest of the plot.Overall an okay film by general standards, but not a patch on the original three, and a lack of understanding from the writers for what worked in the Bourne Identity. Character development, back story and charm.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had just viewed a film that was full of style and excellent character development (Cafe Society). It is a treasure. As I was exiting I saw that this film, Jason Bourne, was to begin in a few minutes. I decided to take a look since I have been watching Riz Ahmed in the excellent HBO series The Night Of - don't miss this, it's great. So Riz was the appeal to me to see this film.And since I had seen Matt Damon on The Late Late Show and talked about the motorcycle chase scene that as well had me interested in seeing it. The motorcycle scene comes early in the film and I was hugely disappointed because the sequence is heavily edited and the camera is shaking throughout - the audience is not meant to see the chase as though it were in real time. The last good chase scene I saw was with Steve McQueen in Bullitt, filmmakers have never topped it. So that disappointed me. Plus I like Julia Stiles and after that scene she is gone.As for Riz, he is underutilized so I am yet again disappointed. In between the motorcycle chase and that last time Riz is on screen, there is a lot of noise, silly chases that defy even the logic of "action" films. Way too over the top.Had I had a pillow with me I would have snoozed through much of this film. And sadly I was in a RPX theater which means it is "much louder" than normal. This is one for viewing via Netflix (not for me, once was definitely enough) or iTunes thereby being able to fast forward through parts that aren't meant to be seen by the audience anyway.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a let-down</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Finally, one of my favorite movie series comes with a new installment! Booked my tickets early and caught the cinema release here in Norway. After the fourth move without neither Greengrass nor Damon, I was pretty excited to see them getting together for a new Bourne move.?and what a let-down! This must be the Bourne equivalent to Speed 2.My main objection is that the character development seems at odds with the previous movies. The last time we saw Bourne, he acted with self-confidence and seemed to have regained his cool. However, the movie starts with Bourne leading a seemingly destructive life in Greece. A weak plot involving some new information about Bourne's past make up the main, and rather poor, story line. The worst thing is that everything I found fascinating with the original Bourne movie has now gone. Matt Damon as Jason Bourne looked realistic. The colors were bleak. The fighting was brutal, but somewhat believable. Things got blown up with a toaster and a magazine - instead of some high-tech stuff. Even the car chase was with ordinary cars ? have you seen anyone handle a Mini or Moscow taxi like that? In this movie we are being served the standard blockbuster format. It may be entertaining, but it lacks the soul of what made this movie series special.Let's cross our fingers that Greengrass and Damon get together one more time for a 6th movie - but that they reflect a bit on what made the first three movies special and at least make an effort to make a credible story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hollywood is obsessed with CIA, its covert black missions, agents or agents turn rogue, trained assassins, special units, small ultra black teams.....and so on. I really don't know what would the real CIA guys, from its politically appointed director(most outsiders) to the lowest security clearance employees think about these ridiculous creations by the Hollywood morons. Guess they would sneer in their offices but at the same time secretly thank Hollywood for the free commercials and save a lot of budget for advertisement. America's CIA is freely glorified by Hollywood as a myth, a dark power, or whatever, why not?This Jason Bourne is in fact one of the worst films of 2016 with childish screenplay, storyline, scenarios, plots and casting. But the worst of the worst should be the directing. What a moron! So hacking into the most capable, most mysterious, most security-minded CIA computer system is so easy, and once you hack into it, all of what the CIA doing would be neatly line up with easy to read File Names, and just scroll down of the lists, you'd so easily find there is a File Name so obvious titled as "Black Ops". Jesus, if CIA is such a naive and stupid organization, they would filed those ultra secret Ops and titled it as "Black", then this so-called CIA is just a big laugh, a complete joke, isn't it? It seems that Jason Bourne and Julia Stiles both got some tracking devices were planted on their body or their clothes, their shoes or, even in their blood veins without their knowing, so the CIA could so easily trace them in a foreign country's city streets without any difficulties, a city on riot, and at night. Yeah, right, are you kidding me? What we saw was a out-of-control shaky camera followed them wherever they went. It's like a camera man or so many camera men were tightly followed them wherever they went. Yeah, right, American CIA technique is so out-of-the-world amazing, it could follow the targets on the street level and no matter the turns, the camera lens could be switched from a street level angle to a sudden air view. Give me break.The car and the motorbike chasing scenes and its arrangement are just so laughably unrealistic, that could only be achieved by CGI special effects and the crazy editing. There's no way a car and a motorbike could chase in a foreign city's dark streets, full of rioters at such high speed and random directions. It's so absurd to watch albeit the crazily shaky camera.There's no story, no tangible substance whatsoever in this movie except hollow chases. If I could make one suggestion here, I would like to suggest Tommy Lee Jones doing some plastic cosmetic surgeries on his face, because those wrinkles and loose skin and flesh are just sickening to watch. Yes, keeping your original features are fine, but we are paying money to see you guys, especially your guys' faces all the time on the big screen, but your face simply transformed an action flick into a horror genre! I just felt that you are not a Man in Black, but just one of the monsters you wanted to wipe out.

		<fullReview>I really wanted to see this movie. I was in the mood for two hours of mindless violence and destruction. Unfortunately, I did not get to see much of anything. The camera was shaking so violently most of the time that I could not make out what was going on. The "cinematography" was the absolute worst I have ever seen. I am 63 years old, and have seen a lot of movies. This may be the worst movie ever made.The shaking in this film made YouTube cell phone video look like National Geograhic documentaries. It was way past earthquake or POV car crash cell phone shots. Blurry frames of faces and lights would dance around the screen in an incomprehensible mess non-stop.An example is the first scene where Bourne meets up with his girl at the train station. The CIA has sent their hit men to take out Bourne. Tommy Lee Jones is standing in the CIA control room in Langley directing the agents. There is some kind of civil demonstration going on in the area so I can understand SOME hand held shots being shaky. Not seizure shaky, not two guys on either side of the cameraman pushing him back and forth shaky, not camera on a spring bobble-head shaky, but some shaky. No sir, this baby is shaking. It's shaking real good.IT IS SO BAD THE DIRECTOR HAS THE ACTORS TELL YOU WHAT YOU SHOULD BE SEEING WITH YOUR OWN EYES!TRAIN STATION: Random frames of blurry objects.CIA HQ CONTROL ROOM FILLED WITH VIDEO MONITORS - TOMMY LEE JONES: What's happening?CIA TECH: The agent is down!CIA TLJ: Send another team!TRAIN STATION: Sounds of fighting. Random blurry dark objects dance around the screen.CIA TLJ: What's happening now?You get the idea. Here is the best part. The CIA control room shots are damn near as shaky as the train station! For no reason! WTF! Is someone shooting "Independence Day" in the next building? Has DC been attacked by UFOS? Where is Will Smith?Paradoxically and ironically, camera shots that in real life are normally shaky, were perfectly still! Like POV hand held rangefinder shots, helicopter and drone shots. Go figure. Bizarro world direction.I kept hoping the camera would settle down. It did not. I left.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inferior to previous in the series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***Warning, contains very mild spoilers*** A largely disappointing all-out action film with a so much dire techno-bull**** that it just made me sigh at times.Vikander's character is so utterly unbelievable even in a series where you know have to suspend disbelief long before entering the cinema. Her use of "malware" to plant a trace in the downloaded files was laughable; having that malware signal the thief is on-line, but having to use a phone line to get access to the computer that has broadcast itself to the Internet just to provide suspense, provided a hole big enough for a double decker bus to pass through.Tommy Lee Jones' character was hackneyed and completely failed to draw you in and his fawning assistants and ineffective teams just more of the same you see so often in this type of film it's become boring.The thinly veiled reference to Facebook provided a vaguely interesting plot point and that was about as much thought as you needed for a movie that didn't so much demand you take your brain out before entering the cinema as much as not ever needing a brain the first place.The editing, cutting so quickly in the car chases, was hugely distracting, making you think it was a way to disguise something badly shot. Even the European city hopping didn't have the élan of the first film.A sad addition to what has largely been an entertaining series of films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tired and stale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have always loved the Jason Bourne films. I even enjoyed Bourne Legacy with Rose Byrne and Jeremy Renner. This latest is a pointless film.Firstly, there is nothing interesting happening in this story. Secondly, there is nothing new. The dialog is tired, predictable and stale. I could not believe that Matt at some point during readings didn't stop and say, "wait a minute-anyone could have written this. It's weak!". And he would have been right to stop it.We all sat there just shaking our heads and several people just got up and walked out of the theater. It's that dull. There is nothing exciting about close up, fast editing on action if you can't follow it and if it doesn't really mean anything.Basically they said, "let's give them what we gave them last time because that's what everyone wants" and with that, they wrapped it up and put it in the can. Completely tiresome and worthless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>* Although this is marked as spoilers I have tried to keep any movie info very vague *I am a slightly obsessive Bourne fan. I have probably watched Identity, Supremacy and Ultimatum more than 10 times each over the years, and the void left since 2007 lead me to read the books, first by Ludlum then by Lustbader. I'm obviously choosing to ignore Legacy.Although the plots are actually quite different, the books make you realise why we all loved Identity most of all and why Supremacy and Ultimatum were a good follow up story. Unfortunately this is where version falls down in a major way - the writing. In particular the depth of the story and Bourne's personal connections were missing leading to a lack of empathy with Damon's character. In a way its ironic that they haven't really learned from Legacy.The books also give you a more engaging picture of Bourne's various struggles, locations that aren't the usual used in most action movies and strengths and weaknesses of his friends and foes.The end of the film leads us to believe there may be more to the Bourne story and I'm sure most Bourne fans out there would like to see something more like the books, a more pensive tense thriller rather than constantly slamming you with over intensive action sequences.I'm hoping that the success of this movie, encourages Ludlum or Lustbader to write another book, which Greengrass and Damon turn into a movie.Unlikely though I fear.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a fan of the original trilogy. They are one of the best action-spy movies of the last 10 years but sadly the new movie in the series isn't nearly as good. I would go as far to say that it was just made in hopes of making quick buck.The script is really bad. Its easy enough to fool but it doesn't really expand the previous movies in the series any way... Jason Bourne has been missing for years, he comes back without a clear reason, does his thing and goes back to where he came... The movie really didn't need to happen at all.The worst thing however is the action scenes and they are plenty. I have NEVER seen so many cuts done in action scenes. Camera easily cuts 3-4 times EVERY SECOND! Add the most shaking camera to that and it is PAIN trying to figure out what is going on in action scenes. This totally ruined the movie for me. It will be the only movie in Bourne franchise that I don't want to see ever again. Save your money until it comes from TV</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wanted very much to like this film. I was a huge fan of the first three, having watched each many times. The fourth was quite good, and I give Jeremy Renner a lot of credit for filling those very large shoes Matt Damon left behind. There was a magic to the first three, that made them some of the best films of their genre, ever made. They flowed, and they were seamless. There was no dead weight, nor any unnecessary scenes. Plus, there were only leaps of faith that were within reason, and within a reasonable degree of plausibility. This film made all of those mistakes, that were not made in the first four. Extra scenes, that did not need to be there. Monstrous leaps of faith, shoddy writing, and some casting missteps. Tommy Lee Jones was cast as a monster. Was his makeup real, or does his face really look like that, at this point? Those close ups, of that face were not something anyone should be subjected to. Vincent Cassal while a very good actor, did not convince me. The nearly last scene, with the chase through the streets of Las Vegas was not only completely over the top, it was unrealistic, implausible, and silly. It might appeal to a 12 year old, but as a mature, adult film lover, it just about caused me to walk out. I was debating with myself the entire scene, whether or not I should leave the theater. I still think Damon has what it takes. But, he was not given anything to work with here. And the director may have lost his touch. This movie really missed the mark.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We've seen 3 decent movies about Bourne running from the CIA. It's really a shame that they still haven't caught him despite having all the CCTV cameras in the world at their command. The movie follows a template that seems to have stuck in the directors minds. The cameraman was probably m*sturb*ting while filming as the shots are not steady and the visuals are in your face. I went in with the expectation to see Matt Damon &amp; Julia Stiles return to the franchise and give us something good, but the film fails on several levels. I ended up sleeping through the last 10 minutes. I'd never watch another Bourne movie ever again. There's nothing the movie that you wouldn't have seen in other Bourne movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So... I haven't seen a Bourne-film since two. But I decided to see if I was missing out on something, after 30 minutes in I got several flashbacks to why I stopped following this series.In this mishmash there is shaky-cam to simulate gritty action (however, it makes the movie look like a five year old with parkinsons was in charge of the cinematography). Close ups so close that I can count the blackheads on Tommy Lee Jones' face, 46. The direction is, nicely put, cluttered; another black-ops to uncover (is not uncovered?), Jason's father's murderer tries to kill Jason (killer is killed), and some hypocritical side thing about a social media mogul not wanting to play ball by selling the information about his users to the CIA, but that can't happen to the CIA, especially not for free! But in all seriousness, if you like the Bourne series by all means this is probably the movie for you. I just don't see the action for all the close ups, makes the whole point of an action film to fail if you ask me, so does the shaky-cam. Also, the script seems to be lost within itself and leads it back to square one, progress...Enjoy it, hardcore fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dizziness inducing boring underwritten flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all I want to clarify that Matt Damon and his friend Ben Affleck are in my opinion the smartest actors of this generation. They avoid Hollywood gossip and always try to make smart or at least deeper movies, even if sometimes they commercially fail. However the Bourne franchise as directed by Greengrass was never my cup of tea. Greengrass style produce me motion sickness; but besides that there is completely lack of humor and after the first three movies; there is no much memory to recover. James Bond on the contrary; was always filled with jokes (sometimes cynicism perhaps) and more open story lines. This four installment (with Damon) is by far the worst of the pack; the action scenes are too long and never produce any kind of emotions. The car persecution in Vegas it is almost too close to the cars so the spectacular stunts get diminished.The full movie it is basically a brief start, four long persecutions (Greece, Berlin, London and Vegas) and an epilogue. Damon barely talks on the movie and does not kill anybody; Cassel as the villain, kills everybody and has far more dialog lines than Bourne. Tommy Lee Jones just uses a little charisma and gets the job done without any effort. Viklander however has the most important character; but somehow her motivations do not add up. In fact most of the things she is related seem forced.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Bourne B-Movie, Bad Casting, Huge Plot Holes, Lazy Writing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd give this a 5.5 because a 6 feels a bit too high and 5 a bit too low, having a 5 be the "average, so-so" film. Why?1. Alicia Vikander is terribly miscast. Talented actress who was clearly more focused on trying to sound like an American than on actually giving a performance that showed a pulse. Having her take the role as second in command in the Bourne hunt (and Bourne sympathizer) was a very bad decision based solely on "who's the hottest new female star?"2. The script thinks we're all stupid. So Jason Bourne is the most wanted man.... everywhere. Facial recognition dominates searches. Yet he walks out in plain site without any disguise and even just waltzes right into any country without any disguises whatsoever. In fact, he can even use his own name if he feels and he'll just get through because... Jason knows the script will find a way to make it work.3. I won't give away the ending but it was insulting. Throughout the movie the writing is so lazy that the average precautions most take are simply not taken or nonsense is uttered so things can happen. We'll just find the IP address of whatever so we can do whatever because the plot must march on. The greatest hackers in the world will obviously not take precautions such as, oh, I don't know, like firewalls or any other protocols to prevent discovery. Perhaps even having tinted windows, a working set of window blinds.4. Contradicts itself everywhere. The movie opens "I remember everything." Uhhh.... no you don't. Because if you did, half the movie you spend piecing things you don't remember wouldn't be an issue. So the con is on right from the opening credits.This is a dumb movie. If you can totally check in your brain at the door you can be entertained. But make no mistake for a good movie - this is not one of them. Unlike the other Bourne films this one is not rewatchable and you'll forget all about the moment you're out the theater doors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exciting finale, but overall a big let down.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The announcement that Paul Greengrass ? director of Bourne entries Supremacy and Ultimatum ? was returning to the franchise, and he was bringing original star Matt Damon back with him, was justifiably met with huge enthusiasm. But with great power comes great responsibility: a duty to the fans to deliver a series-regenerating instalment that puts the Jeremy Renner-led Bourne Legacy far into the review mirror. Unfortunately this operates on a level closer to Legacy than any of the other entries. The fundamental issue is a screenplay that relies on weak narrative threads and surprisingly big plot contrivances, which is massively out of character for an action series that has built its reputation around being smarter than the average bear. With only a couple dozen lines of dialogue, Damon's eponymous ex-CIA operative is overwhelmingly gruff and grizzled too, offering an emotionally destroyed protagonist who seems to possess more brute physicality and less finesse than in the past. The ordinary script doesn't hinder Greengrass' ability to execute a couple of solid action sequences, the climactic 3-part set piece in particular offering a tense cat-and-mouse assassination attempt followed by a destruction derby style car chase followed by a bone-crunching fist fight. The propulsive final act goes a long way in salvaging a film that is disappointingly plodding and unoriginal up to that point, however there's no hiding the fact Jason Bourne is a monumental let down.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Artificial Plot, Unnecessary Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a fan of the trilogy I was expecting it to be a great sequel. The movie started off with an unsatisfying and illogical premise. It could not tie up the story properly the past and did not move towards a solid future either. The plot felt extremely artificial and conjured up. Director Paul Greengrass brought the same quintessential Bourne tension to the film, and I must say the direction and screenplay was amazing. Shout-out to a new character called Heather Lee, played by Alicia Vikander, who was (for me) the highlight of the movie. Her performance was brilliant.At many moments I was really enjoying the film. (In another review a person mentions that the same Bourne formula was used, that we love). But what lacked here was a proper story, and for me that is the most important aspect of the Bourne Series.What bothers me most is that if they did decide to pick up Bourne again, they could have decided to be a little slow in building a more proper narrative (as they had in Identity), but they decided to rush everything without going into any profound detail. So the film does not seem necessary to the Bourne trilogy. There is obviously new information used to bring back Bourne, but it was highly unsatisfying and underdeveloped as a storyline.Undoubtedly this is the most forgettable movie from the four films and as a fan I'm extremely disappointed. Justice has not been done to Jason Bourne.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First 3 Bourne's were simply amazing action movies. The action,the direction,the acting,the story being about Jason Bourne that we care about were all very well done. This movie does the exact opposite.There are 2 major plot lines. The first half of the movie is about Nicky Parsons played terribly by Julia Stiles hacking into CIA's network to get information about the secret ops CIA has been doing. Discovers something about Jason Bourne's past involving his father and suddenly CIA thinks Bourne is involved. Bourne meets with this girl and of course like all Bourne movies CIA is tracking them down giving orders to men in a computer room. There is a long chase scene which would have been cool if it wasn't ruined by the terrible editing and shaky cam. The girl is shot by an assassin who has a past with Bourne and takes the matter personally. After this point the movie falls apart so quickly that you will ask yourself why they involved this plot line in the movie at the first place.The second half and the terrible half of the movie involves a social media plot line which i will not spoil on this review but OH MY GOD WHY. The second half is not about Bourne and adds NOTHING to the story and viewing experience by any means. The story should have been about BOURNE the movie is named JASON BOURNE but it actually is about the social media half i talked about which is written really bad and bores you to death.If you haven't seen the first 3 Bourne movies just don't go out and see this one. Just go and purchase those 3 and enjoy really good action. If you are a Bourne fanboy just get ready to get disappointed.</fullReview>

A typical Hollywood movie decorated with top tier actors and full of action. But there were no story at all. Very long and in a way boring action scenes, lots of fighting, car chases, car and bike chases, and a relentlessly shaking camera for which I guess the director wanted us to get more engaged with the action. But he fails. Instead of getting in to the story you want the movie to end and get some fresh air. Also the story is not convincing. What are the motives behind the evil manners of a CIA director. Why the beautiful CIA technology director lady suddenly becomes a Bourne fan and kills CIA director where there is almost no reason. Why the blonde hacker dedicated her life to steal Black Ops files and why did she bring those to Bourne. And Bourne must be some stupid. He is running from CIA but he resides in the capital of Greece and instead of covering his identity he fights in front of big crowds. I think he has hidden intentions to be a Youtube star. Greegrass has to learn a lot from C. Nolan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I cannot believe the reviews that people are giving to this movie right now. From the bottom of my very good soul, I think this movie stands very close to level of sh*tness that of Bourne Legacy. There was literally nothing new from this movie, everything just seemed to be recycled from the Bourne trilogy. It was quite pathetic to see the plot structure almost being identical to the three Bourne movies, except that this one just seemed to be a nutshell video of Bourne trilogy. Everything was just so obvious right from the beginning. From the very introduction of the new characters such as Tommy Lee Jones and Alicia Vikander, I knew what type of character roles they were playing. I also knew who's gonna get killed, who's gonna save who. Anyone who watched the Bourne trilogy, basically knows what's gonna happen in the first 10 minutes of the fu*king movie. There was no sense of tension, there was no display of Bourne's awesome CIA agent skills, the so called villain in this movie just stood around and watch the monitors of the CIA surveillance cameras. The movie runners just got the brilliant idea of getting yet another black ops project, and they didn't even do that correctly. The movie tries to take Bourne's past a big deal, whilst putting in Bourne's father creating Treadstone operations and some other sh*t. If you're a huge fan of the Bourne Franchise, or even if you're just a fan, do not watch this movie. It's gonna let you down and it's gonna get kill you from inside out. If you're just watching this film for sh*ts and giggles, go ahead, knock yourself out.Final Verdict: 7.1/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jason Bourne - review: Jason Bored</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, I love the Bourne franchise. I've seen all of the Bourne movies, including Legacy, and I like them all. In order ranking, The Bourne Ultimatum is my favorite, The Bourne Supremacy is great, The Bourne Identity is good, and The Bourne Legacy is okay.When I first saw the trailer for this new movie, I was immediately super pumped. After becoming extremely hyped for this movie, I sat down, I re- watched the entire Bourne Franchise, and I had a blast doing it; watching every movie pretty much back to back (expect Legacy, I watched that first and then I went in order), I became super thrilled, and my anticipation had went through the roof.When the new movie came out, I heard pretty mixed reviews; A lot of people were saying it was okay or it sucked depending on were you stood with the franchise as a whole. Me being a fan of this franchise, the reviews devastated me, and so I decided to stay away because I didn't want to waste my money. One day, I said, screw it, and so I decided to see for myself.Jason Bourne is a complete letdown. The movie is boring, the fight scenes are boring (except at the end), the action is boring (expect at the end), the actors are boring, the dialog is boring, and the characters are dull and boring. I sat down for two hours and I watched this pile of garbage, what the hell were Matt Damon and Paul Greengrass doing! As I endured this big mess, I felt like none of the actors gave a sh*t about anything. Matt Damon just walked around looking serious and mad, Tommy Lee Jones was the best in this movie because he's just doing what he does best (pretty lazy, but it's Tommy lee), Alicia Vikander was trying to hard with her accent and it felt fake to me, and every other character was just as plain and boring as everyone else.The fight scenes in the beginning are hard to follow, Greengrass shakes the camera to damn much, I know its apart of the franchise, but the shaky cam was done better in the previous movies, and I hated having to squint my eyes just so I could see what was happening in this movie. The only fight scene I gravitated towards was at the end, it was hard hitting, white knuckled, intense, the fight choreography was exceptional, and the camera didn't shake as much.I thought the reason why Borune was brought back made sense, but the way it was executed just seemed tired and lazy, it should've been more compelling, heart wrenching even, but I felt like the story was just casually going through the motions with no real effort, so ultimately I felt disappointed, and so after awhile I just didn't care anymore.The action scenes are completely forgettable, there's no tension, and I didn't feel worried for anybody's safety (not even Bourne). The action moved at a constantly fast pace, but they felt slow because the scenes within themselves felt hollow. The last action scene was great, but when I thought about it, it really didn't make any logical sense.The movie was predictable, it tried to surprise the audience, but I felt like it was trying way to hard to be clever.Overall, Jason Bourne is a boring movie. I love all of the previous movies including Legacy, but this new one is a mess, and dare I say that The Bourne Legacy is more exciting than this new Jason Bourne pile of hot garbage. You bastards should've brought Tony Gilroy back, I heard he was hard to work with, but at least he knew what he was doing, and yes Legacy is better than Jason Bourne (I said it).Final Grade: F</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This issue of the saga of Bourne, is a clear example of that in a film production all parties have their importance. Specifically, the script for this last delivery fails badly. I think the project was born with the added difficulty of giving a little more than the previous chapter, thus the requirement of a careful script was very very high. The result has disappointed me a lot. The way to involve the character of Bourne, the predictability of the scenes, the dialogues ... everything fails to varying degrees. And the paradox is that in the previous chapters these aspects were nicely crafted. I even think that the work of management, the performance of the actors is affected by the bad fit of the script.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Matt Damon is the only saving grace</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have just come out of the multiplex after watching JASON BOURNE and I do not know how to sum up my feelings for this film. I understand that the Bourne franchise is a huge one and it has spawned a number of successful films. Unfortunately, for me, I am not at all familiar with Jason Bourne. Neither have I read the Bourne novels by Robert Ludlum, nor have I seen any of the films starring Matt Damon as Bourne. There is only one Bourne film that I saw in parts. That one which had the opening sequences shot in Goa. And I saw that film only because it co-starred Franka Potente, an actor I like; and it really disappointed me to see her bumped off in that film, so I switched off the TV the moment Franka Potente's character dies right at the beginning of that film. (Please also read my review of The Conjuring 2 to know how disappointed I am to see Franka Potente star in films that do not have anything substantial for her to do.)I think it would be wrong for me to say that I would not see a film just because a character played by a favourite actor dies in it. Fact is, I couldn't follow that Bourne film. Worst - for the Bourne franchise, of course - I cannot even remember the name of that Bourne film in which Franka Potente's character dies.Let me get this straight. Jason Bourne is not James Bond, nor is he even Ethan Hunt. I know die-hard Jason Bourne fans would kill me after reading this, but somehow this brooding spy/hero just does not catch my fancy at all. Had it been some other actor playing Jason Bourne, I wouldn't have gone to see even this new Bourne film. But it is different with Matt Damon, another actor I like, so I went to see JASON BOURNE. Man! Was I disappointed! I think I might like (or appreciate) Bourne films if I see the first Bourne films, films that made the Bourne series the power it is. But here I am talking about JASON BOURNE and I found it a complete waste of time. To start with, Julia Stiles, another actor I like (I loved her - and everyone of her posh girl gang - in Mona Lisa Smile), is bumped off. Next, the plot devices are nothing new. I must have seen the tropes displayed in JASON BOURNE in several other spy/thriller films. In the end, the only saving grace is Matt Damon. And, to some extent, Alicia Vikander. And why do I think that Alicia Vikander looks like the next Emily Blunt?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Bourne films have always suffered from director Greengrass' inability to shoot a coherent action sequence, but in Jason Bourne (2016)the problem increases tenfold.All of the action is almost unwatchable, and literally impossible to follow,in fact even scenes of dialogue only- and there are LOTS of long scenes of dialogue- are spoiled by the directors insistence on randomly zooming in and out of the film.Even more than this, Jason Bourne (the film) suffers because Jason Bourne ( the character) has completed his story.The Bourne Ultimatum concluded the Bourne trilogy very satisfyingly.This film just seems like a petulant insult to Tony Gilroy ( Greengrass and Gilroy famously don't get on), or a cynical cash grab. Probably both.Everything in this feels like deja vu: you've seen it all before in other Bourne films.Alicia Vikander is the stand out acting wise. Damon does his usual schtick. Vincent Cassel does nothing and Julia Stiles embarrasses herself.Wait for it on TV</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>blew right off the believability cliff *rolls eyes*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This certainly checked all the Bourne Movie boxes. The action and flavor were the same yet some of it came off as a stale retread. It may have a lot to do with the rather basic and shallow storyline. There was tension at times and probably the best car chase scene in any movie in years. Yet, they took it to the edge and then flat out blew right off the believability cliff. Not since the ending to "Con Air" has the Las Vegas strip been used for such an over-the-top finale. I mean, it's almost the exact same insanity. The entire film itself felt like a rough running engine. When it was humming, it was intense and vintage Bourne smooth. When it slowed down, it sputtered all over the place.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A well made product with no added value</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It felt formulated. Efficient and rhythmic as always for a Bourne movie, but not challenging in any way, and not adding anything to the Bourne story. At the movie's convenience, there is 100% surveillance some of the time, while other scenes have none. I mean, if there's always a watchful eye, it should be consistent. Not a bad word about the personal although Tommy Lee Jones is on 2nd gear, at most. A key scene when the "asset" is chasing Bourne while killing 4 team members is supposed to be full of suspense, but it is all known in advance. Just one example of a plot line that is repetitive at times, and as said, doesn't get you anywhere. All this not say it wasn't fun to watch. And surely there will be more from this production line- I might wait for the home version on the next one. But of course, my buddy will need a fresh excuse to take a night off from the wife and kids.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story of this movie I enjoyed, it incorporates things of the old films in the franchise but also offers something fresh. The acting as you would expect is solid and of the highest quality. Although I enjoyed the story many friends did not, people are comparing this with others of the franchise and not as it's own movie and as part of the franchise which is easily the best spy genre ever it is probably the worst movie out of them all, however as a action movie it has a lot of aspects that excellent the movie beyond mosthe out there, I look forward to the next movie due to the ending leaving a great story into the next movie</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Proof that sometimes things don't add up to the sum of their parts... potential minor spoilers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems that even with all the ingredients of a classic Bourne film, Jason Bourne just doesn't add up to the sum of it's parts. Symptomatic of a weak story, and lack of compelling character motivations that are disjointed and poorly explored leaving the audience to question as to "wait... what?" and for me the cameraman so shaky, you start to worry that he's developed Parkinson's instead of wondering if Matt Damon can look any broodier as he walks in and out of buildings for no particular reason other than for us to listen to some tense Bourne style music. Some good set pieces of action, and yes Matt Damon is still Jason Bourne, or David Webb (for the movies). Still very little source material used to develop his character though... It's been 12 years people. Sadly the only real reference to 12 years came in the 12A rating, that made me feel like we missed out on a whole heap of what made the first three films so compelling and exciting, as the camera frantically tried to avoid showing any real detail of the fight scenes by shaking so violently that we miss everything going on, until the last big fight, that was actually just a glorified boxing match, and why were they fighting again? Oh yeah I remember (I think). Bourne was presented as a blunt instrument, more like a battering ram than a highly skilled, multi-lingual master of deception, disguise, and martial arts. Nothing new offered or explored apart from a figure from his past, that seemed like nothing more than a convenient catalyst for this movie to pin it's plot to, while also missing every opportunity to engage the audience with the characters they know and love. Has it put me off paying to see more Jason Bourne (with Matt Damon) certainly not... are they treading on thin ice... I think so.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The worst of the series by far</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Quick cuts! Shaky cam! Extreme close ups! If you love those three things, than you'll for sure love "Jason Bourne," because every single scene in the film features all of those things, and not only is it irritating, but it's also distracting and ruins the immersion and entertainment value of the film. The fight scenes are incomprehensible because of how much the camera shakes during them. I mean, for God's sake, it's like the cameraman was having a seizure in the middle of filming, and not just during the action scenes, but during every single scene in this film. Someone checks a text message? I hope you weren't planning on actually reading it because you better believe that the camera is going to be swinging in every single direction known to man. Bourne gets in a fight with a trained assassin with years of experience? Oh, you actually wanted to watch these two men fight each other? Apparently Paul Greengrass doesn't want you to, because instead of seeing great, clear, concise, and brutal fight choreography, you'll be watching a flurry of split second cuts of close up fists, elbows, and faces, and you'll realize that someone is getting hurt because of the sound effects, but you just won't know who or how until a body drops to the ground. Then all you'll know is that Bourne is the winner, but is that any surprise? Oliver Megaton films more coherent action sequences, and that's saying something.There's also one scene where the camera zooms in on Bourne's face for no reason, and it was so out of left field that I almost laughed. During another scene, a woman is talking and the camera zooms in so much that the top and bottom of her head are out of the frame. Why does this happen? It's not a pleasing or attractive choice. This isn't "Inland Empire," but it seems like Paul Greengrass wanted to add a little bit of David Lynchian uncomfortableness to his film, in the form of close ups that are so close I wanted to move to the very back of the theatre to escape the feeling that I was invading the personal space of the actors. I get that shaky cam and close ups can sometimes enhance the intensity of a film, but come one, is it really necessary to have these things in literally every single scene? The answer is no.The story is also very generic, and nothing we haven't seen before. I will not spoil anything, but just know that this movie feels like every other Bourne movie, just less interesting, less intense, less exciting, less mysterious, and less entertaining. Another thing that annoyed me was that Bourne feels like a superhero in this movie. In all the other films there was a sense of danger because Bourne would get hurt, and get hurt badly. In this movie, Bourne feels like God. He knocks out people with one punch. He walks off bullet wounds to the stomach. He's no longer afraid of getting hurt or of death, which I guess is understandable as he's been doing the same thing for years, but it still wasn't entertaining to watch a practically invincible hero.There was a car chase through Las Vegas that was fun to watch, and there was one moment that just screamed "Bourne," but other than that, "Jason Bourne" is just plain boring. Matt Damon even looked bored! The story is generic, the sense of excitement and suspense is gone, and the action is incomprehensible and bland. (Where was the classic Bourne improvisation during the fighting? Not here.) With all that said, I do hope that another Jason Bourne movie will be made in the future, because nothing, not even a bad movie, will take my love of this franchise away.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved the film, but in the last half of the show, I didn't know if I was suffering from vertigo combined with panic attack as I literally felt very nauseous that I had to go to the washroom three times just to vomit!!! Then, as my friends and I were on our way home, I asked my friend to pull over so I could throw up one more time. I still wasn't felt relieved because as soon as I was entering my house, I rushed to the bathroom once again and vomited twice. I didn't eat anything bad at all. It was all about the stupid camera movement that made me feel so much nauseous. Then I found out that it wasn't only me who suffered from nausea and vomiting while watching this movie.

		<shortDescription>DIsappointing at best (Spoilers ahead!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jason Bourne is back! A decade after swimming away into the abyss of the east river in Manhattan, the title character is pulled out of hiding to find out more about his initiation to Operation Treadstone and take down whatever suit may stand in his way. As a fan of the original trilogy I wanted to like this movie. Knowing that Matt Damon passed on the forgettable "Bourne Legacy", I approached this film hopeful that I would at least have an entertaining 2 hours of action. I left the theater with the familiar sense of disappointment and disenchantment with the series as a whole. The script had the depth of a paddling pool and the major plot points recycled from prior films. Even some action sequences felt distinctly familiar (jumping across rooftops in hot pursuit of a target, T-boning a car during the inevitable car chase). There were many things that set this installment apart from the others (in a bad way) which I shall dial down in the interest of time. - It seems as if the character of Jason Bourne has missed many lessons in Hollywood's school for spies. Mistakes that elicited sighs of dismay from my fellow moviegoers include: standing in plain view of windows, using the same tactics to meet contacts (just choose the most populated place in the city, they'll never find us there...), using a laptop connected to a network to review classified information. Though I will say in his defense he did finally wear a baseball cap to delay the usual 5 minuted identification once entering a building. Way to go. - The antics of the CIA have reached the James Bond (Brosnan era) level of outrageous. Here we are presented with one dimensional villains with access to every computer, camera and cell phone combined with an unlimited amount of minions at their beck and call. Also having the CIA as the main antagonist with an unnamed assassin as the accomplice??? I liked that plot better in the previous films. - Having the head of a Facebook-esque platform host a recruitment panel with a director of the CIA while simultaneously facing privacy concerns is laughable at best. And how many times did they really have to saw Snowden? - Alicia Vikander was egregiously miscast in this role. Ignoring the fact that she was in middle school during the events of the first movie, the actress had no chemistry with any of her co-stars and presented her lines completely devoid of any emotion. Maybe she thought this was Ex-Machina 2? Watching her walk around holding a brief case, wearing a poorly fit suit, and giving her best "serious agent" facial expression almost convinced me that I was watching an advertisement for take your daughter to work day instead of a major movie. She looked completely out of place. To go from Joan Allen (who had her faults but held her own) to this character was a huge step down. This also left the audience without a strong female lead. - Which brings me to the most infuriating aspect of this movie--&gt; the complete waste of Julia Stiles' character. After spending 3 movies developing this character, you have a potential lead that the audience trusts and have emotionally invested in. There was also a missed opportunity to see how the past 10 years have changed her (it was nice seeing her go from the chick who sobbed uncontrollably the first time Bourne confronted her to now knocking out guys in the depths of an Islandic hacker den). And again, killing off a known female character within the first 30 minutes? How very 2004 of you. I'll give this movie 4 stars for quality action sequences, hand-on-hand combat and Matt Damon doing the best he can with this material. With a 60 million dollar opening there will no doubt be another installment (the screenwriters smartly included that in the conclusion of this movie). Lets try a little harder to go back to the roots of the Bourne Saga. After all, when it comes to action movies, entertainment and rational thought are not mutually exclusive.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nostalgic but sloppy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been a massive Bourne fan for years, I regularly re watch the trilogy and I mastered the xbox game (so you can take me seriously). I was uber excited when I heard Damon was back, but also slightly worried. To me, the Bourne Ultimatum ended on such a wonderful, exhilarating note. It truthfully didn't feel Bourne needed to be reprised.So my point is, I really, really, wanted to like this film however it felt like the writers attempted to carve out another narrative from the old one, which came off rather forceful at times. There's a repetitive formula in play which is rather nostalgic, however it's essentially copying the old films. There are new characters as well who are apparently connected to Bournes past but because they haven't been seen or mentioned until now, their involvement feels like the writers effort to create drama for the sake of it. This can be alienating, because I couldn't help but ask myself why re-make another when the past has been solved? The new Pamela Landy is also miscast for me, she's too young and her character was very predictable. There was nothing refreshing or new about this installment.Definitely worth a look though, just to see Damon being chased again and to hear Moby blaring out the cinema. However, for the good of the series I'm not going to consider this as part of the trilogy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A thing that they have done in relationship to this particular movie franchise is they have played the other three films on TV over and over and over-to the point of the ridiculous. This is a good film-a very good film in fact-as are the other ones-but like some good rock songs-over exposure will definitely ruin the products appeal. Many people have been critical of this installment-making fun of it-but its really an above average film. There is a plausible plot line- containing timely concepts which were handled not clumsily but with finesse by the script writers and the cast alike. If I had been working on this movie I would have reason to feel proud of its overall effect. The only thing that isn't particularly good about this movie is the fact there were only three people at the movie, at the screening that I saw. In a well populated area. In a cinema that could seat hundreds of people. A good film in good air conditioning on a miserable hot summers day is not a combination most people would disregard. Cinema is still happening but where is the audience? Support your local cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good but not Great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So finally the new Bourne movie has released. And guess what? I really liked it, yes its not as good as the first three Matt Damon Bourne movies, but this installment is still solid, action packed and worth your time. Plot:Wont spoil much here, Nicky hacks the CIA files and finds info regarding treadstone and what is has to do with Bourne's father. And after that we are taken on a roller-coaster ride. I found the social media plot to be quite compelling and did not bother me much as others say so. Pros: The action on this movie is mind blowing, from the motor cycle chase in Athens all the way to the final fist fight in Vegas. And the car chase is mind-blowing, let me be honest. its far from being realistic, but the way its shot,simply amazing. Acting: Everyone is great. Plot: Though people say that Nicky's death is just a copy of Marie, i really did not mind it. Other wise the film had a strong plot, and though some scenes are so similar to Ultimatum, i still enjoyed them. Cons: Character development: Though we all know that Bourne already knows a lot about himself, they should have added more depth to his character. When Nicky dies it is a very hard hitting moment in the film when its shown but after that i felt that its emotional impact was no more there, Bourne should have at least mourned the death of Nicky, but the movie straight away cuts to the next scene.Same with the information about Bourne's father. They should have added more and it would have been more emotionally compelling. Such as how he's father death affected Bourne in the past and the present.The story of the asset being captured and tortured should have been explored more, and then we really know why the asset hates Bourne, but Dewey says that he was captured, that was really lazy in my opinion.Overall: Jason Bourne is a really good movie, though its much much better than The Bourne Legacy. it doesn't really capture what made the fist three Bourne movies so great. But nevertheless a great time at the cinema and the car chase alone is worth the price of your ticket. Jason Bourne is one of those few movies that would have been better if it was longer.

		<fullReview>I don't see how anyone who enjoyed the first three Bourne movies could be disappointed with "Jason Bourne" It is as good as the first three, maybe better. Alicia Vikander is a great addition, playing ambitious CIA operative Heather Lee. The new Bourne takes Jason's story further into his CIA history, and the fight scenes, car chases and overall action along the way is incredible. It is evident that the original director is back--yes the camera and filming is shaky and off-kilter but this is Bourne, you have to expect that. Tommy Lee Jones does well as the CIA director--yes, he seems to play the same character in all his movies but it works perfectly in this movie. The soundtrack is first-rate. Overall, highly recommended for Bourne fans.</fullReview>

We see how a man with conscience reacts to this evil environment. It is the extreme ways. The truth about what is projected in the TV media gets exposed. The obscurantists are shown a mirror. They see a taste of their medicine. We see a younger generation. The pace is heart-thumping. You will love it. The twists are an eye-opener. The movie highlights that everything is not the way it seems. There are many players wanting to make money at everyone's expense. They are the ones really responsible for the trouble. The deception through spies is exposed. The illegal and criminal activities committed by agencies is wrecking it all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jason Bored</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I honestly wished I expected more from Jason Bourne. To be quite frank, the Bourne franchise is probably the least need of a rebootquel, since every other action franchise clearly aspires to it now. And by watching this latest re-team with Paul Greengrass and Matt Damon, I'm probably even less convinced. See, the original Bourne's were great because they were great at their time and standards, and watching this latest installment constantly reminding me of that makes it look more blatantly dated than it ever was. While by no means Bourne Legacy level bad, this movie is just an airless action movie made less boring solely by the virtue of Greengrass being so passionate of this reunion to a huge fault.For those living under a rock and has never seen a Jason Bourne movie before, well? neither did I, so don't sweat it. But for what I can gather after a week of catching up, the Bourne franchise widely regards itself as a "thinking man's" action movie both in design and theme, as the series blends intricate, real-life spy thrillers with ass-kicking action movies. The movie revolves around Matt Damon as Jason Bourne, a super soldier in an effort to find out his true identity while under constant surveillance by a CIA company Treadstone, who manufactured his crime-fighting powers in the first place. He engages in car chases, hand-to-hand combat, tactile cat-and-mouse scenarios, more car chases, occasional and unravels twists and turns until in Ultimatum (of course it's the best one. Get over it already) he cracks the biggest component of his identity, thus the whole franchises' subtext in general. After which he fakes his own death and goes into hiding, realizing that all of his efforts aren't worth putting more people in danger.So, of course, being allegedly a reboot, Jason Bourne opts to erase all that completely by dragging Bourne out of hiding in order to resolve some hidden agenda by his father. Yep, the new Bourne movie, out of a franchise that otherwise broke the barrier for storytelling in spy action movies in the last decade, now trots out the ever-so-tired "daddy's research" storyline. In 2016. Matters worse, the girl who got Bourne out of hiding ? Julia Styles, one of the returning cast who somehow looks less game for this series than grumpy face Damon ? gets the duty of also serving extra motivation for the hero as she's assassinated by a new Asset (Vincent Cassel) who, big shock, may or may not be involved in the dad's murder. So once again Bourne goes through yet another cat-and-mouse game, this time against the new company Ironhand run by Tommy Lee Jones and Alicia Vikander, to solve yet another mystery about his past.Outside of that, the movie just retreads the series right down to remaking set piece moments. Bike/car chase: check! Needle in a haystack scenario with a gratuitous police riot: check! Lady Treadstone character teaming up with Bourne who may or may not betray him in the end: check! Bad guys looking at tracking monitors while Bourne kicks ass: check!Even though I adore Paul Greengrass' shaky-cam aesthetic more than anyone, and to be fair the action remains his films highlights by a country mile here, he can't seem to find a better angle of which he could tackle that doesn't sacrifice credibility. Even past the naked box-checking of the structure, the whole setup feels obligatory; There is absolutely no reason why Bourne should get out of hiding and even though the stupid father mystery is the driving force of the story, there's no point for Bourne to care outside of giving extra motivation to beat the bad guys. It's as if Styles should never have died to bring Bourne back in the first place. I'd see anything from Greengrass since he's the one who perfected this series, but this feels like such a weak turn from him.Weak also extends to the film's treatment to its subtext that serves as their lasting weight. Referring back to the "theme" part of the series ? having the Bourne movies stand as an anti-Bush allegory after 9/11 was herculean at the time ? the payoff of the series was that Bourne signed up to be Bourne because he wanted to. He wished to serve his country and be part of an advance organization while risking his identity, only to realize that his new masters were the real bad guys. Not only was that a highly unique twist of its time, it was also a gut-punching deconstruction of post-9/11 soldiers during the Iraq war; "Who is the real enemy" and all that. In Jason Bourne, they try to go further into that twist and it ultimately falls apart, reverting Bourne's motivation into a revenge story because the SAME guy who killed Styles also killed his dad. UGH!!Despite all that, the film is just too stale and behind the times for me to warrant any more hatred. I appreciate Greengrass implementing relevant issues like an otherwise gratuitous subplot with Jones trying to recruit a Snowden-esque hacker and then threatens to kill him if he spills the beans, but the rest of the movie feels so dated. They literally play the exact same old Moby song at the end for crying out loud! For a series that revolutionized the way we think of action spy movies, this is such a wasted effort even when everything else topped its game long before this even happened.Jason Bourne is exactly what I expected: just another bland reboot. If you like the classic Bourne action/spy espionage stuff revised twofold in 2016 then go right ahead, because this is only what this film is concerned with. The action, the performances, and Greengrass' classic action chops remain as big as ever, but everything else stumbles. See it and judge for yourselves, but I wouldn't bother.

I am sorry, he is shot so many times but no really impact. And after more than 2 hours, he just knows a thing about his dad, kills along the road and get helps from inside. Sorry but the story for me is just a 4. No nice dialogue, no surprising chances. For me the movie was boring and a bad action movie. But to be honest this is not particularly my genre. I was hopeful because IMDb rated it above 8.0 but now it is already below 8.0. For me that makes more sense. Lets hope for the future they will focus more on the story than losing budget on shooting, damage-scenes and running around through buildings.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although it is great to see Matt Damon reprising his role as super soldier, Jason Bourne, it's also almost 10 years later, and Damon is not a spry as he was back then. Damon still is convincing, though, a little more bulk and muscle but not possessing the agility of his younger self; and he's not an old man by any means. The biggest flaw in the movie, is the camera work, it is not as frenetically paced as the originals, there are bad angles, no shakiness, the sense of spying on a fast moving event. If you watch any of the originals and compare, you'll see what I mean. Having said all this, it's not all that bad of a movie and I'm glad I saw it, it has a good story with a few more revelations, but unlike the originals, they're not as intricately told and surprises are telegraphed and lose some of their punch. Acting is very good, from Damon, Styles, and Jones, with equally good performances from new characters! But a good movie could have been so much better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Honestly, i would say 8.5 out of 10. The movie was everything that you go in expecting from a Bourne movie. Hot female lead, tough bad guy, less tougher bad guy who controls the main bad guy, epic fighting sequences, car chases, and JASON F**KING BOURNE! I love the movie over all because i went in wanting to see someone get hurt and see Matt Damon be one of those people.. Wasn't disappointed in that regard.. he got a little messed up! The only thing i didn't like was the different angles/ cuts they used in the movie compared to the trailer. The trailer made certain things seem so dramatic and cool, but when it came to the actual movie they shot them in different (and less cool) ways.. Overall though if you want to see a cool Bourne movie with Tommy Jones and with a bit more Bourne backstory.. definitely go watch this movie. Don't listen to all the die hard haters on here, they are mad because their erections didn't stay up the entire 120 minutes :/</fullReview>

It's mostly grunts.Matt Damon's career has always mystified me. I can't say I thought he was above average in any movie. Tommy Lee Jones isn't bad in this movie though I don't think he had a line that was more than 5 words.Then there's Alicia Vikander. She is truly awful. Vincent Cassel is always on his feet running which is good because he looks completely lost in this film. Maybe he was looking for the real script. Surely it couldn't be the one they gave him.This was not one my son's better choices for a movie but at least he didn't put me through Ghost Busters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bourne to thrill</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original three Bourne films are some of the greatest action films I've ever seen and some of my personal favourite movies. The Bourne Ultimatum in particular is up there with Terminator 2 and Aliens in my estimation as one of the greatest action sequels ever made. I honestly had reservations about a fourth Matt Damon Bourne film after the disappointing Jeremy Renner led spin-off and and the fact that the author of the original trilogy hadn't written any further instalments in the Jason Bourne saga. I'm so happy to say that my concerns were completely unfounded.Jason Bourne is an incredibly exhilarating thrill ride from start to finish. The new writers have developed a refreshingly complex and layered story featuring a metaphorically lost Bourne accompanied by a sub-plot about digital privacy that brings a welcome layer of social commentary. New information about Bourne'a past and true identity emerges to bring about a thrilling globetrotting stand-off between Bourne and his creators.Julia Stiles returns to the series with a vengeance in a pivotal and emotional plot-driving role while a new supporting cast-members Alicia Vikander and Tommy Lee Jones deliver excellent performances as Bourne's antagonists. Vikander offers an empowering performance as a strong, driven and intelligent female adversary for Bourne to rival Joan Allen from Supremacy and Ultimatum.What makes this film so outstanding is its flawlessly choreographed action and fight sequences accompanied by John Powell's percussion-heavy score which heightens the expertly directed intense action sequences. Matt Damon shines as Bourne; he is a world- class leading man and action hero with a physicality and determination that elevates the action to the highest level. I'm a huge fan of car chase sequences in film and I'm pleased to say that Jason Bourne features one of the most exhilarating and exciting car chases I've ever witnessed. Paul Greengrass is the master of car chases in cinema - his intimate direction style coupled with the outstanding fast-paced editing and sound design bring about a breathless intensity that can't be matched. I found myself literally holding my breath throughout the whole sequence.Jason Bourne lives up to Ultimatum's incredibly high standard as an brilliantly directed, surprisingly emotional action thriller that I will remember as one of 2016's best movies.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yet another unnecessary sequel to spoil a great trilogy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*Spoilers after first 2nd paragraph*Given how awful the last Bourne film (The Bourne Legacy) was, I can't imagine I was the only one with low expectations going into this 5th Bourne film. The story had ended nicely with Ultimatum and I'm pretty sure most fans were content with leaving it as a trilogy. Unfortunately within the film industry, you don't stop making a series until it starts losing you money so a success such as the Bourne series has to be milked dry. For this film, that includes what I can only describe as the laziest writing I have ever witnessed. I mean they really pulled out every cliché on this one.You can tell that no effort was really put into this storyline whatsoever. In an era of cybercrime and privacy debates, what is a modern spy film without some NSA style cover up going on. Of course we don't get much of an insight into this as it's barely explored despite being regularly mentioned. We also needed some weird revenge twist so lets throw in a guy who was tortured as a result of Bourne's actions in the previous films...oh and wait, let's make Bourne remember that this man killed his father on the orders of a guy who has literally never been mentioned before. Films these days are really below par. I gave this film a 5 only because I think some of the sequences are cool. So if you enjoy weak storyline and character development but some cool action sequences that don't really make a lot of sense then this film will probably suit your viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Good Movie Ruined by its Cinematography</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My wife and I went to see this movie with a couple of friends, having enjoyed the franchise, more or less. I say more or less because the last two Bourne movies were directed by this director, Paul Greengrass. It seems this director employed "shaky-cam" in ever increasing doses on the prior two Bourne movies, making them increasingly less enjoyable.In this installment of the Bourne franchise, Greengrass goes nuts with the shaky-cam. The camera does not stay still even in static shots, as in for instance, someone looking at a computer or cellphone screen, where you have difficulty making out what you are seeing. The shaky-cam in my mind should be like an exclamation point in writing, used sparingly. As it was, the four of us did not enjoy this movie at all because of excessive shaky cam. My wife exited the theater slightly nauseated. Not good. Shaky-cam took what could have been a pretty decent movie and ruined it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bourne Again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Identity, Supremacy, Ultimatium, Legacy and now just Jason Bourne. Matt Damon returns for the 4th time as Jason Bourne, the worlds most forgetful assassin, as he aims to completely finish his mission of gaining answers to his past whist making all those involved in Oporation Treadstone pay for what they have done. Directed for the third time by Paul Greengrass this Bourne film should have been just as good as the original trilogy... Sadly it isn't.This is definitely a Bourne film as it contains all the staples of the series such as; Matt Damon, trains, "assets", train stations, an old white man high up in government who is corrupt, Hand-held camera that is vomit inducing etc. For me this is where the film failed as it doesn't seem to do anything new at all. It's the exact same basic plot as the original trilogy, it contains all the staples of the series and, SPOILER ALERT, Bourne scurries into hiding at the end. If you like the formula of the original trilogy then this won't be an issue for you and you may like the film, but for me I was expecting the fourth Matt Damon Bourne film to find a new way to raise the bar even higher instead of just keeping at the same height.The acting is okay, nothing to really focus on and no one to shine a special spotlight on. The acting is exactly what you would expect in any boardroom spy movie series about government secrets and "assets".Hand-held camera is one of Paul Greengrass' directing trademarks, but never has it been used as poorly than in this film. Hand-held Camera is overused in this film as it often is in Paul Greengrass films, but along with fast cuts and poor framing of some of the films fast pace action sequences, it becomes very confusing to understand what is actually going on. The absolute worst use of this camera movement is by far the point where Alicia Vikander's Heather Lee reads text messages in the films final act. Whoever thought it was a good idea to use shaky hand-held camera for a shot of a text message on a phone that the audience has to read, should be shot.Overall Jason Bourne is a rehash of everything that was in the trilogy but brings absolutely nothing new to the table. The film's relevance is questionable and to me feels solely like a blatant cash grab which it definitely is. Bourne is back and I hope his future is brighter than this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A welcome return to form after its mediocre predecessor. Bourne is back!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jason Bourne continues with the story of the most infamous CIA agent, gone rogue. After a warning from an old friend, Jason Bourne(Matt Damon) comes out of hiding. While on the run, Bourne discovers that there are more black ops programs apart from Treadstone &amp; Blackbriar. Hot on his trail are, CIA Director Robert Dewey(Tommy Lee Jones) &amp; expert hacker, Heather Lee(Alicia Vikander). On the way, Bourne finds out more shocking truths about his mysterious past. Jason Bourne is a mind blowing film. The action set pieces will leave you on the edge of your seat. The climax of the movie (especially the car chase) set in Las Vegas, is the highlight of the film. I love the fact that most of the action scenes were shot practically &amp; barely any CGI was used. The locales are breathtaking, as they are in every Bourne movie. One major flaw in this film, is the completely unnecessary conversion to 3D. Not even a single scene is made better with the 3D. In fact, some scenes are made worse. A note on the performances. Performance-wise, everyone is on point. Matt Damon is spectacular as Jason Bourne. I am so glad, Damon &amp; director Paul Greengrass decided to return for another installment. Everyone was severely disappointed with the Jeremy Renner spin-off, The Bourne Legacy(2012). Damon is in tip-top shape &amp; portrays a number of emotions with very limited dialogues. Tommy Lee Jones is great as CIA Director Robert Dewey. Alicia Vikander is outstanding as Heather Lee. Vikander showcases her dynamic acting range, playing an entirely different role, compared to her Oscar-winning performance in The Danish Girl(2015). Vincent Cassel is good as the Asset. Julia Stiles is brilliant as Nicky Parsons. Riz Ahmed is superb as Aaron Kalloor. Ato Essandoh &amp; Scott Shepherd are impressive as Craig Jeffers &amp; Director NI Edwin Russell. Jason Bourne is a must watch for all fans of The Bourne Trilogy. However, watch the 2D version.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never liked any of the BOURNE movies, mainly because of the shaky camera work. Nothing has changed with this newest BOURNE film. Why more people or reviewers don't comment on this terrible way of filming a movie is beyond me. The plot of this latest BOURNE movie is terrible; even if it was good you wouldn't know it as the camera is always shaking so you can't focus on the story. Do the filmmakers think this kind of photography makes the film more exciting and real? They better watch CNN when the reporters are in the middle of an attack. The camera is rock steady. I blame mostly the director, Paul Greengrass, for the lousy way this movie is filmed. If they do anymore BOURNE pictures they need to get a new director.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ridiculous... at best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all; I absolutely loved the trilogy - even Bourne Legacy was decent. I had even re-watched them in preparation for this.But this movie is absolute garbage. There is no plot except "hey, catch Bourne". Everything related to "hacking" in this movie is just absolutely ludicrous. No, you cannot hack anything by pressing the big green "Break in"-button - this is not something we have not seen before, but the level of absurdity in the "hacking" in this particular movie is just beyond belief. It really ruined the movie for me, being just a little proficient in IT.Moving on. Camera work sucks, Tommy Lee Jones is annoying and doesn't make any sense in his role. Bourne hardly speaks at all. It's basically two hours of car-chases, random melee combat and killing innocent bystanders all interconnected with some Facebook-like social media that the CIA is planning to somehow illegally use for surveillance. They call this the plot, I think. They managed to integrate some of Bournes past (and lack of memory) into the story, but it had nothing to do with ANYTHING.Don't waste your time with this. And Matt - I am disappointed that you agreed to do this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a fan of the Bourne franchise, so looked forward to seeing Matt Damon reprise his role.The theatre was filled with an older audience and I went with two men: one in his thirties and the other in his forties. They both thought it was rubbish. Their comments included "just bad" and "don't let me choose a movie again".My review is less scathing as I did not judge the car chase in Vegas as ludicrous but rather as too long and boring with a bit of absurdity.Honestly all the chases are too long and lacklustre and another fellow theatre goer even declared that JB could've just shot him instead of all that.The acting was - sadly - also not their best work. It felt forced and flaky. As if the older Matt Damon couldn't get himself to believe he is up to the task.Jason Bourne is a good franchise because it is everything we want to be but cannot in the real world. This movie made my life feel exciting.We have seen it all before. Same story. Same chases. Just last time it felt crisper, exciting and entertaining. This time it felt...disappointing.They left the movie open to a sequel but I hope they don't repeat this performance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I believe you can stick to a formula and have a successful movie - IF you execute it correctly. Jason Bourne is 123 minutes of cut scene after cut scene of Jason being chased or chasing someone with little plot. The cut scenes are so quick at times it made me want to close my eyes for a break. It's lack of plot and my closed eyes had me fighting to stay awake. This was the opportunity to give Jason Borne a new purpose and develop the character for future movies. Instead, we get a rehashed version in the vein of the Taken series?boring. We get it, the government is bad and Bourne is out for revenge, blah, blah, blah... He needs a new mission, preferably one he chooses. It will take a huge change in direction to get me back in the theater for another Bourne movie. This one is not even worth waiting to see on the USA network.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although there is near constant action and suspense in Jason Bourne the film has a terrible, meaningless plot, poor character development and seriously lacks substance. There are far too man holes in the plot it resemblance a pound of Swiss cheese. Why would the C.I.A. even care about Bourne after so many years and if he was a threat to begin with why let him fall off the grid. The first film was the best and the third my least favorite. I am also a huge fan of the novels, especially the first book which is far superior to the film so I am a bit biased. If all you want is non-stop action and no plot then this film will satisfy your pallet. Otherwise it will not and go down like a spoonful of castor oil and you will be left with a bad taste in your mouth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has a different taste than the previous Borne Movies. For example, it had the longest car chase I have ever seen except for Fast and furious. The acting was excellent, the script dialogue not the best. Borne most of the time walking from one place to another. And this review is going to comment mainly on the camera work of the scenes. What is it about some movies where the cameraman needs to have the camera shaking or moving from side to side? Is it understood that there are many people who get motion sickness? I had to walk out of the theater to get fresh air!When you are talking to a real person in life, do you naturally move your head from side to side and up and down? It just felt like so many scenes had a rocking camera as though the camera man was drunk? The fight scenes I give 2 stars. I have seen better fight scenes with eh camera completely stationary! My wife doesn't get motion sickness but even she complained about the constant camera work as being "Like being drunk" Really guys! In reality a person is trying to focus on the activity of an event, not make his eye balls roll out of his head!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bourne is back in vintage style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The three original Bourne movies - "Identity" (2002), "Supremacy" (2004) and "Ultimatum" (2007) - became bigger and better with the charismatic Matt Damon in the title role and, for the last two segments, the accomplished British director Paul Greengrass creating a brilliantly frenetic style of shooting. It looked as if the franchise had neatly run its course and those of us who loved the combination of Damon and Greengrass had the pleasure of "Green Zone" (2010). However, Universal studios needed to produce another Bourne movie if they were to retain the rights and offered up "Legacy" (2012) which, despite not having Damon on board, was surprisingly good.Menwhile Damon and Greengrass, who repeatedly said that they would never return to the series, found real-world events involving the likes of Julian Assange and Edward Snowden so compelling that irresistibly they have been drawn back together to give us a fifth film in the franchise (Greengrass also co-wrote the script). And it is vintage Bourne with the same winning ingredients: a variety of urban locations, insistent score, frenzied cutting, visceral action, long chases and a story-line that - while incredible - is disturbingly contemporary. The only reason it does not rate more highly is that essentially we have seen it all before.But there are fewer words from Bourne and there are some new characters who are well-played: CIA Director Robert Dewey (craggy Tommy Lee Jones), Agency specialist Heather Lee (the Swedish actress du jour Alicia Vikander), and "the asset" (French actor Vincent Cassel). And there are some new locations: riot-fuelled Athens (actually shot in Tenerife) and car-smashed Las Vegas. Matt Damon was just 30 when he first took on the role and he is now 45 but I wouldn't be surprised if he (and hopefully Vikander) are back.</fullReview>

Did anyone think Bourne would not make it to the climax so he therefore had to elude such chases?Of course, I was distracted for a good part of the movie wondering if CIA Agent Lee was played by a clone of Natalie Portman. She almost looked like NP but not quite. I thought it was because I had not seen her in a movie in a while. This is not a slam against the actual actress who seemed to be the only one who tried to portray her role without a 100% depiction of characters motivations and anxieties.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bourne Is Full Of Action, But Short On Purpose</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you have seen the other "Bourne" movies, then "Jason Bourne" will have few surprises for you. The hero is still on the outside, not even bothering to look in--until someone from his past looks him up and offers him a chance to make a difference (in the fate of the world). He's not interested, but the CIA is still interested in him.Bourne (Matt Damon) is no longer curious, he's just interested in surviving. The film throws some of the major social issues of the day in his face, but he is cause-neutral. The backstory includes echoes of "A Few Good Men", with Tommy Lee Jones playing the part of the pragmatic defender of all that's right. He's willing to step on the rights of any individual or group that might stand in the way of his "patriotic" duty. And he won't even break stride--as do none of the major actors in this drama. They leave bodies in their wakes without a moment's pause. All of this makes moral issues feel like they've been treated with a grey wash.Still, Bourne's in the right because he fights for his right to exist. Meanwhile, the film addresses the naivete of social media companies who refuse to acknowledge that their technologies can be used for ill (like atomic energy scientists back in the day?).The film offers its obligatory car chases (2) and brutal fistfights (2)--all accomplished with frenetic pace and earthquake-inspired camera work. It is said they wrecked almost 200 cars in the making of the chase scenes.Action seekers should enjoy the film. Just don't expect a story that delves into deeper issues. Bourne, after all, has discovered his identity, but he still doesn't know who he is. Maybe someday he will lay it all on the line for a higher calling, or a political principle, or a woman. Then he might really have something to fight for and we might have something to really cheer about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The perfect action thriller - emotional acting, exciting soundtrack, heart-thumping stunts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What happens when you are impressed by emotional acting, an exciting soundtrack and heart-thumping stunts? You get the perfect action thriller - next installment in the Jason Bourne series. This dramatic action film doesn't contain one single joke and it is not a romance flick either. The characters experience multiple adventures and is a non-stop action-filled film with an exciting scene at least every three minutes, keeping the viewer engaged the whole way through.Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) has taken to boxing matches for money, but everything changes when a friend of his, Nicky Parsons (Julia Stiles) comes to him with a flash drive filled with top-secret CIA information. Jason goes on a dangerous adventure where he loses friends, makes new enemies, finds old ones and more all to uncover his past when he was part of the CIA and what happened to him. This story may sound confusing if the viewer is unfamiliar with previous Bourne stories. Although you can guess what happened in previous events as the film attempts to explain what Matt's character is trying to achieve, if you know who Jason Bourne is and what the series are about, it's easier to follow. The good thing is that you do not need to read every book of the series or watch all the previous films since the flashbacks and conversation mostly explains what happened before.Throughout the film there is a very intense soundtrack that adds tension to the dramatic scenes. However, the soundtrack is always intense, including several scenes which contain dialogue and would be great without any of this intrusive music. The action scenes in this film are wonderful with car chases, jumping off buildings and fights in parking lots. Each action scene is epic and clearly shows a lot of work went in to make it perfect. One major problem with the action scenes is that the cinematography is very shaky and rapid. Although it helps put you "inside" the fight, it makes it very difficult to understand what is going on when it's used extensively. Unfortunately, this is the case here and since this film is compiled of lots of shaky and rapid shots, it makes you feel slightly dizzy. The acting in this film is legendary, with returning cast from the previous Bourne films like Matt Damon and Julie Stiles. There are also many new characters such as Alicia Vikander who plays Heather Lee. Each member of the cast excels in their roles and I give them credit for such believable performances.My favorite scene is one of the first action scenes when James Bourne and Nicky Parsons are trying to escape from Greece. One major problem is that the city is full of protests and riots coupled by the fact that the CIA is right on their tail. An epic motorcycle chase ensues as well as fighting sequences and more. It is exciting with perfect staging and the soundtrack adds a lot of intensity as well. I do not recommend this film for young kids due to the language, violence, gore and more. I recommend it for ages 13 to 18. Younger kids would find it too intense and dramatic. I give it four out of five stars because, although it has minor problems such as dizzy cinematography and a relentless soundtrack, it is an entertaining and epic thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director Paul Greengrass has "spun" this new Bourne movie in a disappointing direction... supposedly to pick up a younger generation of movie viewers who are use to watching immensely substandard videos taken via their iPhones. Why Paul? Why take a successful movie series and destroy it? What I'm talking about is the one second frames, blurry scenes, fake hand held camera shots and the camera moving too quickly across a scene. These new, but useless camera tricks don't make it better action movie, they detract from what actually makes the Bourne series good. Have you forgotten Paul what is good about the Bourne movies? Have you? Let me remind you: Jason Bourne has the ability to get out of any situation. He walks into a room unarmed, is surrounded by two or three men who are armed, and he uses whatever is at his disposal as a weapon. Even mundane things like phone cords and magazines become lethal in his hands. An ordinary house can be made into a bomb in seconds. This is what makes Bourne so fascinating to watch. And when I say "watch" I mean I want to see his every move. I don't want to have blurry scenes where I can't see his hands when he's fighting. I want to see everything he's doing.The only way to watch this movie is to watch it at home on your TV. Why pay the movie price and sit with your eyes closed for 1/4 of the movie because of the "too fast", blurry action.I left the movie theater feeling sick: both from motion sickness and because of the fact I just paid full price and missed a large portion of the movie due to the fact that my eyes were closed. Next time I see Paul Greengrass's name as Director on a movie I will skip the theater, save my money and wait for it to be free to watch on my TV.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a prime example of why a film editor should not have been brought on to write a script as big as a Jason Bourne film. The film's pacing was a bit off, and the dialogue was almost amateur, not to mention rushed. But the biggest problem was probably the plot development, which become more and more predictable throughout the film.On a high note, Matt Damon was as good as ever, and Tommy Lee Jones made for an incredible and intimidating head of the CIA Division. The acting wasn't the problem, although Alicia Vikander's seemed a bit off, which was a huge letdown.The only reason I gave this film a 3 out of 10 is because the other films, especially the Bourne Ultimatum, were so great. I don't know what the studio was thinking when they green-lit the script, but it just goes to show that Hollywood is starting to get lazy and desperate.I'd recommend this film to any action fans or even Jason Bourne fans, but expect to be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although it had lots of actions in some parts, I felt like they did too well of a job making the movie over one hour long. For example they chased Jason Bourne for about 20 minutes and they try to invite Jason Bourne back to the agency. The camera was awful, it kept moving and made me extremely dizzy and I wanted to throw up after. The production quality of the flashbacks reminded me of a high school project I did in the past... and that isn't good. It was extremely cliché when they stole a cop vehicle and no one cared, and then the enemy rolled over cars like they were pudding including heavy trucks. Overall, I would recommend you to sit far in the back because of the extremely loud gun noises and shaky camera.</fullReview>

It's certainly disappointing considering how good the first three Bourne movies were, and even the non-Matt Damon Bourne Legacy is at least slightly better. They haven't found a compelling enough reason to return to the series here, with Bourne discovering a new, unnecessary, uninteresting bit of his past to come and beat people up about. I'd also say the editing is a good step below those first three films, too, with some of the action a bit more confusing. Greegrass perfected the shaky-cam style in parts 2 &amp; 3. You always knew what was going on. Still, the action is compelling here, it's quite suspenseful and the film moves along at a nice pace. I liked the new additions to the series, most notably Alicia Vikander, Riz Ahmed and Vincent Cassell. If they do continue on with the series from here, I will probably still follow it. But I hope they do improve upon this one quite a bit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Action-Packed, but Clichéd, and Unnecessary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jason Bourne, the next entry in the Bourne Franchise is here, but it isn't as good as the original Bourne movies. Matt Damon is back in this entry, and so is director Paul Greengrass (Bourne Supremacy and Ultimatum), which means the style and feel of the original films is there. Jason Bourne is entertaining, but is riddled with clichés, and feels like a somewhat irrelevant entry in the franchise. The problem for this film is that many of the biggest plot points are featured in other modern spy films, and at this point are somewhat overdone.Jason Bourne is action packed and offers fans of the originals more of what they love. The film is action packed, despite that some of the action has too much shaky cam, which is common within in this franchise, but annoying nonetheless. The acting in this film is one of the best parts of this movie, as Damon is great in his return to Bourne, however Alicia Vikander and Tommy Lee Jones are both also great in their roles, conveying complex people very well. The major problem with this film is that it's riddled with clichés.If this film had been made 5 years ago, it would have been timely and groundbreaking, and while it's still timely the subject matter is somewhat worn out. Jason Bourne latches on to the same theme as various other spy films today, which is how much can we infringe upon privacy for security. That isn't to say Hollywood needs to abandon doing films about the ongoing privacy vs security argument that is plaguing our society today, but they need to make it original. If you need an example, Captain America: Winter Soldier was a far more entertaining and well-rounded version of the same film, that came out 2 years ago.Beyond being clichéd and not really offering anything new to the privacy vs security argument, this film feels detached from the other Bourne films. By that I mean that the original 3 Bourne films had an overarching story, and they all felt as though they were necessary for that over arching story, this film isn't part of that story. The story never really feels connected to the original films, and instead feels like an unnecessary cash grab. Above that the film refuses to offer anything new to the franchise, recycling the same cinematography and themes of other films.Jason Bourne is a fairly entertaining action/spy film, and it comes at a time when spy films are all the rage, because the public knows so much about the imperfections of the system. That being said this film piggybacks on other, better, films so as to continue Jason Bourne's storyline. The film is action-packed, well-acted, and loaded, but is also unnecessary, recycled, and frankly lacks a fresh look problem. That being said fans of the original franchise likely will enjoy this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Bourne Ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>JASON BOURNE is a non-stop action-packed adrenaline rush. Just when you thought it couldn't get more hardcore, the film goes there. The best spy action/thriller of the year, and of all the installments in this franchise, hands down this is the best Bourne ever! Part of the strength of JASON BOURNE lies in the fact that the same creative talents returned for this. Director Paul Greengrass is back, his frequent collaborator, scribe Christopher Rouse is back, Matt Damon is back, hell even composer John Powell is back. So it's handled by the same people who truly care about this iconic character and this franchise as a whole; it's handled by the same people who made "The Bourne Supremacy" and "The Bourne Ultimatum" two of some of the best sequels I've ever seen. In JASON BOURNE, Greengrass proves once again that he is able to be the eye of the storm. Many of the action sequences in this film including the long intense opening, are set in the middle of a chaotic crowd. So when everybody's running for their lives, right at the center of it is this manhunt; the agency's pursuing Matt Damon's Jason Bourne, and you get to see Bourne's many creative methods of being elusive in those moments. I applaud for Greengrass for keeping it all grounded in what could be perceived as real, because even innocent bystanders could get killed if they happen to be in the way.I remember news on the web a couple of weeks ago complained that Matt Damon only gets to say about 25 lines or so in this film. Turns out, it's not really a big deal at all, I don't have a problem with it. Hell Ryan Gosling didn't say much either in "Drive." Because fact of the matter is JASON BOURNE doesn't focus too much about what the characters may or may not say. When you deal with intelligence agency and espionage, you're supposed to be reading between the lines, and that's what this film does, it's a smooth operation, who's secretly using who, who's betraying who, everybody knows their roles but nothing is ever what they seem.Of course, I have to talk a bit here about the Vegas car chase. You've gotten a tease of it in the trailer and featurette previously released for this film. The production literally shut down the entire Las Vegas strip just to stage this sequence and I tell ya what, it pays off. Some of my favorite car chase scenes in the history of cinema are "The French Connection," "Bullit," and "Ronin," well,... what JASON BOURNE accomplishes here has officially put itself among my all-time top 10 favorite. Insane doesn't even begin to describe it, it's just one of those things where you have to see it for yourself to believe it. And it's not a Bourne movie without those close corner hand-to-hand combats, so the fight choreography between Matt Damon and co-star Vincent Cassel will satisfy every fan out there. At the end of the day, JASON BOURNE is a revenge movie. Does it open itself to another sequel? I'm not sure, because by this point you would think Bourne already remembers everything and there's no small memory left for him to try to pursue. That said, if Bourne does come back to hunt down some other CIA villain from his forgotten past, I'll be the first in line to purchase the ticket.-- Rama's Screen --</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I had two questions... Neither were answered.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why is Jason Bourne back and why should I still care? I still don't know. This movie not only didn't deliver on plot, the action didn't even work for me either. I kept asking myself why things were happening hoping the movie would explain them to me, but it never did. I called almost every twist, which is something I'm usually pretty bad at. I love the first three Jason Bourne movies (we'll not discuss the fourth one here...), so naturally I was pretty hyped to see this. The ending is bad, the acting was meh, the characters were lame..It was a huge disappointment to say the least. Not really even rental worthy. See it if you want to further your Jason Bourne fandom, but be warned.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm big fan of the Jason Bourne series from 2002 (Identity) to 2004 (Supremacy) to the Ultimatum (2007), but this latest film is clearly one too many. The opponent (Vincent Cassel) is not very scary, the CIA guy out to kill him (Tommy Lee Jones) isn't all that impressive, and the female lead (Alicia Vikander) is not as clever or sweet as Julia Stiles. That doesn't make this a bad film, but it makes it #4 of the list of Jason Bourne films.Putting aside the characters, the car chase isn't all that exciting (compared to the other chases) and the action sequences rely far too much of short cuts. To top it off, the ending is not nearly as good as the ending from the other films.My advice ? put it to bed. It was a good run, but the value of the franchise is cheapened with a film that falls far below the other films in such crucial areas.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At some point there is only enough you can take of different crusty old men doing nefarious things in high places before it starts to become redundant. This movie could just have easily have been a Tom Cruise - or some other action star's movie.There was a serious lack of chemistry between the actors, with the exception of Alicia Vikander/Matt Damon/Julia Stiles.Weathered Tommy Lee Jones gives a lackluster and disinterested performance, often looking like he'd rather be doing something else.Vincent Cassel toned down his usual bad guy act a bit for this role, but he wasn't given much to work with to begin with. And once again - zero chemistry with Matt Damon.Also - glaring plot hole about Joan Allen's character Pamela Landy in the scheme of things.Overall - yes, Matt Damon is back with his resident group of the same old bad guys, yes, he travels to several different countries, and yes, it does have lots of action and shaky camera work but at the end of the day it is a repetitive and completely unnecessary addition to a fantastic franchise that should have ended with Ultimatim.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jason BourneWhen I first saw the Jason Bourne trailer I leaned over and told my friend "Hey I bet you one of the government officials says something like "Holy crap it's Jason Bourne." and a few moments in we get a similar line. Bourne is back and there's a new level of Blackbriar, no wait, Treadstone, no wait something new, that he is the only person equipped to deal with.Writing: subplots are good if they add to the overall story and don't ruin tone. That being said Paul Greengrass strays from his usual writing style. Maybe this is why he wasn't a writer on the previous Bourne films.In terms of direction the film is great. To go from Captain Phillips three years ago and reinvigorating a franchise that is almost a decade old. Kudos Greengrass.Matt Damon seemed slower in this film. Maybe it's intentional to show his aging process. Also Jason seems like he's lost his edge, does he really need someone to tell him that bad guys are coming? Not my Bourne. #notmyBourne Tommy Lee Jones plays CIA Director Robert Dewey who will be this films Ward Abbott, Conklin, Noah Vosen. Stereotypical over confident and manipulative head bad guy who thinks he's doing the right thing by murdering an asset gone rogue.Heather Lee is played by Alicia Vikander who is the new love interest. You might be thinking but wait isn't Julia Stiles in the movie. Yeah, she is. Alicia does an okay job for what was written for her.The score and music editing made this film which is a lot of talk and action flow like a roller-coaster. Build up, build up, silence for the actual action scene.The other bad guy is played by Vincent Cassel who looks evil no matter what film he's in. Seriously watch Black Swan or Ocean's Twelve.Verdict: Not the best Bourne, but not the worst. I'm lookin' at you: Bourne Legacy. Worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I did enjoy the previous Bourne movies with Matt Damon as there was point to the plot with him working out who he was and what had happened. For me the latest installment is a money spinner, little more. The film was dull as there really was very little he has to find out now. "Your Dad may have been more than an analyst"... "ok so, shall we get lunch?" should have been his answer back! Some good action scenes but filmed in a way that you miss most of the hard work people put in to give them impact as the camera all over the place. The whole film actually starts to give you motion sickness.Was a bit bored, bit let down and felt just a Hollywood money spinner. 5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a Bourne fan, I am a Greengrass fan, I am a Damon fan, and I am a Vikander fan.But sadly, now i am disappointed.The Bourne trilogy is one of the best action trilogies ever made. And i guess most of you guys reading this review, agrees on that. And you also felt this disappointment when you saw "The Bourne Legacy", it just felt like movie made just to be added the Bourne name to it, and laugh all the way to the bank.It wasn't really a bad movie, but it was far from reaching the standards we had grown custom to from the original trilogy.Ever since i saw "The Bourne Ultimatum", i wanted a new Bourne film with Matt Damon. Matt Damon said after the film was done, that the story had been told, they didn't plan for any more films. And that is fine really, it's better to quit while you are on top. But then again, what a shame, they should be able to come up with something, right?And here we are, with Greengrass at the helm again. (Greengrass who made "The Bourne Ultimatum" into one of the finest and best action films of all time. It was truly a remarkable film, and an outstanding end to the trilogy). And we have Matt Damon as leading cast and producer.Could this go wrong?I thought it couldn't, but it has.Over the last few years i have been reluctant to go to the cinema to see action movies, because i get served the same dish every single time. And i am sick of it, i want a good story, i want progression, i want something interesting. Just like how they kept on building the original Bourne films, that's what i want. The action elements are not suppose to be the story, they are suppose to be there to help make the story more powerful, and this is what the Bourne films did so well, so very very well.This film basically just recycles what the previous movies gave us, there is hardly anything new here. The film has been heavily influenced by the Snowden leaks, and rest builds on the same premise as before. That the NSA and CIA has capabilities out of this world. In this movie this has been exaggerated beyond measure. It's even more incredible than the movie "Enemy of the state" with Will Smith.For example. The CIA seem to have floor plans of every building, in every major city, in the entire world. Including power grids, maintenance schedules and so on. But even more fantastic, all this information also seem to be available to Jason Bourne, which seem to spend most of his days reading about power grids in random buildings in cities he might visit some day in the future when he is done fighting people in the desert. Yeah.. OK...I know Jason Bourne is resourceful, i know the NSA and CIA are resourceful, but come on. The story loses it's grip when anything can happen at any given moment without having any plausible explanation. Things just happen, because..And the story from the trilogy is "old" now, lots of things happen with technology in 9-15 years. The first Iphone wasn't even released when they made "The Bourne Ultimatum". And Bourne has been out of the game for a very long time, still he is on top of things, like he never left. And it's almost impossible not to start laughing at all the ridiculous stuff that happens in this film. But if you are into quantum mechanics, you might find some of it possible.It feels like the makers of this film felt that the Bourne franchise had to be amped up. Except the things that made the original trilogy good, like the awesome fighting sequences, are gone. The ones that are there, are simply boring and non inspiring. What they have toned down, have been amped up with destruction of cars and buildings. Just what you would expect Michael Bay to do if he made this film.The story is simply just unbelievable, completely out of proportions. It is a story written just to cash in some extra money on a beloved franchise. It's not like we haven't seen this happen before, it happens all the time, and is the reason i am skeptical to go to the cinema to see these films. But i hoped for the longest, they would never let it happen to the Bourne franchise. Not with Damon as leading cast, i can forgive spin-off movies, but not this.It's a shame, it really is.But, the movie does have some great things in it. For starters it has the best photographed car chase scene since "Nightcrawler", the cinematography is stunning.The entire movie has about the exact same pacing as the previous Bourne films, it is fast and loud. And that's fine. Just that the scenes have no real impact as the story isn't at par.Of the actors, i think Alicia Vikander is the one that does her job best. Though a bit off on her accent at times, and a bit to young for the role she plays (Not her fault though), she does what she can with what she has to work with, which is a weak script. She has a magic screen presence about her, every time she is in a scene the attention is immediately drawn to her.So if you are looking to go see a movie with plenty of 1 second cuts and loud sound effects while you consume popcorn, this movie has what you are looking for. But if you are looking to see a classic Bourne movie, with intriguing story elements, you will be in for a huge disappointment.5/10 - Mediocre</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not like previous Bourne sequels including The Bourne Legacy, couldn't feel a grasp in it I don't know can't feel it previous movies were glue pasted thrilling feeling around me. Need not to kill Julia Stiles only because she gets old as a character in the movie so decided to eliminate her right in the beginning of the movie just like that by replacing a another female lead actress currently inside the plot (Alicia Vikander) is totally not necessary. According to the story Bourne is vulnerable to the government not Julia Stiles as the way agency sees it OK so, she should have expose the truth about the operation to Jason indirectly by any other way not by voluntarily killing herself for nothing. Eliminating Tommy Lee Jones is a waist for the movie should have used him for another part to give the Jason Bourne fans a bit exciting, coz he is hardcore actor can deliver the quality of the movie on the screen. If Matt Damon and Jeremy Renner played along in the movie against the agency by exposing the dirty operations to the public in which both have been very much used for the agency for their own needs and wanted to left them dead, kind of revenge plot against the agency by hitting them by giving a feeling of doesn't know what hit them bad and aggressively will make the flick a blockbuster hit for sure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being a die hard front row seat fan of the Jason Bourne movie series I just suffered bitterly .. I had high hopes but this stale brew is nothing to cheer at. There is so much wrong with this effort that I don't know where to begin. I feel that the movie actually makes some kind of creepy gesture at Iceland, as many of us know that is the number one country that does it's own thing and is not owned by any big brother and really .. I didn't know people spoke German in Iceland .. Both the story line and the handy cam were very shaky and except maybe for the scenes with Nikki, the entire movie lacked engagement and heart and the creativity that Bourne tickled our senses and surprised us with in his previous pieces (that includes Legacy in my opinion which is 200 times better than this chill pill) The action scenes and the dialogues felt increasingly sterile and scripted and the action auto tune made me feel like I was watching a documentary on Discovery Channel. Pretty much following a recipe for Jason cake, Paul Greengrass stoically dishes up every thing we have seen before, the car chase, check, the locker at the airport, check, motorcycle, check, hand to hand combat, check, did we forget anything ? Many things also appeared to be just unexplained window dressing, like the bare knuckle boxing opening scene in Athens, what for ? Surely the most brilliant rogue asset can find other ways to earn some pocket money.Then there was the whole deal about the cover up of the spy scandal in a smartphone app vs Jason simply not giving a beep and trying to find out about his past that had zero to do with each other, creating a plot hole vacuum the size of Russia. All in all a disappointing mess .. I immediately looked up who the director was because I had difficulty believing it was the same person that did the previous totally epic movies. I had more fun opening the IMDb review section and laughing my anxious and tense disappointment away reading all the hilarious and genuine comments by all you people. I was literally bawling my eyes out so, thank you for that relief! I would have given this 3 stars for such and such, but messing up the most epic franchise in history comes at a price, so there it is, the way I feel about this lukewarm puddle of pee, leaking down my knee for all to see, verily, I say to thee, let it be ..</fullReview>

Like the previous Jason Bourne movies this film is shot an edited in a fast way, many short shots that makes it hard to watch the movie. It is probably modern, new and hip and it is probably needed to cover up the very thin story line but I hate it. A movie should be fun to watch and not give you tired eyes and brain. There are many ways to make a movie 'fast' but the creators of Jason Bourne failed again. It is hard to beat the original movie 'The Bourne Identity' with Richard Chamberlain, by far the best Bourne movie.</fullReview>

The original trilogy was captivating with Matt Damon perfectly cast in the lead role. The new film is pretty entertaining, but never quite reaches the heights of the original movies. The movie catches up with Bourne, as usual, hiding from the authorities. It then pretty much follows the plot from the earlier movies with Bourne gradually filling in some of the blanks of his past life as Jason Webb. This provides him with settles to score with people who are out to get him first. Therein lies the problem because there's really nothing new here. It's just the same tried and trusted formula. There is no doubt that it's certainly pretty entertaining, but you can't help pining for the excitement of the original movies.</fullReview>

After the success of Mr. Robot there's no excuse for this any more. Realistic hacking can still be entertaining.

Also whereas the first movies at least looked realistic this one is badly done on this side - no tries to disguise and ofc Bourne and all the guys just meet in the big cities (there always is some CIA team a few minutes away, think about it...). I wasn't bored the whole time, and Bourne isn't a bad movie, but compared with its predecessors you see the difference in quality and entertainment. And yes, I liked The Bourne Legacy with Jeremy Renner a lot more, it added sth. new to the franchise.

		<fullReview>This installment still had elements of the first three, but somehow got lost in the action as it attempted to ramp up the action. What made the first three so good was the realness of the action scenes and story lines.The technology scenes went so far towards the impossible that it constantly drew me out of the story. The scene where they are tracking the blonde woman at the start is so unrealistic that I sat there wondering if it was a superhero movie or an action movie. No one is that smart and no technology can work like that. The worst part is that they change the rules during the movie and allow Bourne to freely move around places with plenty of CCTV with no explanation (an extra scene with some form of disguise, like he would use in the books would have been fine).As for the action, most of it was well done, but the car chase scene towards the end killed it for me. A truck can only plough through so many cars before coming to a halt.I think if they had taken some of the over the top BS and spent that time/effort/money developing the story line then it would have been a worthy addition to the trilogy. Unfortunately we get left with a film with a similar feel, but none of the substance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A confession: I'm pretty sure I've seen all the Jason Bourne films, but I can't distinguish any of them now. To be honest, I thought I'd already seen one where Vincent Cassel was the baddie. (Maybe that was one of the Ocean'ses, which also rather blur.)There's usually Damon, and an intense-hippy girl, and a car chase around a European city, and other assassins, and Revelations about Damon's mysterious past, and some high-level Government type trying to bring him in or work him out, or kill him. It's all professionally done, and moody, and at the end Damon more or less comes out on top, but let's face it there aren't any real winners in the international assassination game, are there?So here we are again. Jason Bourne: a tense, vaguely intelligent dose of international espionage procedural, breathless action and millennial angst. And an hour after the credits I'm starting to forget chunks of it. Like an international assassin who's seen too much.It's all well done: a strong cast and high end production values, all skillfully handled. (Though the problem with Greengrass's trademark dizzy action is that half the time you don't know what's going on. There's a general sense of confusion, which is presumably the point. But it's hard to care if you don't know what to care about; and it's rather a shame to throw all that money at a car chase, but not to give a strong idea of who's chasing whom, or more than a general impression of a dodgem ride in darkness.)Much has been made of how few lines Damon speaks; it's tight, effective writing. But the general uncertainty about his character, his numb remorseless endurance as yet another bit of Government sneakiness bounces off him, makes him a blank reflecting no more than a general sense of paranoia and nihilism.(And in trying to have its cake and eat it, the film ends up with neither: we get glimmerings of a potentially interesting idea that Damon and Cassel are in the same predicament, victims of the times/the Man/the unbearable melancholy of existence; but by making Cassel part of the villainy in Damon's past, and making him the climactic fight rather than uber-cynic Tommy Lee Jones, the film strains at the last for a bit of goodie v. baddie exuberance that the mood can't support.)And so to the over-extended postscript, with Alicia Vikander the fastest-promoted probationer in history, setting up for next time the same plot all over again. We've seen it before, and it's getting harder to care. The 21st Century may be this bleak, but at least leave us a bit of entertainment on the screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Generic, but not too bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start my review for the 2016 film "Jason Bourne" by saying that I am not familiar with the franchise at all. I have not seen any of the many older films (despite liking Jeremy Renner). The franchise is almost 15 years old already, so it's high time to take a look at it. And I must say this 2-hour film here got me kinda curious. The director and one of the writers is Oscar nominee Paul Greengrass and he also worked on some of the older films. Renner, by the way, is not in this one here, it is, as the title already tells, all about Matt Damon's original character again. But this is only partially true I must say. I did not find Bourne really interesting in here the way he was written. Then again, it is certainly difficult to come up with new ideas for such an "old" character with many stories under his belt. Instead, in my opinion, the most interesting here was the villain duo consisting of Tommy Lee Jones and Vincent Cassel who I both like a lot. What I did not like was Alicia Vikander's character. I think the Oscar-winning actress is a much better actress than she was allowed to show us here. It is such a stereotypical character the way she was written and honestly she adds nothing besides her looks and you can't even blame her as she still gives a solid performance. At that age, she is almost on top of the food chain and collaborates closely with the CIA director? In the end, it sounds as if she may be appointed CIA director herself. It was so obvious she would become an aide to Bourne at some point as they killed of his previous female helper early on, a character from previous films too. And the plot twist near the end is not helping either, now we know that she was still evil, or was she really? They tried with scenes like the one Bourne checking out her history and sees her idealistic quote, but she turns out a very forgettable character, even if she looks pretty nice doing so.As for Cassel and TLJ, I would agree that they did not really show anything they have not shown in other films before, but that's not meant negatively. They clearly are in their comfort zone and the characters were perfect for them I must say. A joy to watch, especially Cassel who makes a great villain. The only thing I did not like is how they keep calling him "Asset" instead of his real name. Like I said, I have not seen the previous installments, but I am a bit worried that the fans of the franchise may not like this one as it brings in so many new faces who so far have not been known yet to be part of the Bourne universe. I myself like seeing familiar faces mostly, so I probably would have struggled with this scenario. But this is still a pretty decent film. I don't think it is one that allows Damon to show his potential at all, but I do believe that he usually shines more through recognition value and charisma than through great range, so this may actually have been a good choice. I enjoyed the watch here and I give it a thumbs-up. Good to see a franchise still going that strong after such a long time and so many sequels.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing compared to original trilogy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jason Bourne is of the grid. Tormented by flashbacks he spends his days being a freelance free fighter. When an old friend resurfaces he is pulled back into the world of intelligence agencies, conspiracies and assassins.Personally I was looking forward tot his new installment of the Bourne franchise, especially after mediocre Bourne spin-off with Jeremy Renner. The first 3 parts of were coherent as a trilogy, exiting and breathed a believable measure of realism.The return of Greengrass and Damon as director and main actor proved not to be a deciding factor in the quality of the film though. The main reason is the plot and poor script. Events in the history of David Webb appear out of thin air to form a rather weak story line.Tommy Lee Jones and Vincent Cassel play smaller parts but due to their flat characters, they can't save this film. Lead actress Alicia Vikander has plenty of screen time but makes no big impression like she did in The Danish Girl. What impressed me most about her performance was the way her facial expression didn't change at all during the two hours of the movie.What remains is an above average action flick that unfortunately lacks the quality of the first three parts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Typically he gets a piece - very disappointed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now there was a pretty girl as is typical of these movies. Jason usually gets to tap the pretty girl. In this move he did not. Here is how it goes.... Pretty girl he used to tap shows up with a jump drive. Jason is making a living punching people. Girl with jump drive tells him about his father. Then a bunch of stuff happens - a city is blown up - they ride a motor cycle and pretty girl gets shot. Big surprise... Somehow she has a key to a locker or something - gets that to Jason with her last breath. Now Jason - a man with seemingly endless resources uses a combination of airplanes and fast cars to get around the world a few times to figure out something about his father. I guess punching people for a living must pay very well. Oh yeah - now another pretty girl shows up - at some point she shoots someone who is about to shoot Jason - she wears a cable knit sweater on an airplane and does a whole bunch of other sexy things. Jason meets up with her in a park after she goes for a ride around the block in a Suburban - then he puts a video camera on the front seat of her locked car showing how she just said she would have him killed if he did not cooperate. Now this was a good movie - just get the guy a piece of that lovely young lady before you show the end credits. I have come to expect it from this series and was genuinely disappointed. Don't get me wrong - I am not asking for pornography - I do want her to probably take her shirt off at least once and then show some sort of thing to indicate my boy got something besides the 60 million dollars they paid him to do this film.So - I recommend you see it - just prepare yourself - and - note to the directors - I am expecting something in the next film otherwise you may loose me as a customer.Good day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Typical Action Film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not a huge fan of action movies, they tend to all feel the same way to me. But after watching the original Bourne Trilogy over the past few weeks, for the first time, I fell in love with the plots, scripts, dynamics, characters, and just about everything else. Nothing about these films were typical in any way and those are the expectations I had when walking into the theater to see the 2016 Jason Bourne film. While it was a good action film and had its moments, it never drew me in the way the others had. I understood the point and plot of the film and why they felt like the Bourne series needed another film to tie off the story of Jason Bourne, after all Jason still had enemies in the CIA that needed to be dealt with, but, it was missing the original "Bourne" touch. In all the other films we learned new things about Jason that allowed him to link his past together and figure it out and that what was missing in this film. We don't learn anything new about Jason specifically but more about his father and even then we don't receive answers to the questions we were given. The action scenes on the other hand are superb and add to the minimal character development we do see with Bourne. We see a new side to Jason Bourne at the very beginning of the film that allows us to see the extent of what he is feeling and the toll being on the run has taken on him. From that point on the action just builds throughout. This aspect of the movie definitely lives up to the expectations and is what kept me drawn in throughout. I would say this movie is a Redbox rental type of film but it is a must see once it comes out on DVD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will begin with the beginning of the film. It is Greek Albanian border and two men are fighting - a Serbian and a Russian !!! Like this is the biggest wtf I have seen in films for a long long time ... I guess the Serbian one won coz Russia could never win in American films. hahaha I really don't see the logic in that, but, of course, it is a film, so ...As for the film itself. It was good. Although rather long, it is not boring. It keeps you interested. The young CIA woman is definitely the highlight of the movie. She is very convincing. Matt is good as usual though I do not really get what is the point of this film aside to get more money. We already saw everything in previous Bourne movies, so this one was rather 'out'. It does not add anything to the story about him - Jason / Webb.Also, I know it is to make excitement or to be more thrilling - but again - wtf with the two enemies finally meet and Borne has the chance to shoot him immediately but he is fighting him for 10 minutes before he's almost killed?! Maybe too much of car racing and car smashing in the film. Too little music. All in all, not a bad film. Seven from me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overproduced. Bad choreography. Simplistic plot.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is impossible to not mention previous Bourne moves, but not without a reason. Not only this one fails to do justice to very well written and well done series, but it is also just rather Sunday TV action movie than a Cunema blockbuster.It is rather clear from the beginning that producer (Matt himself) does not trust the viewers with remembering the character nor with understanding protagonist position. So basically whole plot is a mix of all previous ones with one (yes, just one) new element. So for everyone who is looking for some continuity - will be very disappointed.Screenplay is 40% chase, 15% looking at Bourne face, 30% rewinding the previous Bourne movies, 15% of very bad dialogues. Whole thing is very cliché. Very, very "seen it 100 times before".However if you do not care about Bourne this movie will stunt you wit the scale of NFS-like pursues, big explosions and other production values. But actions scenes are way too long. One chase is like 20 minutes! With very unstable camera you really want it to end fast. Same goes for fighting scenes. You see practically nothing. Like they had no one to do choreography for them. After John Wick, Batman, and other movies with great fighting scenes I was hoping every producer would understand that shaking camera is no way to do fight scene anymore... I was wrong.Movie is a solid 5/10 but it might be too hard for it so I gave it a 6/10. It's not worth your money. It should be in TV very soon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was prepared to be disappointed when I went to the cinema yesterday and I was disappointed a bit. The film was more of the same. OK, that was to be expected. But still... A little more light was shed on his past. But nothing major. Another woman from the CIA that falls for him (sort of). Seen that before. Then: the logic holes. E.g. The all-mighty CIA can find anyone per surveillance cams anywhere, anytime. So how could Bourne escape for years? Another disappointment: the fight scenes were not as tough and realistic looking as I remember from the other movies. The part I liked the least, was the Las Vegas car chase. This was so unrealistic. CGI all over the place. The (pseudo-)realism of the Bourne movies was one of the things (at least compared to comparable series like James Bond) that I liked most up to this episode. Pity. Still there was some suspense. And the film is better than average, so I gave it 6 points.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Border line entry into the Bourne Series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Huge fan of the Original Series and I even enjoyed Jeremy Renners Bourne Legacy movie.What made the first 3 good was that the audience was taken on a journey with Bourne trying to find out who he really is. Part spy, part espionage, part action thriller with great twists.We went to the cinema last night with high expectations and its not a bad action film but left feeling that they had missed an opportunity with this entry.The films suffers with very jerky camera work and the plot you could argue is thin given what already know about Bourne.The chase scenes in particular are a hard watch because the camera never stays focus on one moment for more than a micro second. I can believe what some are saying about getting dizzy. A poor lad down in the front row of the cinema had to leave because was actually sick!It is great though to see Damon back in his pivotal role because I think there is room for Bourne in the world today and the film may open up further possibilities. However bring Bourne back when there is a really strong script available perhaps with Jeremy Renner.There are some positives for the fans as Damon makes the fight scenes authentic and the locations are great. The cars involved are also pretty good!Go watch and decide for yourself however as one persons bad experience is another's delight!6.5 out of ten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Too Bad--But Not The Best, Either</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having watched the four previous movies in preparation for this latest chapter in the Bourne franchise, I can say that this movie is good overall. I'm flirting with giving it 7/10 stars as I write this review. But I think that 6/10 probably describes it best.Let's start with the good parts of this film. The movie stars Matt Damon, who makes a return to the franchise after 2013's "Bourne Legacy" starring Jeremy Renner. Renner didn't do a bad job at all in that film, but the fact is that this is Matt Damon's series. And, thankfully, the movie doesn't bring in very much of the back story from "Legacy" at all (which was a somewhat geeky movie for Bourne franchise die-hards), but instead is a return to the type of narrative seen in the first three films.Tommy Lee Jones stars as the main antagonist in the film--the CIA director, who of course winds up being the lead villain. That should be no surprise if you've seen the previous movies in the series. Jones plays the part well and is arguably one of the more redeeming elements of the film.The script is reasonably strong, and the story telling is good in this movie--and, to my liking, there's less of the shaky camera technique going on here than in 2007's "Bourne Ultimatum". However, the movie's two most prominent action scenes seem to drag on forever. That's another one of those things that seems to be standard for this franchise. It's fine, I guess, but in my opinion it really shouldn't take ten minutes worth of film to convey the conclusion of a chase scene.The biggest problem I have with the movie, though, is that it just feels like at this point the series has become a repeat of the second movie over and over again ("Legacy" being the exception). Bourne is a problem, the CIA wants to kill him, there's corruption at the top of the CIA, there's a bunch of car chases, and in the end Bourne walks away (spoiler). That's all fine and good if you just want some simple escapism, but how many times can they make this same movie over and over again? All that said, I give this one 6/10 stars. It's not a bad movie at all. But it's not fresh. I've seen it all before. And that makes it not as enjoyable as it would be otherwise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A decent movie, but one can't help but feel that the original Bourne trilogy has been let down by it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a Bourne fan, I entered the cinema with high hopes that 'Jason Bourne' would breathe fresh air into the Bourne series by returning to its roots and bringing fans back up to date with the man himself, Jason Bourne. However, it didn't feel as if Jason Bourne's story has enough left in it to justify it continuing any further and raises questions as to the necessity of this film. Of course, the simple answer for that is for the money, but 'Jason Bourne' could and should have been a lot better. While it is a decent action movie and provides plenty of thrills, it does not contain enough quality storytelling and intelligence to warrant bringing Bourne back to the big screen, and stands only to prove that blockbusters are becoming more and more reliant on the nostalgia of previous successes.It cannot be denied: Jason Bourne is certainly an exciting ride, filled with a great deal of adrenaline fuelled and wonderfully shot action set pieces that could be taken directly from one of the previous films; it has the same buzz as a Bourne film from the 2000s, yet it does not reach the same levels of ingenuity, complexity and fascination that the original trilogy gloats to be able to be classed as another well-crafted action thriller that continues the Bourne franchise successfully. Bourne films should not have to be deemed as simply acceptable, which this and 'The Bourne Legacy' both are, but because the expectations are so high and the standard set similarly so, it instantly makes anything less than fantastic rather disappointing. Paul Greengrass undoubtedly knows how to shoot a good car chase or a quality fist fight and this is one of the films greatest strengths. It is beyond question that these action scenes are top notch, yet they are set back by the fact that the stakes are not as high as one would come to expect from a Bourne film, and this does end up making it feel like a 2 hour chase for a lost cause.Matt Damon leads a cast of Oscar winners and newcomers alike, however whilst there isn't anything downright wrong per se with the performances given, none of the actors really shine in their own right and even border on plain dullness at points. Damon's attitude to the Bourne franchise after 4 films can be likened to that of Daniel Craig as 007 following the same number of outings; neither looked like they actually wanted to reprise their respective roles a fourth time and this dampened the impact of the characters on the audience and affected the overall enjoyment of the films. Tommy Lee Jones gives possibly one of his most bland performances of his esteemed career, aided by this years' supposed Best Supporting Actress, Alicia Vikander, who doesn't live up to her title as she comes across as being involved only for the sizeable sum of money that the studio no doubt threw at her as her undeniable acting skills aren't evident much in this movie. Julia Stiles, reprising her role of Nicky Parsons is perhaps the most bothered about her part in the film and while her role may be smaller than what many had imagined prior to 'Jason Bourne's release, she definitely provides the most integrity of the primary cast, so credit to her for returning to serve mainly as another link back to the previous three Jason Bourne films, but at least making it look worthwhile.Having said all this, the script may be to blame for the casts' apparent lack of concern for their roles. It is messy, full of plot holes and ties ends together with as much care as a children's animated film that can only do so much to blow a 6 year old's mind, thus never really stepping out of the comfort zone for worry of doing it wrong or over-complicating things. This is something that none of the original three ever shied away from, providing us with psychological thrills as well as caffeine buzzes and it can only be wished that 'Jason Bourne' sought to do greater things with the potential it had. There are basic principles behind the film that were good groundwork for what could have been a great movie, for example it makes sense to name the film 'Jason Bourne' in the end despite controversy, as it begins to scratch the surface of Bourne's life before he became the "perfect weapon", yet not enough happens to justify returning to Jason Bourne's life for another action packed outing or allowing the film to adequately fulfill the title it possesses.Hence, 'Jason Bourne' is another one of those action-drama films that can be watched passively with no need to pay any real attention, as it provides sufficient violence for the viewer to care enough to watch but not to observe why guns are being fired so often. It has the thrills, it has a strong cast, it has a perfectly ample creative team behind it; all it really needed was a better reason to exist and more motives for both audience and the people involved to be more entranced in what was going on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) has been hiding for years when we meet him. That is only to be brought back into the spy game by Nicky Parsons (Julia Stiles) who has hacked the CIA and discovered a new truth about operation Treadstone which uncovers yet further reveals about Bourne's past. Confronted with Bourne's return Heather Lee (Alicia Vikander) and Robert Dewey (Tommy Lee Jones) both have to try and put an end to his activities following their very different methods.I almost worship the Bourne films, having literally grown up with and close to them. They make up one of the best and most compelling trilogies of all time and from an action standpoint, not only did they set the bar for the whole of the last fifteen years, but they are also some of the most intense and adrenaline filled experience we have had the pleasure to have since the 2000s. A return to form with Greengrass and Damon is of course a welcome idea, how could it not be after what they have achieved in the past? Does the film live up to its tall ordeal? I would have to say that whilst the filmmakers have not disappointed a fan who lives and breathes these films, they have neither truly satisfied him and it pains my fingers to write.What ultimately it comes down to is a messy third act and a lack of climactic value and pathos, which is what made past entries so stunning. By no means do Greengrass or Damon drop the ball on us, you see the effort they are putting into this, it transpires through the screen in many ways and overall brings to the screen a feature that has many elements to be deeply admired. For one, the Greece action sequence is absolutely jaw dropping, It is the testament to a filmmaker who clearly wants to put all his heart into the picture and challenge and surpass himself. And he does. We are served a first act action sequence that takes us by the throat and doesn't let go until we can't take the adrenaline anymore. Staged to perfection and weaved with characters in a slew of brilliant ways, this scene represents the potential of what these people are capable of bringing on screen.The style too is still alive and kicking and doesn't leave behind the novelty that makes it so engaging. We can still count on top notch editing and fantastic cinematography, which still proves to me to be one of the most complex styles to shoot, but the result is absolutely fabulous. The first two acts have a good narrative drive and whilst you are still waiting for the mystery to be uncovered you are deeply intrigued by the characters and their agenda. Admittedly Damon does feel a little off on the role, but the director manages to shoot around it and we still get many nuances of what we love about this character.Where the film sadly films is in long-term motivations. There is simply no drive by the time we get to the third act, that being due also to a side plot revolving around a social media outlet that is completely unnecessary and out of place in a Bourne film. The commentary it is trying to get to really doesn't belong here and the picture suffers deeply for it. The third act has many little moments that are priceless, but when added up in the big picture they simply can't overcome what is poor character development. By the end the film does have a little and classy pick-up, but it can't mend the unfortunate lack of any kind of relevant closure in its third act. Story lines aren't juggled with order and we end up with a mild mess, indicative of this is the final action sequence which is severely void of any gravitas and ends up feeling like a big loud and clunky scene.Still there plenty to be enjoyed, especially for fan of the series, this is in no way the disaster that "The Bourne Legacy" was, it is just an action film with a very problematic third act and conclusion that has two quite strong acts before to support it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen all of the previous Bourne films (even the one with Hawkeye) and enjoyed them to an extent. They are definitely some of the best spy films out there, but my tastes run more to films like the Mission Impossible series (a great example of sequels being better than the original).Jason Bourne doesn't waste any time and gets straight into the action. The sequence at the Athens riot was fantastic, and is exactly the sort of thing that fans of the series want to see.The story, whilst not incredibly deep, was quickly established, as were the main characters' motivations (with one exception, but this is something of a reveal at the end, so that's fine). However, I'm not sure how well this would do as a standalone film, with numerous references to previous films (but then you kind of expect that in the fifth of a series), but that's not really much of a point against it.All of the actions leads to a big finale in Las Vegas. Again, fantastic action (although perhaps too much shaky cam), including a car chase with a van that is clearly made of the same material as the Batmobile from Batman vs Superman (it just ploughed through vehicles).The ending was fine, and the little reveal about one of the characters was nice as well.(Review from my blog: whingewood.wordpress.com)</fullReview>

Story unfolds with Nicky Parsons(Julia Stiles) stumbling upon the new CIA blackops Project named Iron Hand which has Bourne's father's hand in it. She wants to alert Bourne on the same which in turn activates CIA director (Tommy Lee Jones) and CIA cyber wing director (Alicia Vikander). Both want to get hold of him again. Will they succeed in doing this? forms the plot line for the intriguing action thriller. Paul Greengrass is back at the helm as director while John Powell is in charge of music. Vincent Cassel plays the nemesis to Bourne with elan. Spectacular action sequences were shot atmospherically by Barry Ackroyd but the SWAT vehicle ploughing through many parked cars in the climax is Las Vegas is bit too much. On the whole, this is a tense action filled thriller. Serious viewers are welcome to take it a shot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dropping the cryptic name practices of it's predecessors, Jason Bourne is the newest installment in the Bourne franchise. And while it certainly isn't the highest high of the series, it's certainly fun.Thankfully, this movie is a pretty solid return to form for the series, thanks in large part to the return of the successful combination of director Paul Greengrass and Jason Bourne himself, Matt Damon. They both have a pretty clear understanding of what this series is supposed to be, and take full advantage of that, by delivering on the cool things we expect to see. Shaky but yet still somehow gratifying fight scenes? check. Clever evasive maneuvering around surveillance? check. Great, well utilized locations? check. Sweet car/bike chases? Double check. But where it uses formula to find it's legs and get the momentum going, it unfortunately also ends up stumbling do it's strict adherence to it.full review at: https://barrysreview.wordpress.com/2016/08/04/jason- bourne/</fullReview>

I therefore eagerly awaited the new instalment. Unfortunately there is nothing new and whilst its a watchable action flick we still have the CIA wanting to cover their tracks and Bourne dead. We have seen this all before and ultimately in the first 3 films done much better. The shaky camera work of Greengrass made the opening sequence quite difficult to focus on and I feel I missed out on much of the intended action, The neat fighting sequences of the past are largely replaced with shaky fight scenes which leave you squinting your eyes so much that when the fights finish it comes as a retinal relieve.Its a good film and time does pass surprisingly well however they haven't taken the franchise forward which disappoints on every front!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jason Bourne is back again?roughly a decade after exposing Operation Blackbriar and going off the grid, the titular ex-operative is once again pulled back into the fray after new information is leaked from the CIA that could finally give him some closure regarding his ambiguous family ties?but that's only the beginning. A reunion by director Greengrass and star Damon who teamed up for the franchise's second and third films; although this doesn't cover much new ground, and has a plot that would be impossible to describe in a few short sentences, the film benefits from excellent casting (especially Jones recalling his Oscar-winning turn in The Fugitive), and has some tense, skillful action sequences that rarely let up. Difficult to follow, yet still sure to leave you on the edge of your seat. **?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Massive Bourne fan, but it's time...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Quite like his right hook and left jab, that came around quick! I was surprised when I heard the announcement which doesn't seem that long ago, this year even; the studio managing to keep that convert really well. Matt Damon has historically refused to make another Bourne movie unless Paul Greengrass is at the helm and lucky for us, he returned bringing Bourne back from the dead, like, again. I'm eager to know which Bourne movie is the most popular because Identity was mine, the birth of Bourne and sharing that trip of rediscovery kicking ass. Identity is one of those rare films where I'm totally blown away by the actor and not having faith in Damon as an action star was quickly squashed when watching Identity. I want to know which one is everyone's favourite so to compare, because if it's Identity then surely Doug Liman should be the director instead of Greengrass? Don't get me wrong, I both like Supremacy and Ultimatum equally. The plot thickens and delves deeper making this one personal, but maybe too personal to the level I was annoyed. We've been watching people trying to catch Bourne for fourteen years and now all of sudden, it's more personal than anyone can imagine. I suppose it's meant to be a massive twist like when finding out Darth Vader was Luke's father but it lacks the impact completely. It seems to annoyingly follow suit of all the previous ones, with having a corrupt head-of- department in the form of Tommy Lee Jones (not the first time I've shouted "STOP CHASING PEOPLE TLJ!" Though he does it from a director chair.) Chris Cooper, Brian Cox, David Strathairn and now Jones. Alicia Vikander kinda mimics Joan Allen's Pamela Landy role from the previous Damon/Bourne films. Bourne looks weathered and is up against or in the sights of the Night Fox, Vincent Cassel who does good as expected but... The action is really shaky, more so than all the others previously, very fast yet the tension is there but there's so many cuts and handycam shots it's quite disorientating and there's really only one decent punch-up. It feels like a Bourne movie, but I couldn't help and think something was lacking. All the Bourne ingredients are there, knock-outs, deaths by strangulation, bike and car chases, but maybe there just wasn't enough of it, or could it be I was unimpressed with the lack of fast-thinking super assassin scenarios. The script is minimal, and poor, with Damon hardly saying anything but we know he isn't all talk. All the previous Bourne's have had elaborate plot holes filled which I think we forgive being Bourne but this is fast suffering the same fate as the Pirates of the Caribbean vehicle, milking the franchise so not to ever end. I love Bourne, I really do, but there's a part of me that just wants him put out of his misery. It's entertaining, but it's getting tiresome. Less of the shakycam and I think it's gone in the wrong direction. What's going to happen next? Is Aaron Cross and Bourne going to cross paths? There's no mention apart from file reading the Larx project. There bound to be another chief who wants to hush everything all up, when will it end?

		<shortDescription>Doesn't have the thriller and action intellect that the other previous films have.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoy the series for the characterization, story telling, and action that it brings unlike many all action and no plot movies throughout the years.Too bad the story line is lazy, doesn't mix well with the previous films and Jason's character seems to be either brooding or emotionless much of the film (that's probably from all the street fighting he did for a living, but who knows?) Starts out with the CIA's Black Ops information and Jason's father information getting hacked in Iceland by Nicky who contacts him and they end up hiding and going into Athens, Greece which is conveniently going thorough a protest/riot for some unexplained reason. Also, they mention Snowden multiple times throughout the film (you'll automatically see where this is going) The director wants Jason killed and sends "Asset" after him (who is very sloppy as an assassin and many people who he kills is often unnecessary). Nicky ends up getting shot twice and killed.The later part of this movie isn't much better. Tommy Lee Jones (villain CIA Director Robert Dewey) plays your snot so emotional person in movie and looks older than usual and flat out wants Jason dead, while Lee is the director of the Cyber Ops division wants to try to convince Jason to come back to the agency. You would think with all the mass surveillance and facial recognition going on, Jason and even Nicky (at the beginning) would have tried some disguises or just covered up their faces completely. How in the world did Jason go through Customs without the CIA noticing it with a few minutes of him going through? Fast forward to other part of the movie and major plot and you'll see Aaron K, the CEO and founder of Deep Dream along with Dewey because he wants him to make a back door from his massively popular and used Social Media site for mass surveillance to go along with the CIA assassination programs. Back to Las Vegas during some popular convention involving social media and tech.Dewey sets up to have Lee (he doesn't believe in her way of doing things and doesn't her and Aaron killed (he was going to say no anyway and was about to expose him) right before Jason comes and blinds Asset causing him to shoot Aaron in the shoulder. Afterwards they get into a huge car chase which pretty awesome with Asset in a SWAT vehicle and Jason in a Dodge Charger with the Las Vegas PD after them. They crash through the Rivera and fight with Asset ending up killed.But that was just the most memorable parts of the movie, the rest is somewhat bland or forgettable. While it does have a great deal of action and chase scenes the shaking and jerking camera angle ruins it and you can't see what happens certain parts.Overall, if your a fan of action films you may enjoy it, but for the Jason Bourne fans, you'll be disappointed. The character development is lacking, the overall plot isn't great, the action is great along with the chase scenes.And let's not forget the subliminal message of mass surveillance throughout the movie. The film in my opinion is just meh or average. It's not terrible or mediocre by any means, it's just not great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remembrance of things past: beyond privacy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Jason Bourne' (2016) has all the pyrotechnics film goers expect. Violence, fast paced action and country hopping. What's new is the technology and the end of privacy as we know it, it seems. Matt Damon is closer to 50 than to the thirty something he was in the last 2002 Bourne he appeared him. Gone is the boyish face; his features have hardened, he shows signs of aging. Still, he is angst ridden: who is he, why was chosen to be turned into the perfect killing machine of the CIA, so on and on. What's new is how quickly technology has advanced, and used ubiquitously by the government with seemingly impunity. Edward Snowden's comes up once or twice, so we know that the intelligence services snoop on us, as we play with our cellphones, tell our intimate secrets and text and e-mail and order online or read this blog or that; post selfies with astonishingly with an insouciance that strains credulity. And as Snowden's documents show, the social media companies work hand in hand with the government, and Bourne 2016 goes one step further, the CIA gives seed money to Silicon Valley. In the film we have a whiz kid, a nerd of South Asian origin, a graduate of Stanford University who makes a Faustian bargain with the spooks. Deep Freedom is the social media company that has captured the market. (Think Facebook, for example). It cannot break his bargain but with a bullet in his head, killed by an Company (CIA) operative or asset. The technology is not that new, but is available on the web. You or I can buy it and 'spy'. In other words, even ISIS can do what the CIA does. For Americans, the root problem is privacy. Are we at the mercy of the US government? Currently the Public Theater in New York is showing 'Privacy' with Daniel Radcliffe. Audience members are encouraged to play with their I-phones or cell phones during the performance. In this way, they will see how the government or private companies track their everyday lives and choices. How they create a profile of you, manipulate you...and you think you have privacy? It's Big Brother, man!. Bradbury's 'Fahrenheit 451' deals with the same phenomenon. And sanity and privacy are kept by 'renegades' who shun the system and live lonely lives of quiet desperation. And those who say 'I've nothing to hide?' Think again! You're on a fool's errand. Personally, I do think the Bourne films have hit an end. No more sequels please. We are in the land of the hopeful in the US. The film says the opposite, Bourne may be our knight in shining armor but we as citizens need to be our own saviors and band together to save our privacy and sanity. Is it too late</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You know his name . . . and the game.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The tag-line tells us that we know his name. Unfortunately, we also know the game as this is still another installment in the "been there, done that" game. If you don't mind mere furious action sequences helped by editing and a hundred of extras instead of anything resembling an original plot, you might get off on this. I didn't.On this site, it was mentioned that a recurring character was "killed off." Even though I could see this coming, I was still disappointed as this person was my favorite, if sometimes minor, character in this series. No need for me to watch any future installments. Actually, my favorite in this quick-cutting fast-action franchise was "The Bourne Legacy" with Jeremy Renner. The slight variation from the usual scenario was refreshing, even though they couldn't resisting including a photo of Matt Damon as Jason.Unfortunately, Jason Bourne often comes across as a super-hero from the Marvel stable. He downs a bare-knuckles boxing opponent with one left hook, manages to place a significant tape recording in a vehicle without enough time or logistical position in which to do it, etc. Maybe we can next have Super-Jason Meets Batman.A critic recently wrote that Americans don't like originality. This could be true (but sad) considering the re-makes, sequels, and imitative stuff that pours out of Mogul-land these days. The name of the game is "been there, done that" with a huge dollar sign at the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More of the same, but also disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like the original Bourne trilogy, and do not mind that they would like to continue Bourne's story. In this, Damon still is excellent as Bourne, and all the other new players are all interesting.The story is the movie's big flaw. "How deep does this go?" seems to be plot of all of them, and I do wish that they could move on from that. The movie did handle it okay, but they might have gotten a better movie picking a different approach. But this was not the main problem. The first three quarters of the movie has Bourne pretty much going aimlessly from one situation to the next. Almost as if they feel they have to include a number of European cities in the action. Up to the final act, the movie was never all that interesting, though there are some good action sequences. The last act, meaning the last city they visit was quite good. Mostly because you can see that Bourne has a project, a goal. And then you get the brilliance of the character.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bourne again...for the better?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been waiting for this movie for nearly a decade now and the fanboy in me probably thinks its the greatest thing ever! But objectively speaking, 'Jason Bourne' is a pretty great revival of the franchise, but it isn't exactly of the caliber of the original trilogy (especially Greengrass' two previous efforts).Its not a knock on the film itself. There are some great action set- pieces, particularly the opening one set during a night-time Athens riot. It does everything much like its titular - with perfect surgical precision. And yet, one gets the feeling of it getting a tad too formulaic - a series of boxes being ticked off. Car chase? Yes. Hand-to-hand fight with rival assassin? Yes. Stake-out? Yes. And so on. In defense of this film, the box-ticking arguably started with 'Ultimatum' (and its really inevitable in any franchise after a point), but it seems a tad more emphatic here. Yet, the box-ticking does serve the purpose of reassuring audiences that yes, Bourne is indeed back (the REAL Bourne and not Jeremy Renner pretending to be Bourne in all but name), so perhaps one should cut it some slack. Ultimately though, what 'Jason Bourne' does well, the previous films did better.There are two points of 'originality' I credit this film for, and both are particularly intriguing and vital if one considers this to be the launch of a new cycle of Bourne films. One is Alicia Vikander's cyber-intelligence expert Heather Lee. Ostensibly, she appears to be the latest iteration of the Nicky Parsons/Pam Landy archetype, but as the film progresses, we learn there's a lot more to her than meets the eye. Without spoiling too much, let's put it this way - Heather Lee may well the the character that truly gives this franchise its second wind. The other is an interesting discussion, that occurs intermittently through the film, about Bourne's patriotism and whether or not it can be used to convince him to return to service. In the current political climate, dominated by issues of identity and nationalism and debates over who's a patriot and who's a traitor...this is indeed a potent new hook on which to base Bourne's future character arc.Matt Damon of course sinks back into Jason Bourne like he'd never left, though this time, there is a certain weariness to the character, which of course fits in with the narrative. Tommy Lee Jones takes a decent stab at playing Tommy Lee Jones, the gruff CIA Director Robert Dewey, who's basically plays the part Conklin, Abbott, and then Vosen did in previous installments. Julia Stiles brief return as Nicky Parsons is pretty decent too, and she adds some much needed connective tissue between the trilogy and this film. Of particular note is the performance of Vincent Cassel. The nameless 'asset' he plays is the most fleshed out version of this archetype thus far and he's actually relevant to the plot in a way that his predecessors never were (barring Clive Owen's Professor perhaps).On the whole, Jason Bourne is back and there's potential for great things ahead. Only time will tell if we finally get a film that surpasses 'Supremacy' and 'Ultimatum'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Big disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jason Bourne is big disappointment. Previous movies trusted more a good story, this one trust just brainless action scenes. It try too hard to look Fast an Furious movie, but seem to be just too stupid. Action scenes are brainless and overreaction. If SWAT car manages to bump all cars to high up in the air and stops only when it hit in few slot machines at casino then action is just too stupid to be true. Script is simple and predictable and it trusts too much for action scenes and forget the story telling. I just hope, that they trust more for the story if they will make more movies to Bourne series. As a brainless action movie it works a little better, but to me a good Jason Bourne movie isn't just action. It needs a good story too. Big, big disappointment to me.</fullReview>

His role in that movie doesn't portrayed much on what he should do as an agent. His escape plan is not that fancy as i imagined. The car scene was too lengthy. I expected more in term of gadget and intelligence. The girl seems to know everything and what JB would do. The end fighting scene is a little bit too much. Its like watching Bollywood movie and the hero just wont die. On the separate note, JB is like finding waldo. Deep dream company's software did not explained explicitly well in this movie. The ending was naughty but a little bit monotonous. I expected JB to join CIA. I was proved wrong. Descent movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All in all it was nice movie to see, but I really can't say that it was best from Jason Bourne. That Jason Bourneish pace was there and that is one thing what I like about this movie series. One thing what started to annoy me where these CIA agents hands-free systems, they still have wires behind their ears and talk into their sleeves, PLEASE, I can order better hands free system from china for 3 euros, even iPhone hands-free is better, because it does not have "Hi, I am from CIA" written all over it. Maybe directors wanted to leave this old-school agent style in, but I think this is a pit too much for 21st century. Jason Bourne had plenty of time to spend in the gym between movies, but this more muscular tough bad-ass Bourne was pretty awesome. I really liked Heather Lee character, she was mysterious and clever and I hope next Jason Bourne will continue where this one finished. Overall this wasn't the best one for sure, story-line was much better in first three or even four movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some Treasures Are Better Left Untouched.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some treasures are better left untouched. Together, The Bourne Identity, The Bourne Supremacy &amp; The Bourne Ultimatum make up for one of the greatest trilogies in motion picture history, having played an influential role in revitalising the action spy thriller genre, while catapulting Matt Damon to Hollywood stardom &amp; solidifying director Paul Greengrass' position as one of the first-rate filmmakers working in the industry today.There never was a need for another one because all the loose ends were tied up, all the questions were answered, and the whole journey went full circle in those three films. And that's why, there is only one term to describe the latest chapter in the Jason Bourne series: Unnecessary. And by that, I don't mean it's a bad film by any means, for Jason Bourne retains all the trademarks of the series but it doesn't bring or add anything new to the franchise the way its predecessors did.Taking place a decade after the events of The Bourne Ultimatum, the story of Jason Bourne finds the former CIA assassin still haunted by unresolved images from his past. Having lived under the radar all this time, his return to the world he left behind is set in motion when Nicky Parsons hacks into the CIA database to expose their black-ops programs and finds more info about Bourne's past. The two make contact but are eventually traced by the agency, thus restarting the chase all over again.Written &amp; directed by Paul Greengrass, Jason Bourne makes use of nearly everything that's great about his filmmaking style as well as this particular franchise, be it the sense of immediacy that is effectively introduced &amp; sustained till the end or the visceral, chaotic &amp; kinetic camera-work that infuses more urgency into the story, or its emphasis on real stunt work over CGI when filming action scenes and yet in the end, it leaves its viewers wondering if the whole ordeal of bringing Jason Bourne out of hiding was worth it.The plot is always in motion, the action segments keep surfacing at regular intervals, and it's better than what most cashgrab sequels manage to be but there is nothing in it that we haven't witnessed before. The screenplay itself features a weak story that treads on familiar routes, and inhabits new characters that have no flesh on their arcs. The ongoing debate about privacy &amp; encryption is also crammed into the script for no reason, and because it plays no role in influencing Bourne's actions, it feels completely out of place as a result of that.From the technical standpoint, there isn't much to complain as all its aspects work in harmony to recapture the tone &amp; feel of the previous instalments. Cinematography once again employs the dynamic, frenzied &amp; vigorous camera-work to give an added intensity to the unfolding events and is wonderfully assisted by John Powell's vibrant score, while Editing provides a throttling pace to the whole story but fails to trim out the needless moments. As far as its action goes, the film delivers exactly what was expected from it, packing in some pulse-pounding action &amp; over-the-top chase segments.Coming to the performances, the cast comprises of Matt Damon, Tommy Lee Jones, Alicia Vikander, Vincent Cassel, Julia Stiles &amp; Riz Ahmed, with Damon &amp; Stiles being the only returning members. Damon delivers a stellar performance as the near-invincible Jason Bourne but there's a slight hint of tiredness in his work this time. The next best effort comes from Stiles who, even in her brief role, plays her part with confidence. Cassel impresses in bits n pieces, Vikander is wasted in her role, Lee Jones looked as if he didn't even want to be in the picture while Ahmed's character wasn't even required.On an overall scale, Jason Bourne is no match to The Bourne Trilogy but it still delivers a far more thrilling, entertaining &amp; action-packed extravaganza than duds like Spectre, and features enough pulsating, breathtaking, relentless, furious &amp; frenetic carnage during its moments of action to delight both fans of the franchise as well as action aficionados. However, as far as its drama goes, the story isn't compelling enough and lacks the fine balance that the first three films showcased with startling ease. Needless is indeed the word that best describes this latest entry but it still sits above most of the recent summer spectacles in what's been a lacklustre year for Hollywood blockbusters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Action to make up for script? Aging Matt...?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really liked the first three Bourne movies and Legacy. Renner was great and the plot explained a lot of why the program participants were able to tolerate pain, figure out escape routes ... Wish they'd explained how they learned languages so quickly and fluently but I digress. I had heard that Matt Damon wouldn't do Legacy because his favorite director wasn't involved. I agree with some of the reviewers that Matt probably needed the money and a hit - he hasn't had many hits lately and the Bourne movies made him enormously famous - even though he made other good movies. OK - so "Jason Bourne" is filled with action - it virtually never stops. There's not much dialogue and a few holes are filled in as far as Jason's past but not enough to make him seek the revenge that drives him, haunts him, and that he might actually want back in the program - that's a stretch. It was confusion how Nicky was able to find him when the CIA had been searching for years, unsuccessfully. Nicky's become another Snowden and wants to post all the notes about Treadstone, BlackBriar, etc on the Internet. That's also a stretch. Last time we saw her she seemed pretty happy in an outdoor cafe somewhere in Europe. So Nicky get hacks into the CIA computers and gets the program files - OK - Nicky is nice enough but a hacker, sophisticated enough to hack the CIA - I don't think so. She gets the files and gives them to Jason because it's important for him to know his history. OK, let's say that is important to Jason - Nicky's working with another guy want to post all this info on the Internet. The files are encrypted so Jason goes to this guy who un-encrypts the files. While Jason is reading the documents, the CIA (in Langley) detects the computer Nicky had been using to hack the CIA and starts deleting the files. Reality check - 1st - where did Jason get Nicky's computer? She burned it when CIA traced her to this hacker cell. Why is Jason on the 'internet' when he's reading files that are stored on a thumb drive or locally on a laptop? Is the encryption-guy being stupid on purpose? Jason's no computer-geek, that's for sure, but the guy that undid the encryption should know about the dangers of being 'on the grid'. There's no reason for them to be on a network but - well - they are. So Jason just stands there reading documents and this guy tells Jason that it's important to let everyone know about what the CIA has been up to - and then this guy attacks Jason? What? Who is this guy working for.... ? CIA? I must have missed it. Jason beats up the guy, the files are deleted from a computer that was destroyed in the opening scenes of the movie but that the CIA detected to find Jason, and Jason starts looking for another analyst who was involved in the program when his father was with the agency. The plot sucks. The action is good. The bad guy is really bad and you really want Jason to get him - which happens - but not before there's a whole lot of gratuitous violence that didn't add to the plot, just to the character of the bad guy. Compared to the other Bourne movies, this is the worst. It's still good entertainment but it's not as smart as the others. Jason only gets to show off his fighting skills - not languages or map-memorizing. And Matt has really aged. Maybe that was intentional but part of the intrigue of the first three was all that Jason could do and still be fairly young. He looks at least 50 years old in this movie. Nicky looked virtually the same as she did in the 3rd installment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The latest Jason Bourne film is to be commended for its honesty but sadly, its not overly exciting....What really defined the Bourne franchise for me was their use of interesting locations, well crafted fight scenes, intelligence and frenetic pace. The latest outing gives the feeling the franchise has run out of steam. There's a discernible lack of pace and energy found in previous films. It takes too much time for this film to get going and when it does, it really goes nowhere terribly exciting. The fight scenes are of the throw away variety, the car chases seem absurd in an 80's action film, sort of way and there's a general "listlessness" that pervades the storyline. That said there is some thought and integrity that has gone into this film's scripting. Its to be applauded for pointing a spotlight on the Orwellian surveillance state antics, currently underway in the US and elsewhere. It also paints an less than complimentary portrait of the CIA, which is not for from historical fact. All in all, a mixed film that's watchable and has a commendable message but is lacking in the action department that made this franchise a success. Six out of ten from me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having just watched Jason Bourne (2016), I can candidly conclude it competes with The Bourne Identity for best story-line and The Bourne Ultimatum for unexampled action scenes. With the reintroduction of the original CIA hero Matt Damon (as Jason Bourne), this movie is the badly needed revitalising of the Bourne series after the break taken by Damon. He is unparalleled with relation to intense scene acting and his ability to spread a notion of eagerness across an already enlightened crowd explains clearly why he should have remained Jason Bourne throughout the entire series. On the whole, it is a great mix of action, logistics and tactics wherein Bourne secures another future blockbuster whilst both pleasing the crowd who watched this movie (2016) and enticing the same crowd; and attracting even more viewers, to watch the future sequel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After years on the sidelines, everyone's favourite forgetful and resourceful one man army Jason Bourne is back and while in many ways returning director Paul Greengrass's film is just as competent and pulsating as what has come before, Jason Bourne lacks the magic that made the original trilogy such a game changer and a first pick for those wanting their action thrills fast, frenetic and undeniably fun.To come back to a franchise after such a long hiatus is always as interesting proposition when consideration is made as to what was the driving force behind coming back for more when the story had seemingly been tied up and that is Jason Bourne's most glaring issue, the film just doesn't bring anything new to the table when what has been delivered before is still fresh in our collective memories and the mystery and intrigue that helped hook audiences previously is largely amiss here in a fairly cookie cutter story that takes far to long to get properly going.Greengrass and Christopher Rouse's story deserves little examining but rest assured it sees a battle wearied Bourne recalling once more memories of old after an old friend discovers more information about his history and from there Bourne almost gets relegated to a supporting role as Tommy Lee Jone's grizzled CIA man Robert Dewey and Alicia Vikander's computer wiz turned field operative Heather Lee get a majority of the films lead up before an action packed final stanza takes centre stage. It's curious that a film sold off the back of Jason Bourne's very name is so willing to have its star player say a handful of words and get a few big action plays and it suffers sometimes through it with a Snowden like side plot, although Vikander's Lee is easily the series finest new addition since its inception in 2002.As you can see, there's a significant portion of Jason Bourne that falls flat and pales in comparison to what has been served up before but a filmmaker of the talent of Greengrass's and with Damon once more returning to the character the redefined his career, Jason Bourne is still in many ways good dumb fun with a near breathless pacing, intensely designed and constructed action and played by a competent cast, it's still a sight bit better than most of its fellow genre entrants.Unlikely to be remembered in the same regards as Damon's early adventures but far from a series write off (hello Bourne Legacy), Jason Bourne does enough to suggest this initially surprising return to a beloved series has more life to live yet, but as this film often showcases it won't be a walk in the park especially if Bourne himself continues to get a somewhat short shift.3 1/2 chair legs out of 5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jason Re-Bourne?...A By the Numbers Experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Isn't it interesting that when the Bourne series debuted with the first installment Identity back in 2002 it pretty much showed Bond up for the pure ridiculous product it had become at the time and ushered in a new era of spy/conspiracy action thrillers, yet it would now appear that although the newest entry in the franchise Jason Bourne isn't at all a bad film it just seems....well OK.If any film could be accused of playing it safe or playing it by the book Jason Bourne would fit the bill.In terms of the storyline we follow the re-emergence of Matt Damon as Jason Bourne who has been in hiding, or more accurately was staying off the authorities radar in a plot that generally focuses on a conspiracy that involved the death of his father and of course this sets off a chain of events that involves high speed chase sequences being pursued by the authorities and some brutal fight/action scenes.So why my general apprehension towards the film? Director Paul Greengrass knows the notes that hit home and to many fans he probably plays them beautifully in line with what we'd expect, but isn't that the problem? The reason why Bourne was so successful in the first place was because it went against the grain of what was being made at the time and offered up a new and fresh take on not only conspiracy thrillers but gave the audience great intellectual credit and was also merged with some pulsating fighting/action sequences.To the infrequent cinemagoer the film is probably a very entertaining popcorn flick and will certainly do the job the makers generally set out to do but for me someone who is endlessly at the cinema it is going to have a harder time convincing of its qualities.Matt Damon is as watchable as ever but he's been in much better films recently, Alicia Vikander is probably one of the more interesting aspects of the film as the Head of a Cyber Ops Division in the CIA and her performance is certainly a more positive point, Tommy Lee Jones pretty much gruffs it in as the director of the CIA and Vincent Cassel positively surprises as an assassin/nemesis for Bourne to battle.It's a hard one this as Greengrass knows slick filmmaking and this film is as slick as anything, yet it feels way too predictable and familiar for my own personal liking but as I keep repeating the qualities of all those involved make this an above average film, it's just not a film I myself can get excited about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointment! Spoilers!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really looked forward to another great adventure with Jason Bourne. But all this movie was is the last breath of a dying franchise. The movie lacked everything the previous 3 had. The subplot about social-media, privacy and surveillance fell flat. There was no great hand-to -hand fights, thrilling car chases, a sense of urgency nor a good plot. There was a lot of loose threads in this movie that never really connected. Spoilers!!!!!!!!! Spoilers!!!!!!!!! Spoilers!!!!!!!!! Spoilers!!!!!!!!! Spoilers!!!!!!!!! Spoilers!!!!!!!!!It was a shame they killed Nicky Parsons so damn early. I really looked forward to get to know more about the shared history with her and Bourne. Instead we got a clichéd revenge story where his father died in a conspiracy and Bourne is on revenge. Boring... The first 30 minutes or so was good. The action sequence in Athens where great and reminiscent off Bourne of old. Though it went downhill from there and fast. The characters were largely uninteresting. Even Bourne himself wasn't good enough. He should have just stayed underground. All in all I hope this will be the last entering off this franchise and let it die while it still have a shred of dignity. I recommend you to lower your expectations a lot going into this. If you should see it see it for the great sequence in Athens!score: From start til Athens 9. Athens til end 5. Overall score of 7.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm just gonna say it. This film is a disappointment. It doesn't match up to the other Matt Damon 'Bourne' series.For starters, there is unnecessary death scene that is pointless and it would be better if they didn't bring back the character from a past 'Bourne' film.Also the story's kinda pretty boring. It was quite gripping at times, but for the most part too boring.The action was well shot and brutal. This is what makes it a 6/10 rather than a 4/10.So overall this film is a huge disappointment. I was hoping for at least a 6/10 JUST WITH STORY!! Hoping for an 8/10 overall.But sadly, I give this an 5.5/10 or 2.5 stars. I'm sorry to tell you, this is only worth watching if you are either stinking rich or can find it cheap on Blu-Ray/DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More Of The Same, But Worse</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Matt Damon and director Paul Greengrass returns to the "Bourne" series to make the 5th "Bourne" movie, "Jason Bourne." This is a perfect case of Hollywood squeezing every penny out of a story that should have ended a long time ago. "Bourne" fans: don't blame Damon ? if someone offered you millions to do a movie, you'd do it too.Okay, so the story of "Jason Bourne"?umm?have you seen the first three "Bourne" movies? Yes? Then you know the story to this fifth installment of the series. But let me give you some more details. Damon (as Bourne) is unhappily living a life "off the grid" beating the hell out of big guys for money, then he finds out about data stolen from the CIA computers that has info about Damon's past. Wait?didn't Damon already received this info from "Supremacy?" Well?this is new information! About Damon's daddy. And what daddy did while working for the CIA. And how daddy died. And who killed daddy. And daddy's connection to the super spy programs that Damon was tied to. Damon needs to know! So Damon resurfaces, CIA heads get afraid again and put out a kill order on Damon, Damon evades the assassins and gets closer to the truth and the bad guys, yada yada yada. Oh, there's a big, car chase sequence that goes on for so long, you can take a nap and when you wake up, it's still going. And there is still the common shenanigan in the "Bourne" movies where Damon, for the most part, wears no disguise despite being wanted by the biggest spy agency in the world.Well, let's get to it: my most memorable, movie moment of "Jason Bourne." That would be the scene when **SPOILER ALERT** Julia Stiles' character is killed. I liked her character, and I was sorry to see her go in such a violent manner. But at least Stiles won't have to suffer being in the 6th movie, "Bourne Again" or the 7th movie, "Bourne To Kill." If this movie was a financial instrument, it would be a savings account. Why? Because the returns are soooooo small. You put your time and money into a movie, only to get a teeny tiny bit that is new, and the rest is the same old stuff from before. This movie is tired, most of the actors here look tired, and the story is definitely tired and needs to be retired.Mannysmemorablemoviemoments</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Riskier, Less Intelligent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All sequels have the unenviable task of making a movie as good or at least as competent as the first installment (well in the case of sequels following good movies anyway). Jason Bourne was no different. Likewise, Jason Bourne was not different than sequels in that they are usually less original and less intelligent. Ordinarily, to make up for the lack of originality and/or intelligence there's added flash and bang. In the case of Jason Bourne they just made it much riskier. I got what I expected from Bourne (i.e. bad assness) but of course Bourne can't do it all alone. He always requires just a little bit of help from someone else that's connected (ala Nicky Parsons (Julia Stiles)). Nicky was again en force but there came some added assistance and it didn't add up to me. Without giving away the movie I'll suffice with saying as I said before, it was a little less intelligent.</fullReview>

The shaky camera combined with the crappy score, the flashing lights, the frequent and choppy camera cuts, and the over the top noises left me on the edge of vomiting and left others I know with a headache. The movie was almost impossible to watch because of this which is sad because it could have been good.

		<shortDescription>An expected failure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As it is the case with franchises that should have been left alone after the first original instalments, unless a brand new and unexpected story-line is brought forward, Jason Bourne fits the bill for the standard commercial sequel.No original plot, attempt to find substance in a prequel kind of way, very predictable and door is left open for more of the same are all traits that define that genre and JB has them all. I really enjoyed the 1st three movies and while the 1st one didn't have quite the same/vibe feel of the trilogy I found that it was an entertaining and enjoyable action movie in its own right.Jason Bourne is neither, though it has plenty of action but one simply doesn't watch a movie of this calibre and reputation solely for the standard fight and chase scenes. So 5/10 is my score and had I known it would be such a disappointment I would have waited for it on Netflix or cable TV. FYI: I usually rank my movies as Theater material, Video club worthy, can wait for it on Netflix or regular TV if it ever gets there and last and really the least(lol): Not worth my while.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was so looking forward to this release, again with Matt Damon, and it was disappointing, not in the limited story line or plot expectations, but in the extended use of Shaky cam during the action scenes. It was almost nauseating and I had to look away from the screen multiple times of what should have been high excitement.I give the others initial 3 movies 9, 8 and 8 and yes they had Shaky Cam, but this one was way over the top. It cheapened the whole experience.Overall I do like the Bourne movie series, and to be honest I would still recommend this movie to other affectionados; but with the shaky cam proviso. I hope they learn from this error of direction and production and that another movie is forthcoming.</fullReview>

I'm a fan of both Vincent Cassel and Matt Damon in action movies and would have loved to see an actual fight scene between them, but I guess it was too much to ask from Mister "I absolutely have to attach my cameras to a pile driver in motion just for the heck of it". So great job. Me and three of my forty something friends get to go out and see an action movie and we all come out of the theater with either nausea, a migraine or both.

		<shortDescription>Noisy and too much motion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just got back from the Jason Bourne movie. Although, it was a good suspenseful movie, it was very noisy. Lots of chases, fights and just noise. The theater had the sound too loud on top of that. Also, during all the action, the cameras never were still, so you could even get motion sick.It is nice to see Matt Damon still has what it takes to play this character even though he was much younger when this series started. Tommy Lee Jones plays his part well, naturally.During some of the satellite surveillance scenes, I found it a little unbelievable they could spot people in crowds and then zoom in to get a clear view. I think that satellite surveillance is probably pretty good but I doubt it is THAT good.In another scene, Bourne has a guy put an encrypted USB stick into a laptop. Immediately, back in the CIA, people there are able to find out where he is located because he opened a file. I am thinking, if the files are on the USB stick, why would they even have the computer connected to the internet? Wouldn't Bourne know enough not to do that? If there was more to it, they didn't make it clear.I may watch this movie again when it is out on Blu-ray where I can control the sound.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jason Bored. The worst one!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jason Bourne is back and more pointless and mundane than ever before. Even the title lacks excitement with its sole purpose presumably being to let fans know that the 5th installment in this franchise will once again include Matt Damon reprising his role as Jason Bourne. But a more apt title would have been Jason Bored as that was the overriding emotion I was feeling throughout the entire film. The studio obviously realised its mistake with the last film so went back to Matt Damon to milk this cash cow once again. The problem being is that everything got wrapped up at the end of the 3rd film so plausibly bringing Jason Bourne back into the series was always going to be difficult. These difficulties are apparent throughout with a weak plot and very little action to back it up. The end result is a drab affair. There's only 3 action scenes of note and 2 of those are over the top and overly long vehicular chases which just leaves one average fight scene left. Overall a very poor film in which I struggled to stay awake and found it impossible to care what happened next as the bad acting and implausible developments took their toll on my patience. This was the 5th and worst film in an already overrated and milked series. Let's hope to god there isn't a 6th.https://90secondrant.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was a big disappointment to the legend of the Borne trilogy, however it was a good action blockbuster for the summer, though. I had to watch the trilogy (I've watched the Borne franchise over and over, maybe totaling to more than 250 times each) just to get over the big disappointment to the 4th. No fresh, new ideas, no big thriller...Just repetitively going through the legend of the Bourne franchise. One silly suggestion: I predicted the title of the sequel 'Bourne Privacy'. The portion of Matt Damon was quite small..It seemed to me that it used a more or less confrontation composition between the 'Old' and 'New' generation within CIA, surrounding the individuals' privacy issue and the fight against the violation of the people's privacy...That might be one of ingredients of the sequel, if it comes out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, let me first get this out of the way: The movie itself is alright. A decent action movie with a plot that could be more shallow. It is nowhere close to the first movies, but I enjoyed the plot, characters and the story.What makes me not want to see this movie ever again was the shaky camera though. I think there are about 30 seconds in the whole movie where the camera isn't shaking. Even close up shots of a person speaking in a quiet scene has movement.Showing a map? Camera needs to shake! Building a gun together? Great time to shake that camera! Conversation between two people? Better shake some more and show 30 angles in 3 seconds.Seriously, video stabilization was invented for a reason. I was close to leaving the movie and I caught myself wishing the movie would swap for "No country for old man".Michael Bay is an amateur compared to whoever is responsible for that mess. I like to watch movies and relax, but that movie was work and pure stress.The most quiet moments were presented from ever switching angles and with shake. That's okay in action scenes to hide &amp; disguise cheap effects, but IT IS NOT A FEATURE! If you want to get motion sickness by watching a movie, that one might do the trick.</fullReview>

The actors they had are awesome but there was nothing for them to do there. Maybe it got better later but the movement of the camera, the zoom in and out without any visible purpose , shaking even when there was no action scene , it felt like a primary school project of someone who never filmed before.I'm not a film critic I don't notice these kind of things in the films I watch. In my opinion if you like Bourne do not watch this one. If you like action movies it will be ruined by how the camera is used.</fullReview>

Way too unbelievable. That foolishness went out with 24 and their super-duper control room in Los Angeles. And the story line on the premise that they have to "stop" the CIA from running black ops? And after all this time he starts remembering the circumstances in his father's death? Too unbelievable...too many plot holes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chunder-cam Alive And Kicking In This Cash-Grab Mess</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like so many others here I'm still a huge fan of the first three Bourne movies. At the time they were fresh and (for the most part) intelligent, and represented a massively needed kick in the backside to the spy action/thriller genre : so much so, that there can be no doubt that Casino Royale wouldn't have been half the film it turned out to be if it wasn't for Bourne breathing down Bond's neck. The beauty of the original Bourne trilogy is that it was essentially a complete story with no need (or indeed room) for any natural continuation of Bourne's story. He had found out who he was, exorcised his demons, disposed of those who needed disposing, and appeared to everyone who mattered to be dead, thus allowing him to disappear and get on with his life. Job done. To continue the series at all then a change of direction was needed, and in my opinion it was actually a very smart move to attempt something a little different with Jeremy Renner in Legacy, although the film itself was still no-where near the quality of the originals as it ventured into full-on make-believe-land with superman-pills, etc. So with all that in mind, a return by Bourne himself after a 9 year absence needed something very special indeed to avoid simply rehashing what went before. And unfortunately in that regard the film-makers have completely and utterly failed. Jason Bourne is nothing more than a collection of ideas from the first 3 movies that have been lightly dusted off, then liberally doused in laughably unbelievable "IT-speak", and then filmed in good ol' 90's style shaky vomit-cam. And yet, despite just being a rehash of action sequences from the original trilogy, none of them were remotely as thrilling or engaging as anything from the first three films - no doubt primarily due to the fact that the shaky camera-work and 3 cuts per second mean you can never see what the hell is going on! The original Bourne movies all had a whiff of shaky-cam about them, but here it's ramped up to a new level, and then also combined with the most frenetic editing imaginable. When, oh WHEN are directors going to realise that shaky-cam is the most hideous, nausea-inducing "technique" ever to be inflicted upon paying film-goers?! Yes, yes we all know it's supposed to portray energy and movement, but the only movement it generates in me is of the bowel variety! That and a serious turning of the stomach. As I say above, the hilarious "IT-speak" throws anyone with even a passing knowledge of IT completely out of the movie, and when you combine that with the CIA's apparently instantaneous ability to "enhance" any image no matter how blurred, instantly hack into any CCTV feed anywhere in the world, re-task satellites in a matter of seconds, hack a computer using a mobile phone just placed near it, etc, etc, you quickly realise you're watching a no-brain, no-thought, cynical cash-grab of a movie. Oh and there's only so many times you can here some random suit say, "My god, that's Jason Bourne" while staring at a computer screen, before it all seems rather tired and old-hat. The whole movie just feels very cynical, clichéd and frankly unnecessary. I also felt the Vegas car chase was single-handedly the most unrealistic chase in any of the Bourne films. For a purportedly gritty and realistic series, seeing a SWAT vehicle ploughing lines of cars 10 feet up into the air, and coming away with nothing more than a bit of paint damage had all the realism of a computer game. What's that van supposed to be made of? Unobtainium? "Indestructium"? More likely "Leave-Brain-At-The-Doorium". For the first time ever with a Bourne movie (and I'm even including Legacy here) I was actually bored watching it. The only thing that felt fresh about this movie was how out of ideas it all felt. I never thought I'd say it, but I genuinely hope Bourne is put out to pasture now as there really isn't anywhere else to go with this character and his story. In summary, this movie is a less than average actioner/thriller that dumps on the legacy of the original Bourne trilogy by taking a great character and storyline, and turning it into a boring recycled mess, while also inducing violent stomach-churning in all but the hardiest of viewers. Quite an achievement in anyone's book...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'd like to start off with the end where my eyes spotted that Matt Damon was actually the producer of this continued or resurrected franchise. That means one thing - he was into it all, into the role, into the movie itself, all along. He owns it, literally and metaphorically. Julia Stiles in her brief, I should say, appearance as well. This is where the good cast ends and the miscast begins. As a huge fan of Alicia Vikander in her most prominent, at least until now, role in Ex Machina where her star rose, she acted bad in Jason Bourne. I completely agree with those of the reviewers who pointed out the one single fact - she looked too young for this. And is too young for it. This babyface look, those bright eyes, that forehead without a single wrinkle - come on, Greengrass, have a little respect. The idea that Heather Lee is the fresh wannabe director of CIA, contrasting Robert Dewey and the figure of an old fashioned boss, just doesn't work. Jason Bourne and the way he "communicated" with Vikander's character was a huge no-no as well. The experienced killing machine, the ultimate thinker and strategy follower just didn't fall good on the image of the innocent and even naive but quite ambitious young lady, aiming to get a grip of the national security system. Bullshit. Tommy Lee Jones, with all my respect to his achievements so far, simply didn't play in this movie. A few wise words here and there in the quite greyish acting don't work. Let alone the plot weaknesses after the scenes, shot in Greece (those were very delicately touched). That's where Vincent Cassel bursts in - looking sinister, having a few types of guns in each hand and being a good driver of a SWAT vehicle mean nothing. He deserves roles in Darren Aronofsky from now on only. Seriously, as much as I loved Vincent in Oceean's 12 and that cheesy capoeira scene that still gives me goosebumps after all those years, he just lacked all his talent in Jason Bourne. Honestly, I was laughing my *** off by the end of the movie - with the chasing and action shooting between the Asset and Bourne in the streets of Vegas, where about 60 cars were smashed and where the civil vehicle, driven by Matt Damon's character, kept its cool. What a machine - one that's clearly made of plastic and aluminum and still manages to move somehow when it's supposed to fall into pieces right after the second crash in reality. Overall, I admit I was thrilled to see it, didn't feel disappointed after I did but I expected a lot more from both Damon and Greengrass. My enormous frustration here is called Alicia Vikander, apology to The Academy. But oh well...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I prepared myself for this one, watching all the main Bourne films during the week so I could see it on Sunday. Ultimatum jumped out as the best one, however, the other two were just decent action-spy movies. And this one is no difference, is not bad, but it didn't take the good parts of the trilogy and just did the same mistakes all over again. The main villain is a extremely bad 60 years old man (Tommy lee Jones), the fight with the other assassin wasn't as over the top or fun to watch as the first movie and the car chase, even as awesome as it was, wasn't as tense as the one in Supremacy. Jason Bourne isn't that much of a great protagonist and the ending is just sequel bait, is not bad but I wish they would just end the series with the next one, because trust me, there will be another one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Huge let down... Go watch something else like the 'The Secret Life of Pets'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>_____Bourne is weaker_____Bourne Ultimatum - Waterloo Station is one of the finest action sequences in a movie ever. Greengrass takes the viewer on a ride in real-time as if they're the journalist being hunted. The source material here is good but its wasted by lame choices. Bourne is made weaker by making him indifferent. Giving him no purpose apart from getting his face pounded in or chasing a half-baked vendetta (feeble attempt to bring family into the backstory). Its like watching plot holes from Prison Break 3/4. Its not justified or earned. The movie would have been much more effective if Bourne had sided with the whistleblowers or went back to work at the agency or started working for the GoogleBook-like CIA-funded start-up._____ Bourne is unlikeable_____ How good this movie could have been if had opened with an Ultimatum like chase scene where we see a Julian Assange like whistleblower being hunted down using the CIA's new 'track everybody all the time' system. Then later in retaliation we watch Bourne rescue someone from the same net, and we know he's finally back. But here by making Bourne indifferent, they've created no empathy, even made him unlikeable and apathetic (scenes with Julia Styles especially). For example, the writers choose to send him to where all washed up action stars go, bare knuckle fighting in some backwater, waiting to be emotionally rescued. But that point never comes for Bourne. So horrible choice number one is that Bourne's character doesn't care about anything anymore except copying bad opening sequences from past lame Stallone / Van-Damme movies. Then he just becomes a passenger in his own story, feeling irrelevant._____Not showing 'Iron Hand' is unforgivable_____ We never actually see the Person-of-Interest like 'always-on' spying system either. So what happened to the rule show don't tell? This is a major oversight as it ignores past cinematic insight that hacking and malware are pretty boring exposition otherwise. Rule 101, always show human consequences and fallout instead. Not scenes with typing like 'Running predictive algorithm', as its about as interesting as cardboard. Movies like Swordfish manage to pull it off with smoke and mirrors, but that touch of class is absent here. For that look to TV. There is a scene in the final season of Person of Interest where an evil super AI sends an anonymous alert to passengers on a subway train. Its to trick them into attacking a supposed terrorist (and its all done by feeding fake news to smartphones). Angles like this would have added a lot and leveraged the whole social media aspect. But the direction never went there sadly._____Privacy Debate_____ One surprise was the time given over to privacy, or privacy versus security, or sacrificing the same in the name of patriotism etc. The fact that it took a Bourne movie to shine a light on a topic the mass media overlooks is laudable. But it's a debate that gets overshadowed by Bourne's character not caring. It would have been interesting to see inside 'Iron Hand', and glimpse how far and invasive the system could be as it intrudes into people's lives. To spy on or subtlety influence people's behavior. After all this is what Google and Facebook are all about. You can read more about that by searching on "Surveillance Capitalism @ www.theguardian.com". Its pretty sobering! Essentially spying on behavior to influence for profit. But not to digress._____Car-Chases_____There were few surprises here and this was a movie that was ripe for remote car hacking etc. Greece was a great location during the riots but Bourne seemingly just takes a country ride through the city. And the Vegas chase just looked unrealistic, like transformers cinematography..._____Supporting Actors _____ Tommy Lee Jones should have passed on this, and Cassel more so. If you haven't seen Vincent Cassel in Mesrine Killer Instinct (2008). Stop reading and just go and get hold of a copy right now. Its a cinematic masterpiece, not Hollywood leftovers. _____Franchise is Probably Dead _____ They can still fix this if they make more. But I fear in the next movie we'll discover that Bourne's Mother has secretly been running the CIA all along, like ludicrous plot twists out of Prison Break Seasons 3+4. Who knows if Greengrass even gets final cut anymore. 'Running predictive algorithm', nicely sums up Hollywood's playbook for kicking out films now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Disappointed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a big fan of Matt Damon as well as Tommy Lee Jones... but even these two great actors couldn't save what was a very weak script and thin story. I felt like I watched 60 minutes of chase scenes. The "Black Ops" CIA wet-work character, played by Vincent Cassel, basically killed everyone he saw... a sociopathic murderer instead of a stone-cold assassin. I'm pretty sure, real life professional CIA operators don't want to annihilate everyone they see. While it had plenty of action, I wasn't invested in the characters, and found the lack of a real "story" extremely disappointing... I always expect greatness from my favorite actors!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The 3 stars are all for Alicia who does a good job. It is not her fault that she was miscast so terribly... I wanted to like this movie so much but you really don't get a chance. There is no story, no character development, only one single death scene to empathise with Bourne, no love story, no real drama... All you get is one chase after the other and even they make no sense. On top of this they are shot with the now standard "shaky" camera but then edited at a speed that most of the time it is a blur and not enjoyable. Extremely disappointed, there could have been so much more. The Bourne story has so many angles and room to grow into. All in all very sad...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Quite "shaking" the dang camera so we can see. Absolutely terrible camera action and you can hardly make out the action scenes. I was SO disappointed as it was hard to make out what was going on. WHY does it have to be like that? Back the camera up, quite moving it, and enjoy the action. Even if you had to insert CGI, it would have been better than this. AND, even the last 2 of the Bourne Trilogy was a bit much with the camera. I just don't get it. I was SO looking forward to this movie. As far as it being just another Jason Bourne, isn't that what we want? The story was okay, but by far, no forethought with Jason. Things were random. And remember what Nicki said? "Jason doesn't do random". Well, he did random in this movie and it took away from his character. Not a good movie at all. I NEVER go to the movies. I haven't been in over 10 years. I just wait for them to come out DVD as I have a home theater system at home. But I wanted to see this SO bad I couldn't wait. Well, I should've have waited. What a disappointment. Does anyone know where we can write to complain about the camera action? Don't they get it ?!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good to see the Team back in place for this new installment. There is a Paul Greengrass touch to the directing of Bourne and of course Matt Damon IS Bourne so it's nice to be thrown back in this now familiar universe.The movie benefits from a very strong cast: Tommy Lee Jones and Vincent Cassel are Great antagonists and even the supporting Alicia Vikander and Riz Ahmed are very strong in their roles. Good action, good set pieces and strong fight scenes make this a fun movie.The plot is full of twists, is convoluted in the right "spy thriller" type of way and fills holes in Bourne's past... as usual. I want to say that this "as usual" is the biggest flaw of this movie. If you are familiar with the previous episodes, there is a little (tiny) fatigue of "oh are we filling some more holes in his past again?". Other than that Jason Bourne is a good thriller, better than 90% of the spy movies out there</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a huge Jason Bourne fan. I love the first three movies and especially the Bourne Legacy with Jeremy Renner. This movie was okay as part of the series but the most disappointing of the four movies with Matt Damon.Matt Damon stated that he was holding out for Paul Greengrass to direct. Mr. Greengrass co-wrote the screenplay. I did not like the plot lines. The cast is all wrong for this movie. None of the characters from Bourne Ultimatum or the Bourne Legacy are present. Tommy Lee Jones is a great actor but he is all wrong in this movie.There were some things brought up in the Bourne Ultimatum (the third in the trilogy) regarding a possible past relationship between Jason Bourne and Nicky Parsons (Julia Stiles) that are ignored in this fourth movie. My whole anticipation of this sequel was to see those explored. I had always been drawn to the Bourne women of these movies. That element is missing this time. This is the darkest of the four movies.We may not see a fifth now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bourne of Desperation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Bourne trilogy of espionage thrillers, including "The Bourne Identity" (2002), "The Bourne Supremacy" (2004) and "The Bourne Ultimatum" (2007), set new standards for realistic spy movies in the 21st century that even prompted the James Bond producers to follow suit with more plausible 007 escapades. When the spin-off saga "The Bourne Legacy" performed adequately at the box office (a rumored "Legacy" sequel is pending), Damon and "Bourne Supremacy/Ultimatum" director Paul Greengrass changed their minds about making another "Bourne." Initially, Greengrass didn't want to return to the franchise for fear that a fourth film might not surpass their previous "Bourne" outings. Mind you, Bourne no longer suffers from amnesia, but he finds himself inexorably drawn back into the web of intrigue when he discovers that his late father may have created the sinister CIA Treadstone program that deployed Bourne as a contract assassin. Sadly, the latest entry in the globe-trotting franchise, director Paul Greengrass' "Jason Bourne" appears to have been Bourne of sheer desperation. Everything that distinguished the first three "Bourne" movies as memorable spy melodramas appears conspicuously absent from "Jason Bourne." Indeed, "Jason Bourne" qualifies as the least imaginative sequel compared with its predecessors. Despite a mediocre screenplay co-written by Christopher Rouse and Greengrass, "Jason Bourne" boasts an agile as ever Matt Damon tangling with two bloodthirsty dastards played respectively by Tommy Lee Jones and Vincent Cassel. Julia Stiles, who appeared in the first three "Bourne" epics, reprises her role as Nicky Parsons. It should come as no surprise that she doesn't stick around long. When we meet Jason Bourne (Matt Damon of "The Martian") again, he has been surviving off-the-grid, like Tom Cruise's Jack Reacher, and earning pocket change by slugging it out of brawny opponents in illegal bare-knuckled brawls, like Clint Eastwood did in "Every Which Way but Loose." Meantime, not only has ex-CIA agent Nicky Parsons (Julia Stiles of "Save the Last Dance") hacked into the Agency's Langley, Virginia, computers, but she has also downloaded Treadstone files that Bourne will want to read. Little does Nicky know it but a new CIA cyber-security wizard, Heather Lee (Alicia Vikander of "Ex Machina"), has planted Malware in those files. This Malware will enable Heather to track down Nicky wherever she goes to access those files. Nicky arranges to meet Bourne in Athens during an explosive riot. Before she can get down to cases with Bourne, ruthless CIA Director Robert Dewey (Tommy Lee Jones of "No Country for Old Men") dispatches a sharpshooting assassin, designated The Asset (Vince Cassel of "Ocean's Twelve"), to terminate our hero with extreme prejudice. This particular Asset had suffered unspeakably in the past because Bourne exposed another clandestine operation run by the CIA. The Asset wound up in enemy hands, and it took the Agency two years to rescue him. One way or another, the vengeance-sworn Asset is determined to kill Bourne. Heather Lee doesn't think death is the best solution for Bourne. Despite Dewey's strenuous objections, Lee convinces CIA National Security Director Edwin Russell (Scott Shepherd of "Side Effects") to bring Bourne back into the fold. Predictably, Dewey plays along with Russell's orders, but Dewey keeps the Asset on call. Naturally, the Asset is itching for an opportunity to perforate Bourne. During its first hour, "Jason Bourne" globe-trots from Iceland to Greece to England and finally to Las Vegas, with Bourne pursuing Dewey and the Asset in pursuit of Bourne. Neither the tenacious villains nor our indestructible hero are prepared to call it quits. The problem with "Jason Bourne" is its formulaic plot piles clichés atop of standard-issue "Bourne" conventions. Practically speaking, "Jason Bourne" recycles many of the best scenes from Damon's earlier "Bourne" jaunts. Bourne isn't as resourceful here because his CIA adversaries are such buffoons. No close-quarters combat scenes in "Jason Bourne" match the clash in "The Bourne Supremacy" where Bourne wielded a rolled-up magazine as a deadly weapon. If rank and file CIA agents are as imbecilic as they are in "Jason Bourne," it's a miracle terrorists don't slice up America like a pizza. Remember, it is only movie. Nevertheless, Greengrass and Rouse don't do much to make things singular. Most of what Greengrass and Rouse have scripted here occurred earlier in "The Bourne Supremacy" and "The Bourne Ultimatum." The death of the Bourne damsel in "Jason Bourne" resembles the demise of Marie in "The Bourne Supremacy." Inevitably, Bourne and his girlfriend flee from an assassin who has targeted our hero rather than the heroine. Repeatedly, he misses the hero by a hair but kills the girl. The assassination of one male character reminded me of the murder of the English journalist in "The Bourne Supremacy." The Athens riot is reminiscent of the Berlin protests in "The Bourne Supremacy." Any time that Bourne plunges into action, the CIA winds up monitoring his every move from Langley on a big-screen with scores of technicians tweaking the signals. Teams of assassins are assembled and sent to corner him, and he experiences few problems eliminating whatever threat that they pose to him.Greengrass uses his jittery trademark editing to generate anxiety about Bourne's shenanigans. You cannot get comfortable watching a "Bourne" movie because the filmmakers are bouncing you around the globe while the villains are kneading their hands in fiendish collaboration about their next Bourne trap. Tommy Lee Jones makes a formidable villain up until his last scene when he refuses to shoot first and ask questions later. Movies are all about seeing superstars strutting their stuff. Some of the antics that the characters indulge in defy common sense. Jason Bourne is the CIA's most sought-after man, but he neither dons a disguise nor keeps a low profile when he cavorts in public. Interestingly, Bourne's male CIA superiors are as determined to kill him as his female CIA superiors are determined to keep him alive. Despite all the bloodshed and treachery, "Jason Bourne" brings the franchise full circle so as to spawn several sequels.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Definitely a money grabber, piggy backing on the success of the trilogy. This movie fell short is so many ways, using old clichés, over the top car chases, lazy writing, and aggravating shaky cameras.Forewarning, there are mild spoilers in this.Within ten minutes of the movie we are thrown into this ridiculous cyber battle with all the typical clichés: fast typing for no reason, viruses and bugs only take seconds to work, etc. the hacking theme is actually used throughout the movie, to the extent where it becomes unbelievable. the CIA can apparently hack a cell phone not connected to anything and use it to wipe all the information on a nearby laptop.. Yet later in the movie they can't hack a cell phone Bourne stole from a guy the CIA was watching to find out Bourne's location? What??Speaking of the CIA, for some reason Hollywood thinks they still need to have every government agent who is talking via headset/earpiece touch their ear or put their wrist to their mouth. Cmon, give the audience some credit, I think we all can see that they are talking to another agent, stop with the hand gestures already! This is so 20 years ago.Another gripe on the CIA.. none of them are good! Even the girl who you think is good winds up trying to screw Bourne over in the end. I mean, they even use their assassin asset to kill other CIA agents just to get to Bourne before other agents.There are so many other things bad with this movie, (shaky cameras in every scene, horrible dialogue, people dying for no reason), but the thing that made me just not care anymore was the car chase. The antagonist asset is trying to flee from Bourne and out of ALL the vehicles around him to take he decides to steal a police SWAT truck, killing a cop in the process (which was one of many unnecessary kills), while Bourne takes a Dodge Charger. As the chase rolls on vehicles are getting smashed up and thrown around like little matchbox cars. Which, okay, it IS a SWAT truck so I could see that, but then he plows straight through a mass of parked cars and they go flying 15 feet in the air and he comes out the other side without putting a dent on the pretty little SWAT truck, or without losing any significant speed...WTH, it's a lightly armored police vehicle, not a f***ing tank. you can clearly tell that these flying cars were stripped to bare bones to pull off this stunt.The plot was also weak, it took me less than an hour in to figure this one out, but yet it took Jason F***ing Bourne till the very end? Really? i mean a little kid could've figured it out sooner.The only good thing I have to say is it's Jason Bourne, and he's a bad ass. The fight scenes are good, when you can see what's going on, and the acting is decent for the unoriginal script they had. Wait for Rental.</fullReview>

Las veags chase scene and then fight scene was perfect, Athens scene was good too but editing was too fast to enjoy scene. So if u wanna enjoy jb, better watch in non 3D format, only way to save urself from dilemma state.all those who r giving lame reviews here claming themselves bourne fan, are surely not !! Legacy got praise later,similarly it will too Matt damon is best with paul greengrass, waiting for another sequel but should be based on novels and lesser chaos.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This latest and possibly(but not probably) final installment in the Bourne franchise continues along the lines of its predecessors. Bourne is back and continues to pursue the secret of his past, wrecking havoc along the way. This similarity to the original trilogy both enhances and detracts from the enjoyment of this movie. Having seen portions of Supremacy and Ultimatum, and enjoying them, I watched the entire of Identity with high expectations, and I have to admit, they weren't entirely met. I felt that while the hand to hand combat was impressive, the rest was more akin to a generic spy movie. Going into "Jason Bourne", I lowered my expectations, coming to terms with the action-centric nature of Bourne films. The reason this movie exists and the reason news of its making was greeted with general excitement was because the Bourne films have always been captivating, and more of it would always be welcome. The idea was to show Bourne in his routine yet again; on the run. And this was successfully accomplished. The problem arises in that while Bourne is doing what he does best, the story around him is also precisely the same. Much like Star Wars Force Awakens, Jason Bourne fails to be creative in the story department. The action though competent through most of the movie, takes a turn for the worse towards the end. The background score is intense, but its repetitive use turns cumbersome. The direction was definitely energetic and zany. Damon does a fine job, as does Alicia Vikander. Spoilers ahead- While I found Bourne's actions short of exposition and reasoning, the one moment I really "rooted" for him would be when at the end, he viciously pulls the hat from under Heather, giving in to the end credits with Extreme Ways by Moby playing. A slick stylish last scene that brought back the character's smarts amidst the punches. End of Spoiler.All in all, Jason Bourne is entertaining, but just about so. It's story is recycled and it's characters are largely one note. The script is swift and action intense. This is fair game with the potential to have been so much more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Franchise Maintenance at Its Laziest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I never truly understood the appeal of the Bourne Series (2002- Present). On the surface the original trilogy had all the makings of an above-average action spy flick; a charismatic lead, a taut and compelling story-line, unique action set-pieces topped off with competent (if hard to see) fighting choreography. Yet postmortem labeling the originals as the "thinking-man's action trilogy" is giving way too much credit to what is essentially a shell game a degree grittier than Alias (2001-2006). But hey both the James Bond and the Jack Ryan series' were contrivances of their former selves by the time Identity was released, so I suppose next to Die Another Day (2002) and Sum of All Fears (2002) Bourne (Damon) was a godsend.But in case no one got the message, we're not living in 2002. If the Bourne series was a person it'd be old enough to hold down a menial part-time job; which is about the quantity and quality of work dedicated to Jason Bourne the newest and most disappointing installment. Jason Bourne finds sidelined ally Nicky Parsons (Stiles) hacking into the CIA's mainframe and stealing meta-data for a political hacktivist named Dassault (Kiefer). While doing so she digs up more information on Bourne and his life before joining the clandestine Black Ops program that made him into a super-smart killing machine. This new information implicates CIA Director Robert Dewey (Jones) and retroactively absolves Bourne from any complicity in making him the super-smart killing machine he is, basically turning the best movie of the series, Ultimatum (2007), into little more than a hiccup. Meanwhile Dewey is having a spat with Silicon Valley tech billionaire Aaron Kalloor whose new social media enterprise is to be released. Dewey wants access to the code to "keep America safe," while Kalloor wants his new platform to be a "revolution in internet privacy," despite, of course, being bankrolled by the big bad federal government.If taken as an action thriller completely free from context, Jason Bourne could have been worse. As the nearly catatonic Bourne, Matt Damon still wears the character like a comfortable, worn-out shoe bringing to mind the muscled, tank-topped grisliness of Sylvester Stallone in Rambo III (1988). He's a bit of a lark but his constant quest for self-determination still holds a certain dimmed purity next to the morally ambiguous excreta his enemies lather in. The frenetic pace of the car chases brings the most amount of satisfaction. Director Paul Greengrass aptly utilizes the neon glinted Las Vegas strip and the urban, stair dominated corridors of the Canary Islands (Athens in the movie) to create some real tension. Fans of the series will also be glad to know that the controlled chaos shaky-cam aesthetic is back...so hurrah for that.Yet Jason Bourne fails to deliver on almost all other counts giving its audience pale imitations of what they once enjoyed. The kinetic fight sequences that made the first films so compelling has been replaced by frenetic shots of CIA control rooms where operatives are frantically clacking away at computers. Gone are the days of close- range brawling replaced by people in suits walking down busy streets with stubborn obstinacy. Instead of a the cool, calculated Clive Owen or the mischievous Karl Urban, we get a hotheaded and vengeful Vincent Cassel whose backstory we couldn't give two s**ts about.Then of course there's Tommy Lee Jones whose neocon Bush Era, Blackwater, shadow government, conspiratorial wish-fulfillment fantasy B.S. is just sad now. Don't get me wrong, Jones sells the hell out of it in the best way a coasting star could, but his very inclusion in a modern spy thriller is about as current as having a Russian with a five o'clock shadow playing the bad guy. At least the film somewhat acknowledges the character's anachronistic inclusion by having him butt heads with the socially conscious Kalloor and upstart CIA agent Heather Lee (Vikander).The results of Dewey and Kalloor's Faustian bargain could and should have been the "smart-man" interjection that everyone seems to be prattling on about. Instead of being stitched into the plot however, issues of internet privacy remains in the stratosphere. At no point is Bourne, Parsons or young Nicky Parsons replacement Heather made aware of Dewey's machinations, yet in a flurry of half-remembered memories, Bourne vows revenge, thwarting Dewey as an undeserved bonus.Jason Bourne is franchise maintenance at its absolute laziest. It's the unneeded piece of pie after a three course meal. A reboot of a system already out of date. No one wanted it, no one deserved it, yet here it is, cashing in the good name of its predecessors for a chance to get into the clubhouse. Frankly even the series' cousin Bourne Legacy (2012) is asking you not to let it in.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Shallow Imitation, That Only Gets Half Right</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bourne has been off the grid for the last ten years, spending his time in underground fight rings where he owns every opponent he's matched against. Meanwhile Nicky Parsons has joined a hacker group who seek to expose the corrupt powers that be. When she uncovers more mysteries surrounding Bourne's involvement in Treadstone, as well as a new program called Iron Hand, she wastes little time in bringing it to the man himself. Of course that brings the attention of the CIA, a newly recruited Cyber Analyst, and of course an Asset who holds a personal grudge against Bourne. Tied loosely into all of this is a social media platform called Deep Dream that got it's success thanks to providing private information to the government, but no longer wants to follow that path. Cue cat-and-mouse chase across the world.Story-wise, Jason Bourne is a disappointment. In many ways it feels like a retread of Supremacy where Bourne is dragged back into the CIA's games somewhat unwillingly, but at the promise of uncovering more about his past. Not only that, but his female ally gets shot, he has a one-sided car chase with the Asset, and there's a member of the CIA with his own agenda against Bourne. I don't have too much of a problem with all of that though, as it's still dressed up fairly fresh so it doesn't feel like too much of a retread. My disappointment with the story was the revelation to Bourne's past wasn't that much of a revelation. In the original trilogy, every new bit of information he uncovered about himself had a massive impact on him as a character and on the franchise as a whole. Here it feels a little lacklustre, and says more about the film's antagonists than it does Bourne himself. It felt a bit like a "so what?" situation.While the story is half of what made the Bourne franchise so entertaining, the other half was the action, and in that regard Jason Bourne feels like a nostalgic trip back. Right from Nicky and Bourne's first meeting, this feels like a Bourne movie. He manipulates their tails cleverly in order to split them up and ditch them entirely, making the whole sequence feel like a solid cat-and- mouse chase like the very best the original trilogy had to offer. There's a couple of car chases too, and while the last one does stretch believability a little bit, I can't deny how entertaining it was to see a SWAT truck just effortlessly plow through a queue of cars. The only criticism I might hold for the action sequences is the hand-to-hand fights that Bourne made so entertaining has lost it's magic here, but I think that's more to do with the context of the sequence, making it a bit of an anti-climax.Visually this feels like a typical Bourne movie as well, particularly Supremacy and Ultimatum. It's that classic Greengrass touch. Yes, shaky-cam is back and just as shaky as always. If it was a detraction for you in those two previous movies, it'll be a detraction for you in this movie as well. I don't have an intrinsic problem with shaky-cam, what I have a problem with is when those shaky-cam shots are close-ups and blurry. Jason Bourne is exactly that, making it hard to make out exactly what's going on. I can't help but feel the action would've been more entertaining if the cameras just zoomed out a little bit so we could see what was going on. Frenetic works, but not all the time in every action scene.Acting was serviceable from everyone. Matt Damon is as Bourne as always, although this time looking a little rougher round the edges in his older age, a point which made the central motivation of the CIA to bring him back in a little puzzling. Let's be honest, Bourne's probably passed his peak physicality now. Alicia Vikander proves again that she's got what it takes, but her character lacks the necessary development to make her all that interesting. Her yo-yoing would have had a lot more impact if we understood where she came from. Also, it's only later that we understand she has a personal link to the CEO of Deep Dream. Tommy Lee Jones is obviously just here for the paycheck, but he doesn't fone in it either. He brings that double-edged...edge to the slightly corrupt CIA director. Vincent Cassel is as great and foreboding as ever. Not only that, but he probably gets more to do than any other Asset in the franchise so far. I mean, he actually has a personal motivation for the mission, and shows a shimmer of personality entirely absent from any other Asset we've seen.Jason Bourne was, on the whole, a little bit a disappointment, including the unimaginative title. The action sequences are enough to remind you that this is Bourne, back and taking names, but that was only ever half of the recipe. Without that engaging mystery driving every move on both sides, Jason Bourne feels like a hollow imitation of the original product. I give it a 6/10, purely for entertainment and nostalgic purposes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too much of the same</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed all five Bourne flicks, but this is the worst of the lot. A waste of talent, because it's a great cast and they turn out good performance; and Greengrass directs the story at a tight pace, keeping your interest throughout. BUT (and it's a big but)...The whole script reads like a repetition of what we've seen before: car chases and power plays within the CIA; only this time, it's not as creatively written as it was on the first three films of the franchise.There are too many car chases and they are too long. You should leave the audience wanting more, rather than wanting less. And, as noted by other reviewers, the chases ask too much suspension of disbelief. (1) a small car keeping up with a motorbike in the streets of Athens? Come on!... Motorbikes have much more acceleration... In real life, you turn three corners and the car is more than a block away. (2) the Vegas chase looks like a video game with two indestructible cars cutting through a hundred others that melt like cheap plastic.Too many gratuitous killings. In Bourne #1, a CIA assassin kills the landlady in Paris and that is shocking, since she was an innocent bystander who did not need to be killed. This time, the assassin kills half a dozen innocent bystanders throughout the film. Anybody who crosses his path gets it between the eyes... This actually has less dramatic value and detracts from reality.The final showdown between Bourne and Dewey is such a cliché... Was creativity also shot by the CIA assassin between Athens and Vegas?Similarly, the final fight between Bourne and the assassin has zero creativity in its choreography. Usually, you expect that the good guy kills the bad guy in an unusual way, that the confrontation is resolved creatively. Not in this case. Disappointing.Of course, the story ends in a way that sets up the coming of Bourne # 6... And there are some unanswered questions that will most likely be addressed in the next flick. I just hope they put more effort into writing a creative story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The return of jason bourne</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nearly 10 years since matt damon last appearance in the franchise and four years after the jason bourne less film bourne legacy, the character comes back in full force after being forced out of hiding when his ally nicky parsons finds out about his past and his father possibly playing a role in the film. While i fo wish previous characters like pamela landy was in the film since her presence is missed. Matt damon plays jason now more as a quiet character who is forced to battle against the cia who continue to hunt him. While the ever annoying shaky cam is still in the film but it still has great action and awesome scenery.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jason Bourne Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hello there folks. I know it has been since March that I have posted. And I am sorry about that. I have been busy as of late. So, why don't we just jump right into it? Today I will review Jason Bourne.Synopsis: The most dangerous former operative of the CIA is drawn out of hiding to uncover hidden truths about his past. Stars: Matt Damon, Tommy Lee Jones, Vincent Cassel, Alicia Vikander Director: Paul GreengrassOkay, so Matt Damon and Paul Greengrass decided to come back for this Bourne after The Bourne Legacy. And all of the fans rejoiced. That's not to say that Legacy was a bad movie (but it was) but it was so much better to have these two men back, even with Damon's propaganda about violence and guns recently.The basic story of this one is that Nicky from the first three movies finds out something about Bourne's past, so she lets him know. That brings Bourne out of hiding to exact revenge on the men that did it to him. Now, if you remember the last time that they took a classic spy movie and turned it into a revenge story it didn't turn out so good. In case you're wondering, that movie was License to Kill. Not that good of a movie. But this movie got it right.Of course, with the action scenes, you get that choppiness that Greengrass has become famous for. And it doesn't get any better with this one. That is the reason for the rating I give it. Yes, there is realism there, but I want to be able to understand what is going on in the fights. The acting is top notched for this one. You have Matt Damon who actually is the best choice for Bourne. Tommy Lee Jones as the person who is hunting Bourne down. Haven't seen him in that type of role before. Vincent Cassel as an equal to Bourne was the best part of the acting. And the relative newcomer Alicia Vikander as a type of outsider to the situation that is going on was right on. Greengrass was able to pick the right people for their roles.All in all, out of the five Bourne movies I would put this as the second best, Supremacy has the honor of being the best. Would I suggest this movie to others? You bet hello.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>He's been Re-Bourne</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my review for Jason Bourne (spoiler free) ****(4/5) Cast: Matt Damon, Alicia Vikander, Tommy Lee-Jones, Vincent Cassel, Julia Stiles, Riz Ahmed.Plot: Bourne has been off the grid for 12 years and has a new life as a bare-knuckle fighter, until his name is mentioned in CIA records again.Everyone's favourite amnesiac assassin is back (sorry Bucky). The dynamic duo Director Paul Greengrass and Matt Damon join forces again for a Bourne movie, the last two being Supremacy and Ultimatum and them were two very kick-ass Bourne movies is this as good as either of them well yes and no there are elements were this is better than Supremacy but unfortunately not nearly as good as Ultimatum. The last movie Damon and Greengrass made together was Green Zone (2010) which was a bit of a mixed up genre fighter.There are many moments when this film does flow as good as the previous 3 but this fourth installment (technically fifth including Legacy) is just a bit duller than usually which is strange. There are elements when this is one of the best films of the year it has a brilliant continuation from Ultimatum, after Bourne found out his real name and so he runs off to some other country and stays off the grid for 12 years. But when his name pops up again he does what he can to get away from agencies. This story is such a good continuation that it doesn't feel like a retread or in this case a retread-stone.Yes! it does look like that Greengrass has strung a load of scenes together to fit in the action - but who really cares when it's this impressive, especially with the 40 car wave in one scene which I might add is also the set-piece. The dialogue is a bit wobbly especially with Tommy Lee-Jones Robert Dewey who basically takes over Pamela Landy's (Joan Allen) place as the head of the CIA. Unlike the other Bourne movies this introduces a new agency which the CIA say is more dangerous than Black Briar or Treadstone but the way this executes it it's not nearly as dangerous as them. Now there is also the fact that doesn't have long time writer Tony Gilroy who also went on to make Legacy (2012) which was basically a spin off set around the same time as Ultimatum.Unfortunately Bourne doesn't speak that much or sometimes barely anything at all in this one, but don't let that put you off because the like the other Bourne installments the bullets, the car chases and the white knuckle action do the talking, so you won't be disappointed. Speaking of the action it's the same again although more generic this time which is unfortunate, but it's still fast-paced and still fun and you can still enjoy it. Other than all that what is this movie missing? apart from Tony Gilroy, well it's missing all the thrills you got from the previous installments, there are still thrills and they are good but better in the previous 3. Still it still offers the same action packed goodness it always did.For some unknown reason this is a bit more dull it still flows but it's just a bit slower this time but then again don't let that put you off either you can still be satisfied by it. Even with the new cast members it still fells like a Bourne film and it should mainly because it still kicks ass and it's a good feeling to see Damon, kicking ass again after all these years. Even though they said 'there is not going to be another Bourne film' so be happy this now exists so we can take Legacy out of existence or at least try.In conclusion this maybe duller and Bourne doesn't speak that much it's still a very entertaining ride to see him punch his enemies to a bloody pulp, or shoot some of them in the face and conveniently skilfully drive through on-coming traffic, they are still a very charming and enjoyable delight. And you can still enjoy the fast-paced action.Verdict: Bourne punches his way to the top with fast-paced action, bullets and car chases it's rip-roaring entertainment, he has definitely found his Ultimatum.8/10 a very enjoyable roller-coaster ride.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Have to say this is the worst Matt's movie I've ever watched, Mr. Damon are you too old to ACT?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't waste your time. Much of the script was unnecessary, it felt longer than it needed to be, and there were more than a few times where I wondered if the film really needed a certain scene. In most cases I don't think they did.Matt Damon's performance drops down to a historical low level, perhaps because he has got too many scandals recently due to his hypocritical behaviors and other distractions?I felt like they spent $1,000 to produce this movie. Give them credit get name actors and produce a movie on the cheap. Very boring and simple plot. They also put inappropriate sex scene that was completely not needed but I guess they think that will sell the movie. He was just not believable and he was the basis for the movie. I was counting down the minutes till the end of this time sucking movie.Truly it's so sad, it has no suspense, no story, no characters, no ideas, no art in picture of any kind. Plot is more then weak. Not a single action of any character in this movie makes any sense. Just another cliché parade produced by LA movie conveyor.I hope he can come back to the right track again someday, until that day's coming I wouldn't recommend anybody to watch his movies any more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strong force of motion with hollow emotional connection</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Matt Damon has said in his previous interview, "We have ridden that horse as far as we can. So, if there's going to be another one, then it would have to be a complete reconfiguration." Hence, upon seeing Jason Bourne and realizing that there's no story here that director-writer Paul Greengrass has been dying to tell, I'm going to assume that Damon broke his vow. Jason Bourne could have been an easy a front-runner to this year's best action films, however, the exploitation of the hero's murky past as a thriller gold mine reminds us how exhausting this franchise could be. And that's coming from someone who liked the first three films.The film opens with amnesiac assassin Jason Bourne's (Matt Damon) voice in the background, "I remember. I remember everything," he says. Well, apparently, he does not. Living off-the-grid for roughly a decade now, Bourne is brought back to the manhunt when his former colleague/Treadstone operative Nicky Parsons (Julia Stiles) hacks the CIA database and incidentally discovers something intriguing in Bourne's past. Believing that Parsons is an accomplice of Bourne, cyber-ops division head Heather Lee (Alicia Vikander) traces the security breach and brings the issue to the attention of CIA director Robert Dewey (Tommy Lee Jones), who orders the retrieval of the confidential black-ops files and for Bourne's death as well. Pursued by a relentless hit-man referred to as "The Asset" (Vincent Cassel), Bourne must yet again find the missing piece of his psychological puzzle all while trying to outwit the CIA.Perhaps the biggest mistake of this sequel begun when Greengrass and editor Christopher Rouse decided to co-pen the script as it is evidently clear here that the uninspired plot is constructed to cater the lavish action set pieces instead of the other way around. Confused Bourne is surrounded by exceedingly familiar scenarios derivative from its predecessors: CIA officers barking orders in surveillance tech rooms, clandestine meetings in crowded places, high-speed car chases, fist-fights, and tons of Hollywood-level property damage. At one point, in an attempt to outdo the Fast and Furious franchise, a hijacked SWAT truck effortlessly rampages like a bowling ball through a line of civilian vehicles. Not to mention another scene where Bourne knocks off a hulking bruiser with just a single punch, this franchise starts to lose control, even to the point of defying the laws of physics.Neither does the nauseating cinematography help in making this film to be consistently appealing. Greengrass subjects his viewers into the heart of the chaos by zooming in and out on shaky action sequences a-la-documentary style but the thing is, he doesn't know when to stop and he doesn't really seem to empathize for his audience at all. Combined with Rouse's two-seconds per frame editing which passes as cheat-codes, this vertigo-inducing end product undercuts rather than serves its real purpose.To his credit, Damon remains to be a solid movie star even if he's operating on a weaker material. The man on action may not speak that much (he reportedly had only 25 lines), but when he does, he makes the most of it. Bourne is much buffer and tougher here, however, a less interesting character compared to those of, say, Die Hard or Taken where the protagonists have at least someone to fight for. Consequently, emotional pull strings are harder to sell for the lone-ranger Jason Bourne. The film even squanders its remaining shred of emotional investment by reducing Stiles' reprising character to a plot device in favor of a rising female star. Oscar- winner Vikander does her best in portraying a steely-eyed and cunning CIA specialist but standing next to Jones' world-weary and cold persona, it's blatantly clear here that she's miscast for she's too young to play a role similar to Joan Allen's in Supremacy and Ultimatum.The film also tries to be socially relevant by poking on the issues of public safety and personal privacy through the introduction of a social media platform called the "Deep Dream" but such concept never really came into life. Perhaps this half-heart attempt can be said the same to the fake propulsion that's happening in Jason Bourne ? it's a strong force of motion but with a hollow emotional connection. Whatever joy you initially feel upon seeing Jason Bourne again on-screen is spoiled by the realization that this sequel offers little motivation to explore the titular hero. Yet again, if soulless, non-stop action is your thing, then welcome to paradise.Full review: http://www.filmpolicereviews.com/reviews/jason-bourne</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Huge Disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My son and I are huge Bourne fans and this movie completely failed to live up to our expectations. Matt Damon had stated that he would not do a new Bourne unless the story was there and after seeing the movie I'm left wondering what he saw in this script. First of all the movie failed to explain how he arrived at where he is now from where he was when the last movie ended. Give me a bit of an explanation as well how he became this open ring boxer. I found the plot to be incredibly weak and I had the feeling throughout that I had seen this movie before (previous Bourne movies). I saw this movie as nothing more than a cash grab in trading on the successes of the previous Bourne movies. Shame on everyone for selling out. I give the movie a 4 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Okay as a standalone film, disappointing sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original Bourne trilogy set the bar extremely high and, compared to those films, this sequel falls quite short. In my opinion, the "Big Brother" theme in spy thrillers is a tired trope and the way it's presented here is almost comical in its scope. Additionally, there's always a older, badder guy behind the old bad guy from the previous film running a program that's another version of Treadstone or Black Briar. The plot is the same old Bourne but with none of the novelty. It almost felt like a film of scenes recycled or cut from the original trilogy. The result is a lack of anything memorable or outstanding. And, besides that, the shaky cam in this one is particularly bothersome. Still, I found the film worth watching. Had I not seen the original trilogy, I might have found the fight scenes exciting and Bourne's schemes brilliant. Instead, the feeling I got was mild amusement mixed with a bit a of nostalgia. More than anything, "Jason Bourne" is about as inventive as its title and maybe the best thing that can come from watching it is the urge to re-watch the original trilogy to see if they really are as good as you remembered (they are).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My partner and I saw Jason Bourne at the local multiplex, 4:00 show. We were the only folk in the theater. The seats were nice. We paid matinée prices. The shaky camera work (worse, in my estimation than previous Bourne films, made more unintelligible by being out of focus a good deal of the time), the "I'm sleeping through this" performance by TL Jones (he's 69 and looks exhausted and 100), the lack of screen time for Bourne himself (how long did Damon spend on this shoot - two weeks?) and Damon's mail it in performance all combined to make this film a waste of time and money.And too bad, since my partner is a big fan of Bourne movies and the genre in general.This franchise should be terminated with extreme prejudice.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In all the other Bourne movies the pace always helped keep the suspense and tension throughout the length of the movies. At the end of The Bourne Ultimatum, we're led to believe Bourne has resolved his identity and that he can live his life knowing who he is and that Treadstone was done. I had hopes that we would see the CIA asking him to come back and help with some world crisis. Instead, we get yet another chapter of Bourne trying to get to the beginning of why he is who he is and the one evil person behind it all still left from the Treadstone days. We are one movie away from his conception being planned by the CIA. This movie was slow. The action scenes were close in and shaky, so you really didn't see the action. The car chase was over the top and unrealistic. I hoped at one point Jeremy Renner would show up to help bail this movie out and get us hyped up for what could be a movie where they team up together. This movie was a miss.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film will give you motion sickness and leave you wishing you could reach out and steady the camera. Due to the poor writing and filming the story has a hard time coming together. There was potential for this to be decent, but there were too many road blocks that this film never made it over. One of the most disappointing films I have seen in a very long time. The fight scenes were so disjointed due to editing and continuously jerking camera that you wished it would just end. It is not often that fight scenes are boring but it was accomplished in this movie. And the car chase scenes wanted to make you pull out your phone and read recipes for home made catsup. It amazes me that actors of this caliber would agree to a film this bad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>2 stand out scenes but nothing else</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Paul Greengrass always delivers on action and suspense, a case proved with the original Bourne films and Captain Phillips, so I knew what to expect but I wanted more than that. I didn't get it.The plot of the latest Jason Bourne film is basically him trying to find out more about his past, whilst being hunted by the CIA, so little is different from the originals. The only difference is bigger action sequences, and I must say they are spectacular, primarily the Athens sequence and the Las Vegas chase, as they are both suspenseful and enthralling. These both happen at opposite ends of the film, which consequently leaves the middle section pretty empty and cumbersome. There's a lot of running about through buildings in cities around Europe, and this never really leads anywhere and makes the middle section fairly boring.The acting is OK, with Matt Damon doing fine with his little dialogue, with Tommy Lee Jones and Julia Stiles doing fine also, but nothing pushes the actors. The best performance comes from Vincent Cassel, who plays a CIA asset, with his character being the most interesting and developed in the film. The ending is also a problem, which is only there for sequel baiting and it should of been the start of the next film. Jason Bourne offers nothing new to the franchise, and it keeps looking back when it should be looking forward. I would also criticise the subplot of the "Deep Dream Co-operation" which is entirely pointless and doesn't add to what is basically a 2 hour chase.Overall though, the film is pretty enjoyable, and is by no means terrible, just a bit boring in the middle and the lack of new ideas is evident. The franchise must have a new director to take it foreword, so we start looking at Bourne's future instead of his past.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Totally satisfying</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There have been many great director/actor collaborations over the years. Hitchcock &amp; Stewart , Scorsese &amp; De Niro &amp; Tarantino and Jackson are three of my all time favourites. I'm not saying Paul Greengrass and Matt Damon are quite in their league but when I watch their Bourne films I get the same feeling of satisfaction and Jason Bourne is no different. There is nothing particularly new here. It's JB , The former employee of the CIA hiding from those out to kill him and along the way uncovering hidden truths about his past. It starts quite slowly but builds and builds into a rip roaring action film. There is the usual fast and frenetic Greengrass hand to hand combat as seen in The Bourne Ultimatum and there is a car chase on the Vegas strip that has to be ranked as one of the best I have ever seen ( especially good with 4DX). Tommy Lee Jones and Vincent Cassel are the perfect bad guys but I do think Alicia Vikander is miscast . She's way too young for the role she plays. All in all I thoroughly enjoyed this film and I would hate think we will have to wait another ten years for the next instalment. Highly Recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>She sounds like a friend of mine who is deaf when she speaks. Vikander should stick to an English accent. She cannot do an American one without sounding handicapped. The rest of the movie was okay, except perhaps the car chase scene which went on far too long. Also, it's about time that Jason Bourne learned some high tech evasion methods and how to evade facial recognition. The franchise is becoming too simple and even a high school student knows how to do this these days. Otherwise, it was the Jason Bourne we have all come to know. Finally, it's a little stupid to think that a CIA director and whatever position Vikander has would be in Vegas together on the stage. This was really stretching credulity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jason(Damon, great as ever) comes back out of hiding to learn something about his past. Yup, business as usual. The CIA is hacked. But that's not important right now. Nicky(Stiles, as usual professional without being cold) is brought back just long enough to get screwed over. Privacy when using apps is given lip service. And at no point does this give any reason for its own existence.This is what I had expected. The action was pushed as far as it could go by the end of the trilogy, so this goes slightly further, and ends up no longer quite realistic. Some of the worst parts of the trailers are nowhere to be seen, though. Entire lines and setups don't exist in the film itself. Bourne no longer feels like he has a plan, like he's being smart about how he approaches things. He survives things he shouldn't a la A Good Day to Die Hard, by dumb luck. The shaky-cam varies, too much or perfectly fine. It's clear Greengrass cared, and was happy to be back. This goes into action clichés the series had skillfully avoided before. The retired hero is brought back for one last job. He does it only for the sake of his family. His father suddenly matters, and you'll hate where they go with that. This gives us all we expect, and very early, at that.The violence pushes the envelope, as is the style today, and wasn't when we last saw Matt in these. Body-count alone is ridiculous, especially considering who gives the kill orders. I recommend this only to those who value the protagonist's abilities over how his character is treated. 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Follows the Bourne formula again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The latest installment in the Bourne series boasts an impressive cast, interesting locales, and simple straightforward story. Fans looking for an action-packed spy thriller should find some satisfaction in this spectacle but the formula comes off as too familiar and the plot feels overly predictable. Matt Damon reprises his role as the eponymous Jason Bourne after taking off the last episode. Bourne has grown up with the actor who betrays him, he's upset about the revelation in Ultimatum and punishing himself by participating in fistfights. The only character to return from the previous films is Nicky (Julia Stiles) but she serves as the trope of woman sacrifice to bring back Bourne from his apathetic brawling phase. Some of the acting during their scenes feels phoned in. The only other woman in the film is the spymaster Heather Lee (Alicia Vikander) who relentlessly chases Bourne but also realizes there is something wrong with the evil government men in suits for whom she works. Her accent felt strange to me, I wasn't sure if she was going for an American accent or keeping her own. Check out more of this review and other at swilliky.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A standard completion of the Greengrass Trilogy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I suppose with every film our expectations are defined by the previous film in a series or what the best film in the series. With me, the best film in the Bourne trilogy (or quadrilogy if you count the dire Bourne Legacy) was the fantastic adrenalin ride of The Bourne Ultimatum.Going into this film, I was a bit nervous because I wanted this film to really rival the directorial brilliance of Paul Greengrass's last two Bourne films. Given that there was a 9 year gap between Ultimatum and Jason Bourne, many things have changed technologically and geopolitically. Here, this paved way for a potentially harder film to make as it had to incorporate current affairs and state of the art technology and surveillance systems. This and the fact that Bourne/Damon has aged considerably in 9 years meant that you really feel how hard it must have been for Matt Damon to get in shape to still pull of the close combat moves that Bourne looked so easy in executing in Supremacy and Ultimatum.But more on the film, Jason Bourne is set in the post Edward Snowden world of espionage where far more people in the world are aware of their privacy both online and in society itself. Bourne, now knowing who he truly is, is brought back into the fray to taunt and clinch the upper hand from the ever more ruthless CIA who will stop at nothing to avoid the fallout from a potentially devastating hack to their database, led by Director Robert Dewey played by Tommy Lee Jones. Jones revels in the role from start to finish showing his lust for neutralising Bourne. With new additions to the agency such as Heather Lee, played by Alicia Vikander. Vikander delivers a very intriguing role as a young, confidant and ambitious cyber security analyst who aids Dewey in the hunt for Bourne around the world. Another notable mention for Vincent Cassel as the new 'asset'. In previous films, my favourite 'asset' as they call it was the Russian asset played by Karl Urban in The Bourne Supremacy. Urban delivered a chilling, almost robotic like performance, which fit inside the FSB/KGB style of espionage. Cassel is the latest in the CIA's assembly line of super assassins who is perhaps the most ruthless asset yet, stopping at nothing to carry out his orders from the CIA to finish off Bourne.When you watch this film, if you're a hard-core Bourne fan, you'll recognise little things that were used in previous films. Like the very gritty editing method, making sequences look more fast paced and tense and most of Bourne's close combat skills being replicated in the Bourne Supremacy and Ultimatum.I think overall, I wanted this film to surpass that of The Bourne Ultimatum which would have been hard to do but I think this film is almost sets in motion the potential for a further couple of films. It was a good film, but I felt like I wanted more out of it, whether it was closure for the Bourne character or a curve-ball that you didn't expect. I think it was because it took so long between films that they had to adjust to the times to make it look believable in the present day which it did but at the same time, it seemed like the Bourne character looked almost beaten technologically which was sad to see. If you're a hard core fan, I would definitely recommend it but I wouldn't say it'd be your favourite Bourne film. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Back on track, that is: perpetually on the run, staying alive, and more?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Additional spoiler warning!!!After "The Bourne Legacy" (2012) which some critics and audience characterize as outright "cheating" (where the hell is Bourne?), Jason Bourne is back. In my IMDb posting on "The Bourne Supremacy" (2004) I wrote:Although Matt Damon is naturally the center of the Bourne stories, it's Franka Potente that makes Bourne Identity alive. The sparkle between the two added a vital dimension to the otherwise somewhat lifeless storyline. The untimely exit of Potente in Bourne Supremacy removes that vital dimension. Julia Stiles initially shows some promise of being Potente's replacement, but turns out to be pitifully under-utilized. Hope that she comes back in Bourne III, if they are ever going to make one.In my IMDb posting on "The Bourne Ultimatum" (2007) I wrote:Do we get this in "Bourne ultimatum"? Yes and no. While Nicky Parsons is by Bourne's side throughout the middle section of the movie, the feeling between them is handled subtly, and appropriately so, as they are two professional secret agents on the run for their lives. It's only when asked why she helped him that Nicky reveals just a glimpse of her feeling, saying that with him, her job (of being his adversary earlier) has been very difficult. Then with a faint smile, she asks if he remembers anything between them. The romance element is left at that, plus her comforting hand on his in a later scene when he is distressed by the memory of all the killings he did. Maybe more in the next one, if they make one. Now in 2016, after nine years, we finally get "the next one". Nine years is the time elapsed, incidentally, for Jessie and Celine to meet again in Paris after spending together in Vienna the most romantic night in the entire film history. I don't suggest, or even hint, that there is any similarity in the circumstances between Jason and Nicky. But purely from the visual viewpoint of the scenes, there is a resemblance: the man spotting the woman at a distance in a public venue. But then, Jason expects to see Nicky while Jessie only has a faint hope that Celine will materialize. Let me back up. In the crisp establishing scenes, Bourne is seen making a living as an underground prize fighter, the naked fist type. The next scene is a duel just as brutal, between two women, even when no physical blows are exchanged (they are actually thousands of miles apart). Parsons is seen hacking into the CIA secret files while Heather Lee (Alicia Vikander), the young rising star IT wiz fights her every step of the way. Parsons has the upper hand, coming away with some top secret files. One more major character introduced right away is CIA Director Robert Dewey (Tommy Lee Jones), in the process of being informed that a leak "worse than Snowden's" is in the making. Spoiler warning, again.The worst leak, however, is that Parson dies soon after meeting Bourne, shot by CIA's premium hit-man "Asset" (Vincent Cassel), but obviously not before passing the critical USB to Bourne. That plot that unfolds is incredibly simple and completely predictable. At this point, I have to admit that I am wrong about the element of romance, or rather the absence of which. Paul Greengrass demonstrates conclusively that he is the master of masters when it comes to constructing action sequences that will have you holding your breath and unconsciously moving to the edge of your seat, with dying of suffocation and falling off your chair as two real risks. His camera moves at frantic pace and yet at the same time with lucid clarity. The background music, whether ominously pulsating or loudly threatening, is always pitch perfect. Although you have seen it all, you have never seen it until you see how Greengrass does it. Bookending the excitement-packed, multi-location action extravaganza are two top-notch set pieces, the opening at Athens and the closing at Las Vegas. Not much needs to be said about Jones and Cassel, portraying two somewhat one-dimensional cliché characters with first class professionalism. Vilander, coming to this movie with her recent Oscar Best Supporting Actress Award, will be the talk of town. Heather Lee is an interesting character, and not in any way the replacement of Marie or Nicky (well, at least not yet). If anything, she is more akin to Joan Allen's Pam Landy, a friendly element within the CIA for Bourne. But that is on the surface. Lee is depicted as a role-model patriot (that is why she joined the CIA) who believes that Bourne, despite everything that had happened, can be brought back into serving his country. But then, at the very end of the movie, there are dangling causes and dialogues hooks. It boils down to whether she really means what she says to Bourne and to her superior. Hopefully, we do not have to wait another nine years to find out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A lot of people are down on this movie, that it's not as good as the others in the series, but I think it's still worthy of going to the theater to see this movie. Give it a chance, it's hard to continuously raise the bar in anything and the Bourne movie series is no exception. Sometimes I think you can go too far in trying to surpass the previous movie in the series. Overall, the action is good, Tommy Lee Jones is good, and as always Matt Damon is good. It would have been nice to see more of Julia Stiles, but it was still great to see her in this gritty action flick. I thought Jason Bourne was well worth the price that I paid for the ticket.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A welcome return of Bourne, but with a few reservations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Always like the Bourne movies, since my first accidental introduction when I was bored one day and picked up The Bourne Identity which for some reason I hadn't really heard much about.Saw the following two at the cinema, and even the not as great Legacy, and when Jason Bourne was announced, I was in, critics reviews or not.The storyline is very similar to The Bourne Supremacy, in that one is his girlfriend is shot and killed and that brings him back into action.In this one, Nicky Parsons tries to get information to him about his father, and she dies in the process, kickstarting Jason Bourne going back into action after living off the grid since the end of Ultimatum.And that for me is one of my reservations. Its made clear at the end of Ultimatum that he was alive, and should be free because the major players in his life that caused him to be who he became are either jailed or dead.Yet we get reintroduced to Bourne 9 years later, and he is still living off the grid, clearly not enjoying anything, having recurring nightmares of his past and suffering injuries from his many bare knuckle fights...... just what did Jason Bourne bother to live for at the end of Ultimatum if all he was going to do was exist?Seems very contrary to the character. We know he can fall in love with women, so why at least not have the end of Ultimatum as being a return to normalcy for the character, so when he is brought back into the fold for this movie, the viewer then feels he has more to lose..... the way things are played out, going around kicking ass all over the world has to be a better use of time than simply not living a life.But other than that, the Nicky death had poignancy at least, she is the only other character to be in Bournes life throughout all the movies.I was saddened by her death, but, after the events of Ultimatum where she was no longer a part of the CIA and was clearly not going to be a part of that clandestine world again, her death was essential.Everyone else played their respective parts well, no-one stuck out as being out of place, Tommy Lee Jones was pretty decent throughout, Alicia Vikander was good as the new breed of schemer within the CIA, never really knowing until the end where her loyalties were with.The final problem I have with this movie, is the one i've always had with this series of movies, and is Paul Greengrass's insistence on shaking the camera to bits not just in action scenes, but in fairly pedestrian scenes.For instance, there are several shots where important text messages are being displayed, but because the camera shakes so much, you can't quite view them properly, and its like someone when they edited realised it, because then we return to the same shot but its been steadied so you can read them properly.I know Greengrass is going for a sense of realism and making it more frantic as if you were there viewing it all, but its getting to the stage that even mundane shots are being affected.It spoils decent action and fight sequences. Whats the point in Matt Damon doing weeks of choreography on these fight scenes if most of the excitement of them is lost because the camera moves too much.Please, please, please..... can it be toned down for the sequel? Please?????</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A successful entry in the Bourne franchise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Matt Damon returns as Jason Bourne in the fifth entry of the Bourne saga, which still entertains after some years off-screen. Though I still believe the Bourne Ultimatum is the best in the series, the movie still delivers with some action-packed sequences and thought- provoking characters. Directed by Paul Greengrass, who was also at the helm with Bourne Supremacy and Bourne Ultimatum, the movie is able to bring back some of things that made the original Bourne trilogy so good, in particular the incredibly awesome action pieces that are sprayed all throughout the film. It also showcases Paul's signature use of a shaky-camera, and though unconventional, proves to be useful in many situations.Almost a decade after the end of the Bourne Ultimatum, Bourne (Matt Damon) is still hiding, isolated from the world, where he only joins up in the occasional street-fight. But, his involvement begins when former contact of Bourne, Nicky Parsons (Julia Stiles), hacks into the CIA server in attempt to expose information. Files concerning the identity of Jason Bourne and how they attempt to take him down brings him out of hiding.The film boasts a stellar cast, which include Matt Damon, Alicia Vikander, Tommy Lee Jones and Vincent Cassel, all who of whom suited there characters well within the story. The story itself wasn't as intriguing as many of other Bourne films, as there were some minor plot-holes, but it didn't concern me that much. Its ability blend a decent plot with amazing action provides a fulfilling experience for the viewer, in particular those who are fans of the series, such as me. Overall, the movie is a successful continuation in the series which is definitely open to more films in the future.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fast pace, somewhat believable spy-story, amazing action scenes and Damon as strong willed killing machine...that was the charm of Bourne movies for me.I was excited when both Damon and Greengrass said that they put their hearts and minds into this movie.What do we see in "Jason Bourne"? Slow pace, confused and hart to swallow story, shaky and generic action scenes and Damon as mentally challenged, weak willed...boxer.I watched two hours of Matt Damon crying and walking and sometimes passing through customs. Every of four action scenes and two car chases caused nausea and urge to leave the theater. Did I need to see major close ups on Vincent Cassel, Julia Stiles and first zombie know to mankind Tommy Lee Jones? I love Vincent and Julia was perfect in other Bourne movies, but I just felt half scared and half sad. Scared of thought that I might live as long as Tommy Lee Jones and look like someone who shrunk inside his own skin. Sad because Vincet's and Julia's distorted faces made me think about my mortality and passing of time.I sure didn't think "Wow! Look at Vincent. He can sure run up the three flight of stairs and use a sniper rifle with steady hand or kill two teams of 20-ish year old agents." No. No I didn't.Don't watch this movie. Just watch last Bourne movie with Jeremy Renner on mute. Use soundboard from Team America and press "Maaaat Daaaamooon" sound every time Jeremy opens his mouth. That is better than the latest Jason Bourne movie.</fullReview>

The movie also provided with the latest gadget and technology, luxurious places and very intense and powerful thriller actions. Alicia Vikander and Tommy Lee Jones also play very good. But I think its a little lack of stories. The plot seems to be predictable and short. Fortunately, All the trailer doesn't reveal the whole story, which is good. So in general, I will give 8,5 / 10. Go watch it (especially if you are an action movie lover) and you will not regret it. This is a damn brutal movie!. Have fun and feel The Return of Jason Bourne. #JasonBourneIsBack</fullReview>

Vincent C. is a psychopathic murderer. Tommy Lee Jones is okay and the woman, Alicia Vikander, well, she gives a blinding performance. Don't listen to all the other reviews saying it's bad because it's really not a bad film, it's a good one with no stupid slow-motion scenes or Spectre nonsense. Jason Bourne is a real action film. Paul Greengrass has created a film that won't be on my favourite film list. But a film that has entertained me and made me confident that Greengrass will make many exciting movies in the future and hopefully other Spy films can learn a bit from this one.

		<shortDescription>Same high-class thrills from a great franchise.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Why would he come back now?" CIA Director Robert Dewey (Tommy Lee Jones)"He" is of course Jason Bourne, super spy, and the actor, Matt Damon, comes back to the franchise for at least the chance to work with action director Paul Greengrass and make multiple million dollars. As for Bourne, he's always catching up with himself, be it his faulty memory or finding his father.If you're going to produce a thriller, then it better be thrilling, as the film Jason Bourne is for practically every minute of its two hours. Although I'm sated with car chases in many thrillers, Greengrass makes the several here a delightful adrenaline rush. Perhaps his are outstanding because they add to the fabulous nature of the franchise and the mystery of who killed Jason's dad.That's what he's looking for, not to bring down the hyper-surveillance machine called the CIA, and its director, Robert Dewey. Wait, Wait, I think there's a germ of a good idea lurking behind the fisticuffs and bullets: Are our treasured institutions invading our privacy? The agreement pending between the CIA and a Facebook?like company would severely compromise each citizen's privacy, and like the young-adult film, Nerve, even the entertainment of our youth is replete with danger.Jason Bourne is certainly home to many of the thriller genre's tropes, including illogical good luck in gun fights and car chases and the usual surprises about characters you thought you knew. The final fight between good and evil is de rigueur. Although I was half-way rooting for bad guy Asset because Vincent Cassell plays him so menacingly well, I didn't want him to beat Bourne.Enjoy your summer thrills with this entertaining speed machine of a movie, and remember, there's always more to Jason Bourne than just the thrills: "I volunteered because of a lie. They said my father was killed by Terrorists! He wasn't killed by terrorists, was he?"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>4 strong films out of 5 isn't bad.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The powerful psychological hook of the first, second and third Bourne film depends upon the main character not fully knowing who he is, and what his past contains. This device vicariously appeals to the vanity of the audience member by simultaneously offering the seductive notion that a person might amount to much more than one knows and also, beguilingly, the potential of a fresh start, cleansed of all sins. The trouble with 'Jason Bourne,' the latest offering in the franchise, is that, since all of the mystery has now been laid bare and Mr. Bourne knows exactly what he did, for whom and why, his sense of outrage in being used as a tool by a series of ambitious and unscrupulous masters, lacks any moral foundation. Given that he signed up to be a deadly weapon for the CIA, a contingency of which all governments must surely have need, and went about his business assassinating strangers 'to save American lives' the scope for bearing a grudge would seem to be limited, and as he excavates yet another strata of rotten power-mongers within the U.S. intelligence community in search of justice, it becomes increasingly difficult to accept the body count of tangentially involved parties and indeed innocent bystanders laid waste by those pursuing him, who would have survived if only Bourne had just kept his head down and lived out his days in some remote clime.Also difficult to accept is Bourne's propensity to repeatedly place himself in positions where he is certain to be detected and only moments from capture before mounting a desperate bid to avoid his pursuers by the skin of his teeth. He does this four times in the film, obviously as a means of motivating a chase sequence, but in each case, for being so avoidable the ensuing action sequence seems somehow under motivated.All in all, I didn't hate 'Jason Bourne,' but I was hoping Paul Greengrass would revive the economy and artful exposition of 'The Bourne Identity,' rather than opt for the tried and tested sequel logic of 'more is better'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having gone into the cinema without seeing any other movies from this series, I was slightly confused at the start. However, I did begin to understand more as the movie went on. I liked how there were lots of different emotions used throughout the movie and it wasn't just people shooting each other (although there were parts of that too!). For example, when one character died, the atmosphere changed from being fast-paced to becoming slower and more melancholy and made me feel somewhat cathartic. There were also elements where the characters experienced shock, remorse, trepidation, panic and pure, unadulterated bitterness. One thing I didn't like about the movie was sometimes I felt like some elements went unexplained. I do understand that this is because the movie is partly from Jason Bourne's point of view and it was unexplained to him. Despite this, I would have liked to understand these parts better. I was particularly impressed with the acting. This is because there was lots of green screen usage in the film (there were lots of explosions and shootings etc.) yet the actors made me feel as if all of the explosions were completely real. This is a skill I would really like to develop because it makes them magnetic and is what really engrosses the viewers. I would recommend this to others because although it isn't a film I would normally go for, I found it quite enjoyable. One thing I will say however is that this movie needs 100% concentration from start to finish if you want to understand the plot properly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jason Bourne is back!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The ever so popular duo Matt Damon and Paul Greengrass; they are at it again. They go full blown trying to recreate that obscured Robert Ludlum magic that we are all die-hard fans of.The theme we have here though is strangely similar to all the prequels. Unnecessary as it seemed to bring Bourne from the ashes, we end up having something banal as the plot nevertheless. But it still hatches gold in terms of action, technology and that outstanding Bourne foresight.DIRECTION OF JASON BOURNE I just love the direction of Paul Greengrass. His shaky camera technique always stands out. It fills his frames with rare gravitas, and compels the audience to pay heed. We see every bit of his extraordinary panache rolling on the big screen as we feast on the subtle grandeur of a constant commotion.CHERISHABLE BITS (HIDDEN SPOILERS AHEAD) There are numerous memorable moments that we take away from this Jason Bourne film. The first one being the riot backdrop, the anti-government protest which cleverly shows the fight is constant and real. CIA carries out its covert operations unperturbed even in such ruckus. Hats off to that! The rendezvous with Nicky Parsons played by Julia Stiles in a theatrical set of nerve-racking set of events will have you salute Jason Bourne for who he is. Watch out Vincent Cassel rampage in with his unpredictability. A perfect casting there! Well chosen! Another high note of Jason Bourne film worth jotting down is when Vincent takes the SWAT truck and decimates countless cars as he tries to escape Bourne fury. A thrilling scene that will have a go at your adrenaline. Breathtaking! That entire car chase scene was enchanting as well and superbly shot.When you pay attention to the CIA hunting, you will be blown away beyond limit by noticing their jaw-dropping nimbleness to handle situations. Also, the technology they use! Ah! Simply amazeballs! When the competition goes tough and effortlessly enters the nail-biting zone, that's when Bourne flourishes the most. Watching him outsmart the smart is what makes every Bourne movie a thrilling joyride. It all gets justified here as well. Aren't all the Bourne movies formed under that same niche? OTHER CRUCIAL CHARACTERS Another part worth noticing is how the government wishes to have their eyes on everything. As Robert Dewey portrayed by Tommy Lee Jones threatens Aaron Kalloor, a real life like character (CEO of a leading social media enterprise Deep Dream) played brilliantly by Riz Ahmed to work against the ethos he wishes to run his company on, you will be forced to wonder how the future of privacy really looks. Privacy is a myth and so the CIA proves by putting its nose in other's business.Alicia Vikander is one of the most exciting, and as the movie progresses we find out, seemingly powerful characters to have ever entered the Bourne franchise. She wears Heather Lee on her sleeves for the better part of the movie only to drop a bomb on us in the end. The way she gets on top of things with her technical skills is what makes her a girl to watch out for in the long run.DOWNSIDES OF JASON BOURNE The fact that Paul Greengrass tried to weave a plot that seemed kind of forced to blow Bourne out in the open isn't the only downside the movie had. Even though every fact falls in place, and there is a constant pace justifying each and everything as to why a bit is shown, there are other things nay flaws that silently gnaw at the soul of the flick.The first one being the shoddy screenplay of Jason Borne. There isn't an eye-opening line by Paul Greengrass or Christopher Rouse inscribed in it unlike the prequels, that impoverish the quality of the written material.Bourne's character still ends up being very manipulative on account of shattered memories in his head. The part where Dewey chooses to trust his mouth more than a gun against Jason Bourne will compel you to wonder how easy it is to dupe Bourne ? with words from his past.Then there are dispensable characters that don't squeeze out melodrama at all. Like that Nicky Parsons fate, you don't see Bourne feel sorry enough for. We had a past with Nicky. He had too. The movie had snappy casualties that were like dominoes that stood unattended.There is a smothering fight scene as we reach the end of Jason Bourne for a climactic closure. Unfortunately with the previous levels of agent brawls, this one falls a little vapid owing to the zoomed in camera that makes it hard to concentrate. The fight, even though more plausible, ends up becoming a mere 'meh' owing to the way it ends, with a lot of choking.THE FINAL VERDICT Overall I think the movie was fine. An unneeded sequel since the Bourne story was already told in three extraordinary bits before. But being an aficionado I wouldn't ever mind watching Bourne kick Government's ass every now and then just to break free through that mundane ripple.The best part eventually indubitably and inevitably remains, when Bourne does something badass and the music of Moby goes literally Extreme Ways.Read all my reviews here: http://straightfromamovie.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jason Bourne</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At the beginning of Jason Bourne, we have a brief recount on the adventures of the eponymous agent, but it's useless, because the saga has got so entangled through three films (four, if we count the "spin-off" The Bourne Legacy) that any explanation ends up being irrelevant. The only thing we need to know is that Jason Bourne offers us more from the same. 14 years ago (it's hard to believe the way in which time flies by), the film The Bourne Identity was a newfangled alternative in the action genre; a kind of a serious James Bond, shot with a realistic but quite dynamic style (some years before Bond himself adopted that formula). However, now, in 2016, we have already seen too many films with similar pros... which gradually ended up becoming cons. Unfortunately, Jason Bourne is one of them. I hoped the fact that the return of director Paul Greengrass meant a change of road for the saga; another creative reinvention to justify its continuation. Needless to say, it wasn't like that. Despite everything, I found Jason Bourne entertaining despite its rancid niche and archaic intentions. The action scenes are well shot; Greengrass' direction is clear and efficient; and the screenplay includes some interesting themes such as government intrusion and online privacy. Matt Damon practically doesn't speak in the leading role, but he doesn't need any words in order to eloquently express that "now, it's personal". Julia Stiles isn't given much to do as a human mcguffin, while Tommy Lee Jones repeats his worried bureaucrat routine; he probably doesn't even know what movie he's in, but he still evokes absolute credibility. And we finally have Alicia Vikander, a brilliant actress trapped in the mediocre role of Heather Lee, who spends the 80% of her scenes in front of monitors while trying to find new ways to enunciate lines such as "Satellite on-line", "Bring me camera one", and "Target on sight at twenty seconds"; what a waste of one of the best contemporary actresses. Talking about "cyber-operations", Jason Bourne employs the old cyber-tricks which don't cheat anyone anymore: instantaneous penetration of remote systems, access to ALL kinds of technology in a matter of seconds and improbable animated graphics to represent the frantic hacking of the specialists. After the sober realism of the TV series Mr. Robot and the documentary Zero Days, I can't swallow those artifices, which haven't changed much in the 21 years which have gone by since Sandra Bullock was hacking on a bikini in The Net. Despite my complaints, Jason Bourne kept me entertained with its agile rhythm, and it doesn't request too much attention from the audience, because it constantly repeats us the key elements for us not to think too much. So, I can give a moderate recommendation to Jason Bourne as a casual weekend entertainment. Besides, I can't dislike a movie which takes us to "ExoCon", a parody of DefCon in Las Vegas. Or it might be BlackHat. Whichever it is, Bullock would immediately identify it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perhaps the end of something new, maybe the end of something old</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Up to the date, Jason Bourne progressed as an isolated trilogy (besides the spin off with Jeremy Renner), and this extension, which at first, since the previous story could have been stopped at that point, seemed to be a blockbuster pointless continuation. However, as the story progressed, the movie developed to become something as the closing of an origin stories, hence leaving space to more. Matt Damon delivers a convincing performance, with everything that everyone loves about it, that could hardly stand out, due to the overextended music reinforced moments, almost continuous throughout the movie. This point should be underlined, since it leaves the audience on the edge of the seat and simultaneously distracts the viewer from a lack of plot, comparatively to the previous films,and brands it too much of an action movie (although the action scenes seem as carefully choreographed and performed as before). Jason Bourne movies haven't been simply action movies, nevertheless some remarkable action series, and this should not change, since it diminishes the plot points and makes it unable to compete with films of the genre. Still, this movie was not demoted of plot, the plot simply did not live to its predecessors, however, as said at first (and the following is the reason for the spoiler alert), its development can (if carefully managed) be the foundation for a franchise. The ending however, with the betrayal of Jason Bourne's trust, in one hand, delivers a proper ending, at the start - just as the previous movies - however, might eliminate the possibility of generating something interesting. Tommy Lee Jones' performance, having to face all the issues of Matt Damon's, did not manage to want us to have the character alive, either a villain or a hero, since it lost some of its strength to its rather cunning opposite. The latter leads us to Alicia Vikander's, whose, performance stood out, perhaps for the void of the character of the previous movies, perhaps because of the possibility of becoming a darker version of a Jason Boundish "M". Nevertheless, a performance to admire, with a credible version of a newcomer tackling National Security, inner CIA lobbying and unsolved issues of previous times. A film worth watching, but, by itself, not enough to render it better than the previous ones.</fullReview>

It's not an exaggeration to say that the Bourne Trilogy redefined modern action thrillers. It was a relevant, smart and furiously intense reinvention of the espionage genre. The Bourne movies have always been blockbusters, with their fingers on the political pulse and here Greengrass turns his attention over to online privacy post- WikiLeaks. Jason Bourne has always had one mission: to find out who he is. It's a mystery that made him one of the most interesting action movie characters of our time. Alongside James Bond and Ethan Hunt, but he was quick, efficient and acted on intuition and impulse alone. With this movie, the series marks a return to what worked for the franchise - namely: Matt Damon. In fact, despite the welcomed hints of vulnerability introduced by advancing age, Bourne's character seems off. Which comes most likely from the script, which unfortunately also provides Matt Damon with precious few lines. Rather than from Damon who is impressively opening up as an actor with the years. From a stylistic point of view, Greengrass' sequences are defined by seething movement and sense of endless chaos, capturing indelible moments and images rather than a full and coherent picture of it. Indeed, the director is wasting little time before its first adrenalised action sequence and frenetic editing. Still, few directors can craft such clarity out of absolute chaos. Technically and logistically Greengrass delivers everything you expect from him. There's no one better when it comes to staging complex, chaotic action amid the real life of big cities. What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas. The action-packed final forty minutes are staged in Las Vegas, this city might seem an unlikely backup for Bourne's brand, but it perfectly fit the unpredictable choreographed opera-like carnage. Finally, the action didn't disappoint me, what did is the story. There's definitely a revenge aspect to this film. Not just from the hero perspective, but also from the villain, which was very unexpected and it added something to the movie. However, the subplot involving this social media guru was not needed, it slowed the movie's pace considerably. Overall, Jason Bourne is the most unsettling movie in the series but it also left the audience weirdly wanting more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good action movie, disappointing entry in the Bourne franchise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original Bourne trilogy is amazing, not only was it one of the greatest action franchises at the time, but one of the greatest trilogies ever put to film. I love those movies, I think they're directed very well, they have masterful action sequences, and the characters, especially Jason Bourne, are very interesting. And then The Bourne Legacy came along, and it disappointed fans and audiences alike, despite having a pretty good cast that gave somewhat decent performances. It was a poorly directed, incoherent, uninteresting story with a terrible script, some decent action and forgettable characters.Many consider Matt Damon's absence as being one of the things brought Legacy down, along with Paul Greengrass not directing it. Enter Jason Bourne, a new entry on the franchise that has Greengrass returning as director and Damon reprising his role as the titular spy. It has to be great, right?So, was it good? Well, yes, but it wasn't great. So let's start with the things that worked. Paul Greengrass's unique directing style is part of what makes the other Bourne movies work as well as they do, and this is no exception. This movie has many action sequences, and he excels at these. The chase scenes, the fight scenes, they're all incredible, and the action is one of the best parts of the film.The movie has a great cast, and they all give wonderful performances. Matt Damon once again is fantastic as Jason Bourne, Tommy Lee Jones is pretty good as he always is, and Alicia Vikander is surprisingly great. Vincent Cassel is also very good in this movie.The story isn't very interesting, nor is the script that well written. The structure is very similar to the other Matt Damon Bourne movies, but that's not necessarily a bad thing, it worked with the original movies and it could've worked with this one, but the plot isn't that good and it just feels kinda repetitive.It was very disappointing, a bit boring and dull sometimes, but it has great action and strong enough performances to carry the movie, and make it very entertaining. It's definitely better than Legacy, but it's not better than any of the others Bourne movies. I'd absolutely recommend it to the fans of the franchise and casual movie goers who want to watch a good action thriller.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jason Bourne (2016)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you like the trilogy then this film is for you. It delivers action, car chases, shooting battles , fighting scenes and explosions! Matt Damon plays his role well but his character does not have much depth. Tommy Lee Jones plays a CIA Director at first I was excited but as the film went on and on he kept making me bored. Alicia Vikander who plays Heather Lee role was for the most part good but she fails at the end of the film. It might have been the dialogue of the film that was easy to guess and it had many issues. The biggest issue of the film is that there is only one secret agent after Bourne. This agent follows Bourne around the world trying to kill him for his treason. I think a global organization or in this case a corrupt one would have more than one killer after Bourne to do the job. Perhaps they did want to expend some extra cash and did not have time to develop those character so decided to run with it that way. The film suffers due to that decision and I hope they can sleep at night with this horrible mistake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jason Bourne, starts where it ends</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first three movies of Jason Bourne with Matt Damon were a great success. The fourth movie is somewhere in my DVD-collection, but I forgot its where about. I have seen approximately 25 minutes of this movie and I felt asleep. So now the new Jason Bourne is launched in 2016 and yes, with Matt Damon again! The movie it self is a great movie. Action like you seen before in the first three movies, only better. And the story itself continues. In my honest opinion the story itself is not that good, it's the movie which is good! The story is all about the US secret services whether it is called CIA, Treadstone, Blackbriar, NSA and so on...at the end in the story of Jason Bourne all the intelligence agencies of the USA are chasing each other.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>JASON BOURNE - MOVIE REVIEW _ The curse of The Godfather Trio Returns.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 5th installment in the Bourne franchise sees the return of Matt Damon as Jason Bourne aka David Webb, an amnesiac super spy with a troubled past. This film is the sequel to The Bourne Ultimatum (2009). Director, Paul Greengrass recurs his role as well as Julia Stiles along with the new additions of Tommy Lee Jones, the ever brilliant Alicia Vikander and Vincent Cassel. To me the movie is an exceptional summer-flick with loads of fantastic action sequences, even better car chases and delivers on that thrill and promise of a fast paced crowed-pleaser. Now onto the deeper stuff, as a big fan of the original trilogy, I couldn't help but feel bit disappointed and unsatisfied at leaving the theater. I went in with high expectations as I knew Paul Greengrass (who also directed Supremacy &amp; Ultimatum btw) would likely out-do himself as he had done with the previous films of the franchise. Now I had few key issues with the film and I'll tackle them by one; 1_ The entirely unnecessary addition of the whole social media sub- plot: Tbh i did not enjoy a single scene relating to the sub-plot and at times it almost felt like there is another director who shot the scenes for this and they were tacked-on at the last moment to the final cut. Its that bad! It's like the studio was too afraid, almost to release the original film and wanted to "modernize" it by trying to make it more relevant? 2_ Screen time Distribution: This was the second major issue that i struggled with and again I refer to 1 because the presence of such unnecessary sub-plot ate up a whole lot of precious minutes that could be better used, e.g i) perhaps more screen time for a hacker Bourne faces in Berlin, or ii) More plot for a character the movie kills off way too early! 3_ Playing It Safe: Jason Bourne as a sequel to the trio lack all cleverness and ingenuity yet possess the formulae that made the previous 3 standout, in short it is unoriginal and uninspiring. My Final Thoughts: A fantastic watch for a weekend with friends and family and a full entertainment package. But! for those of you Bourners, lower your expectations. Ratings: ******* 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the latest in a series of action films. If you've seen the others, you will know what is going on, I guess. But if, like me, this is your first Bourne film, you'll spend the first half of the film trying to figure out what's happening.Jason Bourne is a man who has been through some sort of covert CIA programme which has gone wrong. Now the CIA are out to kill him. But Bourne, as usual in these sorts of action/paranoia films, has some near superhuman powers. For example, he can knock out any opponent with a single punch.So the bad guys are out to get him before he can get them, resulting in the usual chases and mayhem. There are chases overground, underground, by car, by motorcycle, by a SWAT van that would put a tank to shame...(I wish I could get one of those for my daily commute!)The action scenes are very well directed, and keep you excited despite the clichéd plot. The music, too, is excellent, and keeps the tension up without getting in the way. And it's nice to see Tommy Lee Jones, one of the few Hollywood actors who's not afraid to look ugly.For those who have seen previous Bourne films, this is probably an 8 out of 10, maybe even a 9 out of 10. But for newcomers, it rates only a 6.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Bourne Repititon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Matt Damon returns as the arm breaking action hero Jason Bourne who now comes back into the light when the CIA are hacked and Bourne becomes the prime suspect. Paul Greengrass comes back to continue the Bourne series after the brilliant conclusion of The Bourne Ultimatum. But was this necessary? So what Jason Bourne has become is the same old routine just with a worn out cast and atmosphere not adding anything new at all to the franchise and just recycling everything we've seen before. The film and story have potential from the start but this just gets the characters in the position of the classic Bourne narrative.What lacks in this Bourne film is a strong narrative and direction that the original three had, unfortunately here we have a weak story that pretty much relies on the action and Bourne beating up people to survive.After nine years since Damon has played he role we find him giving his best impression of Daniel Craig in Spectre, being that he just looks tired and not bothered at all. This is also supported by pretty much the rest of the cast providing very wooden performances especially from Tommy Lee Jones, and Alicia Vikander (who tries to pull of an American accent but occasionally slips into British. Damon also very much acts with the same facial expression through out the whole film and barley delivers any lines at all.The film also leaves the traditional Bourne titles for something that should be more significant, but which the film does not give justice to.What is the only good part of the film is the action sequences which carry the film and provide the cinema entertainment everyone wants. So Jason Bourne is not unique and was quite a disappointment for what I hoped it could be. If Greengrass wants to continue the series then he needs to look for another storyline for Bourne to enter instead of the same thing we've seen three times before. Better still he already ended the series on a huge high in Ultimatum so why continue.Overall, there is nothing new in Jason Bourne and should deserve a different name, but it still does what it aims in providing action entertainment. Although Damon doesn't quite show a lot of effort in his performance, he's still got it as the highly skilled assassin. 6.8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An all-out sensory assault</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The fundamental problem with the "Bourne" series is that the sequels were unplanned. As I have said before, finding loose ends to tie up in a matter that is both in continuity and consistent with theme is problematic when one has largely resolved the conflicts for the planned unitary installment. Aware of this, the producers of the "Bourne" series cheat in that in the beginnings of the sequels they negate important elements of the hero's resolution, so that he'll still have some ground to trek. The problem of course is that from the viewer's point of view, we had grown accustomed to "having" these elements and so the film now has to make us care.In this respect, "Bourne" is only a partial failure: Riz Ahmed is perfectly twerpy as an obvious (albeit more na?ve and morally tortured) Mark Zuckerberg stand-in; however, Alicia Vikander is nothing less than abominable and indeed insulting in her role as rising CIA star, especially in contrast to Julia Stiles.And the "plot" hangs together like a soggy potato chip: it is too mired in current events surrounding privacy and social media and too sledgehammer-heavy moralizing to really divert from reality in the present day. The cinematography is quite a piece of work, although you could be forgiven for forgetting that this adventure takes place across multiple Western capitals with the brevity of each and every shot, and the hustle-and-bustle of hardcore action littering every single frame. The deliberate information overload is I suppose appropriate to a film touching on the kind of themes this one does, but the constant references to the current technology and the lifestyle rhythms that follow from them does mean the film won't age particularly well as a fun little window to the political past for future generations, along the lines of say "The Manchurian Candidate."All-in-all, "Jason Bourne" is a two-hour optical, auditory, intellectual and cultural assault. I nevertheless was well-entertained all throughout: if you can get your senses attuned to a fast oscillatory rhythm this is actually both relaxing and stimulating at the same time. Then again, I'm one of those maritime nuts who's actually more seasick on land than on a boat, so perhaps not everyone can achieve that.</fullReview>

This movie was shot for TV. Definitely Not for a big screen. Most of the time you see 2/3th part of faces. The zooming is totally outrageous. Camera crew was drunk or stoned. That's the only explanation I can imagine for the constant swerving, zooming, tilting and panning on screen. It kills the movie. Completely. The story is thin as ice, acting is not available. It all depends on the special effects. Which are decent, but killed by the high zoom. I seriously am not interested in Matt Damon's nose hair count. Maybe on TV this works ?</fullReview>

The scenario is empty: No politics, no tension, no mystery to solve, no feelings (or dating), no secret agent gadgets, a few references to the news (Snowden, conferences about software security).I'm used to action movies with a few different phases: The hunt, the research, the corpse investigation, the mystery. This one has only one phase: Jason Bourne in pursuit.Some nice cars, a SWAT truck. No heroism. I like stupid action movies even when it's the 5th episode, but crucial parts of their team have failed, like the camera framer and the scenarist.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's good as a stand-alone popcorn flick, but fails to live up to the original trilogy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>10 years after the events of "The Bourne Ultimatum", ex-CIA agent Nicky Parsons (Stiles) uncovers new information on the now-defunct 'Treadstone' program. This information is significant enough to cause her to seek out Jason Bourne (Damon), who currently lives off the grid and makes a living off of illegal fights. The two set out to find who really masterminded the CIA's original black-ops program ? and why. Along the way, they encounter fierce opposition from the Director of the CIA (Jones) and an assassin (Cassel) who's out for Bourne's blood.I entered this film with high expectations ? and came out only slightly disappointed. "Jason Bourne" is by no means a bad film but is overshadowed by the films in the original trilogy. Matt Damon still rocks as Jason Bourne; Paul Greengrass' direction is as intense and exciting as ever, and the action setpieces are top- notch (even if they do get too confusing at times). The final climax may feel over-the-top (yes, even more over the top than the final climaxes of the previous Bourne films), but it will have you rocking in your seat! The script is the weakest link here. "Jason Bourne", for some reason, lacks the sense of urgency and relentless forward momentum that made the previous installments so gripping. The addition of the new characters failed to generate my interest. The story is predictable (Greengrass missed the opportunity to write something truly original) and the pacing ultimately takes away from the viewer's attention. There are also multiple scenes that feel out of place and act as boring roadblocks for the main plot.For a franchise that's famous for dealing with the topics of government surveillance and privacy, you would really think that 'Jason Bourne' would push the envelope on that issue. It doesn't. The film takes a heavy approach to those themes and ends up with a rather convoluted subplot that doesn't fit with the tone of the film.The ensemble cast isn't given much to work with. Vincent Cassel gives a menacing and cold-blooded performance as 'the asset' but co- stars Tommy Lee Jones and Alicia Vikander fail to stand out (but they do have their moments of brilliance). Julia Stiles nearly took me out of the movie with her less than convincing performance ? yes, she's that terrible. I don't know if it's because she was never a good actress in the first place or if she just doesn't care anymore, but my god, she gave one of the worst on-screen performances I have seen this year.Although this is far from being Greengrass' best movie (or anyone's for that matter), "Jason Bourne" is a decent action-thriller that suffers from a clichéd script with too many snail-paced scenes. Expect the film to feel a lot longer than its two-hour runtime.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Alicia Vikander and Tommy Lee Jones Shine</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a huge fan of the first three Bourne movies I obviously went into the fourth Matt Damon installment of the series with high expectations. Especially since Paul Greengrass is back at the helm as director.Alicia Vikander and Tommy Lee Jones shine with solid performances as high level CIA agents hunting down Jason Bourne. The problem is that their relationship has strong echos of Joan Allen and Jason Strathairn's character's relationship in The Bourne Ultimatum not really providing anything really that new or original on the CIA front.As for Jason Bourne there is a strange dullness to his character in this film that didn't exist in the first three films. Watching this film we begin to miss the engaging, entertaining nature of Bourne's relationship with Franka Potente's character in the Bourne Identity.Overall still a high quality action movie that is worth seeing, it just missed the mark a little to be considered a classic along with the first three films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good watch - yet, expected more from JASON BOURNE</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"YOU KNOW HIS NAME"As an ardent follower of the Bourne series, the first-look of Matt Damon's black-and-white head-shot hidden beyond a bleak crack-of- light was enough to grab the senses for the 4th and the final- installment.Much of the familiar "Bourne-ish" thrill and action are suitably presented in JASON BOURNE. For fellow followers - that constant feeling of being on-the-run from the unknown is organically preserved by director Paul Greengrass and the protagonist Matt Damon himself - which make it all a worthwhile reminiscence and also, a fresh-experience for the new viewers serving as a compact independent watch.However, as once quoted by Damon himself post the release"The Bourne Ultimatum" that "? the story has been told"; therefore, the viewers may find themselves in a little-too-familiar territory, plot-wise.Bourne now having recovered from amnesia is trying to come to terms with his life staying off-the-grid in Greece while participating in illegal street-fights for a living when the ex-CIA agent turned whistle-blower Nicky Parsons (Julia Stiles, "Silver Linings Playbook"), hacks into the CIA mainframe to expose resumed targeted- assassination black-ops of CIA and coincidentally discovers crucial information concerning Bourne's past - a reason causing Bourne to pop-up the map. Subsequently the current CIA Director, Robert Dewey (Tommy Lee Jones, "Lincoln") juggles to put-down both the no longer complying and revolting social-media giant Aaron Kalloor (Riz Ahmed, "Nightcrawler"), whose online-services have helped CIA's secret mass-surveillance operations along with loose at-large Bourne - through a heavily grudgeful-"Asset"(Vincent Cassel). However, the new cyber-ops Chief Heather Lee (Alicia Vikander, "The Danish Girl", and the most- grayish character) plans for an alternate solution ? to persuade Bourne to return to CIA.What ensue are all parties being collateral with one another ? almost like a multi-person "duel". At its height, the film stages an rapidly chaotic and destructive car-chase in the heart of Vegas and hand-to-hand combat ? all enough to keep the viewer curious till the very end.Nevertheless, the film perhaps could have been a little more than usual - the only reason that people may feel slightly disappointed. Yet, again, with a fair-enough conclusion to the series with the overtone of signature "Extreme Ways" from the background, one can't help but feel thrilled at the sight of the man who survived everything.I am going with 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bourne to Run</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The producers of this film were reluctant to punch the ticket one more time on the merry- go-round. It was especially disheartening to learn that this excellent team of Paul Greengrass and Matt Damon couldn't come up with a more intriguing thriller (Mission:Impossible style). Instead the story is no more than what is said in the trailer "It could be worse than Snowden". Action beats are too frequent to try and go in depth to the aspects of such a story. In fact, Julia Stiles' character, who is the one who steals the information and has good reasons to, has less screen time than I hoped. If the movie went on a different path in setting up the story, instead of the same flashbacks, some fresh air could have been found. Perhaps showing the secret recruits training together. Or the Snowden angle, where tidbits of secrets are leaked to the press, with the repercussions hovering over the antagonists while still trying to commit their dirty deed. Then, there is the macguffin. Sadly, it resembles the same trope that ruined many big movies in the the last decade. It's the whole "big popular new app that everyone will have that is really a Trojan horse". It's not called Genesys, but you get the idea. Adding top actors only made the movie more expensive, not better. Tommy Lee Jones sleepwalks through this film. He looks bored all the time. I complained a few sequels ago that Bourne could have been the US answer to Bond, except he doesn't have a new love interest. And like I said the Julia Stiles angle (she hinted that was something deeper between them before the amnesia), is not explored. One slight wrinkle that works is that the "asset" this time has a personal vendetta, after information was leaked in Bourne Ultimatum. The saving grace, and the only real new aspect to this movie is actress Alicia Vikander (Ex Machina), takes over Joan Allen's role. With her photogenic looks, her European persona, and a tenacity to stand up against the other big boys, this film essentially is more about her character's growth than anything else. So credit the editors, et al, for recognizing the real meat of the story and giving her the appropriate screen time. Oh, and Matt Damon, I think, is in this movie. It could be just his stunt double. Any time he is on screen, the action cutting is so quick it is just a blur. He never talks as usual. This film could have shown some originality by getting Jason to break out of his somnambulism and engage in real dialogue. Alas, it's the same quest as the last three films. With the same old guy who knows all the secrets. This time Jason wants to find out the truth about his Dad. Sure OK. A positive approach to this film is to not lament what the potential could have been for a fourth Bourne outing, and instead just sit back and enjoy the adrenaline rush watching the numerous well-executed action scenes. Back in the 70's, you could produce an action movie like this and nobody would complain. These days, action for action's sake is not good enough. My ultimate conclusion is to recommend seeing this in the theatre if you want to enjoy a couple hours of air conditioned entertainment to get out of the summer heat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bourne equal boring. Hard to believe for an action movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yup this action movie almost put me to sleep twice. What happened is that this movie is 90% action and extended chase scenes that move at the same pace constantly throughout the movie and that pace got boring and tiring. What was worst is that some of the chase scenes were stupid, confusing, and defied logic! They were confusing because there was too much jumping around that you can't keep track of what they were doing or where each person are. Chase scenes work best where the audience is allowed to keep track of where every character that scene is and what they are doing. As for stupid and defying logic, here are two examples: 1) in Athens Greece, born meet with another ex-CIA female agent to exchange information in the middle of a riot. They are fallowed by a CIA hit man called "The Asset" whose assignment is to kill both Bourne and the woman he meets. The asset is controlled by telegraphic communications of another CIA computer monitor agent Heather Lee who is using satellite and local cameras to track and locate Bourne and directing the asset. During the riot, the Greek police are closing off the area and closing in. Fire bombing is happening everywhere. Now this where is gets dumb and illogical. During the chase, the asset crashes his car and has to continue his chase on foot. Bourne and his friend are still riding a motorcycle throughout this chase. Lee, monitoring the situation back in Washington DC, is able to determine Bourne's route out of the area before Bourne knows it himself, she directs the asset to go to the roof a certain building to set up a sniper's position because Bourne's route will circle around that point. The asset manages still have time to climb up to the roof and assemble his sniper's rifle and Bourne hasn't left the area on the cycle. How unbelievable. Now Bourne and his friend, still on the cycle, are constantly changing there own route because of a sudden police blockade or unexpected firebomb and their route becomes what Lee had predicted without one bit of CIA interference. The assets is still able to kill Bourne's friend after all that. Even more unbelievable. 2) In Vegas, Nevada, USA, the asset is assigned a job to go to assassinate Internet guru, Killoor at a convention. It is shown that the asset is studying the plans of the building. Therefore, the asset knows all the exits to the building including a very prominently marked on the plans, sewer line and access tunnels. Bourne doesn't know them. Now thinking logically, both the asset and Bourne are CIA trained to drop the weapon and exit the scene as fast as possible . Every Bourne film shows him doing this. It is logical for the asset to do the same. Well, in this film, Bourne is able to foil the attack, chase the asset a little bit, change his mind and go up to the 23rd floor in an elevator, have a conversation with Lee and CIA director Dewey (Tommy Lee Jones), kill Bradley, get back into the elevator, get back down to the lobby, scan the rushing crowd to search for the asset, find the asset because for some unexplained reason, the asset wasn't able to get out of the building while Bourne was up stairs and the final chase scene starts. How believable was that? Not believable at all.As for the plot, it is basic and lame. Bourne now remembers his real name and his past and that his father recruited him for the CIA and that his father was murdered by the asset on CIA orders. He discovers that the latest launch of a new internet networking program is really a CIA infected program designed to spy on everyone and the head of the computer company, Aaron Kalloor wants to expose the CIA plot. Naturally, Dewey wants him silenced. That is almost the whole story. There is no twists or turns in this film that are the hallmark of a typical Robert Ludlum story because he didn't write this story. Paul Greengrass and Christopher Rouse did. The characters are flat and one dimensional except for Kalloor and Lee. As for Matt Damon's portrayal of Bourne this time, he spends more time imitating the Terminator from the first terminator film than portraying Bourne. Damon just simply walks through this whole film with a grimace on his face and not saying a word. I doubt he had spoken more than twenty lines throughout whole the film. Jones, Vilander (Lee), Cassel (the asset), and Ahmed (Killoor) have a larger speaking parts than Damon does. This is Tommy Lee Jone's film more than it is Matt Damon's.Advice, save your money and wait for the video or the on demand download.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I watched it with slight interest, even though there wasn't that much happening. My boyfriend fell asleep on it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw "Jason Bourne" at the cinema with my boyfriend (he fell asleep in the middle). I should say I was expecting more (even though this is another movie about CIA after all). Why? Because this is Jason Bourne. I last watched the previous Bourne movies long ago, but I remember I enjoyed them. Especially "The Bourne Identity". They were intriguing, secretive, with a stronger plot than this movie. As it said in another review I saw, Jason is usually a clever planner, and in this movie he's reckless. I know that the focus of the movie is Jason Bourne and in this part "he's reached his tipping point", but we still need more cleverness (since he's our main character we should love for his abilities) and more things happening. And I don't think that enough happened even just when it comes to him. Like half of the things in the whole film were predictable. The movie is a bit lazy, but I wouldn't say it's crap. I guess you should watch it and see for yourself. Many people, including myself, were disappointed that one of the interesting things that was happening didn't evolve (related to a big revelation). The ending suggests that another Bourne movie could be made. I hope they will make another and it will have a strong plot. However, I don't regret watching this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good action flick, not a good Bourne film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jason Bourne is the 4th film in the Bourne franchise, directed by Paul Greengrass (I don't count Bourne legacy). After Ultimatum, it didn't seem as though the series needed a new film. The last one completed Jason Bourne's story and ended the trilogy on a high.Yet here we are in 2016 ? the year of the reboots, with a brand new film titled Jason Bourne. With The Bourne Ultimatum being such a wonderful film, Jason Bourne had some very large shoes to fill. And to do this, it tries going back to the basics ? good action and a good story to go with it.Jason Bourne definitely gets the action part right, with high intensity fist fights, fire fights and car chases that will keep you on the edge of your seat. Stunt coordinator Garry Powell really did an amazing job orchestrating (mostly) wonderful scenes. What it loses however is the intelligent structuring that previous Bourne films had, and it's quite a noticeable change in style.The story part however, is not as good. In general, it is passable ? it provides basic motivation for the characters' movements and decisions, and a slight reason for the audience to keep watching but not much more. The characters felt hollow and unrelatable, there wasn't enough reason for the audience to care about what happened to most of the characters, and it doesn't help that there were some less than believable performances from some of the actors. Even worse, there are a multitude of small plot holes, and by the end you are left with more questions than answers. If this film is the start of another series of Bourne movies, then some of the omissions can be forgiven, but it still doesn't excuse a noticeably sub par storyline.To add to that, the cinematography was less than average with way too many nauseating zooms and a 'handheld' look that looked a lot more like 'Parkinson's disease'. It feels as though they were trying to imitate the unique visual style of The Bourne Ultimatum - not a bad idea in itself, but this time it was very badly executed. Add in a lot of recycled shots from the other Bourne films and, even to an unpractised eye, Jason Bourne looks pretty bad. Really the entire film was shot as though it was just one long action scene, and it doesn't work. Instead of allowing the audience to clearly understand what's going on in the frame, we're left to decipher what we can from the blur of elements.It's not all bad though. John Powell returned as composer and he has once again done a wonderful job with the music. Certainly not at the level of Hans Zimmer (not many are), but he definitely hits the right notes at the right times, and the occasional reference back to the older Bourne soundtracks certainly help evoke some nice reactions. Even the editing was spot on, with Christopher Rouse doing an excellent work with all the action scenes and even the more decidedly boring parts of the movie, making sure that the bad cinematography didn't completely ruin the film. Somewhat as expected, Double Negative delivered some really fantastic visual effects. They have been one of the most consistently amazing VFX houses and Jason Bourne is absolutely no different to their other work, with every crack, every explosion, every set extension made to perfection. The Bourne films are based in reality and the VFX completely reflects that, it really is completely invisible and I could not tell you if a shot was done practically or on a computer.In the end though, what made the original Bourne trilogy such an amazing set of action films was the fact that they had struck an almost impeccable balance between adrenaline pumping action and a carefully crafted and believable story. Jason Bourne skews this balance heavily in favour of the action, and it pays the price. What could have been an engrossing film of Bourne finally finding out why he became who he became, is largely just a flurry of fists and cars crashing. Entertaining no doubt, but a real wasted opportunity to create what could have been a beautiful film.7.3/10 ? If you're a Bourne fan like me, you'll enjoy it.Note: If you easily get motion sickness or felt queasy watching Bourne Ultimatum, take a bag into the cinema when watching this movie. The cinematography really is that bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jason Bourne is a highly entertaining movie, though nothing is fresh. It follows the same formula as the other Bourne movies. However there is one improvement: the shaky camera fight scenes. This time Greengrass' shaky cam fight scenes help elevate the intensity of the fight unlike the scene in the Bourne Supremacy, which made that scene the weakest part of the movie. Damon is still believable as a trained assassin though he is becoming more like a superhero than in the previous installments. Another interesting development is the car chase scenes; one of the highlights of all Bourne movies with Matt Damon. The final car chase is exhilarating and feels like it was taken from a Fast and Furious movie. The weak points of the movie is that the movie does not feel fresh. The use of current themes such as hacking, government surveillance, and references to Snowden serve only as a dressing to an already familiar story. Talented actors seem to be wasted. Tommy Lee Jones is great as usual but he should have been given more action such as Chris Cooper's character Conklin. Vincent Cassel has been transformed to a silent killer, which makes him very under-used. Also, Alicia Vikander's performance cannot replace Julia Stile's or even Joan Allen (who unfortunately was not in the movie). If a sequel is made, they should focus on Bourne dealing with the present than dwelling too much on his past. I suggest they make use parallel stories: one tell Bourne's life as David Webb, and Jason Bourne on a current mission.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jason Bourne Is Back!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just recently saw the new addition to the Bourne movie series Jason Bourne and it was absolutely bad ass. Jason doesn't say much but he definitely says a lot with his actions. There are times the highly anticipated action film reflects and goes back to the previous Bourne movies to make a connection. Small things like using previous soundtracks that have been used in the past Bourne movies definitely gives the viewers an even better connection and experience while watching on the big screen. Followers of the Bourne movie series will definitely enjoy the film greater then those who have not got a chance to watch the whole series. Whether you watched all the movies or not you will absolutely enjoy this film. Yes this movie does have some scenes where it does get a little slow but that's with many movies nowadays. Not every scene has to have shooting, killing and gory scenes to be an overall good exciting movie. I recommend viewers interested in watching this movie to attempt and try to watch all of the Bourne installments as it will make an even greater movie experience. But like I said before that is not necessary. I watched this movie with friends who didn't even know who Jason Bourne was and they definitely enjoyed it and wanted more. I give Jason Bourne a perfect score just because i re watched all previous movies a day before i watched Jason Bourne and to me it was like one whole long,thrilling, action movie that explained in great detail his life and journey as a $100 million dollar weapon. I understood all connections and references to past films. I also understood and got what the director is trying to setup for the future Bourne movies. Whether you know his name or not i highly recommend you go watch this movie. You wont be disappointed. I cant wait for future Bourne movies. Jason Bourne lives on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jason Bourne is an OK movie by itself, but the 'hacking' scenes are an affront to computer literate people: - give me the shell (should at least show a shell on the screen when she gets it) - there's a phone in the room, I can use it delete the files (from the laptop that's not connected to the internet nor to the phone in question) ... in general, all 'hacking' in the movie is a really bad version of 'Hackers' from 1995. All the 'hacking' sequences feel like they were written/directed by Jason Bourne himself, a guy who knows how to kick your ass, but only knows how to use a computer to check his yahoo mail account. If the 'hacking' is so important to the plot, at least make it somewhat realistic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you have seen a Jason Bourne movie, than you have seen this movie already and should wait until it is released for rental. It follows just about the same story as each of the three previous Matt Damon Bourne movies. He is after the government and the government is trying to kill him.This movie is just chaotic though. Just about every scene is shot as if you were a passenger in a car traveling over 100 miles an hour and trying to make out the details of everything passing you by. It was choppy and poorly filmed. The editing for the action scenes is such a mess and it strains the eyes.Damon should have avoided this one and kept the legacy as it was.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a Bourne fan, way better than Bond of course and the first three of the series were simply amazing. Superb heavy-weight charismatic characters brilliantly acted by people such as Joan Alen and Brian Cox. After the unfortunate Jeremy Renner diversion, the return to Matt Damon who is superb in the title role and Greengrass directing has been much anticipated. But sadly, it is just too constantly frantic both in the hand-held camera movement and in the overly fast cutting, where Greengrass seems to be trying to make up for the light-weight quality of the other characters. How he must have shouted "cut faster" over and over to try to rescue the movie. Tommy Lee Jones is a real disappointment looking like a man wheeled out of a retirement home and lacking any gravitas at all - not like him normally. If coming out of a cinema with your head spinning is what you want, you will love it. If like me you loved the earlier Bournes, you will wonder if the head ache was worth it. But, after all the criticism, if I had not seen the first three Bourne films, I would have thought it was amazing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"I don't know who I am." was one of the first things Jason ever said, after waking up on a boat many years ago. Finding himself on a path that took many twists and turns. However, now it is much different. Jason Bourne has lost his flair, as so comes with aging. In the trilogy he was a man to be feared, and a man full of mystery. Now Bourne just feels like another agent, lost in a world of action movies and flashy explosions. If you enjoyed the trilogy you would probably enjoy this film, but beneath the shaky camera angles, and a select few cool scenes it feels hollow. It is a story retold, rather than a story extending. Which the trilogy did an amazing job of.Recommendation: Don't see in theaters unless you're with friends, who also like the Bourne series.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bourne is back, but why?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every time I've been to the cinema in the past few months, the trailer for Jason Bourne has been shown, building up the anticipation of Bourne being back on the big screen. Last Wednesday the movie was finally released and I was there to catch a first-day showing. As per usual with this series of films, the movie is a couple of hours of intense action in the form of fight scenes and car chases, a few government conspiracies to form a story, and the patented Paul Greengrass shaky cam causing me a lot of motion sickness but having little idea of what's happening on screen.Jason Bourne is the fifth film in the quintuple series and although I did enjoy it, it ranks in last place behind Jeremy Renner's Bourne Legacy. Everything this movie gets right, the quick impactful fight scenes, Bourne riding on the motorcycle trying to evade death at the hands of the asset, and the use of spy gear ranging from computers to monoculars; we have already seen in the previous movies. Then there are problems like the way the story's main theme is the asset trying to gets his revenge against Bourne after his cover was blown due to the events of the Bourne Ultimatum. This feud completely detracts from the Governments plan to be able to survey and control the world by hacking into all electronic devices: a theme similarly explored in both the recent Mission Impossible and Bond films.The one new and positive aspect from the film is the addition of Alicia Vikander to the cast. Although she is a Government agent, the decisions she made on screen meant you were never sure what her agenda was, maintaining a little suspense throughout the movie. The end scene where Bourne gets the better of her when you are to believe they have an understanding with each other was a classic moment living up to the previous movies' closing scenes.Final thought: Matt Damon is back as Jason Bourne and it is certainly worth a viewing, but if a sixth movie is made in the coming years, let's have less shaky cam and bring back the Moby version of Extreme Ways!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The End of Jason Bourne</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By no means does this film measure up to the excellent trilogy that came before it, however, I am happy to say that this movie belongs in the franchise. Matt Damon has returned along with newcomers Tommy Lee Jones and Alicia Vikander. Jones gives the best performance, while Damon still manages to command the screen at all times as he portrays his greatest character for the first time in nine years. What can I say? This film just feels like a Bourne movie. I'm extremely proud of Matt Damon for holding out on a sequel until director Paul Greengrass agreed to return as well. With Greengrass' cinematography and Damon's acting, these two are a force to be reckoned with. They did a fantastic job with the first three Bourne movies and the main reason why I welcome this new film into my personal canon is because they have recreated what they had already done. I was worried that the new Bourne movie would have a new look to go with the new decade, but thankfully it holds out. As much as I am praising this, many people's biggest problem with this franchise is the choice of shaky-cam action sequences. This I myself dislike in all movies but these. Somehow, they just work. One has to pay unusually close attention, sure, but I respectfully disagree with those who claim you can't tell what's going on in these movies. All this being said, I have a few minor problems with how the story played out. Julia Stiles' character Nicky Parsons is killed off in the first act, and while this in and of itself I don't necessarily have a problem with, I criticize the fact that Stiles herself is wasted on screen and that the method of ridding us of her character is in the end just lazy writing. Her death is no different than Marie's death in 'Supremacy', and what it really comes down to is the fact that this is the only point this sequel directly copies one of the original films that came before it. It would have been much better to include Nicky in a larger role or have her disappear in a different way for this reason alone. One can also see this death coming from a mile away, and it's pretty clear that one of the main reasons is simply to establish rising star Alicia Vikander as the new leading lady anyway (although she turns out to be an antagonist as well, and doesn't really give a noteworthy performance, so this was also pointless). There is a lot more going on in this movie than ever before. Each main character, including the assassin repeatedly sent after Bourne, has a backstory and a reason for involving themselves in the plot beyond what one would initially think. This I also like, because it keeps the plot that has been used for four movies now from getting old. One thing is for sure: this is the end of Jason Bourne. While the ending of the movie would seem to be left open for sequels, it's not that great of an opening and I sincerely hope that the studio fails to convince Damon and Greengrass to return (both individuals have stated they wish this to be Bourne's last outing; good for them). This character is not James Bond. He is not a reboot-able, recast-able character who can have a new leading lady and a new villain for 25 movies to come. In this movie, anything we didn't already know about Bourne's past is revealed. To continue this series with Jason would be milking the franchise dry, and it would ruin the legacy of this great series of films. This does not surpass its predecessors, but it is welcomed by me. Thanks for a great time at the theater, Matt &amp; Paul! 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In a summer of terrible film choices, Jason Bourne is a fun film with some quality moments.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bourne AgainJason Bourne is the fourth installment of the Bourne series, unless you count the related Bourne Legacy with Jeremy Renner. This film stars Matt Damon as Bourne, super weapon gone rogue. The film deals with some of the same themes as the first three Bourne films: patriotism, loyalty, the morality of surveillance, privacy, and power. This films brings out more about Bourne's past, and that's just enough to propel the story and give Bourne reason to take action. Again, an older white guy runs the chase for Bourne, the much elderly Tommy Lee Jones playing CIA Director Robert Dewey. I was at first concerned, but I shouldn't have been. Lee has played enough agents, police and men of power that he could almost play the role in his sleep. Thankfully, he is more than somnambulant in the role, doing fairly well if not breaking much new ground. His voice is a bit flat at times, but aren't heads of the CIA supposed to be that way?A while back in my review of Ex Machina, I complimented Alicia Vikander for her performance and wrote that I hoped that she would have roles other than attractive foils for male leads to play in her future. It's nice to see that attractive leading women can get roles of power and substance. She plays ambitious cyber super-star agent Heather Lee. She is cold, calculating, manipulative and dynamic. Let that be a lesson to Hollywood and film studios elsewhere. Women can act too, even pretty actresses. Now time to bring on an older women to be the head of the CIA, played by perhaps Francis McDormand or god forbid, anti-establishment Susan Sarandon. Talk about playing against type. The one problem I have with Vikander's performance is that I am not sure what kind of accent the Swedish actress is trying to mimic. At various times it sounds slightly British, Dutch, New England and standard U.S. English. It was slight; I am certain most people paying less attention than I didn't notice. She is talented enough that she will master it. You might wonder why Matt Damon would revive the Bourne role after all these years. Perhaps it was because he got to produce this film, making himself a bigger paycheck and giving him more control over the production. If there is another Bourne film, don't be surprised if the price to the studio for Damon's participation is that he direct it. The other actors are excellent, including Ato Essandoh as the CIA security chief and Julia Stiles as the former CIA hacker and confidant, Nicky Parsons. In the best supporting role, Vincent Cassel plays Bourne's nemesis, the CIA asset who has a grudge the size of the MGM Grand to settle with Bourne. He matches Damon's determination blow for blow. The film has one long fight and one long car chase, relying more on espionage than action as parts two and three did. Still, there's plenty of action, so you won't be disappointed if that's what you go for. The look of the major fight scene is different; there might be a new choreographer. It was fine, but not as hard hitting, literally and metaphorically, as the fights in the other three Damon films. There were a few moments that were copied directly out of the first three films, important elements they could have changed. I won't tell you those now; you will have to watch the film to find out. There are also some credibility and continuity problems with the plot. The biggest problem is with Parsons. Why wouldn't Parsons change her hair to blend in is baffling. She stands out like a black woman at the RNC. The editing is top notch, the music mostly stays out of the way, and some of the action scenes are award worthy. That is partly credited the aforementioned Cassel and Damon. Best of all, the ending brings it all home. Even if it leaves us open for a followup film, it was well done and a surprise in the way it happened. Don't believe all the reviewers who say the action was hard to follow. What did they expect from an action film, that you could go to the bathroom and not miss something? Rating: MatinéeIt is well done and laid out with a few plot inconsistencies and worth seeing in the theater. Stop over-thinking it. DO IT, DO IT NOW! And have fun. Peace, Tex Shelters</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Autistic Reviewers Opinion Of This Movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With this fifth installment of the Bourne films, I can say that the filmmakers have chosen to get Matt Damon back along with director Paul Greengrass to bring back what made the first three films worthy of attention, as the last one 'Legacy' received a mixed reception from critics and fans. How does this one hold up? I can definitely say that it has all of the key elements that make the series recognizable but while leaving a door for a future film it does expand the films universe and breaks it's full circle trilogy.I'll keep it short on plot details but it's basically that Bourne is lured back into the hunt for the truth and justice after getting off the radar and seemingly ending the Blackbar/Treadstone operations, he knows of his involvement but now seeks to know the truth why he had done it. Being pursued by operatives that have plans for a new security operations in the world, Bourne must find the truth whilst ending another attempt to place harm on peace and freedom.What makes this one a worthy watch is not only the return of Damon and Greengrass, but this one has a better plot than Legacy and manages to capture the essence of the previous films. The acting is great from all of the cast, both leading and supporting roles and it's great to see Damon back in his signature role, giving his usual best as an accomplished actor. The villain isn't bad at all, he's basically there to make a tough battle for Bourne to beat and being played by Tommy Lee Jones is great, he fits in well and Vincent Cassel makes a worthy side villain that never seems to stop on hunting Bourne and his few allies.The realistic action set pieces are it's usual; kinetic, realistic and very engaging with sharp editing and shake camera work to make a thrill for action fans but a headache for others. The finale car chase was indeed amazing as, but there's no way that it can beat Ultimatum's knockout car chase sequence, but there are two vehicle chase sequences rather than the one in JB and both are just as insane to watch.Overall, Jason Bourne is back at what fans loved about the series in the first place. Engaging plot, knockout action and sharp film making that is a redeemer for fans but unnecessary for some. It's a definite open door installment that wants to go further on story but depending on how you see its ending, it's a good conclusion though it was done before in Ultimatum.3.5/5/ 7.5/10 - Autistic Reviewers</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jason's quest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The long-awaited and much anticipated return of Matt Damon as Jason Bourne with Paul Greengrass directing, just about delivered up to expectations, in my opinion. I would have preferred though that the movie title wasn't a) so boring and obvious and b) in keeping with its predecessors, something like The Bourne Resolution or The Bourne Redemption, you get my drift and I would also have appreciated an appearance or at least reference to the immediately preceding entry in the series, the not unworthy "The Bourne Legacy" starring Jeremy Renner.Nevertheless, it was great to see an older Damon still physically up to the demands of the part, as his stirrings of self-identity are revived by Julia Stiles who kicks things of by hacking into CIA's black-ops files and reaches out to Bourne with the devastating revelation of his father's involvement in the Treadwell program and whose death in front of his son at the hands of a deadly in-house assassin fuels much of what follows.This time, besides the revengeful Vincent Cassell as the CIA's murderous "Asset" stalking his every move, the trail of truth will inevitably lead Bourne to the agency's chief executive, the ruthless Tommy Lee Jones. Lucky for Bourne, the latter's trusted main operative, Alicia Sikander, develops a conscience (or does she?) and AIDS our hero as he finally uncovers the truth about his past life.The problem for me with the movie was that all of the above just seemed a bit fourth or even fifth-hand as situations and characters echo from the earlier films. In addition, the relentless pace of the action, which really only stops when Damon finally gets one-to-one with Jones, and set-piece extended action sequences only tend to further de-humanise Bourne and his predicament. Or, to put it succinctly, as my wife said it to me in her verdict, it just seemed to be one long chase, which makes it more "Indiana Jones and The Temple Of Doom" than "Raiders Of The Lost Ark", not a good thing in my book. And while I'm carping, the decision to set climactic scenes in Las Vegas seemed gratuitous and clichéd, exciting as they are. Even James Bond got there before Bourne some 45 years ago in "Diamonds Are Forever".All that said, it was good to see Damon's Bourne finally gain (hate the word) closure after so long and the fight and action scenes were well up to standard. Once again, it's women who crucially aid Bourne in his quest, but somehow this time, without Bourne really engaging with them emotionally. And for me that sums up the weakness in the film, a lack of humanity at its heart, leaves the viewer battered about the head about what they've watched rather than really engaged inside the head.Will there be more? I don't know, now that seemingly all his demons have been exercised and of course even Matt Damon can't stay in shape forever but if there is to be a Bourne Continuation, I'd like to see a little less action and a bit more emotion brought to the table.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Bourne trilogy - the best spy movies and some of the best action movies of the last fifteen years. This Bourne movie is not so great. The years have put their mark on Matt Damon. I don't know if that's why, but the action scenes are blurry and shot too close. Alicia Vikander character lacks consistency and is not convincing. This time Tommy Lee Jones is an old man without too many ideas. I do not see how the director of CIA could behave so silly... And someone please tell me how the final battle ends in it's last 10 seconds because it is totally unclear and illogical how Bourne win... But, over all, if you close your eyes to details, then it's a pretty good action movie to spend your weekend watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No less ? but also no more ? than an enjoyable retread of what made the Paul Greengrass' Bourne movies so thrilling, engaging and heart-stopping</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No 'Supremacy'. No 'Ultimatum'. And of course, no 'Legacy'. Just the name of the character we are familiar with ? oh, and the return of Matt Damon in the titular role. Not just Damon in fact, but Paul Greengrass, the director of 'The Bourne Supremacy' and 'The Bourne Ultimatum' whose vérité style, with its dizzying hand-held camera-work and splintered editing, became synonymous with the franchise as well as ? for better and for worse ? a much-imitated style of action blockbusters in recent years. Both are back after a nine-year break, and you'll be glad to know that neither has lost their respective sensibilities in crafting a tense, propulsive motion picture pulsating with a palpable sense of urgency. Oh yes, and the fact that Greengrass has not lost his political edge gives 'Jason Bourne' an added sense of relevance too.Rather than rely on someone else, Greengrass has taken it upon himself to assume scripting duties here, collaborating with longtime series editor (but first-time writer) Christopher Rouse to bring Bourne back into the CIA's crosshairs. Keeping with his raison d'?tre of the initial trilogy, Bourne's motivation here remains personal, emerging from the depths of bare-knuckled underground fights on the outskirts of the Greek border to uncover his father's involvement in the Treadstone programme as well as the truth behind his presumed death at the hands of Islamic terrorists in Beirut years ago. It is his fellow Company renegade Nicky Parsons (Julia Stiles) who brings the information to his attention, after harvesting some Black Ops files from the CIA's dungeon while working for a WikiLeaks-type figure determined to expose the U.S. Government's deepest and darkest secrets.Bourne's determination to uncover more of his past comes up against the CIA's current director Robert Dewey (Tommy Lee Jones), who has a couple of skeletons in his closet that he prefers to keep hidden. The fact that Bourne also has information on his latest covert programme known as Deep Dream involving a Facebook-like social media company run by billionaire founder Aaron Kalloor (Riz Ahmed) makes Bourne an even more crucial target to be eliminated. Dewey is assisted by a brilliant and ambitious tech analyst Heather Lee (Alicia Vikander), as well as a relic of the Blackbriar programme ? referred to here as the "Asset" (Vincent Cassel) ? with his own score to settle with Bourne. Not just Dewey of course, each of the other supporting players will at some point emerge with their own secrets and hidden agendas, the irony here being how Bourne is probably the least inscrutable character.By this point, it is safe to say that the Bourne franchise has left the shadow of the Robert Ludlum novels on which the character is based in the dust, but in turn, Greengrass has shaped Bourne as the post-9/11 hero that we need. Through Bourne, Greengrass raises questions about the dangers of Big Brother and just how much we should compromise on individual privacy for the greater good of national security, positing a very real scenario that the corporations owning the social media platforms with so much of citizens' metadata (and actual data) could in fact be in cahoots with the Government that their users inherently distrust. That the finale set in Las Vegas should have its basis in an Exocon conference where the topic of privacy versus security is being discussed further attests to how serious Greengrass is about the issue.That doesn't mean that he has forgotten what his core fan demographic has turned up for; in fact, if anything, Greengrass ups the ante in each one of his confidently staged action set-pieces ? first, a fiery riot in Athens' Snytagma Square where Bourne comes out of hiding to meet Nicky that starts off as a foot pursuit amidst clashes between police and rampaging protesters and turns into a thrilling motorcycle chase along the city's narrow back streets; followed by a public rendezvous between Bourne and a former Treadstone employee in London that sees Dewey run his own little operation by the side; and finally, a mammoth showdown that goes from a 'Manchurian Candidate-like' assassination at a big public event to a slam-blang chase along the Las Vegas Strip with massive vehicular carnage. If anything, Greengrass aims for a breakneck pace that could do with greater moments of quiet contemplation and conversation, especially that which does not involve Bourne running, shooting or fighting.Yet even as it does keep us viscerally engaged and intellectually stimulated, 'Jason Bourne' does not lose its emotional core thanks to Damon's grounded performance. He may have even less to say compared to any of the previous movies, but Damon remains compulsively watchable as the haunted protagonist at the centre of a very frenetic movie. Strictly speaking, this latest entry hardly breaks any new ground, but Greengrass and Damon are back at what they did best close to a decade ago, complete with a topical subtext to ensure its currency. If you've never liked Greengrass' mix of blurry zooms, pans and quick cuts, you're not going to start anytime now; but anyone looking for that unique sense of excitement in 'Supremacy' and 'Ultimatum' will welcome this rehash with open arms.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Matt Damon, Bourne again.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We know his name. Jason Bourne has a whole book and movie series to his name, cementing Matt Damon's performance as an iconic character on par with Daniel Craig's Bond or Kiefer Sutherland's Jack Bauer. From The Bourne Identity to The Bourne Ultimatum, Jason Bourne went through a complete story arc that focused on his struggle to understand who he is, as a lost ex-spy and as a human being.Now, we have a fourth film in the arc (fifth if you count the stand-alone Bourne Legacy, which I barely remember and has no bearing on this film). Jason Bourne finds the man off the grid again, drifting place to place as if in a trance, making ends meet through the exquisite art of bare-knuckle boxing. Of course, something happens that pulls him back into the CIA's crosshairs. He's forced to run from Greece to London to Vegas, outrunning and outsmarting spies and assassins as he searches for the truth. Again.There's absolutely nothing new to Jason Bourne. For a movie that bears the man's full name, as if to suggest this will be a definitive character-defining adventure, it's rather disappointing. There's only one relevant point to the movie makes: another piece to Bourne's past. This revelation serves solely to villainize the villains and give Bourne a reason to kill them. It doesn't change anything before or after: Bourne is nothing more than a golem in this movie who smashes his enemies and comes out totally unscathed and unchanged. There is no real danger or peril to be felt, and there's little-to-no reason to cling to Bourne as a character (other than sheer badassery). He's a total rock, who confronts equally-flat characters.The story itself seems to prove that all the Bourne movies now have a formula: movie starts with Bourne off the grid, something happens, he gets chased, he chases and outsmarts people, then repeat five times in five different countries until he confronts the guy in charge. The end. Guess what? That's pretty much all that happens here: the movie goes through three or four different repetitions of the exact same spy game with big setpieces in exotic locales, but it amounts to a predictable outcome. The only stakes at hand is the threadbare piece of personal history. The movie crams in some current issues ripped from yesterday's headlines (such as mass surveillance conspiracies, finding back doors in communication technology, name-dropping Snowden ad nauseam), which gives some fairly interesting social stakes, but it comes off as stuffy and droll. It's a thrilling experience in the moment, but when I take a step back, I have to ask, this is it? Didn't we see this stuff already with Supremacy and Ultimatum? Fans may be pleased to know that with Paul Greengrass back in the director's chair, the film is on-par with previous Bourne entries. That means, for better or for worse, an onslaught of hyperkenetic action scenes with horrendous camera shake and rapid-fire editing. When the camera isn't shaking, the film is as dark and drab as they come, and most shots are quite pedestrian. Fortunately, performances are decent. Matt Damon still embodies Jason Bourne with impressive physical and emotional intensity. Tommy Lee Jones is fitting as the stiff CIA director. Alicia Vikander can't seem to hold an American accent, but it hardly bothered me?I enjoyed her performance just as well as the rest of the cast. Vincent Cassel is just as menacing here as he was staring in Mesrine. Writing is fairly understated?dialogue is scant, but does its job aptly of giving information and letting the story and characters fill in the blanks. This production is one of the most creditable-looking spy movies around: all the locales, sets, props, and costumes look gritty, realistic, and palpable. Music is okay (although, despite my adoration of Moby's work, "Extreme Ways" continues to grate on me personally, even with a new remix).In fact, the end-credits song may as well embody what this movie is all about: the same old thing with heavier beats. But while the original three movies had a character arc worth exploring, this movie draws out a rather thin thread to string the formulaic plot along. And in the end, I realize there's little reason for me to care about Bourne or what happens to him in this pointless entry in the series.If you're a fan, see it, by all means, you might love it. But unless filmmakers break out of the standard Bourne mold, the original three movies will remain where the series begins and ends for me.2.5/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Robbie K back again with the third movie review of the week. Tonight, we move away from the comedy/drama and move into the action film of the seven-day spread. Our film to review today is Jason Bourne, the fifth installment (fourth if you don't count Legacy) in the spy with the same name. Upon seeing the trailer, I didn't know what to expect with this movie and could only pray the fifth film could maintain the spark. Has the Bourne series returned to the glory of the first trilogy with the return of Matt Damon, or is it another Hollywood sham? As always, let's get started. The GOOD ? Acting is top notch ? Decent crime/conspiracy plot ? Exciting conclusion?ishLet's kick off the review with a quality you might not really care about in terms of a movie like this?the acting. At this time I must say that the emotional spectrum in this movie is limited to stoic faces, slightly angry outbursts and looks of alarm when loud noises are made. But our cast does this so well that you have to appreciate how good the edge works for them. Matt Damon has not let the time delude the sharpness he had as the assassin from years ago. While he certainly looks the part, Damon also keeps his emotions in check and delivers his anger in a manner that is not overdone. As for Tommy Lee Jones, well he still has the reliable delivery that we all know and love in his various agent roles (again not showing any emotion). Alicia Vikander as the new leading lady gets thumbs up as well, but she isn't quite as endearing as the others outside of providing a great connecting character for the story (and potential sequel). Now that the acting is put aside, let's talk plot next. Jason Bourne's plot is decent, a very technical movie that explores the complex web of lies the agency likes to weave. This film does a great job of reintroducing the classic hero (though the opening is a little slow) and helps get the audience prepped for the tale at hand. The focus of this movie involves explaining a little more about Bourne's origin stories and just who is the source of all his anger is. While certainly not the most unique tale I have ever seen, it does fit well with the Bourne universe and provides the backbone for all the chaos to be had. And perhaps my favorite part of it all was the exciting finish. Speaking of the finale, man did Bourne's tale end with a bang. All of the tension comes to full boil, forcing Bourne and his allies to make some hasty decisions that leads to adrenaline pumping chases. What starts out as a foot race quickly amps up to vehicles and gunplay where the special effects come to full life and the sound grips you harder than a vice grip. Yes it is a bit over the top, and the amount of damage is ridiculous, but it certainly is good for a laugh. The BAD ? Slow to take off ? Action masked as lots of walking ? Nicky Parsons limited roleI already mentioned this, but the Borne movie took a little time to take off for me. Yes, the set up is building some tension, but it took a little too long to get to the good action parts. There wasn't as much drive to the set up and the dry dialogue did not help things along at all. Maybe if there had been a little more emotion in our characters or some symphony score to amp it up it could have been better for me. However, the slowness is forgotten once you get to that first chase scene that proved Bourne still had skills, outside of punching untrained guys. And then the action hits the wall that makes you wonder how it is considered the most action packed of the series. After the chase scene, most of the action is actually our cast speed walking around various cities in an attempt to escape the technology superior government. While the cinematography certainly gave you great shots of these locations, seeing the actors get a good cardio workout is not my ideal vision of action. Seriously, I was waiting for the Lord of the Rings walking music to play. Even when the action scenes hit, the camera work got quite shaky and could be difficult to follow at times. At least the finale restored my faith in the series a bit. And finally Nicky Parsons. The woman was certainly awesome in the first trilogy, but in this movie she was robbed of the much needed screen time. As impressive as she was in the opening, her character exited the stage too soon to satisfy the promise the trailers provided. Maybe the story, the action, or the delivery could have been more exciting had they teamed up some more.The VERDICTThe fifth Bourne movie has everything you expect in the series including a convoluted plot, intense chase scenes, decent gunplay, and emotionless flat characters who only care to kick butt. While I don't agree that it is the best movie of the series, it still fit in well with the series and provided some entertainment. True, I did want a faster tale, better action, and a little deeper story, but hey there is always another movie to accomplish that goal. Would I recommend it for a theater visit? I can say yes, especially for die hard fans of the series, but would suggest other films in place of this one. My scores are:Action/Thriller: 7.5 Movie Overall: 7.0</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watchable but probably the weakest of the Bourne films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the fifth installment in the franchise and the public together with Universal actually made a big deal of it because of Matt Damon and Paul Greengrass returning to do one more sequel. The marketing company was pretty blatant with a slogan "You know his name" and the actual name of the movie being "Jason Bourne". It was reinforced by characters saying things like "OMG, it's Jason Bourne!" and "You know who he is, so you better prepare" So it assumes that we all know his name and know he's coming and we are trembling in anticipation. Wouldn't be a problem in case this film fulfilled such high demands. But i'd say it rather didn't.I liked first Bourne movies (especially THE first) for two reasons. One is the feeling of omnipresent powerful mystery and crushing conspiracy, second is jaw-breaking fist-fighting scenes. New Bourne flick didn't bring any. If mystery and hard-core covert-ops atmosphere is a somewhat abstract and difficult matter, action filming is actually a done deal for Damon and Greengrass considering their previous endeavors. But something didn't allow them to deliver. One would think that they just needed to repeat the formula of their previous work, but no. Action sequences are weaker, and what's worse, there are not enough such sequences in the movie overall. We have one short scene in the end. That's it. Those one- punch KOs from the trailers? Don't make me laugh!The mystery feeling was lost mostly due to silly and weak story. Few placeholder real-world "homages" like the presence of Facebook-Google- Apple-like corporation; cyber attacks that are quoted "could be worse than Snowden"; street protests in Greece, etc. don't save the plot from bad 90s spy-thriller stuff like instant any-device hacking, immediate in the crowd spotting, CIA software with a fancy video-game UI, where-to- shoot-the-wall guessing, country-border-while-most-wanted ignoring. Mission Impossible movies make it look more serious. Not because it's more realistic, but because MI at least acknowledges that it's a fantasy. Bourne is a dead serious flick, but with a dead dumb spying techniques. And the main intrigue? Main motivation of the character? Give me a break! Jason Bourne seems like a self-copying story about the same stuff that was in Supremacy and Ultimatum unless it's less dynamic and less fresh after 9 years since the last Bourne movie. And if in the first trilogy every CIA executive, every trained assassin felt and looked like a real threat and a serious obstacle, here Jason's antagonists don't impress at all. I didn't feel any fear for the protagonist. All was too easy for him to overcome. His luck was never-ending and his punches were not less stronger than Hulk's. So no fear for him. Motorcycle and car chasing scenes didn't help being pretty boring.What i liked about this movie is the thing that it partly appeals to the attentive viewers and fans of the spy genre. It often shows classified documents, files, messages, terminal commands as if allowing us to take part in solving the case. Overall production value looked good if lacking in action sequence maintaining. The cast is pretty appealing with pleasant presence of Tommy Lee Jones, Vincent Cassel and Alicia Vikander along with Matt Damon. But as for the rest the film felt as a pretty average piece. I've definitely anticipated more and in the end liked Aaron Cross story more. Universal took not a best road for the franchise probably because original novel material was depleted and original script-writers are not able to provide stories of the same level of gravity and tension. Probably i'll naively hope for the best and await better from the next sequels (because why not?), but for now it seems that this franchise has already given the viewers all it could.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bourne tackles his biggest challenge yet...Global Espionage.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In what seems like a decade has passed, The man with eponymous past has returned to the big screen. As the title card suggests, "You know his name," "You know his past". This should bring excitement to any fan of the series. With a moderately established world revolving around Jason Bourne and his co-conspirators; there is nothing new on the horizon that we haven't seen or frankly not know about Jason Bourne. Or So we thought as each movie cleverly created new information different but vital to what we last saw, With each movie following a basic formula diverging from its source material when needed, feeding us enough history of Bourne to extend three movies and perhaps a bigger universe. As Bourne coldly and confidently tells us "He Remembers Everything", his famous line at the end of Ultimatum. One could wonder where would the story go next with our troubled hero. Well, the answer is nowhere really! In the fourth installment excluding (2012's The Bourne Legacy), Following a decade after his disappearance at the conclusion of The Bourne Ultimatum, Bourne has isolated himself from the world, staying alive through means of illegal fighting. Punishing himself for his past he is lured out by Nicky Parsons (Julia Stiles) with information regarding his past and a new shadowy organization hoping to rebuild what he thought was once behind him. With Matt Damon reprising his role as Jason Bourne, we are also introduced to a new batch of characters. Alicia Vikander (The Danish Girl) as the career-driven and headstrong Heather Lee, who possess ulterior motives when it comes to Bourne and his past. Tommy Lee Jones (Criminal) as our resident antagonists and CIA director, Robert Dewey. Like "Criminal" Jones is sadly not given much to work with here; although he does do a fantastic job of making us forget "Brian Cox", not present this time around. Director Paul Greengrass (The Bourne Supremacy, The Bourne Ultimatum) is back again with a screen writing credit to his name for co-writing the script with Christopher Rouse, and with Tony Gilroy (The Bourne Legacy) not involved in the writer's room, his absence is noticed heavily throughout as Bourne not only struggles to make sense of his newfound knowledge but a plot involving espionage surround an app called Deep Dream created by Riz Ahmed (The Night Of) Cinematographer Barry Ackroyd re-teaming with Greengrass (Captain Phillips) guides us beautifully from different locations, particularly a car chase through Greece and Las Vegas leaving us gasping and anticipating more. The Shaky Cam technique Greengrass loves to use can at times become a little nauseating after ten years of Bourne's absence. When trying to compare Jason Bourne to its predecessor's; One should not judge it harshly. Yes, the groundwork created for the three previous films should have given us a much better movie and spy-induced thriller. But Jason Bourne is a film in the series that is meant to stand on its own merit. A way to breathe life back into the franchise and hopefully give us more stories of Bourne to come. With a collection of 13 novels at hand, I'm sure there is enough source material to go around. If you are a fan of the Bourne Franchise; Then you will love and definitely remember his name.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK - First question - was this next installment necessary? Answer - YES That does not make this a good film however - but it does give some closure - and with the emphasis on CLOSURE - this has to be it.I was never once bored throughout this movie - if you have seen the Bourne movies by now you will be used to the shaky camera work - it is particularly shaky in Jason Bourne.Somehow I feel Paul made this as a finale - god I hope so - to show what he wanted to achieve with an action movie Director and how his camera work can thrill like a roller coaster ride - that mixture of adreneline and sickness...It works - but nothing new in conception happens. Jason Bourne uses the same ol tactics - meet somewhere - create a public panic and use that as a false flag to meet someone and gather info.Great car chases (expected) - some great fight scenes (expected) - you learn about his past (hoped for) and you end up with a wrap..If Paul or Damon EVER make another one I will NOT go. This was a wrap - a finale - and I enjoyed it. A masterpiece it is not - a good movie sure... but Paul has shown what he can do now. No repeat is necessary.</fullReview>

He embodies the essence of the character. Brooding, incredibly fit and spy sharp. The only thing I would love to see is him impeccably dressed in a scene or two. They covered undressed and shabby chic well.There is just one small piece that I can't wrap my "believability" around...watch the movie and tell me what you think.

		<fullReview>The movie had so much potential with a excellent cast, and an impressive trilogy record. While I felt the acting was stellar, the plot was predictable, and the movie felt like a cocktail of other movie fragments. There was a feeling that Bourne was invincible throughout the movie which is caused the suspense to fizzle. It seems like the movie could have developed many ideas that came up, but it the end, it just felt like a screenplay which doesn't develop into substance. However, it is worthwhile mentioning the acting of Alicia Vikander in this film, I thought she was a perfect fit for the role. Overall, not close to the original Bourne trilogy, but had some flashes of interest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film is the jack of all trades but a master of none</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me begin by saying what I loved about the movie I loved Matt Damon's performance and the action scenes were amazing. The action scenes combined with suspense and realism were compelling and the film never bored me. I feel however that this film simply does not have a plot that I can get behind as it is very predictable and the character development is mediocre. It can be a whole to better had they included more obstacles in Bourne's path is he simply gets from point A to point B too easily and while there is one minor plot twist, there isn't one that shakes or makes the film evolve. While you can praise many things about the film, it has it's fair share of weaknesses and leaves you somewhat disappointed that there was not more things in the film. Matt Damon continues to entertain and show us all why he is one of the best actors we have and one of the best of our generation. The fight choreographers did an amazing job and had arguably the best fight choreography of the year due to it's realism. I give this film a 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quality film that suffers mildly.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Paul Greengrass, Matt Damon, and Julia Stiles return in epic fashion. The direction, acting, cinematography, and general quality of the film exceeds just like it's predecessors. The only issues I took with the film was the less than enticing plot and moments of misinformation. There are two characters in specific that the audience is left to guess who they are and what connection they have with the plot. There are several new characters introduced that I feel no one will care about while watching, as we don't get to spend enough time with them. Ultimately "Jason Bourne" suffers from franchise exhaustion. The last film in the original trilogy concluded the story perfectly. If this was a standalone movie I'm positive the reception would be much more positive, but it isn't. What it is, is a revival of an already concluded story, revived singularly for the purpose of making money. Regardless, it is well made and the underwhelming reviews I imagine are those comparing this entry to previous installments of the series.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bourne is back with a Vesuvius style eruption of thrills and spills.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To say Bourne is back with a bang is an understatement. Paul Greengrass and Matt Damon have done it again, and Bourne is back with a Vesuvius style eruption of thrills and spills. This adrenaline fuelled, thrill ride of a movie will get your blood pumping and your heart pounding. Suggest you seek medical advice before you take your seat!Barely existing as a bare knuckle fighter on the Greek /Albanian border, Bourne (Matt Damon) is found by Nicky (Julia Stiles). She has discovered secrets about his past which bring him back into action, seeking the truth. Damon, as always, plays Bourne to perfection, skillfully eliciting our empathy. This time, his main adversaries are CIA Director Robert Dewey (Tommy Lee Jones), Operative Heather Lee (Alicia Vikander), and a CIA asset (Vincent Cassel). Cassel, in particular, gives the film vibrancy with a display of cold hearted rage. A perfect counterweight to the titular character, it's their mayhem inducing film long duel that gives the film so much impetus. It's now a tried and tested formula but the performances and the non stop excitement don't allow you a moment to contemplate whether it's getting stale. You simply sit on the edge of your seat and hold on tight.Afterwards, you might briefly reflect on how repetitive the series is and wonder whether it might be best to let Bourne retire whilst still at the top of his game. However, with the brilliant Greengrass and Damon duo at the helm, Bourne might have more life in him yet.If you enjoyed the previous Bourne films, this is hugely recommended. You won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before I go into the details of this movie, please let me state that I have IBS, an extreme state of it. For those of you who do not know what IBS is, it stands for irritable bowel syndrome. IBS(irritable bowel syndrome) causes my bowels to have extreme movements every day during relaxing times, as well as times that desire my concentration. Which is sad, because I do love the cinema.I have loved every Jason Bourne movie, and that love very well includes this one. I will say, do not go into this movie if you like your hero to be well spoken, because sadly, Jason Bourne does not speak his views many times at all in this film. Even though he does not talk much, it does not take away from the deep story that Paul Greengrass sculpted for us to enjoy. A deep, compelling and smart story, is what many action films lack, today, and this combination made this movie very well worth it. Cinematography lovers will take in this films marvelous glory as it shows exciting camera work.(I would say the many locations of the film, but I don't want to ruin anything.)That being said, with all of the palpable action, I was surprised multiple times. With my IBS(irritable bowel syndrome), I don't take surprises well, and by me, I mean my bowels. I hid most of the sounds, and smell, from the packed theater, but I may have ruined the experience for my close neighbors, before I could get to the bathroom. I may have to cut back on the popcorn, next time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Damon and Greengrass are BACK!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Matt Damon returns as Jason Bourne and Paul Greengrass as the director. They are back, and they bring back with them the thrill, intensity, action, and amazing story lines that we were used to in the first 3 Bourne movies. The cast alongside Damon are also excellent. Tommy Lee Jones was perfect for the role of CIA director. Alicia Vikander is a CIA agent that helps Bourne kill Dewey(Tommy Lee Jones) but for her own motives. Cassel is the asset for the CIA who wants to kill Bourne. Julia Stiles is back from the Bourne Ultimatum to play a short but important role in helping Bourne discover the truths of his past.The difference in this movie is that this time Bourne knows his past and is back for revenge. That and the involvement of his father enrich the plot. The car chase was also amazing. Jason Bourne is a must watch and a much better movie than The Bourne Legacy. Hopefully, we will be seeing much more of Damon and Greengrass in later Jason Bourne projects.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I saw the original trailer for Jason Bourne, I was really excited to see Matt Damon back in the role of CIA ex-spy. I remember the original movies being suspenseful, wildly entertaining, and action packed. This time, we got a very slow start with lots of predictable moments. In the beginning I caught myself yawning as I waited for something truly captivating to begin. And by the end, I got just that. The last 45 or so minutes were the best parts of the movie, but it took too long to get there. With a new sequel coming up with Matt Damon and Jeremy Renner, I hope the crew can learn from their mistakes in this movie and make it up to par with the original movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow..If you blink once during these 123 minutes you are doomed to miss something-hence the 7 starts,otherwise it would be 8 stars. Some actions in this film are so fast and furious that it sometimes impossible to follow a car chase or a quick exchange. This is a spy VS spy VS spy story or JB trying to take hold of his past that he even does not know how it looks.Filming in locations such as Athens, Rome,London adds quit a slot reality to this fast paced JB franchise thriller. With TL Jones, one can not go wrong in a movie.TLJ is always convincing ,and again, he does not look happy as the director of the CIA who ,as it looks, has a lot to hide . Without this being a spoiler I can with confident add It ain't over till the fat lady sings. Ahh and one last thing-I estimate Matt Damon had no more than about 30 sentences to memorize.The whole script in my mind is no longer than maybe 2 -3 pages.All the rest of the time is pure action!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can admit that most people will view this as an improvement over the previous installment, The Bourne Legacy with Jeremy Renner. I am in the minority then. Matt Damon does not phone in his performance, though I think there was clearly some rust to shake off when he re-took this role. Tommy Lee Jones is charismatic and funny as usual, and I cannot say enough of Alicia Vikander's screen presence. Her character is a breath of fresh air and I wish they would have developed her a bit more.As for the plot, I can't give it too much credit for originality, as it definitely has roots in recent Mission Impossible and James Bond movies. I can appreciate that the movie does not pick sides regarding the MacGuffin and is not too far right or left as far as that is concerned. (I've read some criticism of this film's politics so I did want to address that; in some ways this film does a more even-handed job in that department than any of its predecessors except maybe Identity.)My main problem with the film revolves around the development of Bourne's character. There are glimmers of hope in answering some of Bourne's questions of identity (pun intended) and self- doubt, but all too often the filmmakers sacrificed any meaningful point in favor of the easy way out (more action for the sake of putting fannies in the seats).In the end, if this is the first Bourne movie you see you will not be disappointed. However, I doubt this will be the case and in the end it feels like a retread of the original dressed up like a filler like Legacy, both pining away for something more.I give Jason Bourne 2 out of 4 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I admit I expected high for this movie but came out with low feelings and opinions. The story line is weak. Yes I understand where the producers were heading with the death of Bourne's father but the story dragged on with no real explanation and realism, a pretty poor story line which could have been easily thought of in one night. The acting is weak from all cast except Jason Bourne himself but I feel Tommy Lee Jones was castes badly for this role.. It needed an energetic almost blood thirty character like Noah Vosan from Bourne Ultimatum. Alicia Vikander also not the perfect actress for the movie as she is castes wrong again as an mid to late 20s chief operative. Anyone else notice the differences from the trailers to the actual movie? No shotgun scene from the car in Las Vegas, no Nicki Parsons saying "remembering everything doesn't mean you know everything" and other scenes which are not shown in the movie. Seriously? the movie producers and director can do this to us as paying viewers?I feel robbed</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie, but the magic of the previous ones is a bit lost</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is a shame they waited 9 years since "The Bourne Ultimatum" to make "Jason Bourne". I hope they can squeeze another sequel before Matt Damon will look like Lian Neeson in "Taken 3"... This movie is a good reminder why the Bourne trilogy is considered by many as the best action trilogy ever. Despite my extremely high expectations, it didn't fail to deliver. The pace was great with no dead moments where nothing is happening. The story had twists and surprises. The fight scenes were good as usual. What I didn't like in this movie: 1)The casting wasn't so good - I love Tommy Lee Jones, but he wasn't as good as Brian Cox or David Strathairn. The "Asset" Vincent Cassel wasn't convincing enough. First Alicia Vikander movie I see, found her a little annoying. 2)The car chase scene in Vegas reminded me the Fast and Furious movies (and that's not a good thing...) 3)No flashlight attached to a ventilator in this movie - Jason Bourne wasn't remarkably brilliant in improvising.It is almost impossible for a sequel to be as good as the original, but this is a great movie that will not disappoint the Bourne fans!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jason Bourne's called and he wants his series back. After the mixed to negative reception to The Bourne Legacy - the franchises' attempt to pass the baton to Jeremy Renner - Matt Damon is finally back in the titular character role, reuniting with director Paul Greengrass in their third collaboration in the espionage thriller series. Following events of Identity, Supremacy and Ultimatum, Jason Bourne returns to discover the answers to his questions and to ask some more. Is this a successful revamp of the franchise or should it have been left alone, given the critical acclaim and accolades of the initial trilogy.Jason Bourne is an exciting, intriguing, edge of the seat episonage thriller that is a return to the franchise's form, with a mix of new and old characters to carry the torch, even if this entry conforms to the genre conventions it set and revolutionised a little too willingly.FULL REVIEW: http://perksofbeingnath.blogspot.com/2016/07/jason-bourne-2016- review.html</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I gave this film a 9 out of 10 due to the influx of people who will feel inclined to give this a 8 or a 7. The movie in my opinion was an 8.2, better than Ultimatum but perhaps not as good as the original. It was action from the get go, but you wonder what the aim of the opening sequence was as the shaky camera work that Greengrass is renowned for gets in the way of understanding what the plot is.The main attraction of the movie is watching Jason Bourne craft his way through the government, the problem with the first hour of the movie was that he didn't have a plan, and he was out of his depth. This is fine by me, as he was supposed to be rusty, but what annoys me is that there was no real plot being built up here, it was just Bourne waddling everywhere getting caught and having narrow escapes. I'm not going to talk too much about the last hour as it was pure brilliance, and honestly after the awful beginning, it really saved the movie, bringing my rating from around a 6.8-7 to a 8.2ish score.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jason Bourne: Boring. The summary title of this review says it all. The most interesting part of this movie was a unique experience that happened just before the movie began. I arrived to the theater just as the last trailer was ending, walked in with my tub of popcorn, motorcycle helmet, and satchel. There were more people in the theater than I'd expected based upon the seating chart when I bought my ticket an hour earlier, but it still wasn't close to packed. My row had some space, in fact, so I was able to choose a chair based upon others seats. There was someone sitting behind the seat I was meant to sit in, so I chose the one next to it. There was someone in the seat in front of me, and I thought to myself "have to be careful not to kick his seat". He turned around. "Well played," he said. He was smiling, so I smiled back, not quite sure where this was going. "Last one in, and you take the seat behind me. Who sent you?" "Excuse me?" He stood up. "I guess you're going to kick my seat the whole time, huh?" "Did I kick your seat?" I was pretty sure I hadn't kicked his seat. "Dirty tricks. You don't fool me." "You're crazy," I said. "You're insane. I'm not going to sit here and let you intimidate me.""You need to get back to the..." I couldn't think of the word "asylum". He said something else, but I couldn't hear him, stuck in my head, trying to figure out how to finish my sentence. "You need to get back to the Farm," I said, as he made his way down the aisle, then down the stairs and out. I guess I was thinking Funny Farm, but only Farm came out...and that probably served his paranoia even more (assuming he took it to mean the CIA training facility). So...unless you can get lucky enough to sit yourself behind an aerospace engineer suffering from paranoid delusions (or perhaps really in fear for his life...who knows what's going down in the big city), you can do yourself a favor and skip Jason Bourne. If you must see it, wait for video.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There is a lot to love about this film but unfortunately there is just a little bit more to hate.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jason Bourne is the sequel most Bourne series fans have been waiting for since the last Damon outing in 2007. Fast forward nine years and here it is. Jason Bourne is the next chapter in the Bourne franchise and, much like Matt Damon himself, it is showing its age. The film is riddled with fun little references to the previous films but never really allows itself to become its own thing. There is so much to really enjoy here too, there is a ton of action sequences, there are funny summer movie chuckles, and a great cast (on paper). However, despite all these qualities that have been disguised as pluses for the film and especially being prematurely hailed as the film the Bourne fans have been waiting for, these all end up being as superficial as the reasoning for this film's own existence. Director Paul Greengrass is an absolute genius, right off the bat. The man has delivered some of the most emotional, heart pounding films of the last twenty years and yet, Jason Bourne (a film he should be able to direct in his sleep) comes off as more of a cheap thrill than an actual pulse pounding thriller. To start, there are very few instances in the film that are deemed as intelligent ways to progress the story. The film, quite frankly, is illogical and nonsensical in its approach to telling this highly taut political thriller story-line. As we've seen in The Bourne Supremacy and The Bourne Ultimatum, Greengrass is excellent in telling a dramatic and hard hitting story with some truly brutal and horrific scenes of violence that teeter so close to the edge of PG-13 that most films since then have been forever changed by this. But this is not the case in Jason Bourne. In fact, Greengrass does the exact opposite this time around. Jason Bourne is about as safe as an action movie could be. There are no risks taken by the film. All the action sequences that we see, we've seen done before. There is nothing new here as far as craft and the filmmaker is concerned. While this isn't a bad thing, when talking about Greengrass, it is just a disappointing thing. Diving into the cast a bit, they all do their jobs and collect their paychecks at the end of the day. Matt Damon is trying very hard to hold on to the action movie persona that he has built a career on and honestly, he barely skates by. He is no longer convincing as Jason Bourne. You don't get a sense of danger when watching him. Honestly, he feels more like a Terminator this time around. Julia Stiles reprises her role as Nicky and she is the best part of the film. Nicky's part is beefed up considerably for this film so fans will get their dose of her character this time around which is very refreshing to see because Stiles is a great actress and can really do great things when given the opportunity to do so. This film is no different. She is a very good ying to Damon's yang. Tommy Lee Jones is in the film for a handful of useless and sporadic minutes and is another actor that practically sleeps through his role. However, the film also stars Vincent Cassel and he is probably the best Bourne villain since Clive Owen in The Bourne Identity. He is stoic, quick, and brutal and he really gets your blood pumping when he comes on the screen. Now, the biggest issue I have with the film is the illogical and extremely shaky camera movements. This no longer has the effect that it did in 2004 and 2007. Since then, almost every action movie has copied this style and used it to it's benefit so seeing it done now really doesn't do much of anything as far as style is concerned. This time around, the shaky cam is used as a short cut to quicken the action sequences and it ends up being extremely hard to keep up with. Most of the time during an action sequence, it is a fast moving blur in between extreme close shots of their sweaty faces or bloodied hands. It didn't do anything other than confuse. It wasn't edgy, it wasn't particularly violent, it was just sloppy. The editing is another really terrible point to this film. There feels like there is a pace to be kept but every scene we're either one step ahead or moving at a snail's pace. Either way, it makes for a frustrating movie. Despite all that is wrong with Jason Bourne, the fact remains: if you're looking for a way to spend two hours and twenty dollars, there are worse movies out right now. But when you take the fact that this is Jason Bourne starring Matt Damon and being directed by Paul Greengrass, the bar is already incredibly high and this film doesn't even see it in the distance. By far one of the lesser installments in the series but far from an absolute bust of a film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bourne is Back, but did he need to be??</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jason Bourne, one of the best assassins is back, faced with uncovering more to his past. I love the Bourne movies, and I think that if you are going to see this movie you should watch the ones that came before it, otherwise you will probably get lost in the movie.Admittedly there are parts to this movie that feel out of place or prolonged for too long. However overall its pretty good, especially the first chase scene which is probably my favorite out of the franchise.The story in its self doesn't have as much emotional impact as supremacy had for example, and it didn't build up the character that much. Mostly I think it due to the movie being more action based, but there could of easily been more character development done. Paul Greengrass managed to keep the suspense and realism in tone and the plot kept me entertained throughout. In addition like previous Bourne movies we get to see the different perspectives on the events of the movie. Greengrass also uses a lot of shaky cam to make us feel on edge and in the action along with Jason, this works most of the time although it can get jarring later on pair that up with cheesy 90s action movie close ups on the face and you can start to wonder where the director is going with this.I do think this movie was a solid entry in the franchise and is worth a watch, although it may not be as good a character piece or thriller as the other movies in the franchise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I walked into the theater, I though movie would pick-up from where it left in "Bourne Ultimatum" .. but it was not to be. However after 2 hours, it still was an enjoyable watch and you still hooked to the gritty unfolding drama which you don't want it to end. Actions sequences are great as we expect from a Bourne movie.Bourne story unfolds further nicely as lot more revealed on CIA programs and especially Treadstone and who actually created the program.This is 1st Bourne movie in 3D. Frankly I am not sure if 3d was required. Chase sequence looked bit funny, in some parts, in 3D.Overall, Its a good entertainment and the ending (last part) leaves you guessing once again if there will be another installment to this in future. Hope there is one!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The absence of CGI, shaky camera work and the return of Matt Damon save the movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jason Bourne is directed by Paul Greengrass, the director of the previous two films titled ''The Bourne Supremacy'' and ''The Bourne Ultimatum''. This is one of my favorite trilogies of all time, and definitely movies that I can watch over and over! Matt Damon is back once again as the former CIA-agent Jason Bourne. For those of you who have no knowledge of Bourne, and don't know what his story is, I'll give a quick introduction here.Jason Bourne (played by Matt Damon) is an assassin and a former CIA- agent who's suffering from amnesia and is on the run to regain his memory. When he is framed for a CIA operation called ''Treadstone'' gone awry, he is forced to resume his former life as an assassin to survive this madness.Like I mentioned earlier, The Bourne Trilogy (I do not include The Bourne Legacy here) is one of the best spy trilogies I've seen in my entire life. Bond-lovers, do not underestimate Bourne here!!! When I got to know that Damon and Greengrass were coming back to this franchise after nine years, I was so pumped and excited, because I know what they have in store for us. It will be AMAZING and like Denzel Washington says in all of his movies I can say ''I Guarantee It!''. This is the fifth installment of the Jason Bourne franchise (fourth chronologically), and Bourne has finally regained his memory and knows who he is, but there are still some certain secrets about his past that that he is desperately trying to find answers to. I won't spoil anything because I want you guys to see it for yourselves. The opening sequence of this movie is marvelous! There's a fantastic motorcycle chase in Athens that will take your breath away and literally keep you on the edge of your seat. It's not only action packed and fast paced, but it's also emotionally gripping and realistic. I won't explain you why, because this is a spoiler free review. The film later moves further to its subplot which involves a character named Kalloor, who's about to launch a new form of social media that makes people to be concerned about privacy.Julia Stiles who has appeared in the first three Bourne movies has returned to her role as Nicky Parsons. Even though she has a little screen time in this film, she has done a phenomenal job and shares an action-packed scene with Damon that I'm pretty sure people will talk about for weeks, maybe years. The film also introduces two new characters; Robert Dewey and Heather Lee, played by Tommy Lee Jones and Alicia Vikander who've nailed their roles. Even though Tommy Lee Jones has delivered a strong performance as the CIA director, I felt that he wasn't as bad-ass as David Strathairn, who played Noah Vosen in The Bourne Ultimatum or Chris Cooper, who played Conklin in The Bourne Identity. It just wasn't 100% satisfying. We have seen Tommy Lee Jones' outstanding performances in movies such as The Fugitive (1993) and U.S. Marshals (1998), but his character Dewey didn't seem to be as desperate as Noah Vosen or Conklin to take out Bourne. This is one of the biggest reason for why I think this installment is the weakest one in this franchise. When the antagonist doesn't have the equal balance to the protagonist it'll make the story less interesting.Another reason for why I didn't love this movie as much as the previous ones is because the story wasn't fascinating and strong enough compared to the other films in this saga. That doesn't mean that this is a bad movie. This is much more better than The Bourne Legacy, the action is not disappointing, but unfortunately, this is just the weakest one of Damon's Bourne series. One of the few things I missed when it comes to the action is the knuckle fights. There are a few fight sequences here and there, but not as spectacular as the fight sequences in the earlier films (an example: Bourne vs. Desh in The Bourne Ultimatum).Matt Damon's Bourne franchise is best known for its shaky camera work. The cinematography was well handled by Barry Ackroyd and the editing by Christopher Rouse was excellent. At last, but not least, I definitely have to mention Matt Damon's work in this film. Damon is irreplaceable as always, and it's a total pleasure to see him back as Bourne!Overall this is a good movie that I recommend everyone and Bourne fans to watch! For those who haven't seen the previous films; I think you'll enjoy this ride! It's a good movie, but not great compared to Identity, Supremacy and Ultimatum. Paul Greengrass and Matt Damon NEED to come back and deliver an epic end to this franchise!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Re-Treadstones a lot but welcomingly builds on previous conspiracy themes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When former CIA operative draws Jason Bourne out of hiding he beings uncover truths about his past. Director Paul Greengrass and writer Christopher Rouse re-Treadstones much of what we have seen before, the opening set up is quite predictable, that said, as the plot unfolds there are some surprises to be hand along with a handful of energetic sequences wonderful presented by cinematographer Barry Ackroyd. The acting calibre is excellent with reliable veteran Tommy Lee Jones playing a CIA Director. Cyber head Heather Lee is played by the wonderful Alicia Vikander who is tasked with finding Bourne. An 'Asset' Vincent Cassel is later brought into the mix. Cassel perfectly fits the long line of assassins that have graced the series. Based on Robert Ludlum's character Matt Damon's performance as Bourne is as serious and downbeat as ever, which perfectly fits the character. Damon once again show he's not a one trick pony especially in the action and fight scenes. In addition, Julia Stiles briefly reprises her role of Nicky Parsons.Greengrass returns to the series and again offers excellent stunt set ups with realistic grit on the backdrop of real locations. His documentary based style again helps give this outing dramatic weight (notably the Greece protests) which makes it shoulders above the majority of action films around. This follow up with its real-time mass surveillance builds on previous conspiracy themes capturing the bureaucracy, technology security versus privacy issues perfectly.Overall, finishes the series off nicely, but leaves plenty of room for another addition.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Each summer brings to the screens a fair amount of films which aim pleasing especially the family crowds but never or seldom make it to the list of awards of the year or just to the list of the films we will remember until the next summer. It uses to be a combination of comics or comics-inspired films, animation or actors - based, some science-fiction, continuation or remakes of previous themes, sequels and prequels. 'Jason Bourne' enters the schedule, but not necessarily the stereotype. This may actually be the action movie of the summer of 2016, although from a box-office perspective it may be a little bit too serious compared to contenders that race and fight spaceships or bring to screen super-heroes descending directly from comics books.The identity troubles of Mr. Jason Bourne continue and as in the previous few series its again director Paul Greengrass at the helm, and also as co-writer of the film inspired by the hero created by Robert Ludlum. I must declare myself guilty of being a fan of Ludlum and of the genre of international spy action movies. I like films where the pretext is intelligent, where heroes are faced with credible dilemmas, they feel pain and memory losses, and identity crisis. Bourne is thrown out at the fringes of the society in this film, he tries to get back, but is it for revenge? or maybe to re-enter a world that he has all the reasons to hate, but which he cannot abandon because this is his life, he was created by it and this is what he knows to do best - for the good and for the bad motifs.I am no fan of Matt Damon and I will not say more about his acting performance in this film than the fact that he may get better in maturity. On the other hand Alicia Vikander was so good that I kept wondering for the whole film who is this fresh newcomer face, sexy and focused. She not only has great looks but also reinvents herself in many of the films she plays in - she was a completely different person for example in 'A Royal Affair' or in 'Ex Machina'. An actor who certainly reached maturity and more is Tommy Lee Jones, but I was frankly expecting more from him than the extra wrinkles. Vincent Cassel is superb in his revenge killer role, he paid back his ticket over the ocean. Paul Greengrass directs skillfully the action scenes (and there are a lot), his accelerated pace did not disturb me this time, as car chases and gun and fist fights have logic and clarity and fit well in the story, they are not just choreographed violence. If there is something missing in the story it's the romantic dimension, but with the heroes played by Alicia Vikander and Matt Damon alive at the end of the film, and an open end scene that may well be the first one of the next installment, all is possible.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There has been a flurry of movie releases this summer, especially of franchises. Jason Bourne joins this brigade in an effort to bring Bourne's magic back on screen. My rating for this movie is partial based on the fact that I love spy thriller and especially the Bourne franchise. However I am gonna try and keep the review as neutral as possible. When it comes to the Bourne concept, be it the novels or the movies, everybody have tried to take the advantage of the character. The author Eric Van Lustbader has penned 10 Bourne novels after the original 3 written by Robert Ludlum. Thr Bourne Legacy released in 2012 tried to do the same, for a change the filmmakers wanted to check if the Bourne would work without Matt Damon, and it didn't. Hence in Jason Bourne, Matt Damon teams up with Paul Greengrass again. It is tough to broaden the scope of the story for a concept like Bourne. Hence, I didn't expect much from the script at all and I wasn't disappointed. In the beginning Bourne asks Nicky Parsons why should he care and it can be related to the whole movie in general. It makes you ask why many times but there is no good reason at all. As long as the movie does what it does, one should not think too much. Bourne tries to dig up more things from past and comes under the CIA radar yet again. This time its more personal (it always has been kind of) and as usual the CIA is trying to stop him as they continue to plan for one more operation with a fancy name called Ironhand. This time the agent assigned to kill Bourne is more old and has a personal agenda as well. The cinematography and actions sequences are exceptional. Background score has the Bourne touch and of course there is the song Extreme Ways at the end credits which makes us feel nostalgic again.When Matt Damon dons the role of Bourne he is a different actor. He talks less, keeps the numb expression throughout and that's what makes him best and there probably won't be a replacement for him. Tommy Lee Jones looks old and tired in his role of CIA chief. Vincent Cassel plays the role of evil agent and he fits the bill. Alicia Vikander is only getting better and better with each movie and she excels. Riz Ahmend's character as the social media/startup genius Aaron Kalloor is quite ambiguous.I am a big fan of agency and spy thrillers so if there were 100 Bourne movies I would watch them all. Although this movie isn't an exceptional addition to the Bourne franchise, this is a decent thriller and if you are a fan of this kind you are surely gonna enjoy this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow! Can a SWAT truck really do that? I want one! Amazing! Can a high- performance executive saloon car take that much punishment and still go where the driver wants it to? I'll have one of those too! Joking aside, there isn't an action film ever made that didn't bend the laws of physics and probability just a little, and of course a small degree of hyper-realism is almost a requirement for the genre, so I'll say no more. The acting is solid all round. Alicia Vikander is just as alluring and magnetic on-screen as she is in pretty much everything else she's done; is there a more talented up-and-coming actress in the world right now? Full marks also for the relentless edge-of-the-seat pacing, with just enough quieter moments to prevent action fatigue from setting in. On the plotting front, it wasn't bad - keeping it simple is generally best, while attempting to avoid patronising the audience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jason Bourne is back!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The CLAW here, bringing you another, should you see it in theaters, or wait for the DVD. Here we go: Damon&nbsp;is back for his 4 go around as super spy, who just wont die, Jason Bourne.&nbsp; If you haven't seen the original trilogy in a while, not a problem.&nbsp; The movie does a good job of not divulging to much into the past, and when it does, it's accompanied by a flashback. During the movie we get to see some characters of the past, and some new, most likely future characters. Alicia Vikander, who just won an Oscar, plays Heather Lee, an American CIA cyber-ops tech, with an accent that had me guessing where she was from the entire movie. It was not distracting, but was quite noticeable. She is a Swede, and I'm assuming perfecting the American accent isn't the easiest thing to do!Another Bourne means more hacking, and more chases. This time the plot revolved around Bourne trying to figure out his past, and how he became who he is. With a little help from Nikky, the story gets rolling and never lets up. The CIA Director Dewey(Tommy Lee Jones) is worried that Bourne will yet again leak major information like he did with Treadstone. While Lee wants to bring Bourne in thinking she can "fix" him and have him work for the CIA once again, Dewey has other plans. Without getting into detail, there is a whole subplot revolving around Dewey, and a social media mogul Aaron Kallor (Riz Ahmed), that ties into why Dewey doesn't see eye to eye with Lee.This movie had a lot of action, and a lot of backstabbing. The two action scenes that stand out, are the Greece chase and the Las Vegas chase(both shown in trailers). Both had high energy and had you on the edge of your seat. Vincent Cassel plays Asset, and does a good job of playing a CIA operative out for revenge on Bourne. As a side note, does a dodge challenger airbags ever go off? When you watch, you'll know what I mean. I couldn't help but notice this!Recommendation: See in theaters +Damon as Bourne +Action +Interesting subplot about social media-Alicia Vikander accent -Challengers airbags don't work?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jason Bourne is back with a spectacular bang</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jason Bourne is a worthwhile and exiting entry into the Matt Damon, "Bourne" franchise with incredible intensity we've come to know from any "Bourne" film throughout and other recurring familiar themes that manage to remain fresh throughout the modern world. Firstly, the twists and turns work in the film and don't feel forced, allowing for a cohesive, fast-paced and intriguing film. Secondly, director Paul Greengrass retains his classic style when it comes to filming action and it looks gritty, realistic and brilliant (as always). Finally the performances of both new and old cast members are great with Matt Damon (of course) and Alicia Vikander the pick of the bunch. Tommy Lee Jones is also good in his role, as is the same with Julia Stiles who makes the most of the small screen-time she is given. My key (and only) flaw with the film, however, is how it will sometimes slow down to focus on a disappointing and bland social media sup-plot that turns out to be integral to the script. Other than that though, this is a movie for the the Bourne franchise and for spy/thriller films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outcast Jason fights off another CIA attack as govt threatens privacy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The American government is so free and open that its filmmakers can continually expose its crookedness and authoritarianism. It was true in Tricky Dickie's reign and it remains true in these troubled days of the Snowden and Assange exposures of government spying and betrayal. Of course, all that will change when Donald Trump is elected pres. Trumplethinskin (not my coinage, alas) has pledged to suppress the critical press and judiciary along with his more specifically racist niceties. Matt Damon's newest incarnation of the alienated and amnesiac former intelligence agent exercises the public's fear of government surveillance and an uncontrolled tyranny. The arch villain is the CIA director Dewey (Tommy Lee Jones, profoundly and implacably wrinkled). We don't know what happened to brothers Huey and Louie in our loss of Disney innocence. Innumerable lives are wasted and ? perhaps worse ? public and private automobiles demolished in the government's ardor to protect itself by slashing away the individual's rights, especially to privacy. In the spirit of the times ? including our Hillary's nomination ? Bourne is abetted by two empowered women who play out the opposite themes of loyalty and betrayal. They also embody the hero's alternative impulses ? to return to the system or to remain a freer wheeling outsider. The film's title sticks to the hero's (assumed) name. The "Jason" is the heroic quester of the (non-Toronto) Argonauts and the (non-Trump) Fleece. And as Bourne means 'journey' the character unsure of his identity, history and purpose is on an endless quest to save himself, a journey without other purpose or clear destination. The trip is the thing. Expect sequels more. The word famously throbs in Hamlet: But that the dread of something after death, The undiscovered country from whose bourne No traveler returns, puzzles the will And makes us rather bear those ills we have Than fly to others that we know not of? Thus conscience does make cowards of us all, And thus the native hue of resolution Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,?No danger of the latter in this non-stop action flick. The cast of thought quite pales amid the smashing action and spectacular computer screens.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you are a Bourne fan or love to watch a good action movie, Jason Bourne is just right for you</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jason Bourne came up with a lot of promise and expectations from the fans. While I haven't watched all the Bourne movies but the name itself drew me to the theater in the opening weekend without even seeing any reviews. Unfortunately, the excitement it generated through the trailer didn't survive as I watched this movie. Story (7/10): This movie revolves around Jason Bourne's past, as always, and goes way before he was a part of CIA. The plot had all the material required to make it an amazing script but it was at a transactional level that the story falls flat. When you have a movie on a character that is already four movies old and has very specific behavioral traits, you have a very narrow margin of error. Certain sequences just don't make sense to be true for an ace spy like Jason Bourne or for an agency like CIA - the London sequence, Jason's passport, and the final chase. Acting (7/10): In the midst of an average story, the movie fared well when it came to acting. Matt Damon doesn't seem to have lost what it takes to play Jason Bourne. However, the noticeable performance came from Alicia Vikander (playing Heather Lee, the head of the CIA Cyber Ops Division), making her presence felt in an otherwise veteran casting. Vincent Cassel is pretty much angry throughout the movie. For someone like Tommy Lee Jones, his presence is not at all felt except for maybe towards the end. Direction (6/10): Paull Greengrass perhaps had too much on his plate playing a role of writer, producer as well as director. With experience around the Bourne series, having directed Supremacy and Ultimatum, he has stuck to the formula but fails at the execution level. Some of the scenes just don't make sense - be it walking around the city when it is on fire, losing a guy on a sniper or messing with US immigration on a potential system hack. The climax of the movie didn't inspire much either with an inexplicable background and technical mistakes. Coming to the good part, the length of the movie was just right and not for once, it felt like a drag. Overall (7/10): This might be the last movie of the franchise with everything explained now. So, if you are a Bourne fan or love to watch a good action movie, Jason Bourne is just right for you, if you consider it standalone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Matt Is Back!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw "Jason Bourne", starring Matt Damon-The Martian, True Grit_2010; Tommy Lee Jones-The Men in Black movies, Captain America:The First Avenger; Alicia Vikander-The Man From U.N.C.L.E., Seventh Son; Vincent Cassel-Black Swan, Eastern Promises and Julia Stiles-Silver Linings Playbook, The Omen_2006.This is the 4th in the Bourne series, 3rd for Matt-he was absent in the last on, which starred Jeremy Renner, who, by the way, will have his own sequel about Aaron Cross in 2018. This movie is directed by Paul Greengrass, who directed the 2007 Bourne Ultimatum and the 2004 Bourne Supremacy. So if you liked those versions of Bourne, you should enjoy this one because Matt is back as the amnesiac super spy. Julia finds Matt just brawling for money in Greece-bare knuckle fighting. She tells him that she has uncovered evidence about Matt's father and how Matt was recruited into the C.I.A. to become an asset. She also got more info on Treadstone and other, newer operations that the C.I.A. are running. The only problem is that Julia set off alarms in the C.I.A. when she did her hacking and the head of the C.I.A., Tommy, sends almost everybody he can think of after the two. Including his best asset, Vincent. Alicia is the head of cyber ops, working for Tommy and may or may not be sympathetic to Matt. The plot is nothing new from previous Bourne movies but the action, car chases and fight scenes are all excellent. There is a car chase in Las Vegas that wrecked 170 cars. It's rated "PG-13" for action, violence and language and has a running time of 2 hours &amp; 3 minutes. I liked it and would buy it on Blu-Ray.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>He's Back for More</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Matt Damon is back after nearly a decade as super spy Jason Bourne in this latest installment of the action franchise. Damon delivers a solid performance for his return to the role that propelled him back to the A- list. There is some added depth to his dark past with Treadstone (the project of the first film), but not that much has changed on Bourne except for the mental torture he puts himself based on his past actions.Joining Matt Damon in returning is Julia Stiles as Nicky Parsons. Stiles makes the most of her limited screen-time to give some exposition to the film's plot. However the information Nicky gives Bourne is null and void after her departure; the new secret project is left out of the movie after that whole section between Bourne and Nicky. Added to the cast of new faces are the likes of Alicia Vikander, Tommy Lee Jones and Vincent Cassel. Vikander takes on the mantle of Stiles' role in the original "Bourne" trilogy as a conflicted analyst, Heather Lee, who wants to handle Bourne without killing him or others. Her American accent has a tendency to falter in the film as she lets her natural British accent pronounce some words with that inflection. Vikander's performance is solid as she does put her energy into Heather, but it's hard not to ignore her similarity to Nicky Parsons in the original trilogy. As the new CIA director, Tommy Lee Jones is once again a symbol of authority like his role in "The Fugitive". However it is clear that Jones is a bit out of his element playing an opponent of Matt Damon's super spy. Delivery of his lines are stilted at times and he maintains his trademark rigidity. Director Dewey's drive to get Bourne isn't quite up to par as his predecessors from the original trilogy were (i.e. Chris Cooper in "Bourne Identity" and David Straithairn in "Bourne Ultimatum" who wanted Bourne dead or Joan Allen in the latter two trilogy films who wanted to deal peacefully (and did) with Bourne). And as a new Asset, Vincent Cassel is cast perfectly as a villain but is sorely lacking a backstory except for a fact that he was part of the same program as Bourne. The character is all too happy to kill those in his way and has no regard for consequences which hurt his chances to get Bourne. Cassel manages to maintain a sinister demeanor as he skulk around the exotic locales, but sadly is an easily defeat able villain by the climax of the film. The film's script is fairly straightforward in its plot. Jason Bourne is out to discover more secret truths behind his life before he was made a killer assassin by Treadstone. There is a shocking moment behind the project's creation and why it was imperative that David Webb/Bourne join. However there are glaring holes in backstories of the new faces added as well as why the film's supposed new black ops project is worse than the previous films' operations. Operation Ironhand is left dead in the water after Nicky Parsons is removed from the narrative and we never get answers about the operation. The cinematography is mesmerizing as we globe-trot with Bourne and the CIA around the world. Going from Athens, Greece (actually filmed in the Canary Islands) to Berlin, London and finally Las Vegas for the ultimate showdown. It is a boon to have "Bourne Supremacy" and "Bourne Ultimatum" director, Paul Greengrass, back at the helm. His visual eye is keen though his use of shaky cam is dizzying for the Athens chase scene. Greengrass also co-wrote the film's screenplay.Overall, there are plenty of issues with the movie but the good elements are present to balance the bad. An entertaining action romp for any "Bourne" fan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a mix</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a good movie when it comes to action. It's well shot, directed. The performances were amazing, Tommy Lee Jones, Matt Damon, Vincent Cassel - they all were great in this. However, some of the characters were not so good, kind of cliché'd and poorly written. "Agent" was a terminator-like character with no other qualities whatsoever. It felt like Bourne himself didn't know what he was doing half of the time. CIA operatives in this movie were extremely childish and non- professional as well. Also, the fact that a young (~22-24 y.o. max) attractive woman can be a chief of operations is amusing yet unbelievable. The script is easy to follow, but it really lacks some logic and has some serious holes in it. Sometimes stuff just happens by itself to propel the plot. Also, technical side of all the devices and tracking possibilities was surely taken from a sci-fi movie. Sometimes it becomes downright ridiculous (well, I guess it's sort of okay for a Bourne movie). Sadly enough, Bourne himself felt uninspired and by the end of the movie he basically achieved nothing besides a sequel tease. The movie started around Bourne without his intent and ended like this as well. It would've been a great movie if it was a little more grounded and realistic instead of being sci-fi action, cause, you know, this is what was good about the first movie (2nd probably too). I liked it, but my expectations were much higher. P.S. At least it has one of the best car chases from 2000-2010s, that's for sure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of my all-time favorite series is back in a big way. Jason Bourne doesn't disappoint. Incredible action, one of the best car chases I have ever seen, and Matt Damon delivers as only he can with this character - not to mention the exotic places these films take us. We're not overloaded with too much with this movie. After nine years, a lot has happened - but we get a taste of the past and then they throw us right back into the next thing. Bournes never ending quest to figure out who he is....and we finally find out some key details about Bournes past! Greengrass did a great job, Damon is phenomenal, and Jason Bourne delivers. I'm keeping my fingers crossed that we see more Bourne movies soon!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not quite Supremacy or Ultimatum, but still very good.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Bourne Ultimatum was nearly ten years ago, now, and I remember interviews being given in which Matt Damon and Paul Greengrass both said that they would only return to the Bourne franchise if the other was on board too. And after that ending, where else could you pick up the story, but some years later with David/Jason trying desperately to put the pieces of his fractured life back together, still tortured by the memories of the Treadstone training, and his live as a CIA black ops agent.As with the previous two Greengrass/Damon outings, this film is less centred on Jason Bourne, and more on the world around him pulling him back into its orbit. In this case, it's Nicky Parsons's (Stiles) hacking the CIA's Black Ops program files - including a new program called Ironhand - that alerts her, and the CIA, to secrets in Bourne's past.What I love about Paul Greengrass's storytelling is that things aren't explained through huge tracts of dialogue where people stand in rooms and explain the plot to each other. You are gifted a momentary window into their lives. In this case, you can imagine that Nicky for the last ten years has been working in the shadows, nibbling around the CIA firewalls to find details of Jason's past to bring him peace, while he struggles to find his own identity again in the light of his actions. Greengrass also excels with the idea that people make incorrect assumptions and run with them - exactly what Dooley (Jones) does to further his own agenda, while Lee (Vikander) seeks a different end.His direction is incredibly visceral. Screen time isn't wasted with exposition, and pointless pauses; they are given a place within the narrative that links action set pieces together. They are necessary, but they serve a purpose. As we, the audience, take a breath; so too do our players - whether that be to garner information, tend to injuries, or suss out their next moves. Shaky cam is back, and in full effect in this movie, but that adds to the emotional engagement of the film, despite occasionally blurring the details for us.Jason Bourne isn't the same character we left nine years ago. Matt Damon is still portraying the tortured CIA black operative, but now with many more miles on the clock. His body is battered and injured - we see that early on - and his hair is greying at the temples. He feels tired, and lost from the first moment we see him on screen; and his flashbacks seem like memory flashes as he delves deeper into his memory.Heather Lee has the more interesting arc, but then - didn't Pam Landy? Bourne is a single-tracked freight train heading for only one destination, but Lee is more conniving and devious than that, and her own ends are shrouded. It makes for a compelling pairing, and having an actress of Alicia Vikander's calibre to play her was an exceptional choice.Tommy Lee Jones plays CIA director Robert Dewey with incredible relish and menace. Initially wanting Bourne dead - thus dispatching a Blackbrair Asset (Cassel) - then to bring him back into the program, he deliberately works both the Asset, and Lee. Watching Tommy Lee Jones play this kind of character is always entertaining, as he is an actor with a huge screen presence and great sense of character. In keeping with both Noah Vosen, Ezra Kramer, Ward Abbott and Conklin - he keeps his options open whilst pinning the blame onto someone else. However, Dewey is simultaneously playing Aaron Kalloor, founder of Deep Dream - a social media company - who, in exchange for funding, has provided access for the CIA and their Ironhand program.This is part of what keeps me coming back to the Paul Greengrass movies: they're smartly scripted, brilliantly paced, and have scaled back scripts and casts to let the story through. I've read some sniffy reviews about plot holes and muddled scripts, but I thought this one was on par with both ?Supremacy and ?Ultimatum. Although this is more about the cover up than it is about revealing this truth - with a subtext of history repeating itself - it still makes for a compelling, and hugely entertaining, movie.It's not perfect, though. I could sense early on that one of the cast would not make it through the first act, and I wasn't wrong. The scene was incredibly reminiscent of the inciting event in ? Supremacy, however, the motivation it gives Jason is not one of revenge. I'm glad, in that respect, that it wasn't as the character in question could easily have become the girlfriend in the fridge. They didn't. However, it didn't do much for the gender balance of the story.The action, as always, is superbly choreographed and shot thrusting you firmly into the action with the first major set piece in Athens during an austerity riot. However, I did catch myself thinking of analogous scenes in the other movies that, while not wholly unwelcome, is surely not the main purpose of the film. I also had questions left at the end of the movie about whether or not the door had been left open for another film. I'm sure there is the possibility of it, but whether or not it'll happen I guess is down to whether there's another story in Bourne's character to tell.Jason Bourne is a great film. Though it had a lot of significant baggage in the form of how well received the ?Supremacy and ?Ultimatum were, I think it does an excellent job of keeping the cinematic and story quality upheld, whilst also moving Jason Bourne into the current climate. I was emotionally, and viscerally, engaged in the whole movie. However, towards the end, I was left with more questions than either of the previous Greengrass/Damon Bourne films left me with.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jason Bourne is on the run again, older but still explosive</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It all flashes by the screen with impressive verve ? Greengrass is a true action ace ? and it's entirely possible to forget the regrettable fourth franchise film, The Bourne Legacy from 2012, made without the participation of Damon and Greengrass.But there's also a certain déj?vu about Jason Bourne, a feeling of going through the motions that can't be denied, even if those motions are skilfully executed. A subplot about the CIA's meddling with a Facebook-like social media giant raises serious questions about the invasion of privacy, but it serves more to showcase actor Riz Ahmed's talents than to advance the plot.The experience of Jason Bourne may ironically work best for those who are able to put past chapters out of their mind and just thrill to the movement on the screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bourne is back as great as ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into this movie with very high expectations &amp; it met them. It may not be the best of the Bourne movies with Matt Damon, but it belongs right there with them (certainly topping "Identity"). It is, by far, the best movie I've seen this year. (This is not a back handed compliment.)It is a Paul Greengrass movie &amp; you know what that means. Damon continues to thrill in playing the haunted Bourne for the 4th time (unlike Daniel Craig who clearly grew tired of playing Bond for the 4th time). Alicia Vikander &amp; Tommy Lee Jones are great fun to watch in their roles. Vincent Cassell is a much better hit-man than many reviews would have you believe. Julia Stiles has the most heart wrenching scene. Riz Ahmed is well cast as a Silicon Valley magnate.The action is without parallel. Nobody does action like Greengrass -- not even George Miller. The two major set pieces (in Greece &amp; Vegas) are lengthy &amp; astonishing. A car stunt in the Vegas chase may be the best I've ever seen on screen. (I sure as hell won't tell what it is &amp; let you discover it for yourself.) The editing is precision perfect --even in the non-action scenes-- &amp; there is less "shaky-cam" in any Greengrass film since "Bloody Sunday" ("shaky-cam" never bothered me).The adrenaline is all there, but what really makes this movie memorable are the issues it addresses with 21st Century privacy versus nation security versus the definition of patriotism. Yeah, that is all there. Is any wonder that Greengrass is circling a 3rd big screen adapt of "1984" as a future project?This new "Bourne" does not sacrifice intelligence at the altar of entertainment although it seemed to last half of its actual running time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't Mess with Jason Bourne</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My friend Ron said that in "Jason Bourne" almost all of the characters have no redeeming qualities. However, they keep messing with Matt Damon's Jason Bourne, and they never learn their lesson that they shouldn't?either physically or strategically. Ron also pointed out that part of it is that Bourne doesn't trust anyone. That is both a blessing and more a curse for Jason Bourne. Those on his bad side as well as those he loves fair tragically. Matt Damon powerfully returns in Director Paul Greengrass's "Jason Bourne" as the CIA trained assassin uncovering his forgotten past and recreating his purpose in life. The screenplay by Christopher Rouse and Greengrass is an original story based on the Robert Ludlum characters. Rouse and Greengrass brilliantly weave themes of Machiavellian national security directives and the cost of privacy associated with global social media. "Jason Bourne" is high octane non-stop action with spectacular chases (the amazing Las Vegas scene), and international locals. The movie also makes you think. What resonates most is the personal existential journey of Damon's Bourne. At the story arc Bourne confronts duplicitous CIA Director Robert Dewey (awesome Tommy Lee Jones). Bourne says "I volunteered on a lie?". Dewey tells Jason, "You're never going to find any peace?" Jason finds little solace in the fact that the world is safer, because of what he has done. Damon embodies Bourne's tortured and noble soul in his lean words and authentic visage. Bourne of all people deserves to find peace. Bourne has been off the grid for years. He is in Greece making a living as bare knuckle fighter. We see the chiseled Bourne (Damon) drop a hulking fighter with a vicious left hook. Julia Stiles also returns as Nicky Parsons, Jason's only true friend who knew him even before his amnesia. She has startling information about Treadstone, the Program that created him, and his father. Director Dewey (Jones) and his ambitious protégé Heather Lee (strong Alicia Vikander) detect the security breach caused by Parsons. They track down her and Bourne in the middle of a political riot in Greece. We get that this breach may have an aftermath along the lines of Edward Snowden. Dewey activates the Asset (cold blooded Vincent Cassel) to terminate Bourne. The Asset has his own reason for revenge on Bourne. The narrative web expands. Back in Silicon Valley, Mark Zuckerberg- like CEO Aaron Kalloor (Riz Amed) is about to launch a breakthrough platform for his social media giant Deep Dreams. Riz has the right mix of swag and darkness. Aaron also may be beholding to Dewey from the past. Heather (Vikander) gets the lead from Dewey to bring in Bourne, though her allegiance is murky. Vikander is wonderfully authentic in her inauthenticity. Tommy Lee Jones brilliantly underplays the over confident puppet master Dewey. The downside of "Bourne" is the fight scenes. They seem well orchestrated by choreographer Roger Yuan. I was excited to see the tight boxing and explosive martial arts display. However, the quick cut visual style makes the action difficult to follow and distinguish. This is unfortunate even in the climatic fight sequence. That aside, overall "Jason Bourne" is solid. Matt Damon makes up for a lot of the rough edges. Paul Greengrass tells a compelling story with velocity. It would have been satisfying to see an eloquent resolution to Jason Bourne's journey. Well, perhaps more the next time around.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent follow up to the Bourne trilogy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film delivered. Matt Damon, as always, did a great job of staying in character. Great action scenes - lots of action in fact, and a pretty hair-raising car chase which was pounding. The only thing that fell short is that the main vehicle (a SWAT vehicle), after crashing into and through about 50 cars, didn't show a single dent or a broken head-lamp, which was kind of a stupid oversight on the part of the movie-makers. Nonetheless, the movie was gripping, and it it had a nice build-up, climax to climax. For me, it was a great message about the on-going corruption of the CIA and its agenda to put in an ultimate surveillance net, and it also championed the private sector who fought for privacy and freedom from surveillance on the worldwide net. The ending had a great final twist - loved it, and as always, it was a fist in the face to the agency dicks. Good movie, watch it and enjoy the ride.</fullReview>

I loved all the other films especially with Matt Damon . I thought to do better than the first three films in particular the third would be an impossible task. For me it was no better or worse, it retained the same line. The fight sequences and car chase are very well achieved despite some moments not understand very well what is happening. The end of the film clearly shows that they intend to continue the Bourne , but with some questions about what happened in the last scene which is a good thing to get the viewer to think. No doubt that Matt Damon is Jason Bourne.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie was very well thought out and put together. I'm not sure why some critics said the overall plot was lacking. Did they watch the same movie? I saw a plot, I saw the plot develop, I saw Bourne discovering new information about his past, and how he wiped out someone from his past, ha ha. The music and score were phenomenal and had me nervously anticipating what could possibly come next. Jason Bourne really did good in taking up the role of Bourne again. Tommy Lee Jones really cracked me up on how nonchalant he was throughout the film. In my opinion he nailed the role perfectly. Go see the movie and ignore the naysayers. Most people are disliking this film based on political reasons based on what Matt Damon recently spoke about in an interview concerning the use of guns.Put your biases aside for 2 hours and some and be swept away with this spy thriller. Truly an entertaining film!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For a character like Bourne to return to the screen after almost ten years, it's going to be tough. Not only do you have to bring together all of the elements that made the originals great, but you also have to give it something new that makes it feel fresh. I feel that the writers accomplished this as well as anyone could have. The original Bourne movies were well-paced, suspenseful, thoughtfully plotted and of course, topped with incredible action sequences. Bourne 5 successfully integrates each of these aspects into the film. Now, that being said, people need to keep their expectations reasonable. Is this one an exact replica of the first three, or does it have the most mind blowing and unanticipated plot that will leave you stunned and breathless for days after? No. But it is a well-made and enjoyable show.</fullReview>

What this newest version has going for it is the fascinating high-tech surveillance backdrop, the decent self-contained plot, and a real trooper in Julia Stiles who again agrees to put in another appearance (albeit surprisingly looking distinctively older). What also stands out unfortunately, is the absence of disguises and what might to considered lazy fight scenes somewhat reminiscent of The Dark Knight (2008). The sharp, stylized, crisp fight scenes from The Bourne Supremacy (2004) are missing. It's debatable whether or not the quick transitions between supposedly emotional scenes are too brief to really offer the audience a sufficiently visceral connection to the characters and relationships. This newest Bourne version however offers up a fascinating chase scene though Las Vegas that brings up "how did they do that" in such spectacular fashion, it was a real, creative, fresh take on an old generic scene and offers up a gritty and powerful mob scenes that are shot in a gripping and authentic manner. The basic structure of this movie was sound, it had chilling thrills, good pacing, yet it seems to omit the necessary care and refinement that could have made this Bourne movie into a great movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jason Bourne</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first three films in the Bourne franchise are fantastic, the one film without the protagonist, Legacy, is good, nine years since Ultimatum, the leading star and director Paul Greengrass (Bloody Sunday, United 93, Green Zone, Captain Phillips) returned for this fifth instalment. Basically it has been ten years since Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) recovered from his amnesia, found out his real name, David Webb, exposed Operation Blackbriar and disappeared, he is isolating himself from the world and making money in illegal fights. Bourne's former Treadstone contact Nicolette "Nicky" Parsons (Julia Stiles) is in Reykjavík collaborating with a hacktivist group led by Christian Dassault (Vinzenz Kiefer), and hacks into the CIA's mainframe server to expose black ops programs, in the process she finds documentation concerning Jason Bourne's Treadstone recruitment and his father's role in the program. Parsons travels to Greece to find and inform Bourne, but her system intrusion has alerted CIA cyber ops division head Heather Lee (The Danish Girl's Alicia Vikander), and CIA Director Robert Dewey (Tommy Lee Jones), a team is sent to locate Parsons, she and Bourne meet at Syntagma Square, in the midst of a violent anti-government protest, Bourne is spotted and also turned into a target, after evading the team, Parsons is killed by ex-Blackbriar assassin the Asset (Vincent Cassel). Before dying, Parsons gives Bourne the key to a locker that holds all CIA files she hacked, Bourne locates Dassault in Berlin, decrypting the files Bourne discovers that his father, Richard Webb (Gregg Henry), was a CIA analyst involved in the creation of the original Treadstone program. The CIA are alerted of Bourne's location, a team is sent to capture him, while Lee remotely erases the files to prevent further leaks, Bourne kills Dassault in a fight, Lee believes Bourne can be persuaded to return to the agency, so alerts Bourne about the team. Bourne uses the few leads he has to track down former Treadstone surveillance operative Malcolm Smith (Bill Camp) in London, he arranges to meet him in Paddington Square, Lee persuades Dewey to allow her to speak to Bourne and try to bring him in, he agrees, but secretly sends the Asset to eliminate her team and kill Bourne, Dewey believes Bourne cannot be reasoned with. Bourne knows the CIA are watching him, he evades them and Lee long enough to talk to Smith, who admits his father created Treadstone, but tried to prevent them recruiting Jason, the Asset was ordered by Dewey to kill his father and staged the death to look like a terrorist attack, so that Bourne would join Treadstone. The Asset kills Smith, Bourne finds Lee, who confesses she is not comfortable with Dewey's methods, she directs Bourne to a technology convention in Las Vegas. Dewey is scheduled to attend the convention for a public debate on privacy rights with Aaron Kalloor (Riz Ahmed), CEO of social media enterprise Deep Dream, Kalloor is the public face of corporate social responsibility in the Internet age, but Dewey secretly funds him, he intends to use Deep Dream for real-time mass surveillance, and resurrect targeted assassination programs Treadstone, Blackbriar, Outcome and LARX projects, now known as "Iron Hand". Dewey suspects Kalloor will refuse the CIA access to Deep Dream, so has authorised the Asset to assassinate him, and Lee who he no longer trusts, Bourne arrives in time to prevent the assassination, and confronts Dewey in his hotel suite. Knowing that the agents are closing in, Dewey stalls Bourne, Bourne kill's Dewey's right-hand man Craig Jeffers (Ato Essandoh), while Dewey is killed by Lee before he can shoot Bourne, Lee's involvement is covered up by Bourne, he then chases the Asset through the Las Vegas Strip, before they both reach the sewer, and after fighting Bourne finally kills him. In the aftermath, Lee convinces Director of National Intelligence Edwin Russell (Scott Shepherd) of Dewey's outdated methods, and offers to be the eyes and ears in the CIA, Lee wants to use Bourne's trust to bring him back into the agency, but knows there are orders to kill him if he refuses, Bourne wants time to consider the offer, but leaves a recording of her conversation with Russell, revealing he does not trust her, Bourne disappears again. Damon was fantastic in the first three films as the troubled assassin, so it is odd to see that he doesn't speak as much in this, apparently he only has 45 lines, mostly with few words, but even with not much dialogue he remains good, Jones is interestingly intense, Vikander is good, and Cassel is suited to being the hired killer. I will admit that the story gets a little complicated at times, but the simple plot of revenge for the death of a father works well, and there are good themes of conspiracy and no privacy in social media, and the fast-paced chase sequences, especially the final car rampage in Vegas, definitely keep you watching, overall it is a worthwhile action thriller. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jason Bourne - Movie Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay before I talk about "Jason Bourne" let me talk about the other films first, as I think this is the perfect time to quickly talk about other ones, because I like the Bourne trilogy.The Bourne Identity was a great movie not because of the action or anything, but because of the mystery surrounding the main character. Matt Damon was the perfect choice to play Jason Bourne as I can't imagine anyone else taking that role.The Bourne Supremacy did a lot of things better than Identity, in terms of the ending, the emotion and just how violent it is. The one thing that no one talks about in Supremacy is how smart it is of delivering the emotion from characters. There's no sad music or overly dramatic dialogue to make you feel something; no, it was all from the actors who had to deliver that and they absolutely do. It honestly made it more effective.The Bourne Ultimatum was just amazing and I do think it's one of the best action movies in the last decade. The movie is non-stop action and it's so filled with energy, after it's over you need rest from it. The way the movie ends, I thought it was the end for the franchise. But many wonder if another movie was to come, but many seem to think that "Ultimatum" was the last one.Oh and I'm not counting "Legacy" as part of the series, because lets just ignore that one.But here we are with "Jason Bourne". Matt Damon and Paul Greengrass return to the franchise and while l thought this installment was an enjoyable one, but it's not as great as the others, unfortunately.The best part of Jason Bourne was it's opening action sequence with an incredible motorbike chase during a riot. It was quick, intense, exciting and insistently hooks you. The rest of the action was pretty damn good and fights are once again brutal. The one thing this movie does not disappoint on is it's action.Matt Damon once again dose a great performance as Bourne and after all these years it doesn't feel like he missed a step.Tommy Lee Jones is basically TLJ, but he was still good. Even with his motivates not being that strong and the character itself isn't anything that compelling.Alicia Vikander and Julie Stiles were both fine in the movie. They did a decent performance in this and it's always nice to see those two in movies.Vincent Cassel is an excellent actor and he makes for a perfect hit- man to go after Bourne. While the gifted actor is great in this, I wished there was more of him.Everything was going great....until the actual story of the movie starts. The story evolves around people being concerned about privacy on social media and most of the movie dedicates to this plot. This is when the movie goes down hill and it doesn't take long for that to happen. This story line is so uninteresting and not at all needed for a movie like this. I know this movie is trying something different and there is somewhat of a revenge story here that's not just from the hero perspective but the villain as well. Nothing about this was riveting and it had no emotional weight to it.The writing was pretty lackluster and not really compelling. Again, the social media plot line really grinded this movie down. This should have been a full on revenge movie and while that may be repetitive for some, but hey, it's got to be better than this. What breaks my heart is that there were plenty of times where this movie could have went into a interesting direction, but instead chooses to stick with the social media crap.While I thought the Las Vegas chase was pretty enjoyable, I did think it was a little over the top. What I like so much about the previous Bourne movies is how the action scenes feel so realistic and I'm not saying it's like real life, but it was realistic enough to keep you on edge during those sequences. But here, it goes full out nuts with cars flipping and flying in the air. There were so many times where Bourne should have died and the villain as well. It's completely mad.Overall rating: I enjoyed "Jason Bourne" on an action movie standpoint. There's a lot of things to like in this movie with the directing, the acting and the action, but judging it as a film overall, it was pretty meh. Compare it to Identity, Supremacy and Ultimatum, this was unfortunately a massive step down from those three. This movie should have been spectacular but it sadly wasn't.At least it's better than "Legacy"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a huge fan of the Bourne trilogy (of course, not the legacy) and I have to say that this one gets the job done, specially if you consider this is the fourth movie, which you know you shouldn't expect much.Sure, the plot is kind of dumb compared to the previous ones, and the motivations of Jason Bourne are a little confused, but the character still intact.Plus: Still connected to the trilogy and not just a new story that includes Bourne Against: Locations in this one are not that good as we were used to.Being Ultimatum my favorite, this one is at the level of Bourne Identity and far better than Legacy. Yes, go see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A 2 hour chase film - and that's just fine with me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>JASON BOURNE is my favorite film of the summer of 2016 (so far).Admittedly, this bar is pretty low, for the films this summer have been (so far), just okay. They haven't been bad, they haven't been great, they fall solidly in the "good" range. I think that this is because a vast majority of these films are sequels or remakes and there just hasn't been anything original.The arguments I have heard against the newest of the BOURNE films falls right into this camp. It's not "original", there is "more of the same" - and I can't argue with that. Like a comfortable t- shirt, I was able to slip it on, turn my brain off and escape for two hours.So, what makes this one different than THE AVENGERS, THE X-MEN, GHOSTBUSTERS or STAR TREK (my 2nd favorite film of the summer)? For some, it will not be all that different, just more of the same. But, for me, I enjoyed the "more of the same" immensely for the two, fast-paced hours I was in the theater.JASON BOURNE reunites Matt Damon (as Bourne) and Director Paul Greengrass. This pairing brings back, for me. the excitement and pace of the original. I was anxious to buckle in for a wild ride, and that's what I got. Aiding these two is a strong supporting cast, Tommy Lee Jones, Vincent Cassel, Julia Styles and my current favorite actress, Alicia Vikander. They all jump ably into the fray and bring professional, workman-like efforts to the cause.But, make no mistake, this film is not about the acting, it's about the action and Greenrass brings the action, fast, furious and constant. Some argue that this film is just one long chase scene - and I would agree. Though, I see it as a compliment, not a complaint.If you're looking for something original that will ask to to break into discussion groups after the film, see something else. If you're looking for fast-paced action, professionally done, see JASON BOURNE.8 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (of Marquis)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Re-Bourne</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's some very clever packaging at work here. It felt like the most exciting two hours I've spent in the cinema in a long time, and yet what it mostly does is to recycle the plot of the first three movies. Having recovered his memory, Jason is now trying to clear his dead father's name but the devious new head of the Agency (they're always devious in this series) has to stop him. There's a subplot involving an ultra-nerd social media chief who maybe does or maybe doesn't want to let the CIA use his global network for surveillance. Matt Damon isn't given much dialogue: he's an all-action man. The new CIA chief is played by Tommy Lee Jones, looking as if his head belongs on Mount Rushmore. He has a cool new assistant (Alicia Vikander as a younger version of the Joan Allen character from BOURNE 2 and 3). Vincent Cassel plays a freelance assassin (he often does) known only as 'the Asset'. Julia Stiles reprises her role as renegade agent Nicky Parsons; there's an early chase scene involving her and Jason that is more visceral (and more believable) than the OTT climax on the Vegas Strip. The various plot-threads are somewhat clumsily tied together, but the main focus of a Bourne movie are the chases and shoot-outs. As he has before, Paul Greengrass serves up non-stop action with a lot more style than cartoon-based movies - although Jason Bourne, let's face it, is another superhero just as James Bond is. Yes, we've seen most of this before, but the pace and the packaging - there are five killings in the first sixty seconds! - make this feel (almost) fresh.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good Action but not Superb</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although I gave 8 out of 10 to the new Bourne movie (2016) and it is still a movie that I highly recommend it to my friends as a very good action movie, but I have to admit that the movie is not as superb as the previous trilogy movies that were based on Robert Ludlum fascinating books. Here and there there are some obvious flaws in story-line and unfortunately it is not impeccable like the previous Bourne movies. A fast-pacing movie with good editing, acceptable reconstruction of the demonstrations in front of the Greece Parliament and Vegas streets scenes are of the advantage points of the movie. I like Matt Damon's attitude, acting style and professionalism and Alicia Vikander (Danish Girl) has demonstrated herself as a capable and versatile actress. She is quite good in her role in spy genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Go out and see this movie its worth it. The movie is different because he knows who he is and that he was trained to be a super killer. That drove the first three movies, him trying to find out about himself. So now its time for something different. I liked this movie for a number of different reasons. It was cool to see how the CIA can track a person in almost no time at all. How surveillance and facial recognition technology is making it almost impossible to hide. How software is linking your past life and acquaintances to facial recognition software and so that agencies like the CIA can quickly locate people you have associated with. The scenes where he is running for his life are great. Just one other note, go onto YouTube and watch the original Jason Bourne movie from the 80's, its called the Bourne Identity, this version follows the book fairly close. You will see how different the recent movies are compared to the actual book. I personally like the recent movies better, but the book has its charms too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While second and third installments of successful films often disappoint, that is not the case here. Co-star casting is terrific. Tommy Lee Jones' relaxed nuanced performance was terrific, and all in the ensemble deliver. Enjoyed the buttoned-up underplayed performance of the young CIA manager. Plot, pacing, and dialogue are very good; the Bourne trademark of the hopscotching of world cities is intact; and the action/chase scenes are spectacular. (The downtown Vegas car-count may be a tad too spectacular). From his pre-Bourne work, I would never have imagined Matt Damon for this type of role. Glad he found it/it found him, as I look forward to installment #4. Pure entertainment, start to finish.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Of course not as good as the trilogy, but this is a nice closure for Bourne fans. Especially since we were let down by The Bourne Legacy. Kinda boring in the first 30 minutes, but the action scenes after made up for it. For me, it's really nice to see Matt Damon again. Getting flashback about his life story and the struggle of his character, makes me a little touched. And seeing Nicky Parsons here too, makes me teary. I'm hoping for more complicated plot twist, but the plot was okay. Not complaining. I mean what more can you hope after the great trilogy. Not great, but not a terrible movie of course.

		<fullReview>'Jason Bourne' is the latest entry in the 'Bourne' franchise, a film that has had it's anticipation dampened (for me) only by 'The Bourne Legacy' - which was disappointing to say the least. This movie is, thankfully, much better than that but it isn't as good as the original trilogy (Identity, Supremacy and Ultimatum) - action flicks which are all brilliant and very close in quality. 'Jason Bourne' struggles to maintain its relevance and is actually an unnecessary outing, as evidenced by a weak 'reason to return' for Bourne himself. However, it was made and so we have a good spy thriller that would've been better if it were not tied to, if you will, the 'Bourne' (movies') legacy.Paul Greengrass has returned to the series, in the shape of not only director but also co-writer. He is definitely better at the former, because he displays some of his best work here; the style he created is still one he excels at. An example is an extended sequence set during a riot in Greece, which features hundreds of extras and creates a palpable sense of chaos. Yet the movie retains focus, telling a cohesive story within the mayhem. It's a wonderful scene, encompassing what is great about this instalment. All of the action is visceral and well-done, and it easily stacks up to that found in the rest of the series. The customary hand-to-hand fight is fantastic, making you really feel as though you are in the middle of it, and it's brutal too. The only downside is that, upon reflection, most of the blows are obscured and the camera-work hides a lot; this means that it's a little hard to follow beat-for-beat, and it's hard to know exactly what is going on. The basics are there though, and the sound design / mixing enhances what's on screen. It is also clear that Greengrass' signature shaky style is not used to hide any dodgy stunt work or doubles, and Matt Damon has always performed most of his own action. This seems to be the case here too, and as such the fights seem real and compelling in the moment. My only other complaint with the action is that it sometimes feels unrealistic compared to the prior movies. A handful of CGI is clearly used and feels out of place, some of the choreography is a little far-fetched and Bourne himself also feels slightly indestructible.The acting here is mostly good, as are the characters. Damon is great as Bourne, effortlessly slipping into the role, even though he doesn't say all that much. Some of his character conflict has been removed unfortunately, due to how 'Ultimatum' left things off, but Damon still conveys a lot of emotion through body-language. Julia Stiles returns as Nicky Parsons, though this feels a little redundant and she gives probably the weakest performance of the film. Tommy Lee Jones, Alicia Vikander, Riz Ahmed and Vincent Cassel are all good too. Jones and Vikander play the CIA officials tasked with tracking Bourne, and are both wells suited for their parts. It's a little odd that someone in their 20s could become second in command of the CIA so quickly, but that doesn't really bother me. Ahmed portrayed a social media mogul who's inclusion in the movie is questionable at best, but the actor does what he can with the limited material. Cassel is excellent as the primary 'physical' antagonist, playing an 'Asset' working for the agency. He is convincing in the action scenes, and his quiet precise demeanour can be threatening.While the action is all great, and easily the best thing about the film, there isn't actually all that much of it - at least, not as much as I would have liked. The film's major issue is that it spends far too much time with the CIA, or Ahmed's character. It works best when it's with Bourne, but that is actually quite rare for a movie with his name as the title. The original films had a lot of the CIA stuff too, but the focus was always on the titular character and everything else was in service of the main story. The CIA plot here isn't all that interesting though, and feels like a re-tread. The plot is generally very weak, giving a fairly poor reason both for Bourne to return and for its own existence. The flick feels much longer than it is, with the middle act meandering and the script feeling fairly uninspired. The ending is also very anti-climactic, especially since it follows a great action scene. It's a shame that everything in-between the action is a little inadequate because the movie could've been better than it was. The film as a whole makes for a decent spy thriller, but it isn't up to standards set by the fantastic first films. In summary, Matt Damon and Paul Greengrass have created a worthy - if unnecessary - sequel to their beloved franchise; while it never quite reaches the heights of the original trilogy due to a weak plot and a tendency to focus more on the CIA than Bourne himself, this is still an enjoyable film with some great action scenes that should keep you entertained throughout: 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch Full Movie Here</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just found a link to watch a movie http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x4n1q63 The Bourne franchise started with "The Bourne Identity" back in 2002, continued with "The Bourne Supremacy" in 2004 followed by "The Bourne Ultimatum" in 2007. I do not consider "The Bourne Legacy" (2012) part of this franchise because Matt Damon didn't take part in it and because it has much lower quality in script and filming. "The Bourne Identity"was one of the best action movies I had seen at the time and it really made an impression on me. The sequels were almost as good as the original, although they didn't have the same vibe. I will not go into details about this year's film since I don't want to spoil your fun. If you enjoyed the previous "Bourne" movies you will find "Jason Bourne" at least entertaining.About the 2016 movie "Jason Bourne", it is an American movie directed by Paul Greengrass(director of "The Bourne Supremacy" and "The Bourne Ultimatum")based on a script by Greengrass and Cristopher Rouse, it had a budget of $120.000.000 which definitely paid off in the movie quality. The movie has a solid cast(Matt Damon, Tommy Lee Jones, Alicia Vikander), good plot, not so good script, no cliché lines, great action/visual effects, it has common sense and it does not defy logic like most action movies do. "Jason Bourne" definitely lives up to the expectations. In this movie we have Jason Bourne knowing who he actually is, cured of amnesia, and battling an even larger enemy than before. There are car chases, well choreographed fight scenes,shootouts,explosions and everything else you would want from an action movie. Even though we are used to seeing Jason Bourne being chased by a government agency we still love it. Unfortunately, this movie has a weak script and plot holes, it is far from the quality of the "Bourne" trilogy. "Jason Bourne" still is one of the best movies released this year and I would confidently give it a 8.0/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(RATING: &#x2606;&#x2606;&#x2606;? out of 5 )THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED. IN BRIEF: Action takes a precedent over storytelling in this taut thriller.GRADE: B-SYNOPSIS: Jason Bourne is call to action once more as he fight cyber spies.JIM'S REVIEW: Jason Bourne is born yet again in Paul Greengrass' latest installment to the profitable series. The death toll rises and so does the moviegoer's pulse rate in this taut but somewhat predictable espionage thriller. The film shows off the director's virtuoso style of filmmaking. His visual sleight of hand remains impressive, but it is still The Emperor New Clothes...all flash but no real substance. Still, Mr. Greengrass is such a fine craftsman and his vision revitalizes the franchise with such needed verve and energy to hide the film's major flaw: its screenplay (by Christopher Rouse and the director himself).&#xfffc;One never gets bored with the non-stop action. That is basically all that there is. As with many spy films, there is an overabundance of chases and shoot-outs which happen in many global destinations like Greece, Germany, and England. These set pieces make up Jason Bourne. Yet one yearns for a credence of logic and story that could simply connect these riveting action scenes with an engrossing narrative. That doesn't exist in this film chapter which hampers its overall impact.Our hero remains a man of few words (and so is the director for that matter). In Jason Bourne, this rogue agent is brought back from hiding into the world of spies, counter intelligence, and cyber warfare. The film succeeds in its depiction of espionage on a grand scale and Greenberg's images are first-rate.&#xfffc;Matt Damon is all buffed and ripped in the title role. His character's fighting skills are evident as is his quick thinking and the actor is solid (in many ways) in his role. But it is the other characters that remain hollow and sketchy. The script has too many illogical circumstances and exposition that defies explanation. (Just a few of the numerous leaps of logic to ponder: How does the globetrotter Bourne get through airport security so easily and how does he afford the airfares with his paltry jobs? If he is so savvy an agent, then why doesn't he realize that his whereabouts can be easily traced whenever he uses any form of technology?)Tommy Lee Jones (overdoing the evil bit), a typecast Seymour Cassel, and Alicia Vikander (underwhelming) never bring much depth to their one-dimensional shady characters. Julia Stiles in a smaller part, as Bourne's sidekick, Nicky Parsons, is back and their chemistry again is strong if short-lived. Riz Ahmed as a corrupted computer CEO is given too little to do.&#xfffc;But with the Bourne formula, it is the action and mayhem that takes center stage. The film is a series of chases linked to each other with some computer technology and double crosses thrown in for good measure. Conspiracy theories and talks of governmental paranoia helps to keep everything so topical.Despite some overall reservations, there is literally a memorable bang-up action sequence on the streets of Vegas that leads to an exciting chase through an underground garage that is so well staged and concisely edited. (Kudos to Christopher Rouse, yes, the same co-author of the film doing double duty, whose editing makes the film consistently better than it actually is.) Actually the film's sparse style and technical expertise is its main asset...it surely isn't the minimal dialog and monotonous plotting.&#xfffc;The strengths are in its production values and the director's artistry, which outweighs its weakness in storytelling. Jason Bourne may be intellectually inert and not totally fulfilling, but the film is a visceral joy ride.

		<shortDescription>Struggles to live up to it's classic predecessors.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'JASON BOURNE': Four Stars (Out of Five)The fifth installment in the blockbuster spy thriller series, once again starring Matt Damon (as the title character). Damon returns to his most popular role; 9 years after he last played the part (in 'THE BOURNE ULTIMATUM'). Bourne is (once again) on the run from the CIA, after he comes out of hiding to help an old friend. He then searches for more clues, about his mysterious past (which seem to be never ending). Paul Greengrass returned to direct the movie (for the third time), and he also co-wrote the script (for the first time); with his longtime editor Christopher Rouse (a first-time screenwriter). The film costars Alicia Vikander, Tommy Lee Jones, Vincent Cassel and Julia Stiles (returning to her role for the forth time). The movie is entertaining enough, but it still struggles to live up to it's classic predecessors. Jason Bourne (Damon), and his former CIA coworker Nicky Parsons (Stiles), have been in hiding for nearly a decade. Bourne has been keeping busy, and paying the bills, by competing in illegal fights (far away from society). Nicky has recently teamed up with a government 'whistle blower', named Christian Dassault (Vinzenz Kiefer). She's also drawn unwanted (deadly) attention to herself, by hacking into classified CIA data; including info on operation Treadstone (the program that she and Bourne were involved in). Bourne also comes out of hiding, to help her. He quickly learns that there's more secret information, about his past, that he doesn't know yet. The director of the CIA (Jones), and his protégé (Vikander), desperately try to stop Bourne, from exposing more classified information (that they can't risk getting out).The movie is (once again) very aptly directed, by Greengrass; his script could have used a little more work though. Damon (once again) makes an awesome action hero; even if he utters almost no dialogue in the entire movie. Vikander is strikingly beautiful (once again), and she gives a scene-stealing performance in it (as well). The movie is definitely entertaining, slightly engaging, and (without a doubt) action-packed. It does feel (somewhat) unnecessary though, and it's definitely not as good as the first three films in the franchise; it is better than 'THE BOURNE LEGACY' (at least) though.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/WJl7HNQ4N_4</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not The Bourne this time , just Jason Bourne.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jason Bourne(Matt Damon) comes out of hiding, to learn about his dad, and why he became the perfect killing machine. He quickly goes on the run again upon learning about Ironhand the next best thing to Tredstone, run by CIA director Robert Dewey(Tommy Lee Jones). How will this come into play? It's quite a dream come true when Matt Damon reprises his role has Bourne, after saying he was done with the role, but agreed to reprise it only if Paul Greengrass was brought back to direct, who directed the last two Bourne movies that starred Damon. Action scenes are pretty good, fight scenes don't disappoint either. I'm not gonna say it's better than the other Bourne movies that Damon was in, not counting the Jeremy Renner one. But Jason Bourne is on the same level, not better or less than. Matt Damon really jumps into character almost feeling like he never left, really sells it well, although a little older. Tommy Lee Jones is good, selling scenes with a cold eye stare. Vincent Cassel and the rest of supporting cast do pretty well too, and Paul Greengrass direction really works here. Will there be another Jason Bourne film, only time will tell.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It was good!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The trilogy was about as good as a trilogy can get. The 4th was good, which is rare. My thinking is if your gonna do a 5th one and you get Jason and NIkki back then it should go to the next level. Well....it didn't, it was good but I can't say more. They gave you the same action sequences, same themes, same triggers for Bourne. Cinematography was on point. Great location shots. The story was in line with the past, but nothing new, no money shot! The movie stayed in the same lane the whole time, no surprises, nothing. I would have liked to have seen the Pam Landy character return. Joan Allen is a exceptional actress, she could have added more juice to the film. All in all it was good, not great, and I think most Bourne fans were expecting great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Top notch. Bourne is back!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>He's back, baby. God it's so good to see Jason Bourne doing his thing on the big screen again, especially in a flick that's every bit as excellent as the original trilogy in all the old, good ways, while adding a few twists of its own that suit the digital age we have progressed into, and the concerns which go hand in hand with it. It's been sometime since Jason swam away out of frame as an unsure news report claimed that his body was never recovered, and a slow smirk spread over Nicky Parson's (Julia Stiles) face as she observed on TV. With ex CIA director Kramer (Scott Glenn) no doubt incarcerated, the agency is headed up by the worst apple of the bunch so far, Robert Dewey (Tommy Lee Jones), a surveillance hound dog who has ties to Bourne's past and wants to use a record breaking social media app to illegally spy on users for 'national security' purposes (heard that one before). Scary stuff, but simply a backdrop for Bourne to come speeding back onto their radar and make hell for them, after Nicky hacks the database and spurs him on. Damon is beefed up, weathered and has never been more furious as Bourne, and if you thought his revenge rampage in Supremacy was something to behold, just wait til you see these fireworks. It feels a bit more intimate than the last three, with a lot of time spent on Bourne, and less agency types howling in control rooms and backstabbing each other, save for Dewey and his eager beaver protégé Heather Lee, played by Alicia Vikander in a slightly perplexing character arc that I'm still trying to think through. She has her own agenda, clashing with that of a ruthless rogue asset (Vincent Cassel is going grey, but damn he can still run around like nobody's business) that Dewey foolishly sends after Jason. Paul Greengrass is back in the director's chair again, and after this chapter I can honestly say I think he's the best captain to ever sit at the helm of a Bourne flick. He just has this way with action that never feels too stylized or obviously cinematic, while still delivering a pure rush of thrills that exist in a realistic space. There's an early scene taking place in Greece during a dangerous riot that feels like they just dropped the cast and crew in the midst of a real life police skirmish and started shooting, in more ways than one. My favourite has to be a thundering car chase down the Vegas Strip in which a SWAT tank causes a jaw dropping bout of vehicular Armageddon. Sounds too over the top for a Bourne flick, right? You'd think, but somehow they just make the thing work and stay within the parameters of this world. I had this fear that they wouldn't be able sneak another Bourne movie onto the back end of an already perfect trilogy without it feeling out of place. While it certainly is different than it's predecessors (we live in a radically different time), it still has that magic, feverish rush that I love so much and that has carried the franchise along on wings of adrenaline. A blast. Cue Moby's Extreme Ways to play out my review.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than the critics would have you believe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Jason Bourne" (2016 release; 123 min.) brings the on-going adventures of the Bourne character. As the movie opens, we are at the Greece-Albania border where Bourne is fighting in illegal fighting rings, while staying off the grid. Within the first 15 min., we are introduced to scenes in Reykjavík, Iceland, in Washington, DC, in Silicon Valley, and I know I'm forgetting a few locations, and before we know we are off and running! Couple of comments: with this film, the tried-and-true Bourne team of writer-director Paul Greengrass and Matt Damon as the title character return after a 1 film/9 year absence. Welcome back, guys! While the previous film, the Jeremy Renner-fronted The Bourne Legacy, certainly wasn't 'bad' per se, the reality is that we've now become so associated with Matt Damon in this role, that we simply expect him to play in a Bourne movie, period. I must admit that I had my reservations about this movie, in particular since the critical reception by the so-called experts was generally lukewarm at best (currently at just 57% on Rotten Tomatoes). The opening 10-15 min. seemed to confirm my reservations but then once the movie arrived in Greece, everything seemed to fall into place as the movie from then on is essentially one long drawn-out cat-and-mouse game/chase. The 30 min. segment in Greece is for me the most satisfactory and most enjoyable sequence of the entire movie, but truth be told, I very much enjoyed the rest of it as well. Matt Damon is terrific as usual, but the movie is helped tremendously by the outstanding performances from French actor Vincent Cassel (as the "Asset") and Swedish actress Alicia Vikander (as CIA Head of Operations).The opened launched nationally this weekend. The early Sunday evening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was SOLD OUT to the very last seat, somewhat to my surprise (Sunday evening is not a time that I associate with tons of movie viewers). It is clear that there is a hunger for this franchise that has yet to be stilled. After opening with $60 million over the weekend, it seems only natural that in due course we'll get another installment (fingers crossed). Meanwhile, this turns out to be much better than what the critics would have us believe. Whether this is your first time or your fifth time taking in the Bourne franchise, "Jason Bourne" is still worth checking out, shortcomings and all!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shaky Camera-work But an Excellent Sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would have given this movie 10 out of 10 if it was not for the shaky camera. It came close to being unwatchable on some occasions. Why such big budget movies are employing cameramen who are high on coffee and doughnuts are beyond me. The jittery camera is just awful. It takes the focus away from the story, and from the action. The idea that home-made footage gives intimacy or authenticity is far from true. I have many footages from my phone that me and my kids have shot. They all mean a lot to me but they are, honestly, totally unwatchable. Even to me! So when I pay my money to watch a Jason Bourne movie, I expect not to be given a headache in return. Each instalment appears to get worse in this regard. Please can someone in the production team for the next Jason Bourne film hire some gimball, or whatever stabilisation equipment? Now that the rant is over, I actually felt that the story was carried forward quite well. It is an expected storyline but done well. I enjoyed the part played by all the actors. Despite some other reviewers, I quite like the complex genius portrayed by Vikander. She lends herself to the role well. The stunt scenes are not a cliché like many other films. It stays true to Jason Bourne style. Very much so. The stunt scenes are gritty and yet spectacular and memorable. It is quite remarkable that Jason Bourne series have even managed to create a 'style' that is easily recognisable as the Jason Bourne 'brand'. Even other big brand movies like James Bond, have struggled to create a unique, recognisable style to their stunts. Less camera shake would have rendered some parts sublime and supremely entertaining. It is possible that the director thought this camera shake is part of the brand. I would disagree. There is an immensely identifiable style that is very 'Jason Bourne' without all the jittery shaking. I love the colour tonality, the intimate feel of scenes, the pace and quickness, the expectation of movement each shot appears to carry, the view or the angle the camera takes, etc. etc. ...well too many to list. Then the sound, both the background, and the music. The film gently touches a critical current political issues. Very lightly. This is nice. It is not bogged down by anything. It does not offer solutions, just shows it as a clever and purposeful backdrop to the story of this instalment. So I recommend this film with a caveat that if the shaky camera gives you a headache, make sure that the cinema offers you a free aspirin on the house. Thanks for reading.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dynamic Duo Damon &amp; Greengrass return for more high octane chicanery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>JASON BOURNE (2016) *** Matt Damon, Tommy Lee Jones, Alicia Vikander, Vincent Cassel, Julia Stiles, Riz Ahmed, Ato Essandoh, Scott Shepherd, Bill Camp, Gregg Henry. Damon and filmmaker Paul Greengrass reunite in their 3rd outing of the 5th film in the Bourne franchise attempting to revitalize the action packed espionage thriller by going a tad more low key as everyone's fave amnesiac attempts to avoid CIA chicanery to an epic fail when the government sanctioned org is out to stop him and a leak of global identity encroachments. Peppered with enough high octane action (including a killer slightly over-the-top Las Vegas strip chase sequence) and minimal chat from Bourne's more Eastwoodian encroaching hero. While the usually engaging Vikander is hamstrung with a placid turn as an eager beaver recruit her senior op and CIA director Jones (taciturn to the hilt) keeps stony gravitas to the nth degree.</fullReview>

Tommy Lee does a good job as a bad guy too. As a relatively new comer Alice Vikander does a really good job also. I liked her in 7th Son and she was better in this. I would pay to go see this movie a second time that is how well I liked it, which is rare for me to want to see something again well enough to pay a second time. I would recommend this movie to anyone that likes action and mystery.I just hope this is not the last one would love to see at least one more before they stop.</fullReview>

As he is still a wanted man.After he exposed publicizing some CIA classified secrets that lead the agency to try to bring him in, or better yet in their eyes eliminate him for good.But he is too wily and too cunning. As he meets up with Nicky the contact he sent away to France with her stumbling upon his past.But as the CIA and other agencies close in on him, he must find a way to stay alive and expose the inner corrupt workings of the CIA and the privacy issue laws.

		<fullReview>It's been 9 years since one of the greatest trilogies of all time ended with The Bourne Ultimatum in 2007, but it's hard to believe this is the story that took them so long to come up with. It's easily one of the most thrilling films of the summer, but it's hard not to be a little bit let down with the lack of an original story amongst the amazing action.One of the main complaints I had with the last two entries in the series were that the script retreads pretty much the same story beats as its predecessors. Bourne is reeled back in unwillingly, the C.I.A. suspects Bourne for going after them or others wrongfully, an 'asset' tries to take him out, and Jason Bourne gets ticked. Just look at all 5 of the films, including the Renner one, and that's the arc they take. Perhaps it's unfair to say they are all the same, but re-watching all of them in the same week sure made it seem like it.To its credit, the Bourne films always seem to add some incredible acting talent, and 'Jason Bourne' is no different. Alicia Vikander, Tommy Lee Jones, and Vincent Cassel are the notable additions and they all give something to the story. Jones plays the now stale 'sketchy C.I.A. director' role. Seriously, how many more times are these films going to show the head of the C.I.A. to be a huge threat? Nevertheless, Jones is great. Vikander is another great addition to the series as a C.I.A. tech specialist and hacker, but also somebody who sees Bourne's side of things, much like Pamela Landy from the previous two.Cassel is the one that surprised me the most, though. I knew the great talent he has acting wise, but I was pleasantly surprised at how well the script painted his character as someone who you understand their motivations. I think some of the previous films fell victim to having an assassin going after Bourne as a one-note killer, but Cassel is far from that.What the film doesn't do better, however, is reinvent the series and take it in a new direction. As I mentioned before, it doesn't even pretend to be something other than a rehash of the same story threads from 'Supremacy' or 'Ultimatum'. Because of that, the film relies heavily on how good the action and performances are. Luckily, both are quite good. It seems the filmmakers put a bigger emphasis on making the action bigger and better, and they definitely succeeded, though I can still do without Greengrass' shaky cam tropes.Last but not least, I should mention the greatness that is Matt Damon as Jason Bourne. He may only say around 30-40 words across the entire length of the film, but he does more than enough without words to create an emotionally and physically satisfying performance. From here, I'm not entirely sure where the franchise goes, but I hope it strays away from the same story beats over and over again and reinvents the series in a new and exciting way.+Explosive action+New cast members+Damon does a lot without saying much+Cassel's assassin has depth-Pretty much the same story as the previous entries7.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Relentless action and thrilling combat sequences</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Matt Damon is no doubt, Jason Bourne. With him this time along for the thrilling ride is Tommy Lee Jones &amp; Alicia Vikander. If you are a fan of the Bourne series,you will enjoy and appreciate the return of Jason Bourne. It puts you on the edge of your seat from start to finish, needles to say the 2hr run time of this movie flew by. The pacing was great and returning Director Paul Greengrass does a great job at mixing combat heavy sequences with mentally stimulating set pieces that keeps the audience guessing and thinking like and with the characters throughout. What will you do next? How will this affect her? Why is he doing this? All of these amount to a style of story telling that engages the audience. Like the previous installments, the movie gives you a slight hint at what the agenda is in the first act of the movie before it takes off as you watch the characters make their move on the chess board you see in front of you. You see the characters have evolved from the events of the first 3 films and you immediately connect with those familiar faces. The soundtrack is edgy and Greengrass does not rely so much on this to build suspense, he can use silence as a technique to building tension as much as he can with the score. If there is a flaw, it might come in the form of the ending, not to say that it was bad, it wasn't bad at all.Its just that the plot devices that were planted throughout the film that should've built up to a resolution ending, for a specific agenda didn't quite pay off as much as I would've liked to see and I know where they were trying to go, just didn't quite get there for me. But each to their own. Jason Bourne is a must watch. :) Visit my new YouTube channel 2min movie reviews: http://bit.ly/29RrTbl8 out of 10|Gerald James|</fullReview>

Matt Damon always does such a good job with character submersion and I have come to expect nothing but the best from him, I haven't been disappointed yet! For all of you Bourne fans out there you will find yourself on the edge of your seat at multiple points in this movie. I found myself uttering "he is a bad man" during many of the scenes.

		<fullReview>Jason Bourne (2016) I gave this 10/10 its perfect at 2hrs3min of very breathless| Action, and a Thriller to boot director Paul Greengrass has it all here with his hand hell camera following around bourne as the most dangerous former operative of the CIA is drawn out of hiding to uncover hidden truths about his past. You know his name and one thing you can be assured of is a breathless white knuckle ride with loads of thrills and spills with bourne of the scent this film is a picture postcard of traveling from Athens to Iceland to Germany London and Washington but as we see bourne is back and Matt Damon is Jason Bourne and he plays the character so well after 9 yrs away you see him fighting for money in Greece so as we see Tommy Lee Jones character picking up the pieces of the last programs CIA Director Robert DeweyAlicia will do all he can to bring bourne in and reprogram him with all necessary means in his control room but as we see Nick Pearson in Iceland looking into CIA old files comes across a old program but updated version hacking into their PC so putting the CIA on alert as they have know clue as to why she hacking but soon follow her trail as it might lead somewhere as and so it does in Athens there is riots going on as Greece is in turmoil as we see Nick and Jason meet up to discuss their findings the C.I.A are hot in pursuit with 2 teams to find them in HQ they spot them as Nick tells him that the tread stone and blackbriar programs have been replaced and like snowdan there have been leaks and they know that want him in so this part is breathtaking as the asset is on hand to do whatever it takes with the crowds the riot police closing down the streets there plenty of running down narrow streets car chase and GPS maps to find new routes to capture or kill both with the asset chasing and find his route to vantage point as they escape on a bike with police following the asset strikes a valuable target but with heart in your mouth moment his old adversary of bourne he knows he is in trouble but as we realize that bourne is looking around Europe the have New protégé in Alicia Vikander and academy award winner lee a C.I.A recruit is helping the director win bournes trust she plays a great character but as we see bourne reliving his past his actions speak louder than world quite litterly with just 33 lines spoken The screenplay does offer up an promising post-Snowden scenario but it still feels a little too familiar. These issues aside the movie is still a pulsating ride. The pace is relentless and Damon's taciturn Bourne still represents a driving force of reckoning. The spy-craft and action set-pieces ooze -coolness and you will want to see it again just to catch how they did it. : I volunteered because of a lie. They said my father was killed by terrorists! He wasn't killed by terrorists, was he? Jason Bourne is the fifth entry (technically fourth, as The Bourne Legacy is really a spin-off) in the Bourne action spy thriller film series. While I still consider The Bourne Ultimatum to be the best in the series and nothing else will ever to top it, I think this one is still an enjoyable follow-up. It never felt contrived and added some more interesting backstory for Jason Bourne's character.as we see in Berlin he find old pals on hid tale as the USB stick reveals why he was chosen into the programs the puzzle deepens as we see there is internet company with a deal to help to CIA in the back door for technology to keep up to date with everyone so no more leaks as they had with bourne malfunction as the truth hurts bourne revenge is always on his mind through Berlin on to London as the spies become the spied there a bit of reality of bond creeping in here in a creative sort of way in real time as we see the CEO doesn't want to have any more dealing with the CIA he has a crisis of conscious at but in London we see the CIA op go badly wrong as bourne plays a blinder here finding the real leader of the program as we know the CIA have him covered but the asset is on hand to but director is not trusting his new protégé so bourne get friendly as well with the CIA protégé but keeping her at arms length so as head to Las Vegas convention the CIA have a plan up there sleves but bourne just seems a sat tep ahead of their assignation attempt so as we see bourne running around getting his gadgets and chasing around Vegas with asset fleeing and a trilling cat a mouse car chase with cars flying everywhere with some great action scenes and some very poignant moments involving Jason Bourne trying to remember who he really is. Matt Damon is once again excellent in the title role, even after fourteen years of playing him. Director Paul Greengrass' trademark shaky-cam also returns in this film, which was noticeably absent in The Bourne Legacy. If you enjoy the Jason Bourne series, then I'd say check this one out. With a budget of 120 million its will worth the comeback will there be another well lets just say he will be bourne again and spying around keeping other people in check and listening</fullReview>

The spy games double cross plot twists in the story. The hunt for Jason Bourne sub plot which make the viewer learn more about Jason past perfectly blends into the bigger story. The characters were perfect! Tommy Lee Jones plays a conflicted heavy. Jones' director character make the audience wonder was he a patriot or ambitious bureaucrat? Alicia Vikander character is she just the same as Jones' character. Bourne's internal struggle with his past and the agents sent to hunt Bourne make for a interesting character. Directed at a fast pace where the movie jumps from character to character, and scene to scene is done in perfect symmetry. Excellent action sequences, especially the ending made for a breath taking movie. I found the Jason Bourne experience memorable. 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jason Bourne is back, people!I just saw this movie a couple hours ago, and i was blown away to see how incredible this movie has to offer. I've watched all 4 Bourne movie, and this may be the greatest of all the movies.Matt Damon is obviously do a great job for the role everyone loved, and he's doing more action than words. Nikky Parsons is back but sadly she's just appeared for 15 minutes and poof! gone (you all know what it means). The new cast are solid and Alicia Vikander as the new hero Heather Lee is a welcome addition to the franchise. The action is probably the most brutal of the franchise, and the car chases are more Fast &amp; Furious now, which i like it. The hand-to-hand combat are more choreographed and the finale is the most brutal of the franchise. Bourne's backstory is featured this time, but for me it has some questions unanswered, and it might be a good set up for the next Bourne. Oh, and did i mentioned that the shaky cam is back?And yes, the film ends with another cliffhanger, and yes, the new version of Extreme Ways by Moby got me hooked again.But like all the movies, there are issues. First is someone's death (you all know who it is) which is somehow formulaic for the franchise, I mean seriously, why does all the Bourne sequels (minus Legacy) has to begin with someone's death? They should come up with a better first act next time. The side story about a Steve Jobs like CEO is so unnecessary for me, the climax is so anticlimactic and rushed for me, and they should have had a better movie title.But with all the flaws and issues, Jason Bourne is truly an incredible movie with a great cast and action. The franchise is truly Re- BourneFinal Score: 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow was this movie a bust. The directing trend to take the easy road and do everything in hand-held camera has taken over with Paul Greengrass. Not only is *every single* scene bouncing around and jittery, Paul has taken the step to add zooms to the mix making things even worse. Add to this editing that makes each shot about two seconds (literally), this movie is virtually un-watchable. Dreadful lazy lazy film making. The story (what little of it there is) was really really stupid. If you are a techie and can't overlook ridiculous technical setups and jargon, you will have a hard time getting through this movie. It is pretty laughable. But I can overlook that stuff in the interests of fun. I had high hopes for this one, and was extremely disappointed. If I wasn't with others I would have walked out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Low point of an otherwise solid series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved the first 3 Bourne films. They were fresh and action packed. The acting and story were solid. Something got lost in this movie, and it was way off the mark.The acting was not up to scratch. Julia Styles (Nicky Parsons) was not her usual self, easily one of her worst performances. Tommy Lee Jones was brought in to mock the old boss as being outdated and corrupt (ageism) and his performance was good but not great. His "you are just a dumb girl" lines came off as contrived. Matt Damon put in a great effort but didn't seem the old Jason either. Alicia Vikander played the new kid in the block (the know it all with attitude). Her performance was mostly mediocre, but, I put that down to writing/directing as her character had major personality changes at different times and never came across as credible or believable.The story did not engage. The elements with Jason's father felt shallow. Characters changed behaviour for no apparent reason. The logic barely hung together where agents were killing other agents just to establish one character as a victim. In fact, the whole victim thing was badly played from all angles.The special effects felt particularly staged. As the car was driving, explosions conveniently went off right next to the car.Saving grace was the absence of hyper aggressive female characters, one of the few modern movies not to have ridiculous martial arts scenes (thankfully). Unfortunately, Matt Damon filled the hyper aggressive role in this movie. It really wasn't necessary and went on far too long.There were many other flaws, but, it'd take too long to write. This and Star Trek both had me biting my knuckles to dull the pain. This is by far the worst of the Bourne series.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Time for the Bourne franchise to change or end</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oh why, why, why, why, do they shoot a whole movie using hand held cameras apparently manned by cameramen with Parkinson's disease? In some action scenes the camera moved so much you couldn't actually see what was happening. Even when they zoomed in on a phone expecting the audience to read the displayed message they had the phone jump around on the screen. Why? The never-stay-still camera work made this movie almost unwatchable. The plot was ordinary and predictable. Never at any time did I feel any tension because the outcome was always known (here they are chasing him again and here he is getting away again). It put me in mind of watching an old James Bond movie but with a lot less character depth and a lot more destruction. There are so many ground breaking movies out there with absorbing plots and characters to spend my time and money on. It's time to introduce something very different into the Bourne franchise or let it die a welcome death. I can't go any higher than a 3.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deja vu</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You've seen it all before but dumbed down. The action jumps from country to country seemingly at random. The Bourne Identity was a great film along with the first two sequels but this is a rehash with the same plot line especially of Supremacy: girl close to him gets killed, Bourne tries to find details of past and lunatic asset. Does the CIA really hire psychotic murderous lunatics? We also have the obligatory big car chase and high body count. Boring and a sad end to the franchise. I even enjoyed Jeremy Renner's Legacy but this was a pale imitation of all that went before. I marked this as having spoilers but the real spoiler was going to see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The worst of the Bourne saga.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, no disrespect to anyone, but I may be the number 1 fan of Jason Bourne. As soon as the movie was out in Spain, I was there to watch it. I knew it would be difficult to re-ignite the saga and to find a reason to make Bourne come out of retirement. And that's the thing, everything feels a little forced at the beginning of the movie. Bourne lives completely isolated of the world while doing bare knuckle fights. While this is not an ideal way of life for such a unique agent, the truth is, there's absolutely no need for him to stick his head out, and get involved in more trouble. His pre Bourne girlfriend thinks otherwise and hunts him down, and puts him back in the spotlight. What we see once the action starts is the spitting image of the last 3 movies. A man and a woman in office who don't even trust each other but are engaged in a super important mission, while trying to get Bourne out the way. But hold on! Bourne was not even interested in being there. Let him rest, honestly. The guy deserves to relax for once in his life. No more Bournes. They are not needed. The first 3 were enough. This doesn't add anything to the saga.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bourne Is Back</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not a bad movie at all. Better than I was expecting considering the way the YouTube reviewers are chastising the acting in this movie. The acting was really no different than in any other Bourne movie, in my opinion. Plot was a little thin but enjoyable. Honestly, this lives up to the other Bourne movies in that it's great just not excellent.Final Grade: A- Number Grade: 8.9/10Plot: 8/10 (Great) You can tell that this was not based on any of the Bourne books, and in a way that is its one tragedy. They tried to update everything with computer hackers and such, which worked but also didn't. Paul Greengrass and Christopher Rousse did a decent job, however, and you could almost think they might have gotten a look at Ludlum's notes for Bourne and just went with it. Not a terrible job in the least.Character Development: 9/10 (Excellent) It was good getting a bit more backstory to Bourne and what turned him into the Treadstone operative he became. We got to see (a little bit) of what Nicky Parsons has been up to since the end of Bourne Ultimatum. And we also got introduced to the new head of the CIA, who is running a brand new operation based off of Treadstone, so you know how that's going to go.Direction: 9/10 (Excellent) Paul Greengrass is really a great director for Bourne. My favorite Bourne film by him is The Bourne Supremacy, and this is my second favorite. Bourne Ultimatum is third because they really tried to tie things up too quickly in that movie. But here, as writer and director, he had a solid idea of what he wanted to do and did it very well.Casting: 9/10 (Excellent) Great casting, as always. Matt Damon, Tommy Lee Jones, and Alicia Vikander were perfect, though you can really see age creeping up on Mr. Jones. Vincent Cassel was great, too, in his role. The secondary characters were...okay. Nothing special about them, especially Riz Ahmed, who was really not much to the story other. But as the movie didn't completely focus on him, it was okay and his part worked for what it was.Acting: 10/10 (Perfect...for a Bourne movie) Some reviewers has complained about the acting in Jason Bourne, but honestly, no one in this movie is a Shakespearian actor. They did fine with what they had, giving the best performance they can give to the characters they had. Matt Damon was never very lively as Bourne anyway.Cinematography: 10/10 (Perfect) Visually pleasing with far less shaky cam than normal--either that, or I'm finally getting used to it. There were some points that it was distracting but not enough to count off for. As dark and bright as both Bourne movies, as as usually, you might want to take sunglasses for when it cuts from a dark scene to a bright scene.Music: 9/10 (Excellent) Typical Bourne fare for music, including Moby at the end with yet another version of his song "Extreme Ways." I wonder if he'll ever get tired of remixing that song?Pacing: 9/10 (Excellent) Only looked at my watch once during the movie about an hour in. After that, pretty much had to fasten my seat belt.Sets and Costumes: 8/10 (Great) Nothing too special. Locations were great, clothes worked for the characters--again, typical Bourne fare.Re-watchability: 8/10 (Great) I may not see Jason Bourne again in theaters, but I definitely will pick it up on digital when it becomes available. Great movie all around that I will enjoy watching again when I watch the other Bourne movies.I recommend going to see Jason Bourne at least once if you're a Bourne fan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>movie was solid. FELT like a Bourne movie. some sequels don't have that same vibe as the originals... not this movie. Matt Damon hasn't got too old or doughy faced to play a believable Bourne...he's still got it!!Solid acting (except one... Ill get there) Solid Direction, Non Cheesy lines, and only a few minor complaints. SOLID ACTING. 10/10 on casting and line delivery except 1 actor.Julia Stiles botched her 4 lines in this movie. Julia, baby, what happened? SOLID DIRECTION.Paul Greengrass was BORN to Direct BOURNE movies.NON CHEESY LINESdidn't feel like all the spy movie rip offs we've got since the first Bourne movie. Not too much tech or government jargon ( Tony Gilroy) Not much wink wink nod nod we know the audience wants us to say this. It was solid. MINOR COMPLAINTS 1) Julia Stiles is on the run from the CIA. She knows they know what she looks like, and how they plan on catching her with spy cameras and face detection and just plain looking through binoculars and "oh hey there she is!"does she make any attempt to blend in? disguise herself? NOPE... long flowing blonde hair, dressed like an American college chick touring Europe. Julia at least wear a hoodie and fake mustache2) They referenced SNOWDEN and it kind of broke the 4th wall for me. because Snowden lives in a world that Matt Damon lives in. and they two worlds just collided in my mind and took me out of the moment. I dunno its just odd when movies do that. 3) Indian Mark Zuckerberg's subplot had no place in this story other than an excuse to get us to Las Vegas.4) How is the bad guy not British? The guy looks like he plays polo with the queen every Tuesday5) Tommy Lee Jones' face... it looks like when you pull a thing of silly putty too far a part and it just droops there THE AWESOME1) Alicia Vikander... she was awesome! 2) Amazing opening sequence, Amazing car chase, Amazing end fight3) End of the movie where Bourne pulls a fast one and EXTREME WAYS BY MOBY WAYS AND OMG HE GOT ME AGAIN!!!!!OVERALLIf you liked Bourne 1,2,3 you will LOVE this movie.

		<fullReview>Don't listen to Old Fart reviews from other sites. Real Rating for a genre that is difficult to master these days is between 7.5 - 8.5 depending if you've seen the first ones or not. There are no slow moments in the movie and expensive action scenes are well captured on film without to much shaky cam even though there's still some.You will enjoy it even if you are not a spy movie fan. Giving a movie like this a 5.0 like some of the critics did is extremely irresponsible and causes studios to lose money specially when the movie hits all the good points of story telling . Matt did a good job and so did the supporting cast. As far as spy movies go this one is probably the best ones in many years having said that its difficult to give a movie in this genre and with this much back story a 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still fresh, still thrilling and now even with unexpected twists</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After reading reviews perceiving 'problems,' I felt compelled to provide mine--in part to rebut how some consider the series to be somehow tired--somehow no longer true to the original trilogy. While a few points are partially valid, they take away little from the movie. (If you do not want to read potential spoilers, STOP reading.)First off, we get the same rush from the first 3 movies; the spirit is the same and now there are some finer and unexpected twists we don't see coming.To address some detractor's points: some believe this "rehashed" the first 3 and the character development seems lacking in spots. Nowhere does Bourne unnecessarily "rehash" nor take time away from its development; rather it uses flashbacks to reveal both an unexpected element not even hinted at before and then uses them to springboard us toward a new revelation: Bourne's father selected him for the CIA to surveil him to gauge his possible use to the program. While a few may argue "why wasn't his father mentioned before now?" The movie nor series provides no clue. However, hearing Bourne's father state "I made a mistake" blows the false assumption that Bourne willingly volunteered sky high--so now we the audience discover this the same time Bourne does--which proves masterful. This also reveals to both us and Bourne that someone assassinated his father--and it was NO accident. This now reaches back to likely the same assassin that knocked off the Treadstone director, although up to now, that didn't seem a loose end. We now discover this asset got captured and tortured in Syria and now he seeks Bourne's head! Another skillful move showing yet again the writing comes off as fresh and still surprises us. For the character development (or lack), a weak point is Tommy Lee Jones as Ironhand's director: he is as crooked as the last two, but we don't see the full picture; he has his "s.o.b." moments, and him attempting to convince Bourne to "come in" certainly felt flat, BUT he does play his role competently but not as crisply as his predecessors. A few think Vikander's character attempts to recreate Pam Landy's, which is completely false: Vikander's is totally unique in the sense she shows ambition for something other than trying to get Bourne off--and you can't quite put your finger on it, either. They use Vikander for the ultimate ending twist of thinking she's one-upped Bourne--only to find Bourne (the master of surveillance) one ups her! Anyone thinking she is replacing Landy isn't seeing how she's trying to manipulate both the situation and Bourne to her own advantage--something Landy NEVER did in 2 installments. Probably the one element no one mentioned nor seemed to discuss that did seem underdeveloped or slightly questionable was Nicky Parson's hacking with someone to uncover further black ops programs that we thought ceased completely with Ultimatum: while she thinks Bourne "should want the same thing" on exposing the programs, it's always been clear poor Jason only wants peace and to find a way to have a quiet life off the grid. Sadly though, it's precisely this poor assumption that lands Bourne in hot water with the agency and starts this whole movie on its trajectory. So the fact such an unnecessary consequence exists should rightly bother some critics, while it rids us of Parsons (who obviously was never going to survive on her own without help and earns her offing quite well for her stupidity) proves useful although it does make the audience ask the obvious question "if Parsons revealed she was Jason's lover or girlfriend in Ultimatum, how does the movie show she revealed that to him and how did that change his existence?" On that, we have no clue and it indeed appears to be a significant dropped ball. For those things, certainly -1 star.That said, the movie shines in the action, chase and fight sequences in that Bourne in typical fashion kicks everyone's tail and we love seeing him do it (talk about a guilty pleasure for a poor guy that doesn't want to be chased and pushed). It's also part serious while part comic relief to see these clueless CIA guys send team after team after Bourne who of course still handily wipes the floor up with the lot of them. It does make one question "why do they bother when they know Bourne is the best and even if you get the drop on him...he always survives???" He also finally deals his father's assassin a proper death, sealing off one more CIA "asset" that just couldn't manage to off Jason--and it's both a relief and satisfying end to that jerk who finally gets his just desserts by seeking to avenge himself on Bourne. NO DICE BUDDY--and now you're dead too! LOL!The verdict? Yes, Jones didn't deliver the same quality acting seen in "The Fugitive," but he fills his role. Vikander proves the interesting wildcard, given she lives to try to down Bourne again-- although Bourne discovered her true play and will be doubly careful if he ever crosses paths with her again. Parsons dies (as we expect, really...she's kind of a dead weight), but we remain unclear why nothing was done with her revealing she was Jason's former girlfriend and they were VERY close. We get treated to the unexpected uncovering of Bourne's father having insinuated Jason into the whole sorry business and the movie throws us the additional curveball of the Identity assassin that shot Conklin dead to be trying to off Bourne. We get the thrill ride of the Vegas chase and the typical closing fight scene with a major baddie (who Jason kills like we expect), and Bourne wallops us by upending Vikander's game to promote herself (although she thinks Bourne's a bumpkin)--and even leaves us laughing with his ingenuity. We're left with a promising future installment and obviously with a Bourne that's still master of everything. Nine stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Cerebral Spy Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jason Bourne AKA David Webb is in my opinion cinema's greatest spy. His skills in badassery have graced our screen for 14 years and his tortured soul has proved the ultimate thing to dissect on the screen. There's such a thing as the "Bourne formula" which all the movies have followed since The Bourne Identity in 2002. With Jason Bourne, the franchise has returned to that formula that was lost in The Bourne Legacy and created undoubtedly one of the best action movies of 2016.Matt Damon and Paul Greengrass return for the fifth installment of the franchise and bring back their chemistry that made Supremacy and Ultimatum such great movies. Damon brings a different physicality to the role that he didn't have in previous installments and barely talks throughout the movie (only uttering 30 lines in total). This works in an unexpected way and makes Damon's emotions and choreography stand out much more.Almost a decade after exposing Blackbriar, Jason Bourne is back with most of his memories intact. Nicky Parsons (Julia Stiles) is back and enlists Bourne's help in leaking classified files that the CIA predicts could be a leak "worse than Snowden". This is where the movie turns into a highly cerebral game of cat and mouse, taking us from Athens to London to Las Vegas. Greengrass and his cinematographer Barry Ackroyd do a fantastic job of making the audience feel as though they are there and his signature "shaky cam" really brings a level of authenticity to the action that leaves you digging your nails into your seats.Over the years I've learned that I like movies that take their time and develop the story in a natural, organic way. Sadly, many audiences don't have that sort of attention and these sort of movies are not given a proper chance. However, Jason Bourne does this beautifully as screenwriter Christopher Rouse builds tension minute- by-minute until the full-throttled third act that features some jaw dropping practical effects.The new cast does a fantastic job of incorporating themselves in the world of Bourne. Vincent Cassell is fantastic as the "Asset" never being named but leaving a big mark on the film. His motivations are understandable and he's without a doubt one of the toughest enemies Bourne has had to face. Alicia Vikander is surprising as Heather Lee, an analyst who has high ambitions and crosses over the line of ally and enemy many times throughout the movie. It takes a special actor to steal scenes from Matt Damon and Vikander is one of those actors.Finally, it's worth mentioning Riz Ahmed and Tommy Lee Jones in the same breath as they play small but integral parts, playing off each other very well and sharing animosity for each other and executing their plans in different and unique ways. Ahmed is a huge talent, breaking through 2 years ago with the stunning Nightcrawler and he does a great job with a smaller role.Jason Bourne is sure to be loved by all Bourne fans. It's intelligent, bursting with social commentary and features some thrilling action sequences. Greengrass once again comments on the times with the movie focusing on the importance of privacy and how intelligence officers sometimes abuse their power beyond comprehension. Damon is fantastic, returning to a character 9 years after his last time and jumps right back in the role, giving arguably his most physical performance to date.After all the visually oriented movies of the summer and the superhero movies, realism is a breath of fresh air. Jason Bourne is as close as it gets to portraying real-life espionage. The action isn't done in a second. People don't die and come back. In the world of Bourne, it's a no prisoner sort of worldview and that's refreshing in a world with happy endings. Jason Bourne's ending is one that the franchise could easily end with and leave the fans happy. But if they decide to make another movie there's so much that they can dive into. As we've learned from Damon and Greengrass never say never, and if the series keeps putting out great movies why the hell should they stop.http://getreelmovies.com/jason-bourne-return-of-the-real-spy/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bourne series continues</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Got complimentary passes to see the latest (fifth) installment of the Jason Bourne series. Have to admit - I was typically expecting some new twist and unusual additions to the story plot and I was not disappointed. On the story side they did add a new little nibble regarding Jason's background, on the action side they removed one of my favorite characters, who had been around for a while. On the action sequence, they were all very well done, adding a higher element of expansive depth, split second snap judgment calls, and of course edge of the seat gripping inducement. Jason manages to get around all over the globe, but the locales are quickly done and over with. Jason Bourne as usual finds a sympathetic ear in almost every flick, so no surprises here. Tommy lee Jones is still good at portraying the ruthless/conniving character of a CIA black ops director. They added a Silicon valley angle, but that was weak at best. One or two subplots were left completely unexplained or incomplete as best (maybe it ended up on the cutting floor during edits) after all the film is 2 hours long! My only tinge of disappointment - Matt Damon looks a lot older! Otherwise a good enjoyable action flick!</fullReview>

I also liked the story of this film, although I don't felt it pulled me in as much as the other movies were able to. There's still a lot going on, just not as much as I would have expected. Overall however it was definitely worth the price of admission. It's a good final film, and the end wraps things up nicely.

		<fullReview>Jason Bourne is a great addition to The Bourne series. We are all familiar to the name Jason Bourne and his numerous amazing action packed journeys fighting to stay alive and get important Intel. This movie is similar to Jason's past battles but better and more action packed. Great story, multiple action scenes and exciting adventure. As an audience and follower of the Bourne movie series you will definitely feel the rush and energy this movie gives off. Perfect connection into previous Bourne movies and Jason's past encounters throughout his blurry, confusing life as a multi-million dollar human weapon. I see a great future for the Bourne movie series. A great cast and exciting story can definitely extend Jason Bourne's journey to uncover more of the long truth to his past life. I can promise the audience that every penny you spend on your admission ticket will be worth it. Jason Bourne does not disappoint. He is still kicking ass and getting answers no matter how many times they try to put him down. Bourne has pure sheer willpower and is relentless. A few years have gone by but Jason Bourne looks as if he is still in his prime and has absolutely not peeked one bit. You truly do feel for Jason as he hasn't been able to have a normal life and have someone to love without devastating, horrible death. I guess that's the life that comes with being a secret human weapon. Jason Bourne is a bad ass action packed movie with great story and endless adventure. Everything you'd like to see in a great action movie on the big screen, is one ticket away. I truly do hope for more Bourne films to come up in the near future.</fullReview>

The return of Bourne and a bit more of stress on the story. Matt Damon brought the umph back into the franchise. He doesn't miss a beat from where he left off after Ultimatum. -Negatives -They tried to make Alicia Vikander's character intriguing but ended up making her look disinterested and oddly out of place. - No more of the high octane music and action sequences - Tons of clichéd scenes. Verdict The first 3 Bourne movies are always going to be thought off as better movies than this one but its definitely going to help you forget the classlessness that Legacy brought into the series and in short it's definitely a one time watch.</fullReview>

Matt Damon is as usual, no surprise, nothing special. And until the last thirty minutes, this feature is a real sleeper, where the non stop adrenaline scenes can be even boring, with the usual silly soundtrack. But I was literally amazed by the Vincent "Terminator" Cassel's performance as the evil dude of the movie. He is absolutely awesome, impressive at the most. So, I repeat, the finale part of this film shows a terrific car chase in the streets of Las Vegas, including a SWAT armored truck, and this is one of the most impressive and devastating car chases of all times. Incredible in the good way. Unforgettable. This is maybe not the best Jason Bourne film but quite good thanks to the final chase.</fullReview>

All the hallmarks of previous series(except Legacy) are in this movie, the feeling of Europe environments, one on one fight scene, car chase sequence, CIA control room scene, public chaos, the shaky cam(I like this thing, very much!!!) and everything you remember about previous series.

		<shortDescription>A great addition to this franchise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been excited about this film ever since I heard it was happening and the new Jason bourne is a great film for bourne fans. The premise of the film sees a leak in the CIA reveal something that would interest bourne, so he comes out of hiding to get answers. Matt Damon has returned to the role of Jason bourne and he fits it effortlessly. He is fantastic in this film what he lacks in dialogue he makes up for in his expressions which show an older bourne who still doesn't fully understand himself. I thought he was still great in the action scenes and while watching this film I once again saw the character of Jason bourne. Tommy lee Jones plays the head of the CIA in this film and he is good in this film. He is exactly what you expect from his character but he definitely fits the performance well. Alicia vikander plays his second in command and I thought she was really good in this film, she gives a strong female performance which is good to see in an action film. Vincent cassell plays the asset and he does a really good job as the opposite assassin and when they clash it is great. The only performance I didn't really like was riz Ahmed because I just don't think he is that good an actor and his character just really didn't fit in this film. The revenge story in this film really worked for me and I was really invested in it. However, there is this pretty large side plot involving riz Ahmed's character and it was dull and it didn't really flow well into this movie at all. The script had some pretty good drama in it, but I do feel like it could have been raised a bit more with a bit more clever and dramatic moments and dialogue. The style is fantastic, the pace moves very quickly and it keeps you invested. The action scenes are brilliant, the chase scenes are great and even with the shaky cam the hand to hand fighting was brutal and awesome to watch. Overall this is a great instalment to this franchise and worth a watch if your a fan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best movie in the series since The Bourne Ultimatum, A Must-See</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Matt Damon is back, and better than ever in the role of Jason Bourne. Incredible thriller, with a frenetic pace and bone-crushing action in another outstanding entry in the series by brilliant director Paul Greengrass. This movie is the must-see movie of the summer, in my opinion. I had high expectations going in, and this movie not only lived up to them, but surpassed them. From car chases to fight scenes, the action is exhilarating, non-stop, and very brutal and "macho" in the film, and Matt Damon obviously put in a lot of hard work on his physique in order to get into top shape for the movie. Matt Damon was born to play this character, he is truly amazing as Jason Bourne.Other standout performances were the actors Vincent Cassel as the cold-blooded assassin, "the asset", and I especially loved the character Heather Lee (played by the wonderful Alicia Vikander). I thought she was one of the best characters in the film, besides Jason Bourne.I loved this movie, and would put this as ranked second best in the whole series, only beaten by the masterpiece, The Bourne Ultimatum.A couple minor criticisms are: there should have been a few more "quiet moments", my friend who saw it with me remarked that the music seemed to always be going and was loud throughout the film, and there weren't enough parts to catch your breath. The only other criticism is the story line is kind of simple and straightforward - not the most interesting story in the world, but it is serviceable to the great action. I can only hope this movie is the first of many sequels in the series starring Matt Damon and directed by Paul Greengrass, because these guys are an incredible team, who know how to make an outstanding action/thriller!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perhaps the Best Yet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After a nine year wait, Jason Bourne has returned to movie screens in what is perhaps the best Bourne movie of them all. Jason Bourne picks up nearly a decade after The Bourne Ultimatum, with Matt Damon's Bourne currently living in Greece as a street fighter, off of the CIA's radar. Of course it wouldn't be a Bourne movie if Bourne wasn't drawn back into the crosshairs of the CIA, only this time it's personal, when a major revelation about Bourne's past comes to light that propels Bourne on his quest for revenge. To say too much would rob this movie of the franchise's trademark twists and turns, which are all executed well by director Paul Greengrass.Once more, Damon does far more with the role than what is required. With only about two dozen lines of dialogue in the whole two hour movie, Damon has to make us feel for Bourne through his actions and facial expressions, which with a character as stoic as Bourne, is no small feat. I can't help but think that had The Bourne Identity director, Doug Liman, cast a lesser actor as Bourne, the franchise would have never made it this far. Joining Damon once more is Julia Stiles, as former CIA analyst turned whistleblower, Nicky Parsons, as well as newcomers to the franchise, Tommy Lee Jones and Alicia Vikander. Vikander portrays a morally questionable CIA cyber agent on the trail of Bourne, while Jones acts as the head of the CIA. I have often said that I think every movie would be better with just a little bit of Tommy Lee Jones, and that is true here as well. However, what makes Jason Bourne possibly the best Bourne movie, is the emotional motivation that drives him in this one.The first three Bourne movies were all pretty much about Bourne learning who he was by exposing what the CIA did to him, and once he did all of that, that was it. We didn't get to see what those revelations really meant for Bourne, which is what Jason Bourne does. When we first see Bourne again, he is a man adrift. He has no purpose in life and is struggling with the knowledge that he was a killer. Then Nicky comes back into his life, and with her she brings an emotional bombshell that sends Bourne into action once more. It is that emotional bombshell that makes Jason Bourne such a strong movie. It creates a basic human reason for the carnage beyond Bourne simply wanting to know who he was. Of course, while the Bourne movies have always been known for their smart storytelling, they're still action movies first and foremost, and Jason Bourne more than satisfies on that mark. From a tense motorcycle chase during a riot in Greece, all the way to a car chase on the Las Vegas strip, Jason Bourne is an adrenaline-fueled thrill ride. While I think the final fight between Bourne and the bad guy is a little lackluster compared to some of the great fight scenes in previous Bourne movies, the end result of the fight is emotionally cathartic.All in all, Jason Bourne is a movie that you must see if you are a fan of the Bourne movies. While I am not sure how well the movie will play if this is the first Bourne movie you've ever seen, Jason Bourne is such a well-crafted spy thriller that I think just about anyone interested in this type of movie will feel rewarded.I give Jason Bourne a 9 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jason is "Bourne," again.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some movies promise a lot in their trailers. Only to wind up like unemployed postal carriers: failing to deliver.This is not the case with JASON BOURNE. Like BOURNE'S LEGACY (the interim flick that starred Jeremy "Ghost Protocol" Renner), it was not loosely based on any of the books written by Robert Ludlum. It was written and produced directly for the silver screen. And, apparently inspired by the real-life scandal involving the NSA's illegal phone tapping. For all those were afraid that Matt Damon's character had, indeed, really drowned in the Hudson River at the end of BOURNE'S ULTIMATUM? Fear not. He has now resurfaced somewhere near the Greco-Albanian border, where he makes a meager living as a bare-knuckle brawler. Re-enter Nicolette Parsons.A past romance between them was strongly hinted at, in B.U. And, evidently wishing to rekindle that, she has done some computer-hacking of the CIA. But, she's not as stealthy as she had hoped. And, thus, a new cat-and-mouse game begins. Only this one involves a secret surrounding the long-lost father of David Webb (Bourne's true name). And when the memory of that secret finally becomes too painful to repress through hysterical amnesia?Wow!!!!!STAR TREK BEYOND blew GHOSTBUSTERS III out of the water (and deservedly so). Will this film due to the same to the former? Well, like Jason Bourne with a sniper rifle,......it will take its best shot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think, for the first time, in a Bourne movie, I was bored. Tired too, but that could just be the crappy 3D. In a movie that has some of my fav actors, not including Damon and Vikander, I kinda spaced out. And yeah, the pathetic 3D conversion, it was baaaaaadddd. For my money, I preferred the Damon-less/Bourne-less 'Bourne Legacy' to this, though I am in a minority there.I'm still holding out hope for a crossover of sorts, with Damon/Renner/Norton/Vikander duking it out in the next one.Cassel and Jones were good, as was Vikander. One of the accusations leveled against the Marc Forster helmed Bond movie, Quantum of solace, was that it felt more like Bourne than like Bond. Well, I'd say something different here. With the number of lives Jason Bourne has, from all of the set-pieces in this one, especially the last one, I think this is not a Bourne movie, but a Bond movie.I did not like the 1st one in the series, at the time (have since revised that impression) since I was a fan of the Ludlum novels, which themselves became derivative after a while. To be fair though, this does progress the plot, and there is an important consequence to a few of the main characters involved. Treadstone. Blackbriar. LARX-3. Now, Ironhand.I did not mind Cassel's casting, but his characterization did leave a lot to be desired. And it did not help that (not his fault - he's a fantastic actor) he does not hold a light to similar characters played by Edgar Ramirez (Ultimatum - perhaps the best characterization of a fellow assassin), Karl Urban (and even Marton Csokas) and yep, Clive Owen (from the 1st one). Not to miss mentioning Louis Ozawa Changchien, from 'Legacy', who was effective in just 2 fantastic sequences.Have a whole laundry list of items that could have been fixed by better writing, imho: Why's Joan Allen's character done away with? What about the CIA leadership from Gilroy's 'Legacy' (its OK that they did not wanna have Renner, but box office retns for that ain't everything - some continuity is expected). One of the most effective villains from Gilroy's Legacy, Edward Norton (not to mention Scott Glenn and Stacy Keach) - transferred within the CIA? Did they absolutely have to cast Vikander, at the cost of these existing characters, who do not even have a sit-down presence in a meeting room? Disappointing. * Why daddy issues? Has to be the weakest plot device yet. Thought these were better than using what was available easily. I get the angst they were gonna go for, but having him continue to face his demons (Franka Potente etc.) would have sufficed. Bourne 6 is sure to go for his mom now....I did think there was hope, especially initially, when they tried showing Bourne being affected by the ravages of age, showed him weak, showed him bleeding, and all that, but that was probably a moment that was subsequently unrealized over the rest of the movie. Him being vulnerable is never gonna happen. With this, they have proved, that Bourne is a Bond/Terminator combination. Nothing's gonna happen to him, and while its good for us to be in his corner always, that also kinda robs the movie of its need to be a thriller that hides something unpredictable at each turn. And that makes for a bad thriller, even in the mainstream milieu. And I'm not asking for another 'Nightcrawler'.My preferred order in the Bourne movie universe now reads thus - Ultimatum, Legacy (yep!), Identity, Supremacy and now.....this.....sad.....Watch 1nce, just for its curiosity value, preferably on 2D, and yes, on the big screen only.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Formulaic By The Numbers Affair</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I feel like I've seen this movie several times before. I know, it's a summer popcorn flick so that should be okay. Except it was actually kind of boring for a routine action movie. The acting was poor, with characters falling in and out of their accents, and some painfully mailed in scenes. The action suffered from being just plain silly - like the car chase scene, to outright painful - I'm looking at you shaky camera. I would have loved to see the final battle scene, but between the shaky camera and jump cuts, I found myself just wishing for it to end.I admit I didn't have high expectations for this film, but a summer action flick should deliver enough to keep your attention while suspending your disbelief. Instead, I mostly just kept wondering how much longer it would be until it would end. This one goes onto the heap of the endless pablum of sequels, prequels and reboots thrown at the contemporary movie goer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>worth a watch, but leaves you wondering</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't remember being so eager to see a film in a long time! As it turns out, I ended up seeing this film twice in three days (as a birthday treat from my children!) which was great! I found the film very entertaining, however was left scratching my head at the end wondering what I had just watched. The story line was very weak compared to the previous films and although I am a great fan of Greengrass - found the over use of hand held cameras very annoying and really frustrating at times. There is no doubt Matt Damon carries this film. Julia Stiles is disappointing, Alicia Vikander totally unbelievable and Tommy Lee Jones (although a great actor) didn't get the best of lines. So, if you're a Bourne fan - it is worth a look, but probably not twice like I did :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bourne the Unpredictable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A lot of critics criticize this fifth entry into the Bourne universe, I can't see the logic for it, I think it is not the actual movie the problem it's the way that has been edit it. If you can take a note from the trailer how some of the scenes were left on the cutting room floor. In the theatrical movie those scenes are very short and you can barely see what is going on only the ending of last action is present. However tho movie is enjoyable it has moments were the pacing slows down a bit it is less fast pace s the previous movies from the trilogy. It has the longest and best car chase out of all Bourne movies so far. I was hoping they will improve the hand to hand combat but that is lacking because this time they use boxing instead of Kali fighting method. It is still pretty good but it is not as highly excessive in violence as there other predecursors.I think for that we have to blame AAMP rating board trying to dumb down the violence. I hope there is an extended do directors cut somewere to be put on Blu ray if we the fans petition for it. I guess I haven't seen any directors cut from the previous movies so I debt it. This Bourne entry can improve on the next one if there is going to be any, there is always room for other assets to join the club. Jason Bourn is better than Bourne legacy in every way it stand out in every way, I don't think Tony Gilroy can out to Green Grass in directing not naysayers who critics or movie goers are criticizing the camera work by Greengrass, But he is the maestro that know how to create adrenalin pumping when it come to action. The reason why Bourn Ultimatum is because the creative team were joined forces between Gilroy and Greengrass, the writer and the director. Now we see that both sides can't create mega blockbuster. Because they went their own ways, made their own movies without interfering their ideas that leads to a clash. They have to realise is lacking in their talent to makes a masterpiece, The only way to accomplish that is join forces. The same formula was not applied in the Taken series between Luc Besson, and Pierre Morel Their creative talent was not as good as was in collaboration, it is pretty clear the follow ups of Taken weren't as good as the first Taken movie. Filmmakers need to learn their mistakes from them self's there is nothing powerful as in collaboration. To accomplish prosperity you need uniting, and that is the principle of the Universe, Unite with love and prosperity not divide and conqueror with animosity. "Some people who want to be great need to serve others, by serving self it will fail into despair and chaos". Now they have to shake hands and sit together if they want to make the next movie to be the Quintessential in the Bourn Universe that is going to incorporate the story that falls the crossing between Jason Bourne and Alan Cross. Other ways will not work. Until that doesn't happen we would never ever see anything or even better then Bourne Ultimatum. For me Bourn Ultimatum is easy 8 out of 10 Bourne Supremacy is 7.8 out of 10 Bourne Identity is 7.9 out of 10 I give this movie 7.5 out of 10, only for the car chase.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The reviews are so unjust, I made a IMDb account just so I could write my first review on here.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been reading the reviews on this site for a while and have seen many movies over the years. But for the first time I feel the critics and reviews for a movie have completely missed the mark. As a fan of the original trilogy I was excited to hear that Damon and Greengrass were returning for a another film in this series. Before going to the theatre, I decided to check the reviews. After which, I tentatively went there on opening day, wondering if it would be the right choice. Glad to say it was: the movie was fantastic! I will start with what I loved about this movie. Just like Damon promised, "It brings Bourne into post Snowden world." Because of this you will notice the technology used by NSA is MUCH better than the previous movies which makes the movie much more entertaining. In the original trilogy Bourne completely overpowered them in realistic ways some of time and sometimes unrealistic ways. Whereas this one is much more evenly matched and realistic; you genuinely don't know which side will win throughout the movie. This brings out the best and smartest Bourne we have seen on screen and leaves you on the edge of your seat in ways other action movies can only dream of. The hit-man on Bourne is also a step above than the previous hit-men; unlike the original trilogy's, this guy actually has a purpose other than a order from his boss. He is also more talented than the previous ones as he actually has some victories against Bourne. This adds fuel to their final confrontation which turns into something much more than a fight. Because of the elements I just mentioned the action and the story are greatly enhanced. The ending is so Bourne like. The original trilogy gave Bourne a great purpose that gave meaning to all his actions. This movie is a whole new chapter and Bournes purpose behind each action is on par or even better than the trilogy's. Now what I think could have been better. The original trilogy had a fantastic score and I think they should have left it completely unchanged: It was already perfect. This movie uses the same score but they have changed it a little for each song. You would think this wouldn't have a big effect but it does, because for three movies we had the same music and quality of sound editing. It was so good that it could be used again and again in three straight movies and audience still loved it. That score made every action scene an high energy adrenaline rush. As a result the action scenes are still good in this movie but not as good as they would have been had they left the score unchanged. If you disagree that the tiny tweaks to the score would have a big effect look how the score and sound effects enhance this scene dramatically (make sure to see the whole scene or else you won't see what I'm talking about) https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=7SpZ70T1j9U In the new movie, they have a similar score but not the same score like they added parts to that score. Don't fix what ain't broke. Other than the sound editing this movie was better in every regard to the original trilogy. But keep in mind sound editing is a huge part of any film. I walked out of the theatre thinking this is definitely the best movie of the year by far. And best action spy movie since Bourne Ultimatum. Definitely a theatre watch.Solid 9 out 10 (would give 10 if they had used the same score and sound editing).</fullReview>

The action scenes are all good and natural, all of the actors performed very good especially Matt, Julia &amp; Alicia.

		<shortDescription>Bourne Is Back!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Extreme Ways truly are back again. "Jason Bourne", to me is a fantastic movie that is being way too harshly criticized by Film Critics. I consider myself in the middle. I'm both a film critic, and an average film-goer. I love my deep thinking stuff, but I also love my mindless action movies, This film, to my surprise, was to me, both of those things. The 1st and 3rd act are big on the action, while the 2nd act is a bit more focused on the story aspect. Now one of the biggest complaints I keep hearing from critics, is that the story isn't very compelling. I couldn't disagree more. I was on the edge of my seat, listening to every line of dialogue intently, because they went deeper this time around. The story didn't focus SO much on Bourne's character...they went in a couple different directions and explored different side stories that still remained relevant to the story. The action is absolutely enthralling. Just as Greengrass' well- choreographed hand-held-cam technique takes over the action, so Matt Damon's fierce performance as Jason Bourne fires up the screen. He doesn't have much to say, but to me that's not necessary for this story. It's a bit more personal. The Vegas Chase in this film is so exciting, there's some of the classic hand-to-hand knockouts from Bourne that we all know and love, and this film has my favorite fight scene of the whole series. It's personal, intense, exciting, and the most fierce fight scene yet. I'd be surprised if they top this fight in the next film. Critics have been saying this is "shallow", "mindless action"... To me, that's so far from the truth. They went deeper than ever before. Even Vincent Cassel who rivals Bourne as an assassin known only as "The Asset" tracks him, you find out that even with that aspect of the film, there's a more personal touch to their relationship. There's a reason they cross paths. As far as the performances, I thought everyone was fantastic. No complaints. Alicia Vikander plays a new character, Heather Lee, and she was one of the most interesting characters to watch. And of course, Tommy Lee Jones is terrific as he is in everything he does. As stated before, the 1st and 3rd act are mostly action, however there still is a little action sprinkled out through the 2nd act, which I found very nice. ~ In conclusion, "Jason Bourne" takes the franchise in a bit of a different direction, but it makes sense with the time that we live in. We live in an age dominated by technology and fear of Government. And "Jason Bourne" explores that aspect. As well, Jason deals with probably the most personal memory issue he's ever dealt with. It's an extremely personal memory, and at times, a heart- wrenching piece of the story that gives Bourne even more reason to come out of hiding. They could've just made this an all action blockbuster, but to their credit they don't. They stick with what makes the Bourne franchise so popular...great action, and great story. Everything comes together in a perfect mold of action, drama, thrills, and suspense, that leaves you questioning...and most of all, yearning for Jason Bourne to make another appearance coming out of the shadows of his hiding place, as soon as possible.</fullReview>

I am NOT professional critic.That said, I don't hate this movie.Jason Bourne is essentially a Bourne movie thrust into a Post-Snowden/Post--Obama timeframe.Matty once again brings it as Jason Bourne, Alicia Vikander is bearable and Tommy Lee Jones and Vincet Cassel add talent.Essentially, Julia Styles' Nikki sets up an intriguing plot point, that is until Paul Greengrass says "Hey!!!!! Here's what's relevant right now!!!!", and pivots to a Post-Snowden story line.This movie is good but yet it's almost as if Paul has yet again made another decent film, despite himself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605; - The Bourne Unnecessary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I might be the only person in the world who isn't a Bourne fan. Ultimatum was good, but I never got engaged with his character, despite a promising set up. So after the completion of the trilogy, I wasn't expecting any more!Admittedly I went into this with pretty high expectations - I respect Damon and Greengrass and thought they would only bring out another Bourne if they knew it would be something special. I'm not convinced the end product was what they were hoping for. Damon is back as broody as ever (no mention of the pointless Legacy), and again feels like a man without an ounce of happiness. He'd managed to hide undetected in the shadows for so long that his resurfacing felt bizarrely underwhelming and unnecessary - why did he let himself get exposed? Still, Damon does a decent job of supplying depth, sympathy, reverence and mystery to the role.The true star, for me, though is Alicia Vikander, who seems to steal the show in more or less every movie she appears in (especially Ex Machina and The Danish Girl). Her character has more complexity than all the others combined, almost to the point where it starts to get confusing which side of the fence she's on. Still, she's likable, mysterious and smart - a good combination well executed. Jones always plays his roles perfectly too - he just knows how to deliver a line with the right tone and emphasis, even if his character is pretty thin. Everyone else though is forgettable, including Cassel's big angry baddie.But Bourne is all about one thing - great action - and this one didn't disappoint there. There are some pretty intense chase sequences (the Athens scene is decent, which I managed to enjoy twice having walked into the wrong screening - oops!), and again the really close hand-to-hand fights are captivating. For me though, some of Rouse's insanely quick camera editing and Ackroyd's over-the-top shaky cam did spoil it slightly in places. The Vegas car chase is one of the best action scenes this year, but because the camera cuts so quickly it's hard to see exactly what's happening.The disappointing thing though was the story. Something special needed to happen to bring Bourne back, and the surveillance plot has been used a lot recently in action movies. It's a fairly predictable story, but the decent action kept me engaged to the end. I still can't help thinking they should have left it at a trilogy though.3/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, I want to say I am not a huge fan of bourne series but I like Matt Damon's acting, That's why I am here to make the review for this film. I am also not an action lover so if any action movie makes 5or 6 star from me, that is a very good number for the movie. I judged this movie like this and this movie makes a good number. No wonder this is one of the most anticipated movies of this year and also a huge risk for summer but it seems this movie will do well at the box office.The first Bourne movie was a sleeper hit and that's why the makers created a profitable franchise by this. This series is a suspense thriller spy movie series and undoubtedly this is a huge commercially and critically successful franchise. That's why people's expectation about the 5th movie is very high and I think it will meet the expectation. This movie is a pure action and a very good thriller. The suspense is good but after 40 minutes maybe you will lose the flow of the story and you feel a lack of continuity of the story. The screenplay could judge the story and that's why you feel something lackings. Full of action and good heavy dialogues make the movie an enjoyable thriller. There are so many twists so you can enjoy the movie and Matt Damon's outstanding screen presence makes you charmed. You will see a new Jason Bourne after a long time and you will be very surprised after seeing him. I will not reveal the story but it is a good thriller movie. Go watch it.....I promise you will not regret.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just another exercise in futility - the kind that's been sapping the life out truly interesting filmmakers for decades</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw an article somewhere titled "20 brilliant movies that didn't need a sequel". Naturally, "The Matrix" took the cake, although, personally I think all three parts were just beautiful, but that's me. There was "Saw". "The Exorcist" and others. The "Bourne" franchise wasn't there, which is a shame because after the original "Identity" all four nonsense-packed follow-ups are simply poster children for elaborate money making scheme, where proved Hollywood assets habitually flex their CGI muscles (not bothering with writing a half decent script) and actors "act" out the ridiculously labored drama. Had it been the first time, the fraud itself would be worth at least some praise -- look how we managed to bend y'all over a barrel! But it keeps happening again and again, season after season, movie after movie, TV series after TV series: there's no more investing. There's only vested interest. And because of that it's impossible to spoil a Bourne movie; you get a stack of entertaining idiocies a mile high and a list of characters who resemble the previous versions of themselves to a point of deja vu. Firstly, Bourne himself. At least James Bond changes his clothes every once in awhile, busts quips and beds different women out of civility. Bourne doesn't even do that. He is an island in the most boring sense: superfluously bleak, empty, washed-up. Then you get your Girl-helper. She's there only to fulfill a certain function, be it to give Bourne a ride or hand him a flash-drive, a phone, a key or a note. The likes of Franka Potente and Julia Stiles handle the job perfectly. Then there's the CIA man/woman -- a seasoned, yet full of doubt pro, ready to change sides whenever he/she thinks it's "the right thing to do". The villainous old fart from the said organization -- just as predictable (read: uninteresting) as Bourne himself (and not even Tommy Lee Johns' grit can save the day). And of course, "The Asset" -- sawing death to dull his pain?"Officers, Gentlemen, Messenger, Herald, Attendants" etc.If I were to ask you, which of the five Bourne films this succession came from, you'd probably have to scratch your head. And rightly so because essentially the last effort by the director Paul Greengrass has no real creative, intellectual or spiritual merit, just another exercise in futility -- the kind that's been sapping the life out truly interesting filmmakers for decades. Nothing to see here, people, just making the ends meet -- aaaand, action!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Matt Damon set to make millions off yet another promotion of gun violence all the while preaching anti-gun liberalism in America! He is the definition of HYPOCRITE and all Americans should boycott this movie! For that matter, no anti-gun activist in Hollywood should be allowed to make another movie promoting the very thing they are actively protesting!Lastly, as a Montanan I'd like to say this to Mr. Damon personally, GET OUT OF MY STATE AND TAKE YOUR LIBERAL BS WITH YOU! We don't want you in our state nor do we want your kind here!We do not want or need your money and sure don't want your progressive agenda politics here! California is big enough for you and your hypocrite friends so go back there and enjoy the crap infested culture you have helped create there!&#xfeff;</fullReview>
