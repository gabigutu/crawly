		<fullReview>Towards the end of the movie, Henry Cavill's Napoleon Solo asks, "How's THAT for entertainment?" (when teaching the movie's villain a lesson about monologuing), and my answer regarding this movie would have to echo Waverly's "very good", as this film manages to out-Bond the last two actual Bond films. While it might be the unpopular opinion, I in fact enjoyed Guy Ritchie's two Sherlock Holmes films and so decided to give this a chance, knowing nothing about the original TV series this movie was based on and going in with no preconceived notions. One thing that sets it apart from other recent spy thrillers is it staying set in the 60s time period and not being "modernised". From the opening "spy jazz" music, it sets the tone for what will be a fun ride. Ritchie's unique directing style fits perfectly with this slick/stylish film and he proves once again to have the right touch when it comes to blending humor with serious moments (one example being in the most morbidly amusing torture sequence I've seen since Bond's in Casino Royale). Whilst there are "talky" moments and occasions where the camera lingers on a shot for a solid moment, which those with impatience may grow restless during, there's also action (but not such that it's overkill) mixed with humour, some emotional beats and even the odd sexy moment. It all combines extremely well.Interestingly, as has been noted elsewhere, the main cast aren't using their own accents for their roles, with Brit Henry Cavill playing the American Napoleon Solo, American Armie Hammer playing Russian Illya Kuryakin and Swede Alicia Vikander as German Gaby Teller. Cavill, who I found dull/a bore in Man of Steel (then again, I felt that way about the film as a whole save for Antje Traue's Faora), is far better utilised as the suave/cool Solo here (which now brings the tally of cool movie characters by the name of 'Solo' to TWO - the other being...hmm, let's think...). He oozes charm, confidence, elegance - all those words that make up the definition of 'suave' - and has some great reactions. One scene I particularly liked was him just chilling, with a sandwich and bottle of vino in a truck he commandeered, as his newly assigned partner was attempting to escape some baddies in a boat. Just when you think Solo's almost heartless, he shows he's become quite attached to the Russian with anger management issues and does something nice for him (when they're not exchanging spy bugs or ramming each other through toilet stalls Casino Royale-style). As expected, they spend the majority of the film begrudgingly working alongside each other, bantering/arguing and showing each other up. Illya might be almost superhuman in strength and have the fancy fence-cutting tools, but Solo has the expertise breaking into vaults undetected...almost. Armie Hammer's better served here partnered with Cavill than he was with Depp in The Lone Ranger. The two play well off each other and have a nice fun dynamic. It also must be noted (since everyone's pointed it out regarding Tom Cruise in M:I 5) that while this film has a lot of stunts, both Cavill and Hammer took part in them, with the latter apparently giving his stunt double "hardly a chance to do anything because he's out there doing it all by himself". 2015 seems the year of the Awesome Swedes, as Alicia Vikander joins M:I 5's Rebecca Ferguson in making quite the memorable impression on screen. Apart from some rough-and-tumble with Illya, Vikander's Gaby sadly doesn't get to kick as much butt as the aforementioned Ferguson, but still proves hard to look away from when she's on screen (partly because she's dressed in eye-catching 60s fashion - which, along with the film's score/use of songs, goes a long way to creating the right 'mood' for the film - but also because she's awesome in other ways). Her character, a mechanic at the start of the film, soon finds herself in the thick of the action during a great chase scene featuring her at the wheel, with Solo in the back seat and the then unknown to them Illya in hot pursuit (a fantastic sequence, with the directing, music, acting all flowing together seamlessly...and manual window winders used for great comedic effect). Vikander has interesting/fun dynamics with Cavill and Hammer, showing some different sides to her character (one instance being in an amusing dance sequence) whilst also proving smart/helpful and that there's a bit more to her than you might first expect. This trio of characters are a large part of what makes the film as good as it is. Elizabeth Debicki plays the icy cold Victoria to the best of her ability, although there's not that much going on with her that one wouldn't already suspect. Hugh Grant and Jared Harris are both good in their small parts. Playing Gaby's Uncle Rudi, Sylvester Groth is quite memorable in his role.While in his Sherlock Holmes movies Ritchie showed us in slow detail what Sherlock was going to do to his opponents (so we could actually *see* it/make sense of it before everything sped back up and he moved in a blur), it's sort of the opposite here, where we flashback to things we might've missed, little details and such, that are later filled in for us and thus make sense. The use of split screen is also something he seems quite fond of, walking the line between being used effectively and overuse. It proves an extra flourish to an already very stylised film. I enjoyed this origin film of sorts for the team made up of our three main characters - who hopefully we'll get to see more of in a sequel, as this ended up being a pleasantly surprising addition to the spy film genre. For extra background info about the characters, as well as to learn what the acronym U.N.C.L.E. stands for, make sure to watch the stylish end credits.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a long-time fan of the original series who has watched rights disputes, and cast and director changes over the years, I viewed the pre-release publicity with high hopes and low expectations. But in the end, the film itself was a wonderful surprise! Witty, light-hearted without being a spoof and dramatic without being heavy-handed. The two main characters were updated from what was allowable in 60s television to satisfying and engaging modern versions of their original incarnations, and the attendant allies and villains were all one could want. The film was very much what the series could have been were it being done now, in the era of Game of Thrones and Mad Men. I've been twice and will be going again, as well as buying the DVD. Open Channel D; this film is more than I dared hope for!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw better than expected, I knew it would be good. But it was better than good, it was great.Very witty, sexy movie. Take the humour of Sherlock (with Robert Downey Jr. &amp; Jude law) and stick it in a bond movie- then you have The man from U.N.C.L.E. - I like bond movies, but I LOVED the man from uncle. It doesn't get boring, or drop at any point. If you've read anything negative from critics Don't listen to what critics have to say, they don't like any kind of movie if it's not based on a true story. It's certainly worth the price of admission, you'll be glad you saw it. I'm honestly hoping a second will be made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Man from UNCLE is a spy comedy that Hammers out a Cavill-cade of Hugh-gely satisfying laughs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw the previews for Guy Ritche's latest film, "The Man from UNCLE" ? a remake of the series of the same name ? I decided to approach it fresh. So I avoided watching any of the adventures of Robert Vaughn's Napoleon Solo and David McCallum's Ilya Kuryakin.I mean, to do otherwise just would not be fair, since my exposure to the original is limited to pop culture references. Why catch up to a show from decades ago only to rip apart the new one? Why give myself false nostalgia? That said, I cannot tell you whether this is a faithful recreation of the original, a tasteful homage, or perhaps a complete bastardization.However, I can say that, as a Guy Ritchie action-comedy, it works. The jabs at fictional representations of espionage are delivered with near perfect timing. Even the languishing takes meant to ridicule the tropes, stereotypes and clichés we have all come to see in every action spy thriller do not feel drawn out. All of Ritchie's trademarks are also there, from the diagetic sound that shifts to almost non-diagetic levels as the on screen action becomes a musical montage ? a music video if you will ? right down to the ubiquitous tongue in cheek, deadpan humour.While I am sure the more eagle-eyed of viewers could play a game of "spot the anachronism" (that tube frame 4x4 in the previews, for instance), I would actually fault this movie as being too period. They seem to have cherry picked all the things people imagine as from the era. The result is that the clothes are just too chic, the set pieces too on the nose.Then again, I guess that is the point: You are meant to fall in love with the aesthetics of that period as interpreted by Oliver Scholl's production design, and as captured by John Mathieson's cinematography. The fashion, the accessories... even the cars. Especially the cars! How could any depiction of the glamour of the sixties be complete without one Jaguar E Type? Also, watch out for the cameo of a $38 million Ferrari. Even with the attention to detail "Mad Men" put into shattering any preconceived notions of the so-called swinging sixties, as well as CNN's "The Sixties" television documentary series' unflinching look at the social turmoil of those times, somehow I still wish I could have lived back then.Or at least escape into the movie universe they have created.Because in our world where terrorist groups are committing heinous acts of barbarity that would put any of UNCLE's supervillain enemies to shame, where spy thrillers like "Homeland" had to up the ante because reality is scarier than the fictional world they have created, where the James Bond 007 franchise lost its playfulness long ago and just keeps getting grittier and grittier, and where Donald Trump is the most popular US republican presidential aspirant, the Cold War and its Mutually Assured Destruction definitely seem worth pining for. I mean what is the mere threat of a few megatons of thermonuclear annihilation compared to the Donald? The movie is cast satisfyingly well enough, with Armie Hammer's Ilya Kuryakin projecting a cold lethality that may have been a bit much. Luckily, this is a bickering buddy movie, where Henry Cavill's Napoleon Solo balances things out with borderline insufferable calm smoothness. For something with a bunch of Brits speaking in American accents, I am a bit surprised they toned down Gaby Teller's accent whenever the character speaks English ? I'm sure the Swedish Alicia Vikander could lay an affectation of an East Berliner real thick.In all, "The Man from UNCLE" is an enjoyable comedy and an escapist fare which just happens to be seemingly set in our past. I even rank it as a solid tale of espionage, with the end reminding me of Roger Moore as Bond, yelling to General Gogol, "That's détente comrade. I don't have it. You don't have it."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Remembering the TV show, just barely, I remember I liked Illya a little better than Napoleon. That hasn't changed in this far better version. This movie is a joy and I either smiled or laughed through the whole thing. There is no way they're not making a sequel.Guy Ritchie's direction is assured and far more clever and entertaining than his current rivals. And his eye for casting, assuming it was his doing, is impeccable. I particularly appreciated Alicia Vikander who was dreamy enough in Ex Machina. Here she does a little dance in one scene that went indelibly into my do not erase memory.Cavill and Hammer make an unexpectedly good team. And though I was a little partial to Hammer's performance, Cavill has a flair for comedy that I haven't known about. Oddly enough, Hugh Grant who appears briefly, is a proved asset but seems a little out of place.All in all though this is a fun movie and not to be missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Combination of Action and Banter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw a sneak preview of this movie and I have to say I thoroughly enjoyed it. I will have to preface this review by saying that I have not seen the original show, so I can't say whether this paid appropriate homage to the original, or if it is a bastardization.The opening sequence chase scene featured heavily in the previews, but surprisingly the trailer did not ruin the scene. It actually came across even more crisp and clever in the theater and was a great beginning for the movie. It perfectly sets the tone of the two spy characters and establishes their respectful rivalry.The movie isn't wall-to-wall action, but there are enough action scenes to keep the pace lively. There is also a second chase scene towards the end of the movie that is perhaps even better than the opening scene's chase.I think the real strength of the movie is the comedic element. The banter is quite snappy and a few of the lines I couldn't hear because of the laughter filling the theater. In particular Henry Cavill delivered as the slick cool spy Solo.Armie Hammer also delivered as the Russian counterpart, Illya. In many ways he plays the straight man to Cavill's comedian, which is actually the harder part to play. It was also apparently the harder part to direct and/or film since a few of his scenes came across as a bit clichéd.The third part of the group is Gaby, played by Alicia Vikander. The part she played is the most uneven of the group. To an extent it seemed like they couldn't quite figure out her role, so she ended up being a bit of a third wheel. That being said, she didn't detract from the movie, and serves as another foil for the two main characters.As long as I'm mentioning actors/actresses, I have to say that Hugh Grant did a superb job in a relatively minor role. Also Elizabeth Debicki did an excellent job as the female villain.Since this is a period piece, I think it's important to point out that they went through a lot of effort to get things right. Fortunately for me, they did such a good job that it, that it didn't feel like I was being beaten over the head with the 60's. There were a number of iconic outfits, but overall it was subtle enough that I wasn't jarred out of the movie, which says a lot about the great job they did.Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, and would recommend it for anyone who enjoys spy movies, or action/comedies. Also, if you've seen the trailer and thought it showed promise, then you should definitely see the movie, because the trailer doesn't show all (or even most) of the good parts, but gives a good sampling.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a fan of the original TV show and also a fan of Henry Cavill and Guy Ritchie. I have been looking forward to this movie for quite some time and am pleased to report that it was as good as I had hoped it would be.I prefer being entertained at the cinema rather than being shocked. I like leaving the theater refreshed rather than depressed. This movie was perfect for me. It was fun and witty. There was no inappropriate language or gratuitous sex (only what you see in the trailer). The only disturbing (very brief) scene helped establish the villains as evil and fanatic. This movie pays homage to the decade of my youth and brought back memories of the history and style of the times but will still be enjoyable to the younger audience who are not familiar with said history, style, or TV show.I think Henry Cavill is a talented actor, and I found his performance excellent. It was his job to establish Napoleon Solo as a suave and lighthearted cad who is nevertheless an intelligent and capable crook turned CIA agent. He got the job done! This movie certainly shows he can play a variety of roles. Armie Hammer is so funny in "Mirror, Mirror" that his performance as a dedicated and austere career spy was a delightful surprise. Hugh Grant and his brand of humor really added to the movie. Alisha and Elizabeth are great in their roles and play them with relish.I loved the retro spy gadgets. Certainly enough action to satisfy me. Too many funny scenes to name them all or without spoiling. Just go watch the movie and see for yourself. Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into the movie for my birthday, being a young woman my twin and I were initially attracted by the 2 leading male actors who were captivating &amp; handsome- but is that enough to make a movie watchable to a certain degree? No. But this movie beat my expectations. I had already read some online reviews by critics but to be honest I don't know what movie they had went to see since the reviews were overwhelmingly negative but it couldn't have been 'The Man From U.N.C.L.E.'. It was a witty, and smart movie where each actor didn't outshine one another. I personally do not trust critics since they tend to like boring movies like 'The Lincoln Lawyer' that put me to sleep. It's almost as if the movie was too witty for them &amp; the quips and snarky comments went over their daft heads and left a sour taste in their mouths.I recommend this movie to anyone if you liked the Robert Downey Jr. Sherlock movies then you will thoroughly enjoy this. My only wish is that it was a little longer but that doesn't detract from the quality of the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Man from C.O.O.L.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had heard of the 60's television show "The Man from UNCLE", but like most of us under the age of 60, never got the chance to see an episode. I know, I know, there have been countless re-runs, it just never grabbed my attention. All I could go on were the words from my wise mother who stated, "I used to watch that show when I was a kid back in the 60's. It starred.....oh what's his name.....Robert Vaughan." She couldn't remember the other actor that starred along side Vaughan but I was guessing she was just thrilled to have something from her childhood reborn into the 21st Century.Let me start by saying, this is a good movie. The star of the show is undoubtedly the director, Guy Ritchie and like most film buffs, was more curious than excited about U.N.C.L.E.'s arrival. I was curious to see what Ritchie could do with a television program that has been dead and buried for over fifty years. Was he going to modernise it for the 21st century? Was it going to be a serious take on the lighted-hearted spy genre? Who was going to be in it? I am really glad I am getting the chance to review one of Guy Ritchie's films because I am a fan. I enjoyed Sherlock Holmes and his gritty London underground films but was I going to enjoy this. He seems to be the go to director when Hollywood needs a relic dug up and brought back to life.Guy Ritchie's trademark is everywhere on this film, from the stylish sets, to the retro fashion. The catchy score, the swagger, and the witty banter, all are part of the Guy Ritchie experience. His ability to take the audience back to the 1960's was a master stroke and will keep UNCLE unique when compared to the many other spy franchises that hit our cinema screens all too often. Ritchie was able to find the right balance of subtle amusement, keeping true to the television show, without making it into an obvious comedic sketch. It was an entertaining, fun ride that engrossed the audience from start to finish with enough action to keep the doubters glued to the screen.We are introduced to the two protagonists, CIA agent, Napoleon Solo (Henry Cavill) and KGB operative, Illya Kuryakin (Armie Hammer), who team up against their wishes to foil the attempts of a mysterious organisation to produce and profit from nuclear weapons. Set to the backdrop of the Cold War, the two secret agents must rely on the daughter of a German Scientist, Gaby Teller (Alicia Vikander) to infiltrate the organisation. But is she more than just a mechanic? The three stars are evenly matched throughout the film, each getting their chance to shine in the spotlight but if there is a standout performance it would have to be Ms Vikander who dazzles in a mesmerizing array of 1960's fashion. She looks the part and plays the part perfectly of a seemingly innocent and sweet young woman tangled up in the world of espionage.Guy Ritchie has taken a gamble on his two leading men with both heavily criticised in recent big budget roles but it pays off as Cavill and Hammer look comfortable in their roles with neither outshining the other. The two agents continually strive for superiority, mimicking their own countries need for supremacy in the volatile world of the 1960's. Hammer's short tempered psychopath is perfectly balanced to the cool, slick ladies man of Cavill. Elisabeth Debicki is chilling and cold as the she-devil villain and the big goof, Hugh Grant is used to perfection by Ritchie who gives him a nice cameo. Grant adds a bit of star recognition to the film but comes across as rather likable with well timed appearances.This is a film to be enjoyed for what it is.....a fun ride. Taking it too seriously will damage the experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wasted Potential</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In The Man from U.N.C.L.E., Russian Ryan Gosling and German Jennifer Lawrence team up with Superman to save the world or something.I struggled to phrase that because the plot is never established properly. There are Neo-Nazis building a bomb? Okay, I suppose that's self-evidently threatening, but we're never told exactly what their plan is. Nor is there a clear villain, which goes a long way to explaining why the ending to this film felt so devoid of tension or significance. Not that the villains are the only ones to suffer from inadequate characterisation - we're given the "suave" American spy and his ultra-serious, literal-minded Russian partner in a reluctant marriage of convenience. The characters lack any depth - it's as if the audience is served up this partnership and told "You know how this dynamic works, just go with it - it's a recipe for great action and comedy gold, right?" Well, I can accept paper-thin characters operating within a paper-thin dynamic to serve the purposes of a movie solely focused on action, sure. But despite the promise of its brilliant opening, very little of U.N.C.L.E. is actually taken up with action. I get the feeling this was intended to be a real character piece - after all, this is the first of a new franchise, so subordinating action to character establishment would be perfectly reasonable. But as a character movie, this fails; it's not simply that the characters and their relationships lack depth - they're not particularly likable either. Henry Cavill plays Solo, supposed to be like old-school Bond - and I welcome this, especially as the actual Bond films have become very serious and dark lately. But Solo just comes across as a perfect example of what we Brits call a "wanker", with no charm whatsoever. I felt the same way towards Robert Downey Junior's portrayal of Sherlock Holmes in the films also directed by Ritchie - no charm, just know-it-all American swagger. If you consider the characters portrayed by Jason Statham in Ritchie's Lock Stock and Snatch, or Gerard Butler in RocknRolla, they have the same relentless self-confidence - but their characters are flawed and really quite dumb, which makes them endearing and human. Instead Solo is just a perfect super-agent.His Russian counterpart Illya is very much a stock character, precisely what you expect as the super-serious counterpoint to Solo's swagger. Aside from a brief mention of his childhood - basically designed to answer the question "Why does Illya like hitting people?" - his character is given little development. I'll reiterate - this would be fine if the film spent most of its time on action, but this isn't the case. Illya is also given a deliberately awkward romance. I'm not sure why this was inserted into the film except to create some combination of comedy and sexual tension. A love-triangle between Solo, Illya and Gaby would have been more interesting; this would have created more tension and also more fully integrated the story lines and characterisations of the three protagonists - as it is, the film features two effectively separate relationships (Solo-Illya and Illya-Gaby). I feel bad writing this review, because I love Guy Ritchie; Snatch and Lock Stock are two of my favourite films. U.N.C.L.E. did have some typical Guy Ritchie tropes ? great stylised action and the integration of the soundtrack is masterful as ever. I was glad to see these elements, as I felt Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes films felt too conventionally directed, lacking experimentation or inventiveness. But in U.N.C.L.E., you get the feeling Ritchie hasn't really been let off the leash, and he and the other 3 screenwriters have certainly tried to compromise between his stylised masterpieces and the requirements of the increasingly homogenised blockbuster. That's understandable - but I think the biggest disappointment of this film is its squandered potential. I'll give three examples. Setting: The opening takes place in East Germany and, along with a fantastic montage documenting the polarisation of world politics, it really sets the Cold War tone. Unfortunately, the film mostly takes place in Italy, and the Cold War is barely referenced. What a waste! If you want a Russian and an American spy in an uneasy working relationship, you could have had it in the modern day. The recent Tinker, Taylor, Soldier, Spy film did an excellent job of exploiting the Cold War setting for tension and tone - if only U.N.C.L.E. remained in Germany.Action: There's not enough of it. As discussed, the protagonists are too weak to make this a character piece. Nor does the plot contain any sort of mystery or suspense - when the agents briefed, they're told exactly what to do. They don't have to discover anything; basically they've just got to take out the generic movie doomsday device. This is acceptable if it sets up an action romp. Unfortunately, whilst the action is great whenever it does occur, the vast majority of this film is spent in what we Brits call "faffing around".Characters: Solo is meant to be a former post-war black-market profiteer serving the CIA to escape his prison sentence. Clearly there's great potential here - it would have been interesting to see Solo chafing against his superiors or employing his "maverick" qualities. But he never disobeys orders and once on his mission, his superiors largely leave him to it - and as for his unorthodox past, he never puts to use any of his unique skills or knowledge. This was the whole reason he was recruited, right? I don't see him doing much different to a regular spy. Although I guess Henry Cavill can hide gadgets or weapons or getaway vehicles inside his chin. Not terrible overall - it's just too slow, too shallow and sometimes too safe - I really think a younger, unencumbered Ritchie could have made a spy film 10 times funnier, cooler and more exciting than this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow! Did not expect this.This was one of the most boring spy movies I ever seen.The action is so slow it seems outdated for modern cinema.However the rating here suggests I missed something or masses of people actually like this numbed down piece of nothingness.Well,not nothing,it had nice set pieces but that's not enough to make a good movie.The actors had no real chemistry and the story was to dull and a lot of scenes felt really forced trying to be funny by playing the obvious east against west card.Besides that a lot of "interesting" things happen off camera which reduces the action even more so you start thinking ,who did they make this movie for?. Teens that like 60's spy series?or adults that like teen rated movies?There once was a Guy that made "lock stock"and"snatch", can't we have that Guy back.The trailer for his next flick better be of that level cos in the future i'm really gonna pass on these kids flicks.Compared to Bond or Bourne and even Hunt this really falls flat and adds nothing more to the genre than what somebody else hasn't done before this was released.I hope the next "Guy" is better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERS! Just saw this movie. Like Avengers 2, if you love bad jokes and don't have a brain you'd probably enjoy it. This movie was PACKED with bad scenes, story, small-talk and "hot- angles" of hunks and a petite girl. This movie is truly for small minded people. If there was a way to get my money back after seeing a movie I'd do that in this case. I almost left the theatre half way through (I only stayed because I payed for the junk). Even if I downloaded this movie for free on piratebay I would just stop 15 minutes into the movie and delete the file.What happened with Guy Ritchie? I love his old movies and are a big fan of even buying them to see again, but this movie? Really? It's like Apple after the death of Steve Jobs. It's just Hollywood trying to milk a dead cow.This movie is like a soft-porn where you have two hunks, where one of them wants to nail the petite teen (Alicia Vikander) but with clothes on. The other guy are nailing every other girl in the movie even if they're enemies and you're not even seeing the scenes. There are no real connection in the acting and are just "hot" people but into a movie to cash in on the publics interests of sex, without sex. It's sooooo boring. I got a bit of panic cause there are just nothing in this movie that was interesting, funny, hard-to-figure- out, or anything... It's simply 116 mins of waste of time. I'd even watch PewDiePie before this. (and trust me I hate him as well)I do not recommend you to watch this peace of junk. I guess I have to wait for The Hateful Eight to see a REAL Hollywood class movie again. All love to Tarantino so far since he and very few others still have a soul for movie-making and are not falling under the roof of milking the dead cow.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sucked. Nearly walked out half way through. Dull. Lead male and female miscast. Poorly written. I went based on this is a "Guy Ritchie" film. Unfortunately it falls flat with weak dialogue and a innocuous, cliché premise. Yes, there are a few good action scenes, but they are distractingly pasted to the first and third act in a way that really begs for a more sophisticated plot. I feel sorry for the talent... thinking they were in a "Guy Ritchie" movie. In a way, Hugh Grant nearly steals the movie because he's the only one with a bit of character. The rest are too shallow to care whether they return for another scene in the simple-minded, hardly funny, plot (?)The anti-hero, a blonde automaton should have been developed further, instead is given no real character at all. I did like the attention to wardrobe and make-up. Having grown up in the 60's I recognized a lot of the wardrobe. Still, too many useless scenes, like when the American sits in the truck and finds a glass of wine and a sandwich. So what? It may have been more interesting if they just let the Russian spy die? "George Gently," the 1960's British detective makes UNCLE look like the work of someone without much sleep trying to cram for the next day's test. Lee Inglesby and Martin Shaw please.Perhaps this is the effect Ritchie was going for. The three teen boys sitting behind me may have said it best, "not very interesting." This poster child homage to the 60s and 70s TV shows just didn't register much, especially without a well-written plot. Story still leads. We've all seen James Bond getting it done over and over. Yes, the Bond are good action, some funny lines and some gripping twists with true hunky guys and bomb-shell gals. This didn't really have any eye-candy or amazing characters to grab a hold of. Certainly, no compelling twists or dialogue.Yawn...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Never watched the show, so can't compare the two, or whether or not this is a faithful adaptation of it or not, but I loved this film. It perfectly rides the fine line between straight 1960s spy movie throwback, and satire of one.Villain is pure 1960s vamp/ femme fatale, Henry Cavill and Armie Hammer's chemistry alone makes this worth watching. Hammer's twitch as his anger reaches boiling point is a great bit of detail. Cavill really reminded me of Roger Moore's Bond, specifically from The Spy Who Loved Me. He has a suave, "Trust me, I know what I'm doing" attitude throughout.Several scenes creatively have the action taking place in the background, while the focus is on the foreground. A perfect example, and maybe my favourite scene in the film, is Cavill sitting in a truck, basically picnicking, with a large sandwich and bottle of Chianti, while boat chase is playing out in front of him, reflected on the windscreen.The film is rated PG13, but it doesn't look watered down to get that rating, ... Henchman's electrocution torture scene was both graphic and simultaneously funny- another case of the action playing out in the background, while Cavill and Hammer debate the fate while in the next room.The plot is a bit of a mess, especially toward the end, but a great cast, sharp dialogue, and great attention to detail, and good action makes this a winner</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very enjoyable movie here. Cavill and Hammer seem to hit it off on the big screen in Guy Ritchies retro 60's spy thriller.A typical 60s plot about nuclear bombs and baddies with their own islands and speedboats, it's a perfect mix of tongue in cheek action and very witty one liners.It has a really good 60s feel to it and manages to keep enough dialogue with some very well filmed action sequences.Far far superior to the awful Kingsman released earlier in the year it never takes itself too seriously . Cavill has a great approach to comedy and delivers it much like Leslie Neilson in Airplane...always plays it straight as though he is the last one in on the joke' Armie Hammer is a good Russian spy and he plays the part really well.This is supposed to be a few hours of relaxation and fun which hits the spot perfectly. Would not worry too much about the few bad reviews , they were obviously expecting Tinker Tailor or something. Well worth a watch..bring on the sequel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hadn't ever watched the original series, so I had no ties to bias me to the TV show.That said, while the characters grow to become fairly endearing, and the film well captures the atmosphere of the 1960s as well as aspects of the spy vs spy Cold War undertones, overall it's rather bland.I couldn't help but be mildly irritated anytime Gaby (Alicia Vikander) took a stab at speaking German. I'm from the U.S., and took four years of German in high school about 20 years ago, and even though I've had a paltry handful of conversations in German compared to a native speaker, even *I* could tell how mangled her pronunciation was; it sounded like a muddled mess of nonsensical babble rather than the orderly and rather crisp intonations of one fluent in the language.The final scene features the chief of British intelligence meeting the group, reunited and having a drink on their hotel balcony. The chief informs them they're to pack up and leave for Istanbul for another mission. The expressions on the characters' faces, though, made me wonder whether the actors themselves didn't think they'd need to suffer through the making of a sequel. I hope they're wrong.</fullReview>

I call it the watch test, if I am straining to see the dial on my watch to see how much longer it goes on for, it is going to be a bad movie. Will I be able to endure the torture or will I spring out of my seat and walk out. I never look at my watch in a good movie, because time goes quickly. The film has no proper story, is badly directed, badly acted and just about as exciting as watching paint dry.The story is ridiculous, the bomb bit straight out of 'Goldfinger' but there the resemblance stops! I know it is supposed to be a comedy thriller, but it just isn't funny or thrilling in any way. Nearly two hours long, it seemed like a long haul flight. Guy Ritchie should pack up making movies and just live on 'Lock Stock' memories. I was astonished to see that the film has done well at the box office, but I guess the dumber a movie is these days doesn't stop it making money.I feel hurt that my eight quid adds to the profits, I hope you save your money and buy a DVD of the old sixties show.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Man From U.N.C.L.E. ? A Delicious Slice of 60's Pastiche Pie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had not watched the original series 'The Man From U.N.C.L.E.' since I was a child, and I had only seen a made for TV movie which brought back both Robert Vaughn and David McCallum reprising their roles from the series over thirty years ago. This put me in an odd position of having grown up in the 60's, but not really remembering much of this series thereby allowing me a somewhat fresh take on the film.For those who know less about the series and the movie than I did, an American CIA agent, Napoleon Solo (Henry Cavill) has been tasked to extract a young woman, Gaby Teller (Alicia Vikander), from East Germany. However he is being shadowed by a KGB operative, Illya Kuryakin (Armie Hammer) who also has orders to not let the woman be taken, all because of her missing father, Udo Teller, a German scientist who has the knowledge on how to build an Atomic Bomb. Through unforeseen circumstances we see both Solo and Kuryakin paired up to help young Gaby rescue her father. There it is, your basic spy/espionage flick.Guy Ritchie (director and co-screenwriter) had decided to craft an origin story for this movie, given that the TV series never gave any background information on either Solo or Kuryakin, let alone how they came together and started working for the organization known only as U.N.C.L.E. Cavill looks as if he were born to play the part of Solo. Aside from having a physique that beautifully fills out his tailored suits (no doubt due in part to his work in 'Man Of Steel'), he shows a delightful dry sense of humor and expression. As Solo he continually exudes an almost annoying sense of confidence bordering on arrogance, but he always pulls it off because he's devilishly charming, even when the odds are obviously stacked against him. Hammer, on the other hand, is clearly the straight man. He's clearly designed to act the role of this Russian character in a stoic, possibly cliché manner. Perhaps this is merely meant to play towards the 60's sense of how Russians were portrayed in the American cinema of that day. In any case, Hammer pulled it off quite well which worked beautifully against Cavill's almost cavalier performance.However, the real star of this movie is Guy Ritchie. He went out of his way to craft a film that looked like it could have easily come out of the 60's, starting with a very stylized opening credit scene that looked like it could have come from any movie of that time, to the very atmospheric music which was beautifully composed by Daniel Pemberton whose previous work was primarily in television. Here he gives us music for every scene that perfectly matches, not only the setting, but also that unique era. Lastly, the production values of this movie are not to be believed. It's not easy to totally capture a period of time, but it was done with perfection. From the sets, costumes and props, I truly felt like I had been transported back to a time long past, but thanks to this film, clearly not forgotten.This movie is filled with action sequences that, again, pay homage to the cinema of that time. Cuts and split screens play a part in helping to tell multiple points of view at the same time which seamlessly advances the story. There are also twists and surprises, some immediately revealed, others through well-timed flashbacks, which keeps the audience totally engaged. The humor, for the most part, is wonderfully dry, but there was one scene, beautifully acted by Sylvester Groth as Rudi Teller that starts off quite funny and then ends up in the land of hysterics. Under normal circumstances this scene would be deadly serious, but through Groth's acting, as well as Cavill's and Hammer's, we were given something that had the entire audience quite literally howling with laughter.If there is one flaw is that it plays a little loose with an actual historical character, but aside from that this was a pure gem. Solid acting on everyone's part and perfectly crafted by Ritchie and fellow screenwriter Lionel Wigram. If I had to sum it up, I would say that 'The Man From U.N.C.L.E.' is "60's Cinema Geek Porn."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like Guy Ritchie, his films like Snatch, Lock stock and Rocknrolla are some of my favorite movies. They are very re watchable, the characters are fun and interesting and the dialogue is very quotable and memorable. The Man From UNCLE has fun interesting characters in the form of the two main secret service agents, one that resembles a suave bond and another a more realistic less smooth Russian agent. These are fun characters and their relationship and conversations are the highlight of the movie. The rest is sadly kind of dull. The action wasn't particularly interesting or investing, the drama was blandish, and I was never really invested in the intrigue and plot. So... yeah... I'm hoping Ritchie goes back to Britain for his next movie as I feel he has a more personal connection with that world, not the spy world.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie could have been better. An American agent and a Russian agent tie up in the 60s to save the world from a former Nazi's scientist's new bomb. They use the scientist's daughter from East Germany to get it.The bad points: The direction and music are bad. Guy Ritchie's style isn't suited to this kind of movie. His fragmented way of showing something breaks up the excitement and makes the action sequences fizzle. The music is too loud and distracts from the scenes. More often than not the music did not suit what was going on. It's a shame with all the great music of the era. Alicia Vikander isn't special enough for this role, a bit ordinary and forgettable and a bit laid back looking.The good points: The 60s mood is captured looks wise with the cars and fashion. The European scenery, Berlin and Rome mainly, is attractive. The 2 photogenic leads Armie Hammer and Henry Cavill perform well enough. Armie Hammer does a good for Hollywood Russian accent distinct yet understandable. Watching Henry Cavill the next James Bond comes to mind.Worth one watch but it could have been better. If there is a sequel it would be better if Guy Ritchie isn't involved.</fullReview>

Carroll had far more drama and the acting was better.I get so ticked at these people that write a 10 paragraph (or more) review, and blather on and on about the movie studio, producers, directors, actors....and I say who needs it!

		<shortDescription>Better to Visit Your U.N.C.L.E</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I could scarcely keep my eyes open, thought about leaving, but with 100 degree heat making life miserable outside, I opted to stay the course. No reason to do this if you're in a more hospitable climate. The script is dull and humorless, no suspense included, and never any real sense of an impending nuclear threat, that might moved audiences a little closer to the edges of seats. The lead actors appear uncomfortable throughout. Neither Cavill nor Hammer seem to have any humor at all with which to infuse their roles, though as per the posters make stylish very male models. Better seen that heard. There is absolutely no chemistry whatever between them, hence the wit of the original series is totally lacking in the effort.With the exception of Hugh Grant, who delivers the only real performance of the film. His turn as Waverly, all too brief, is wry, energized, and surprisingly evocative of a younger, hipper version of Leo G. Carroll's Mr. Waverly. The visual nods to the mods are many and varied but go only so far. I found myself watching the "It Takes a Thief" era Chris Craft pulling away from the dock, the quick glimpse of the stand up, rotary dial Ericofon and Elizabeth Debecki in full 60's high fashion mode and thinking "Almost cool. But not quite."For my money Ritchie is much more effective with smaller films like "Snatch." He writes them better and directs them better. He seems to have gone from over the top with the Sherlock Holmes efforts to bouncing along the bottom with U.N.C.L.E.In the end, your better off visiting your U.N.C.L.E in TV Land.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Underwhelming and disappointing, coming from a fan of everyone involved, it is a pain to admit that this film, which I was really looking forward to, didn't live up to my expectations. I wanted to be thrown back to the same, outstanding fun I had with the two Sherlock Holmes movies and mix it to some old fashioned spy drama, but most unfortunately neither of those was fully satisfied.That is not to say that the film hasn't got entertaining points. For one the cast does the deliver the best they could have with the material they were given. I am a strong supporter of all the three main players and they gave me no reason to doubt them. They were probably what managed to get me through many scenes which could have collapsed easily in lesser hands. Moreover, as always, Ritchie is short in fun visual/audio ideas and plays with them throughout the film: not all work, but the ones that do were real fun. Also, photography-wise there is some very sleek camera work that made itself very noticeable and enjoyable at multiple moments and combined with the breathtaking locations helped the movie never getting dull. The music too delivers, with clear and explicit inspiration from Ennio Morricone which was never too invasive and enhanced scene very uniquely.For the rest the film is pretty much a light mess. It's very sloppy and the pace isn't fluent. Character motivations are never solid, it doesn't manage to support its twist filled storyline and so many times we are explained things twice and never explained other important things. The action is 95% uninteresting, fast cutting dullness and by the climax of the film I was bored by it. It really bothers me that the same director who made those two gems of Holmes movies which had some of the best pacing ended up making this very unsatisfying action piece. The sound too is pretty messy and Ritchie uses it in very strange ways in different parts of the movie which I'm not sure really worked.Call me disappointed, I really wanted to come out having seen the fun movie of the year, yet I was served a mediocre outing that could have really been saved by some better editing and wide angled action.</fullReview>

Unfortunately, that was not what we experienced. There were many things that disappointed us. First off the unrecognizable accents were disturbing and just awful. That wasn't the only thing that ruined it for us, the script was too simple and we like a challenge when we go to an Action Movie. Henry Cavill should have been allowed to use his real accent which is incredibly cool and he could have played a British spy instead of an American one. My son fell asleep during the movie and we left without seeing the end which is a huge deal for us as cinefiles. We wait for months for movies to be released and love the movie theater experience. This movie was two thumbs down for us. I wouldn't even suggest seeing it on local TV or cable. Avoid it if possible!</fullReview>

Where is the UNCLE theme music? Where is Del Floria's tailor shop? The pacing was poor, the acting ho-hum, and most of the action very contrived.

That, in itself, would not have been so bad if he'd managed to make a decent, witty action movie. Alas, he failed miserably.

		<fullReview>Somehow, Guy Ritchie managed to make a movie about cool super spies chasing bad guys through exotic locales during the Cold War totally BORING.Jokes fall flat. Sight gags are tired before they even start. And the action sequences end just as they begin to get interesting (the island climax suffers the worst in this regard). I will give Guy this: his soundtrack cues for this are great (as they always are in his movies), but his usual bag of tricks, his visual flourishes, are lacking here. He relies too often on goofy, multi-colored split-screens to convey action instead of just CLEARLY SHOWING US THE ACTION.As for performances, Armie Hammer pulls off his KGB character with some interesting choices. But I'm sorry, Henry Cavill is so vanilla that he can't match Hammer's big, bombastic performance. Cavill is totally miscast; almost feels like he belongs in a parody of this kind of movie and not the actual movie. I didn't find him suave, I found him bland and borderline unwatchable. And don't get me started on his stupid voice for this -- it sounds like a kid imitating the "dubbed" voice you normally hear on old Kung Fu movies.The TV show was before my time, but I'm a big fan of Guy's movies (usually) and of modern spy films and this one really disappoints. Style and fashion are not enough to carry a movie. Better luck next time, Guy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excess of Style and Smugness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Style over substance can definitely still be appreciated by the appeal of its own craftsmanship, but maybe putting that aim out of hand could bring a quite different result, and that is basically the case of The Man from U.N.C.L.E. This is meant to be a throwback to the old school spy movies where it's all about the hero's swagger, campy villains and some cool, slick sets all around. But the movie lacks the fun or at least the energy of this campiness and even the coherence of the plot at some points. There is a lot to admire through the surfaces of this film, but everything else is sort of too smug to enjoy.The plot isn't really that complex, it's the typical saving the world by thwarting an evil plan type of mission. However the movie has a lot of stylistic gimmicks like juxtapositions and slick camera work, which takes this narrative to a different spin. As silly as some of these details can be, the movie doesn't really take the advantage of having fun with this absurdity. It's more fond at being cool than anything else. While it is effective through that ambition, it is frustratingly devoid from any serious tension. Even at some crucial moments, it rather feels uneventful, in spite of seeing how the scene was build up. It is so smug, we even see the protagonist eating a sandwich while his partner is having a dangerous boat chase. That scene is impressive by its tone and cinematography, but then it seems to solely exist to show off how cool this guy and the movie are.And that is what it often feels like in this movie; visually, it's undeniably stunning, probably some of the best looking imagery you'd see in a blockbuster, but you don't always find any purpose or connection through a particular moment, because sometimes there isn't much to merit other than its own swagger. Though the characters do have their worthy moments, like whenever Solo and Illya are trying to show off which of their country's agency have better gadgets and technology. Their spark should have given more of these comedic moments maybe little more.The acting is much of the same as the visuals; Henry Cavill is perfect as the spy of the film's era, though this character is rather dated in our time where we root better for relatable heroes, but his wittiness should have given a real sense of humor; the Chianti scene doesn't count since the movie is having a profoundly whimsical moment right there; but really, that would have made this character work, at least in our sensibility today. Instead, Armie Hammer gets the jokes; his character has a temper and pathos that often become a punchline or treated with petty suspense; otherwise, it's just a blatant stereotype, like many of the characters here.The Man from U.N.C.L.E. is remarkable in its style, it fabulously captures the groove of its setting. But again, it's also too smug because of it. There is so little reason why the movie has to have this straight face since the story doesn't offer much subtlety or the characters aren't given any deeper personalities. It's definitely meant to be adventurous and campy fun, but it's too narcissistic apply those and even make the plot easy to follow. Therefore, it's just swagger and fancy suits around these glossy action.</fullReview>

In two short minutes he then convinces her that she absolutely needs to go with him to save herself from the KGB . Her time as a mechanic pays huge dividends as she speeds through the streets and alleys of Berlin in a fashion that would make Rémy Julienne jealous . The dialogue , the characters , the cinematography , awful ! With the exception of Jared Harris , the acting was ATROCIOUS . I have not seen a spy movie this bad since " On Her Majesty's Secret Service " . Poor George Lazenby looks like Larry Olivier next to Henry Cavill . Life is too short , I implore you , do / see , something / anything else !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Man from U.N.C.L.E. - Not Bourne, not Bond, but a new code name. Rather a good one - 3.75 stars Does anyone remember The Man from U.N.C.L.E. television show?Walking into the cinema... Skepticism abounds with this film. Less than reliable lead actors, a story based on an ambiguous television series, and those accents, but it has Guy Ritchie at the helm. This could lead to another level of skepticism, but I am willing to go into the screening with a low level of optimism. Oh, Mr. Ritchie do not let this optimism, albeit small, be misplaced!Overall Rating: 3.75 stars Cinematic value: 4 stars Big questions value: 2.5 starsThe Man from U.N.C.L.E (United Network Command for Law and Enforcement) is most likely not a television show that people will remember from their childhood or have even experienced in reruns. Besides taking the title and the basic concept of the show, this espionage excursion does provide a fresh take on the spy game. Placed on the backdrop of the cold war and the 1960's, director Guy Ritchie (Sherlock Holmes) incorporates a style of film making that is less Bourne and more retro-Bond. Well-dressed, clichéd agents with well-timed dialogue that takes front stage over action. Not that there is not action, but the action that is provided is more stylised and methodical. The central characters of the latest Ritchie production are CIA agent Napoleon Solo (Henry Cavill) and KGB operative Illya Kuryakin (Armie Hammer). Two agents who must put aside their national loyalties to work together to bring down a criminal organisation that is profiting from the burgeoning nuclear weapons market. Adding a link between these two agents is the sensual and fiery Gaby Teller (Alicia Vikander), who provides the means of finding the well-connected arms dealers. This origins-type spy story has a different pacing, action and spirit that counteracts the current tradition in foreign agent adventures. The Man from U.N.C.L.E. does force a shift in cinematic expectations. Ritchie seems to take on the mantra, 'Everything that is old is new again' by providing something new within a retro-style packaging. Fans of this director will see his fingerprints all over the film, while being conscious of fresh techniques in his direction. He utilises some of his trademarks to provide his touches to lighting, well-timed dialogue and subtle sexuality that complements the action. One pleasant surprise is his ability to get strong performances out of Cavill and Hammer. The nature of the story develops around their bizarre partnership and their reliance on each other's special agent skills, which also seems to be the case with the actor's performances, too. On their own, these actors are one dimensional and potentially boring, but together they present a uniformity that is quite enjoyable to watch on the big screen. Their relationship takes time to build, but in the end it does deliver. The true adhesive that brings these two agents together and provides the elemental connection for their performances is Alicia Vikander (Ex-machina). An up and coming force in Hollywood, she delivers the sensuality and feminine spark that perfectly complements this combative bunch of agents. In the end, the biggest challenge for this film will be to manage the audience's expectations. If the viewer expects Bourne or even the recent incarnation of Bond, they will be disappointed. But, if they go into the theatre looking for a fresh take on a well-worn espionage storyline, they will be pleasantly surprised and will find themselves looking forward to the next instalment of these undercover agents. In the realm of espionage theatre, the considerations to discuss war, national loyalties and the atrocities of mankind are extremely obvious. Loving our neighbour is an idea that can be seen in many of the world's religions and philosophies, but a radical notion that was introduced by Jesus was to not only to love our neighbours, but to love our enemies. Honestly, it has to be one of the most confronting concepts in the Bible and one of the hardest to implement. Individually it is challenging, but how about on the global scale? Without unintentionally waving a 'make peace, not war' sign around, loving your enemy opposed to going to war has its appeal. Also, not to misrepresent Jesus as being merely meek and mild, the concept of loving your enemies might be one worth considering, for ourselves and for global politics. Leaving the cinema... You might be able to gather that this reviewer is a Guy Ritchie fan, but regardless of being a fan, this film was refreshingly different in the realm of spy films and out and out fun. A small side note: one thing that was missing from this Guy Ritchie film was extensive foul language, but the story was not lacking because of this was omitted. This is one spy film worth seeing in theatres this year. Reel Dialogue: What are some of the bigger questions to consider from this film? 1. Where is real hope found? (Deuteronomy 31:6, Romans 5:2-5) 2. Can we love our enemies? (Luke 6:27, Romans 12:19-21) 3. Why is it so hard to trust other people? (Proverbs 6:12-16, Romans 3:10-18)Written by Russell Matthews based on a five star rating system @ Russelling Reviews #russellingreviews #themanfromuncle #guyritchie</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, I am a fan of Guy Ritchie's work. I have seen Snatch, Sherlock Holmes etc. I was very enthusiastic to watch this movie because it has a spy content in it. The first half was more interesting than the second half. Henry Cavill as a spy looks great and played it well too. Rather the movie was more of comedy than detective in nature. The views were great but the acting was flawed. The movie was full of boring jokes and needless conversation to increase the runtime of the movie. At the second half the movie gets twisted in itself and the characters starts looking dull. Fans of Guy Ritchie may have enjoyed it much more than I did. If I go with rating the movie, I give it 2.5/5. I didn't got what I expected of this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film opens with a delightful throw back to the days of the iron curtain. The opening chase sequence is brilliant through out.Guy Ritchie has brilliantly used his narrative style to get Solo (Henry Cavill, American Spy) &amp; Illya (Armie Hammer, Russian) to show off their skills in the trade craft. It was refreshing to watch the two super spies in action.Form me just about there Guy Ritchie loses his narrative. He has just gone for the stylish looks &amp; fun in a movie that involves two super spies. The comedy puns come out more like some chick flick and forces the viewer to think again if this is a Guy Ritchie movie. Only the background score and camera work will remind you so.All the actors come out as very average if not a horrible performance. And they too have concentrated only on delivering those college type puns and not on how truly complicated their characters can be. We are talking about Communist &amp; Capitalist spies working together. A tensed relationship between the two would have added to the script. And that is what Ritchie has tried to deliver. A tensed relationship between the two leads in a comical manner. But what Ritchie ends with is failure at many levels.If you are just looking to kill time and don't mind the chick flick type forced puns, then it is a brilliant watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Style Over Substance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know why, but Guy Ritchie's films have always felt way too stylish for my liking. They just don't do much for me at all, really. And although I actually do like the Sherlock Holmes films he did, the directing style he uses in that is my least favorite aspect. But I was curious about The Man from U.N.C.L.E. Alicia Vikander is about as hot as you can be right now with the amount of projects she's either rumored for or locked in after her Ex Machina success. And Henry Cavill is one of the most likable guys in Hollywood. The problem with the film isn't the actors at all, in fact, I actually liked Armie Hammer a lot here, which was a big surprise. The problem comes from the stylish directing and the missed attempt at making an action film with comedy in it.Maybe it was just me, but I didn't really find anything funny in the film. Sure, a sexual innuendo here or there was a good change of pace, especially to hear out of Superman's mouth, but the other comedy bits just misfired. The chemistry between Hammer and Cavill was the best part of the film and a stroke of brilliance. Which is actually one reason why I would see a sequel, but without Guy Ritchie. With that being said, I loved the premise of a Russian and American spy working together to stop a nuclear attack, and the comedy route seemed like the right way to go about it, but it just didn't hit for me. As much as I loved Vikander in Ex Machina, I thought she was just okay here. The forced romance (and yes I know it's supposed to be goofy) between her and Hammer's character was brutal to watch at times and I got to be honest, I just didn't care enough about her character. Hugh Grant makes a glorified cameo but he ultimately ends up being overwhelmingly underused. Not to mention the fact that the 'big' or 'climatic' action sequence ends up being a montage of a brief clips was a huge disappointment and a missed opportunity to reel me in for a thrilling end.Back to Ritchie, I also found his use of music in different sequences to be incredibly distracting and even bombastic at times. But even though I had a lot of problems with the film, I did have some fun with it. It was nice to see Cavill take on a lighter role and you could tell he enjoyed filming the movie as well. The premise itself is cool and the chemistry between the leads is quite prevalent. But that's about it. It's one of those films that would probably seem a lot better if I caught it on cable and had lowered my expectations. It goes down as yet another average film in what seemed to be a rather promising 2015.+Cavill +Chemistry between spies -Forced romance -Style over substance-Distracting music 5.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Perfect Example of Style Over Substance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are actually a lot of great things about The Man from U.N.C.L.E. It's got a slick and stylized atmosphere, the cinematography is excellent, an amazing soundtrack, some fun action scenes, and a few bursts of humor throughout.So why isn't it a good movie?Well, what keeps U.N.C.L.E down from being anything more than just a mediocre spy flick is an incredibly weak script and brutally uneven pacing. Director Guy Ritchie is so concerned with trying to make the film look cool and stylish that when it comes time for the story to come into play, he forgets to make it compelling in the least bit. After the film opens with a rather impressive action scene, we are met with about 45 minutes of story before we get another one which just feels more and more dragged out the longer it goes on. Ritchie's script is not the only thing keeping the film from being uninteresting, but also the chemistry between the leads. It's important in a buddy film like this for the leads to have some sort of chemistry and while there are occasional moments where the two shine, they never really click together. Cavil's performance is probably is the strongest to date (although that's not saying much) and while his smooth cool guy act is amusing to watch at first, he brings very little to the role other than that. Hammer ends up being the weaker of the duo being unfortunately dull to watch once again failing to prove his strength as an actor.When U.N.C.L.E does actually get into it's action sequences it's actually pretty entertaining to watch and there are a few laugh-out- loud moments of humor here and there. Yet, these moments aren't worth of completing the chore of sitting through the painfully long stretches of the boring and uninspired plot. In the end, it ends up being a Connery-era Bond film without the elements that made those films as fun as they were. It's a shame too because you can't help but notice the great elements here that only make you realize how much more of a wasted opportunity it actually was. It really is a prime example of a film that has indulged itself in the sin of "Style over Substance".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know that a lot of people like this movie, but there are good reasons why it flopped.The concept comes from the TV series where an American CIA agent and a KGB agent work together to do some vaguely defined task (there is a nuclear bomb or something, but I am not exactly sure what they plan to do with it).Most of the movie involves people sitting around talking. engaging in pointless dull banter and petty pathetic bantering. Pretty much nothing that happens in the movie is movie the plot forward. The action is dull and also does little to advance the plot, which is why they made it so stylish. Overall a great 30 minute TV show stretched to the length of a feature movie and it suffers for this. While there are lovely subtleties in this movie, none of them really pay off. To put it another way, here is a movie that tries to be different, fails to entertain most people, and blows away a small group of people.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A load of empty style but sporadically entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Man from U.N.C.L.E. has been a big box office bomb, which it didn't deserve to be. Guy Ritchie's flashy and pleasingly retro spy thriller is a fun ride but it lacks any kind of genuine punch. It's a very generic spy plot which is given lift by being set during the Cold War and involving the CIA's best agent (Henry Cavill) and the KGB's best agent (Armie Hammer) working together. Overall TMFU is a moderate success. Guy Ritchie's direction is visually excellent and unlike the 2 Sherlock Holmes films (Which were good but not exactly Sherlock Holmes) his style fits the movie perfectly. The acting is good all around, with Armie Hammer improving on his fairly generic performance in The Lone Ranger although Henry Cavill occasionally comes across as a bit smug. Despite being set in a different time period the film manages not to feel anachronistic and serves up plenty of sleek entertainment. Ultimately this is basically just lots of style with little substance although the Cold War setting makes it more interesting.The story is completely hollow and forgettable. Style over substance and not in a particularly good way this lacks a real human touch and it's difficult to feel truly involved in the story as a result. The action sequences are fun but sometimes the film sags in between them. There just isn't anything we haven't seen before in this and I've already forgotten quite a bit of it even though I only saw it a week ago. There's nothing particularly wrong with TMFU and it's fine. That's the problem. It's just fine. Compared to Furious 7, Jurassic World, Mad Max Fury Road and Inside Out this is a completely unmemorable and forgettable blockbuster which judging by the box office performance certainly isn't busting any blocks. Not a bad film then since it's thrilling and well made but just a very ordinary one. Does it give Bond a run for his money? That's a definite no, although to be fair it's certainly more fun than Die Another Day or The Living Daylights or Moonraker or A View to a Kill.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Guy Ritchie pulled this off with his artistic brilliance. The cast did a wonderful job being funny and witty at the same time, Armie Hammer in particular with his Russian accent. The background score was delight for ears being retro and complementing the plot. The action sequences were conceptual and exciting. I found the plot rather fictionalize for the sake of making it more interesting but then it was necessary otherwise the movie would be slow and dull. The dialogs are canny and jovial (particularly "Take it like a pussy, That's not the Russian way). One thing that I found disappointing was the ending one reason being it was predictable and way too diplomatic for the agents who espouse secret agencies of two competing nation, who should be overwhelmed with the feelings of patriotism for their country.Overall it was fun to watch and I enjoyed it very well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Consistently lacking in any real spark or sense of fun, leaving it a dud with attractive period production design</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't grow up in the 1960's, although the original Man from UNCLE was a show I watched growing up as I remember it was on in the Friday 6pm slot on BBC2 probably around late 80s / early 90s, and my mother had been a big fan when it did screen originally, so we tended to watch it. This is not to say I had huge affection for the show, and I certainly did not come to this film ready to pick holes for it not being like the television show; being honest I was more curious what they would do with the material in the film. After watching I was quite unsure why they decided to make this story connected to this product ? because other than brand recognition (does UNCLE have such strong drawing power?) there really doesn't seem to be a reason that this story could not have been done with a whole new creation of characters and agencies (indeed it is only a sequel, if one occurs, where the team would be together).This aside, the other thing that made me wonder why this film was made was that it really just seemed to 'exist' and not do much else outside of that. It was noticeable that I hadn't really seen or heard much promotion or buzz for the film, and watching the film myself you do get the feeling that there is not a great deal to be excited about here. Unhelpfully elements of this film reminded me The Spy in the Green Hat, which is easily the best UNCLE film (a feeling unchanged with the addition of the 2015 film); Nazi doctors, female villains who seem to enjoy the suffering element, one of the agents in a 'relationship' as part of the mission etc; it was a totally different plot, but these little elements put me in mind of it ? which is not helpful because that film has a lot more going for it than this one.It is not that the film is bad ? it isn't, it has too much professionalism and resource to be really bad. The issue for me was that it just had so little spark and fun in it that I wondered what it was supposed to be doing. Tonally it is a bit messy (there are jaunty spoofy sequences along with torture sequences) but it looks like they were going for this slick sparkling fun feeling, but they just never convince with it. The performances are front and centre, and these are the most obvious place to look, because there certainly does seem like a certain lack of chemistry and charisma between the leads. Cavill and Hammer as individuals are not people I have fallen for as film stars or even actors ? but this film needed more of the former and not so much the latter. They have a few good moments but generally there is no sparkle to their performance and no real connection between their characters. Vikander is equally so- so throughout, aside from a few spunky moments. People like Grant, and Jared Harris don't have too much to work with but are nice to see, but generally it is a film that feels like it is going through the motions. The period design is probably the only area where it really does well, and it does feel genuine but yet still having that fun sense of the swinging sixties. In reality the film doesn't justify having this aspect be as well done as it is, because it doesn't make the most of that cool and detailed base.Maybe there will be a sequel, maybe there won't ? it generally seemed to be as lukewarmly received as it was lukewarmly presented, and in the end this film is one that will not please older fans who remember the original series (not that they represent big summer cinema spenders), nor win over a new audience due to its lackluster content and general lack of fun and spectacle.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>two points for Victoria character, others deserve zero</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is advertised in Russia as "finally-good-Russian-guy-in-Hollywood-movie" but even this positive attitude can't save the bad script. There were lots of possibilities to make Napoleon Solo and Ilya likable and at least 2-dimensional. There's a difference between mocking spy movie and mocking Guy Ritchie movie. Even here in Russia where Guy is "our everything" considering cool brutal movies for "real guys". These people here respect him for his homophobia (and desire to have more biological children with young wife) with all their heart (thanks to Christopher Ciccone tell-all book). And even after that love for director this movie is not a masterpiece or decent entertainment. Even Thom Cruise latest flick is better. ** This part of review contains spoilers ** No suspense, two jokes and time wasted at mediocre Alicia Vikander instead of amazing Elizabeth Debicki. This scene with drowning Ilya is really good and final scene too. But ladder scene and many others are really about nothing. Italian villain a-la female Hitler? LMFAO duet would be better.Of course, this movie is going to gain a lot of success in Russia for its mention of mighty 60s politician Yekaterina Furtseva (or Catherine the Third). Maybe it is shocking but Russia is very "anglophilia" driven country that hates KGB and loves MI6. Hugh Grant had a chance to save the plot. But he didn't. Anyway, Guy Ritchie is now very welcomed in Russia unlike his ex-wife. He's a hero who "escaped Madonna's sexual slavery" (quote from the article) and makes children with his Jackie Ainsley every 1,5 years. Thus, his art is always going to be adored by all Russian guys who can't afford intelligent sexy Russian girls the same way Alicia Vikander's German character can't be engaged to Russian. BTW, even now German girl can easily marry Afro-German, Turk, Tunisian... any other minority... but not Russian. Armie Hammer actually looks like Oleg Vidov (Soviet actor who plays KGB agent in "Gentlemen of Fortune" 1971 film).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A big fat disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hate to be so blunt by giving out one-line verdicts to the films in the review titles, but, out of respect to Mr Ritchie, it has to be done quickly and gracefully. For a special man like him, it just wasn't his special day.The Man from U.N.C.L.E. is basically an average spy action flick. A very professionally done one of course, with nice characters played by very decent actors, with a handful of charming little scenes and a few witty dialogues. For any other writer and director it could've even been considered a big success. However, just being on par is not what we honestly expect from a Guy Ritchie movie. Instead, we expect something that treads lightly, unfolds a surprise at every step and, most importantly, is never plain dull. And that was what Ritchie's been brilliant at his whole career. Up until now.I can't even tell when it all went wrong. The premise - two enemies from entirely different worlds teaming up for a greater cause - is, albeit not original, still pretty promising. Henry Cavill does look chic enough to pass for a James Bond alternative, and Armie Hammer posing as a crude but deadly efficient KGB agent should have been really fun, especially with him wearing that preposterous cap at all times. The female lead was also pretty well: cute enough to be likable, but not too doll-like hot to be unbelievable. The action was also diverse and intense, the dialogues not dumbed down. So, why did the movie leave this little to no aftertaste?I think i have an answer to that question. And even though being rude is something i hate even more than being blunt, the answer is that the plot is a huge steaming pile of generic crap. There's literally nothing special or innovative about this movie, no contrived twist or charming atmosphere, nothing to delve into or to relish. And no actor's charisma or director's wits and vision could have turned that bland "an unlikely team of superhero guys saves the world, while they become friends along the way" bore into anything genuinely fun.What remains a mystery to me is why on earth they decided to drag Ritchie into this. He's a wizard of a British crime movie genre, but, like it's the case with those allegedly famous miraculous Filipino healers, his magic belongs with the land, and once outside of London and his favorite niche, he's literally useless. The maestro did try to give this film some small-scale charm, but a multitude of little things never turned into anything solid and united. Such a shame.I really wanted to like this film. And failing to do so even makes me feel bad, as if i did something terrible like driving a cute little puppy out of the house when it's cold and raining outside. The problem is that the puppy couldn't help gnawing at your new Italian shoes and pissing on your sofa, and this time it simply didn't have a diamond inside to make up for it all.</fullReview>

Style seems to have been the only consideration rather than telling a story.The characters couldn't have been less interesting if they tried to be. I simply didn't find any of them likable and neither did I care what happened to them. No actor is going to win any awards for this. The possible exceptions being any actor appearing after I left. The script didn't help the actors by playing to the least likable aspect of their characters. Solo comes across as a greasy spiv and Kuryakin as an unstable psychopath.The production values were good but that's about it.

		<fullReview>Style over substance is how I would describe The Man From U.N.C.L.E. as that often used expression is the first thing that comes to my mind as I dwell on the character of Napoleon Solo as played by Henry Cavill. Though he is supposed to be the main character he never goes beyond a superficial caricature of James Bond. On the other hand the characters of Ilya and Gaby become more human as the movie goes on. Napoleon Solo on the other hand remains glib. He could practically not be in the movie at all as the story revolves around the romance of Ilya and Gaby and I now struggle to remember what Napoleon Solo was doing in the movie at all.The story of this film is generic with nothing special about, but while I've seen worse I can't remember a film that bored me this much. The Man From U.N.C.L.E. is in that awful middle where it's not good OR bad enough to be entertaining. There are some humorous scenes but the movie can't decide if it wants to be campy funny or serious but funny.Also it feels like a bad prequel or one of those first films of a franchise, that exists only to get the team together, before the second much better film. Hence there are no real stakes to the plot and the origin story is not convincing.Overall my low score is because I can't name single thing about this film that would serve as a recommendation for seeing it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you are a fan of Guy Richie, Henry Cavill or Hugh Grant, do not go and see this movie.It's quite stylish yet very lazy, the storyline is so weak, I considered leaving the cinema to go get a coffee.Cavill has this, monotone, '1960's television announcer' accent going on, with a lot of smug eye-brow raising, which does nothing to endear you to his character, Solo. In fact it becomes quite irritating after the first five or ten minutes.They also have this really disturbing bit in the middle where Cavill is strapped to a chair, and the whole thing is reminiscent of Christopher Reeve, (the likeness is uncanny and distasteful)Hammer is good, and by all account did a little bit of homework for the role...which no-one else even considered...Even its classic soundtrack doesn't redeem it, in the same way as the Guardians of the Galaxy movie became as much about the cool soundtrack as it was about the Marvel geek-dom.Definitely wait for the DVD or BluRay.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What ever made this director take a comedic tone on this movie was beyond me. There is funny and there is funny but this misses the mark totally. What could and should have been a good movie was completely ruined in this production. It felt like the actors actress' wished they were anywhere else in the world other than in this movie, hollow and wooden acting. What a shame.It sure would be nice if they actually did a action crime thriller of this movie.Who votes and rates these movies here is beyond me, as there is not a chance in the world that this movie rates anywhere near a 7.6 on IMDb. Well enough said, as always everyone has to decide for themselves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rather dreadful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This starts with a really poor script, and this script was terrible. There is a complete failure to develop any decent or engaging characters, the three main protagonists are paper thin and boring. Secondly it lacks humour, the only character to make you break a smile is Hugh Grant, who shines in the mediocre darkness of this film. Thirdly there is no craft in the story telling, the plot is barely intelligible, makes frequent unexplained leaps and at no point does it arouse even mild excitement. It is very pretty with some lovely scenery and fashion, but no amount of prettiness can make up for the complete lack of excitement or interest. I was a fan of the original series, where there were characters after a fashion, but as a modern reinterpretation it is completely misses the mark.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Man from C&amp;A....or M&amp;S....or Brooks Brothers........</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Boring - this is what this film is; the first half hour was so slow that I was tempted to walk out. In bringing back this 60s classic they forgot to add any decent action until very late on and the whole story line was so stupid and unlikely that I shook my head in disbelief. Let's make the 'nazty Nazis' the villains - in the 1960s? Yeah right. Compared to Mission Impossible V, let alone Bond, this was more of advertisement for classic 1960s sartorial elegance than anything resembling a spy thriller. The two male leads had all the charisma of men's underwear models and there was never much in the way of genuine excitement, let alone tension. You always knew that the 'nazty Nazis' were a bunch of hopeless goons and that our heroes would make short work of them, with the help of a British aircraft carrier (!). Guy Ritchie has proved yet again what a vacuous and shallow director he is with this weak effort - lots of glitz and no substance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bored, And I'm Not Sure Why</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie seemed to have all the right ingredients to be entertaining. It had action, snappy dialogue, and a likable cast. However, I was bored from beginning to end.To be fair, I'm not really a Guy Ritchie fan. Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels didn't do anything for me, and Snatch was rather forgettable, imo. So maybe I just don't like Guy Ritchie's style of movie making. But there are a couple of things I can put my finger on.Firstly, I didn't like Henry Cavill's manner of delivering his lines. It didn't seem natural and it smacked of poor acting, but was probably due more to poor direction. Additionally, many of the scenes seemed silly to me, defying logic and making it difficult for me to suspend my disbelief. But that still doesn't explain my boredom.About halfway through the movie I got up to use the bathroom. After I was finished I debated on whether I should go back in the theater. I decided I didn't want to waste any more time on the movie so I left, not even the slightest bit curious how the plot would turn out.So, take my review with a grain of salt. If you're fan of Guy Ritchie you might just enjoy this film. Otherwise, you might not want to waste your time on it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This certainly is nothing like the TV series. In fact, the title could just as easily have been "The Man From C.I.A" or somewhere else. One of the main problems is that director Guy Ritchie keeps the action (and other stuff) so distant you really don't get inside on things. Example: Kiryakan just sits there on and on and on during speedboat chase - and then the climax is away and nearly off screen. The end raid is done in multiple split screen shots that remove the viewer from involvement and (though not true) feels like stock footage was used and this is a way of covering it up. There is very little charisma between Henry Cavill and Armie Hammer. I felt Armie Hammer had almost no personality whatsoever. The disposition of the main enemy is not really handled well, and the ending goes too long afterwards. I also felt that there definitely did not need to be so much revelation of negative things in Solo's past.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Open Channel D for Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stylish, glamorous and cool is how I remember the "The Man from U.N.C.L.E." when growing up in the 60's, with the incomparable Robert Vaughn playing the titular "Man" (Napoleon Solo, famously named by Ian Fleming no less) and with David McCallum having a rapidly increasing presence as his Russian colleague Illya Kuryakin. I must have spent much of my school playtimes crouched in a corner with a Parker pen whispering "Open Channel D" into the top! Highly entertaining and misogynistic, sidelining women as little more than elegant cloth-horses for later (hinted-at) sexual fun, the new film adaptation differs in only one respect? unfortunately, not the one you most would like it to. Henry Cavill ("Superman") plays Solo, forced into a spiky working relationship with his cold-war rival Kuryakin (Arnie Hammer from "The Social Network") when a famous nuclear scientist goes missing risking nuclear bombs falling into the hands of a rogue power (which midway through the film seems ? rather oddly ? to be equated to the Nazis). The team recruit the help of the scientist's daughter Gaby (Alicia Vikander) to track down her missing father. Guy Ritchie films are always a bit of a lottery: the "Sherlock Holmes" films had panache; the less said about "Swept Away" the better. "The Man from U.N.C.L.E." lies somewhere in the middle, which I predicted from the trailer: whereas I have raved about the trailers for "Inside Out" and the new "Star Wars", I had the exact opposite reaction to the trailer for "Uncle"?. it was just so 'meh'. So this was a film I entered with low expectations, and those expectations were pretty well met. This is not to say that the film doesn't have its moments: some amusing banter between the two male leads; an atmospheric cold-war Berlin set; some high octane scenes that bear stylish comparison to Sergio Leone Westerns; and the delectable Alicia Vikander ("Ex Machina"). But against these plusses it all seemed, at its heart, rather soulless. For significant periods of the film I wasn't fully engaged and the film grew tiresome, not helped by multiple finales that fizzled out with a damp squib intro to the next in the franchise. In terms of feminism, the film doesn't move the ball along very far. True that Vikander's character is an East German car mechanic who knows how to wrestle a man to the ground, but once into 'the plot' she is given precious little to do other than dress prettily (something she does, with the help of costume designer Joanna Johnston, very nicely). One of the primary villains ? Victoria (Elizabeth Debicki from "The Great Gatsby") ? is also female, but again the role seems largely toothless and revolves around her draped in 60's fashions and pouting a lot. Of the male stars, Cavill and Hammer (which sounds like a make of toothpaste) lack any great charisma; Hugh Grant does a good Hugh Grant impersonation; with the most fun being had by Sylvester Groth ("Inglourious Basterds") who is creepily entertaining as the ex-Naxi torture doctor. Whilst eschewing the norm in most reboots of reworking the classic theme, Daniel Pemberton's soundtrack is unusual and fits the retro- nature of the film well, although it can be a little too brash at times. Also retro in nature is the use of 60's style split screens but this is much less successful, totally neutering the suspense in some of the action sequences. This is most notable in the final Bond-style raid on 'baddie HQ' which, combined with the deafening music track, clearly cost a lot of budget to stage but is just yawn-worthy dull in its presentation. With a current 7.6 on IMDb I may be in the minority, but i.m.h.o. it's worth a Sunday-afternoon watch on DVD but not something to rush to the cinema to see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Essential film for fans of Guy Ritchie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is indeed a remarkable film of action, intrigue, a tape of "colleagues". The director of "Snatch" and two instalments of Sherlock Holmes, among other films, Guy Ritchie have been immersed in the direction of this adaptation for the screen of a series of the sixties.This time gives his particular vision of the "Cold War" and the series "The Man from U.N.C.L.E." delivering an elegant and well-executed but with a dose of bad milk, hooliganism and humor film.The film respects the original title of "The Man from U.N.C.L.E." series, in Spain was "C.I.P.O.L. agent". Ritchie has managed to move forward with this film, with three attractive faces like Henry Cavill, Armie Hammer and the girl in this triangle at work is called Alicia Vikander. I liked it a lot. It makes you have a good time, and you get fully into this story from the first minute, from the grand opening credits. Hooks you and makes you stay attentive during the nearly two hours.The soundtrack is another of the strengths of the film, a very good soundtrack that makes you jump right into the film.</fullReview>

A comedy with twists and actually a very good story. What I enjoyed the most about this movie is the way scenes are used to sometimes give unnecessary long shots to unimportant parts and swiftly showing you what action is taking place in various parts. Its not bad, the way they are stitched together keeps your mood light the entire time and you get an occasional laugh at some silly situations. Acting is great, I don't make a fuss about acting unless it is exceptionally bad, here the actors portray the character's personality quiet well considering the challenges involved regarding one of the lead roles I must say I shall be waiting to see if it has some sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not even nostalgic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Man from U.N.C.L.E. is quite big disappointment. I haven't seen the original television series, so I can't even feel a bit of nostalgia. Only good thing in this movie is it's imagery of 60's which makes it looks fresh. Good thing is that they haven't try to bring story to present. It try so hard to make James Bond parody, but doesn't manage in it. Humor is not good enough and it feels to written to younger audience. That feels quite stupid because most of it's audience is way older than 50's. Timing of the the movie is also a big problem. It feels like there is only bunch of sequences glued together. With better timing it could be a better story.Story is lame and implausible and actors won't get anything out of their characters. Russian agent who try to speak English with Russian accent feels just stupid and Henry Cavill is not believable agent. Predictable story and clumsy jokes just don't work. It is better to leave this movie alone in it's theatrical release and pick it up when it comes out in DVD. It only takes few months when you found it from sales with only few Euros to pay, so it is better to watch at home when you are always free to pause it when visiting at refrigerator.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exquisite 60s spy action with an irresistible rivalry and friendship story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oh I loved, loved this movie! From the beginning I was intrigued by the characters ? their synergy is irresistible. I've seen this film 19 times already - and it still moves me with tears and giggles and suspense!Henry Cavill's gesture and presence immediately captivated me and took me back to the spy TV shows I used to watch as a child in the late 70's and early 80's and the sophisticated Roger Moore's and Shaun Connery's J-Bonds movies. There's a touch of humor in his voice and performance, which in addition to his charisma makes him a lovable character. At first he appears arrogant, but as the movie develops we learn he has a taste for pleasure and la dolce vita ? he is as astute as a serpent and suave as a dove? but with a big heart. Armie Hammer is so original and genuine in his Russian spy performance. Of course his persona is a perfect match for the role ? with his innocent boy face and haircut and that massive energy of a muscular Russian spy. The juxtaposition of his sweet vulnerable personality and massive destructive energy is also irresistible. Eventually we learn more about his past, making us (the audience) care for him and love him even more. The symbolism of his father's watch ties the beginning of the movie with the end. At first his character is reminiscent of a slight terminator-ish sort of spy, but it is through his rivalry and later his forced cooperation with Solo (Henry Cavill) and Gaby (Alicia Vikander)that his humanity evolves. And we learn that, he too, has a big heart under an iron fist.Alicia Vikander She did a great performance with her bad-turned-good witch character in Seventh Son and Ex-Machina ?- now we see her here, a prickly rose amongst steel thistles (Solo and IIlya). Alicia, as Gaby, brings balance and contrast ? a young passionate girl that appears to be innocent later on in the movie surprises us when we discover who she really is. But her personality ? sweet and explosive and delicate make her a great match for the trio. She brings the softness in Armie Hammer's character, she teaches him to be more human. And of course, she learns to be a better human too. The high fashion she wears throughout the movie is also delightful. And what about Hugh Grant? His charm and mature wisdom with his natural lovable British sense of humor make him completely adorable to watch. He is the boss of this nascent discordant team! The cinematography honors the spy TV-shows from the 70's ? absolutely and contradictorily refreshing, compared to all other spy/action movies in the recent years. I love that this movie takes place in 1963, so the action relies less on high tech gadgets and more on man's intelligence and instinct and skills. There are so many exciting layers to this movie! There's a teasing romance, there's history, a cocktail of foreign languages (which I find stimulating and fascinating), and all the European settings are a joy to watch. The foreign language spoken by the actors makes the story even more engaging. Also, I laughed and laughed ? subtle and sophisticated humor.Loved it! And the music? I couldn't resist swaying with the rhythms: a potpourri of 70's style and original contemporary scores plus some romantic Italian songs. I'm buying the soundtrack as soon as it becomes available! Violence is kept under control. Only trickles and hints of blood. It's mostly the physical wrestling fight style, without the carnage and surgical bloodshed of recent movies. I didn't feel disgusted or disturbed. There's only one scene that is chilling ? related to World War II torture, but even then, violence is restrained. In the end, after all the action and heroic achievements, the good-hearted ones and kindness and justice prevails. I just didn't want the movie to end! In the last scene I was convinced these characters are here to stay. I am ready for UNCLE 2! Meanwhile though, I'll be watching this movie at least 10 times.I walked out of the theater feeling good and smiling.Cheers, Yelitza</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'The Man From U.N.C.L.E.' is Enjoyable Fun on many levels.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The latest Hollywood remake to hit theaters is the hit TV show from the mid-60's 'The Man From U.N.C.L.E.', which lasted four seasons and was partially developed by Ian Fleming just as the James Bond franchise was taking off. If you were alive during the mid-60s, you would have known that this 'U.N.C.L.E.' television series was one of the best things on TV at the time, as it centered on an American spy and a Russian spy, working together to take out the bad guys in a very 007 kind of way.Cut to present day and we have director Guy Ritchie ('Snatch', 'Sherlock Holmes I &amp; II'), delivering his version of the television show for the big screen. It's a rather enjoyable and fun film to watch, however it never can find a steady beat nor plant its roots in a cohesive manner like the last couple 'Mission Impossible' films have done. Even though the film runs just under two hours, it feels longer than 120 minutes, which is a problem Ritchie has had in the past with his 'Sherlock' films.The American spy in question is Napoleon Solo (Henry Cavill), who is a suave womanizer and also excellent at his job, who has been tasked or shall I say forced by his boss (Jared Harris) to find Gaby Teller (Alicia Vikander), a beautiful auto mechanic whose long lost father was a former nazi who might be helping the wrong people develop a nuclear warhead. Set in the 60s as well, Solo uses these vintage gadgets and cars to get around Europe, which is sure fun to watch as he finds Gaby, only to have Illya Kuryakin (Armie Hammer), the Russian spy with psychotic episodes that cause him to wreak havoc on anyone and anything near him, try and capture Gaby for himself and his boss, which ensues in a fairly excellent car chase that is similar to something we would have seen in 'Sin City'.This sets the stage for Kuryakin and Solo to one up another and "cordially" meet, as their bosses force them to set aside their differences and work together on finding the people who are hiring Gaby's father to make the the nuclear weapon. The people in question can stand aside the best of the Bond villains as well, as they each have their one unique fashion statement or "skill" that sets them above the rest. This all sounds like quite the fun movie, right? Like I said before, this film is enjoyable, but there are some pacing and character problems to deal with in between the good moments.There are a few slow scenes that seemed like they could have been left on the cutting room floor, mostly with Gaby's character, who really is only there to be beautiful, which is unfortunate, because her character could have done so much more. Then there is the relationship and banter with both Solo and Kuryakin, which is mostly top notch, however Kuryakin's character is the more introverted character here and tends to stick to only business, when his character shouldn't 100% of the time.Cavill, who also plays 'Superman', does a great job of balancing the two personalities and is quite the comic relief most of the time with his dry wit and quips centered at Kuryakin. I only wish Armie Hammer had more to work with here, but when the two spies start insulting one another, it makes for good entertainment. Ritchie does a decent job with his iconic direction here as well, as he sets up the action sequences with a '24' style split screen on crack, complete with fun titles, zooms, and twists of the camera. It's classic Guy Ritchie filmmaking, along with a killer soundtrack. I don't think 'The Man From U.N.C.L.E.' will be able to compete with 'Mission Impossible 5' financially or critically, but it's still enjoyable fun to see these two on screen. So much so, that I hope to see them again, which is of course Warner Bros.'s goal to make this a franchise. That being said, I don't see that happening any time soon.Recommended!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Style over story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stylistically this film is top-notch. The music, cinematography production design, costumes and opening credits are all superb. The mood - that of a laid back yet still elegant '60s - is also well captured. But was the story sacrificed in the process? The narrative - involving a missing scientist and a nuclear weapon possibly falling into the hands of some Nazi sympathizers - is so half-baked and altogether dull one might think that the story was always considered secondary. The film also opens flatly with some boring dialogue in an East Berlin auto shop and, in general, the film takes a while to get going and lacks a memorable action sequence - never a good sign in an action flick.The casting is not all that successful either. Armie Hammer does his best with a thinly drawn caricature of a character. He utilizes a Russian accent so thick it appears to have been intended to be comedic. Henry Cavill fares even worse. His dialogue, for instance, often appears as if it was dubbed or looped in at a later date. Instead of appearing as suave, cool and debonair, he comes off as robotic. And his character's attempts to come off as witty always feel forced. The performance was like a bad James Bond audition. He does look good in a suit however. The Man From U.N.C.L.E is thus like its leading man - beautiful to look at on its surface, but underneath not much to write home about.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Man from the United Network Command for Law Enforcement. Or is it men?I was in college back in the 1960s when the TV series was popular. With no computers, no internet, no cable, students could not watch TV in our rooms. In our high-rise men's dormitory we had one TV and it was in the big social room on the first floor at USL. All of us would find our way down there to watch and cheer on the most popular TV programs, "Man From U.N.C.L.E." was one of our favorites.This movie brings back the core characters from that TV series, British actor Henry Cavill in the part of American agent Solo, and American actor Armie Hammer in the part of Russian agent Illya. They start out as foes but quickly are ordered to become a team.They need to pick up one more specialist and it is Swedish actress Alicia Vikander as Gaby who, among other skills, is an experienced auto mechanic. (Vikander seems everywhere lately but it is for a good reason, she is very easy to look at and she is one of the best young female actors.) So in a movie like this the characters and action sequences are much more important than the actual story. Suffice to say it involves a rogue group who seek control of a small nuclear weapon and even more significantly, a software package that will allow its owner to control the world. Yep, that's a pretty big mission. Is there any doubt the good guys (and gals) of U.N.C.L.E. will prevail? All in all a very entertaining movie done is a semi-serious style with lots of humorous lines and humorous scenes. The ending seems to be setting it up for a sequel but nothing has been announced.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice throwback to the era of spy-fi.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Man From UNCLE was a long time in coming. Attempts at a revival go back to the 1980s, with nothing, other than a reunion TV movie, ever coming to fruition. Finally, Guy Ritchie delivered a film and it is one that captures the feel of the era. The Man From UNCLE grew out of the spy-fi craze that followed the success of the early James Bond films, and delivered weekly doses of superagents Napoleon Solo and Ilya Kuryakin, along with some amateur, as they matched wits with agents of THRUSH and other baddies. This time out, we get a sort of prequel, as American agent Napoleon Solo finds himself reluctantly working with KGB agent Ilya Kuryakin, as well as amateur Gabby Teller, as they hunt for Teller's father, a German nuclear scientist, in the hands of neo- Nazis. The film is set firmly in the period and gives us the intrigue of an escape over the Berlin Wall, car chases, brutal fistfights, elaborate gadgets, doublecrosses, exotic locales and everything that was great about the classic Bond films; and, to a lesser extent, UNCLE. Henry Caville and Armie Hammer make a fine duo and the film is a nice blend of humor, action, and intrigue, in the best traditions of UNCLE. No new ground is broken; however, an entertaining film is delivered, especially to those who miss the classic era of Bond films, where things were a bit larger than life.There are little nods here and there, for fans, as Solo is given a back story derived from such classics as Harry Palmer and David Callan (a crook blackmailed into working for an intelligence agency) and Kuryakin has touches in tribute to David McCallum and the UNCLE reunion film (where Kuryakin had become a fashion designer, after leaving UNCLE). If it has a failure, it's that the film sometimes buries some great scenes in montages, probably a nod to shorter attention spans of modern audiences. Even that is a minor flaw. My only other quibble is that the UNCLE special is largely buried in a nighttime action sequence, though we get a glimpse, of a different version, at the closing credits.All in all, this film delivers most of what I have been missing from the newer Bond films and the kind of sprawling adventure I always wanted on the TV series, good as it was. If you are a span of spy- fi, you will enjoy this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Glass is half full and half empty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tone of the movie: Director Ritchie should be commended for getting the tone of the movie right. The original TV series was a light hearted spy action series and this movie has captured that tone. There is one scene that is very dark but the tone shifts back immediately. Plot: This is the weak point of the movie. How many times people have seen a spy movie where the hero is after neutralizing a villain who has gotten his hands on a nuclear weapon? Old James Bond movies have used this plot many times over. Hero characters: The characters are well explained and their actions let us get into their heads. Henry Caville has the look and is very good as Solo. Armie Hammer's performance was a pleasant surprise. After playing that goofy version of Lone Ranger, he was able to play the role of Illya who is a darker character than Solo. Seeing the contrast between these two characters was one of the high points of the movie. Both actors did the best they could with the material that they were given. Villain characters: This is another weak point. The Villains are strong but not strong enough to let the audience feel that our heroes might not survive this ordeal. Directing and action sequences: This movie is about style over action. It is a subdued action movie. It is a movie that is targetted at a somewhat older audience (25 years and older). Director Ritchie and his second unit directors created a good escape sequence in act 1. There is an action packed and a thrilling boat chase sequence in act 2. However the final act 3 where you should floor it and push the pedal to the metal never reaches a high point that it should. This is important because the act 2 in this movie is somewhat slow and the dialogue is halting at some points. Now that you have lost momentum in act 2, you must make it up in act 3 by creating a memorable and exciting conclusion. Box office: I do not think WB knew exactly how much a stylish yet subdued spy action movie that is mostly targeted at 25 years and older can make in Summer. Now they know and it is not exactly what they had hoped for. It was not the Compton movie (a musical biopic about a hip hop band) that siphoned some of the audience away from the UNCLE movie (a spy action movie). The target audience for these two movies are different. It was that other successful 1960's TV series turned franchise (Mission Impossible) which is still running strong that siphoned off some of the audience away from UNCLE. It is Summer time and popcorn season. Joe only has 10 dollars and wants to see a spy action movie. He has a choice. He can spend it on UNCLE (a movie with moderate buzz at release time) or he can spend it on Mission Impossible (a movie with a lot of buzz) and see how Tom Cruise survives a ride clinging to a flying airplane. Final thoughts: As a fan of the old TV series, I am glad that the movie was finally made. Based on the box office performance and the buzz after the release, I do not think that there will be a sequel anytime soon (2-3 years). But I hope in the long run, it generates enough revenue so that a second UNCLE movie is made in the future. This is what happened to Hit-man Agent 47 movie. The first Hit-man movie was released in 2007 and the second one in 2015. It was great to see Solo and Illya on the big screen. For a moment, it felt like 1960's again.</fullReview>

They're great fun and more enjoyable than the grim-a-thons that the James Bond, Mission: Impossible and Jason Bourne franchises have churned out, though I love those as well. I thought the casting was a nice in-joke, pairing DC Comics' Superman with Marvel's Captain America, and I have loved Alicia Vikander's work since seeing her years ago in 'A Royal Affair'. I thought at the time she exuded both acting chops and sensuality out of every pore and would be a real monster if she ever went international--which she definitely has, both here and in 'Ex Machina'. Though I have never seen the TV series, I felt the camaraderie between the stars was refreshing, the car chases and other stunts were excellent, and, in a year most saturated with spy films (thankfully, for enthusiasts such as I), although it tanked at the box office, I for one hope it becomes a franchise. Why put the brakes on a good thing?...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful....but disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the most gorgeous movies I have ever seen. The attention to detail in setting up the whole sixties vibe is first class. The clothes, the cars, the gadgets, the fashions. All sumptuous. Not to mention the gene pool lottery winning cast of Henry Cavill (Man of Steel), Armie Hammer(The Lone Ranger), Elizabeth Debicki (The Great Gatsby) and Alicia Vikander (Ex Machina). Gorgeous. Everything was gorgeous.Why the was this one of the slowest 116 minutes of my life. I mean, Guy Ritchie has done some good stuff before. Remember the quick fire banter of Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels or Snatch. Remember the Chemistry of the Robert Downey Jr and Jude Law partnership in the Sherlock Holmes reboots.Therein lies the problem. The dialog was anything but quick fire, especially when you add in the laborious accents the two leads tried to carry off. Cavill and Hammer not only lack the charisma of a Robert Downey Jr and Jude Law individually but they also lacked any obvious chemistry with anyone else on the set. SPOILER: The attempt to add some sexual tension between Vikander and Hammer's characters was a dismal failure.In summary: Beautiful... but disappointing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie is amazing! The dialogs are perfect. Not too many words but the right ones said. Armie is so... Russian. :) Henry Cavill is so perfect. He kills the American accent and Im in owe of him lately. Since Man of Steel, I found the man gorgeous and quite an actor. To both Armie and Henry the role of a spy or secret service agent suits perfectly. They couldn't have found better actors. And yes I think its better they did not pick some very famous actors.Have some doubts on the girl though. Maybe a little more feminine woman would have been better. Definitely going to see some Richie and Cavill movies now. Absolutely recommend watching it, best alone and late at night as it captures your attention and you enjoy it better with no one else talking and ruining it. although the movie its a remake, I really liked it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had no expectations for this movie going in. My college aged son told me it was fun, and he was right. This movie is fun! It reminded me a bit of the old Bond movies with Sean Connery. The costumes were spot on for the 60s. The make up and hair really brought me back. It was like paging through a fashion magazine from the 60s. The sets were great. It's an action packed romp with just enough romantic tension to make gals happy too. There was nothing to 'pull me out' of the movie and make me have to suspend disbelief. This is not an action movie with no story. The character development was well done. I really enjoyed it and I hope they make a sequel.</fullReview>

Finally not the same people over and over again such as Ferrel, Stiller, Sandler, Rudd, and a bunch of other so called comedians who bore me, etc, etc and aren't even funny let alone exciting. I don't get how a movie like ant man got better reviews? I couldn't even finish watching it. Finally a diverse, gorgeous and sexy cast too. I think everyone played their roles perfectly.

		<shortDescription>TV fare, but the wrong series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's hard to imagine who the audience for "The Man from U.N.C.L.E." might be. I went to it expecting a camp homage to the '60s television series that starred Robert Vaughn and David McCallum. Instead I found what looked like an extended episode of "White Collar," with superior special effects and an eccentric soundtrack, awkwardly removed to the decade that gave us the Berlin Wall and the Kennedy assassination. It must be said, however, that everybody looks good, even if they rarely get out of their tight-fitting suits. Matt Bomer-lookalike Henry Cavill's character is known mostly as Solo, presumably because the writers were concerned that modern audiences wouldn't know who Napoleon was (this is NOT the generation that learned its history at the knees of Bill and Ted), and Illya Kuryakin is now a hulking Armie Hammer, whose main asset seems to be that he has the stamina of the Energizer Bunny but can't control his temper. I found it pretty to watch and actually kind of fun. But then I'm hardly the demographic Hollywood is aiming at, even if I did survive the '60s. All of which is to say, I didn't buy the popcorn.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Got to see this fun flick at a Thursday night premiere with my significant other. The cast seemed to have as much fun playing their roles as I did seeing them perform on screen. Henry Cavil in particular seemed to enjoy portraying Napoelean Solo and captured the spirit of Robert Vaughn's portrayal in the original 1964-1968 T.V show. Armie Hammer made for a different Ilya Kuryakin from David MacCallum's original portrayal. Swedish newcomer Alicia Vikander was a lovably plucky heroine. Hugh Grant was a somewhat snarkier Mr. Waverly than the original played by Leo G. Caroll. Elizabeth Debicki was an excellent femme fatale as the villainess. The costumes made me wish I could hop into a time machine and travel to the '60s. The action sequences were reminiscent of the early Sean Connery James Bond pictures,which inspired the original T.V. show. The plot twists with a reveal that the heroine was cooperating with British intelligence. If you enjoy old-fashioned spy adventures,such as the original T.V. show, run to a theater near you and say "U.N.C.L.E.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the 60's, the CIA agent Napoleon Solo (Henry Cavill) is assigned to bring the mechanic Gaby Teller (Alicia Vikander) from East Berlin to the other side of the wall. Gaby is the daughter of the scientist and American collaborator Udo Teller that defected from German at the end of WWII and now has vanished. They are chased by KGB agent Illya Kuryakin (Armie Hammer) but they succeed to escape. Soon Napoleon Solo's chief Saunders (Jared Harris) discloses that Gaby's uncle Rudi (Sylvester Groth) works for the wealthy Alexander (Luca Calvani) and his wife Victoria Vinciguerra (Elizabeth Debicki) and Udo might be secretly building a nuclear weapon for them. Napoleon Solo is forced to team-up with Illya and Gaby and they go to Rome to investigate. "The Man from U.N.C.L.E." is a deceptive and overrated film by Guy Ritchie. The story does not have the charm or the humor of the original series and films. Henry Cavill and Armie Hammer are not funny and the uneven and forgettable screenplay is silly in many parts. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): "O Agente da U.N.C.L.E." ("The Agent from U.N.C.L.E.")</fullReview>

The talent and magnetic presence of the lead actors are wasted on this film (Cavill, Vikander, Hammer). While the frames are intriguing enough, the dialogue is so inane. This is proof that merely slathering the screen with attractive people is not enough to keep the viewer's attention. One needs to actually develop the characters, duh. The pacing is so painstakingly slow. Also, the writers wasted a solid premise. I mean, spy stuff are supposed to be interesting! This was a huge disappointment.

The bad acting from overall so called their leading actor make it more unbearable to watch.At the and of credit rolling, I just wonders, How Hollywood Can produce this kind of movie?

I know not everyone wants funny in spy movie but I can't help but think that some of the negative reviews on here are based on either a hatred of Guy Richie or a jealousy about the attractive male leads! There is very little to dislike about this movie, it has slick production, good acting which is complimented by the type of old school script that stays true to the original.

		<shortDescription>Good Retro Spy Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2015 was a good year for spy movies. It had been a while since Hollywood gave us so much variety in a genre that was limited to Bourne &amp; Bond for a decade or so. The year started with the excellent KingsMan and its superhero-ey over the top tone. We had a solid Mission Impossible, a solid 007 and then Man from U.N.C.L.E - a surprising choice - to finish the year. Not the strongest license (who really knew this TV series in 2015?) ad not the strongest cast (ah! right, it's the Superman guy) so this was built on the strength of Guy Richie's name... and unfortunately he has had a few misses in the recent past. But, it was fun. Yeah, probably the most tongue in cheek entry of the lot, with some successful retro scenes, comic book panel montages and retro tech that Bond doesn't really do anymore. Some funky characters, fairly strong acting that doesn't take itself seriously, it was fun. One could criticize the convoluted third act but, at the end of the day, it doesn't hurt the enjoyment so no need to address it in this otherwise positive review!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Man from NOT BAD genre-land</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I keep going back and forth in my head about this one. On the one hand, you should almost expect that this will be a total style over substance piece of Hollywood action fluff, and lo and behold it is. But on the other hand Ritchie casts it with such appealing leads (Henry Cavill shows why he is a star, Armie Hammer fights a Russian accent but has probably the most character to work with, or at least background to play from, and Alicia Vikander is sex on a stick) that it's kind of a shame they aren't given a meatier script.I'm not sure if the show was the same way, but the movie of 'U.N.C.L.E.' is so slick that you're almost worried the movie will trip over itself while it goes on. It's full of action that, at first (that opening chase scene at night between Cavill and Hammer that you saw in the trailers) is exciting and shows off Ritchie's flair for staging elaborate fairly simple set pieces but with the composition and cutting of someone trying to keep pushing his own envelope. But that's at first; by the time it gets to some of the other action (the escape from that one, uh, compound locked in by water, the chase through the forest-y parts by motorcycle and, uh, kart, yes in 1963) it's kind of become monotonous.Which is why the actors do such a good job of keeping things in motion and interesting - Hammer actually does get more likable as the movie goes on, since his character actually has to struggle against his own worst impulses, and Cavill is great at being this dude Solo (no, not that one, though I notice the coincidence) - even as the twists pile on to the point where it becomes just too much. There is an element of fun, but it's not totally consistent; I'll laugh at one thing, and then go about 20 minutes staring like it's an art museum of a spy movie. Then I'll laugh again (during, of all things, the second half of a torture scene) and I'll perk up again.So it's something that I can recommend, but not something that you should go out of your way to see; it has beautiful locations and beautiful actors (even the villainess is basically like the spawn of Catherine Deneuve or something), and, holy hell that IS Hugh Grant right there, it's nice to see him again. Perhaps it's not fair to compare, but it's hard to when the calendar year this was released, 2015, also had Kingman (by Ritchie ex-producer Matthew Vaughan) and Rogue Nation, and used the genre to much greater effect. It ends on a satisfying note, and is probably a masterpiece for like a nothing-to-do cable weekend afternoon watch, if that makes sense.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1963, the height of the Cold War. In an unlikely alliance, a CIA agent, Napoleon Solo (played by Henry Cavill) and KGB agent, Illya Kuryakin (Armie Hammer), band together to save the world from nuclear disaster. A top nuclear scientist, formerly employed by the US, has gone missing. It is suspected his brother has kidnapped him to work on a nuclear bomb. Solo and Kuryakin accompany the scientist's daughter, Gaby (Alicia Vikander), to Rome, as this is where her uncle is based. The idea is to covertly investigate his company and, hopefully, find the scientist and the bomb. Things aren't all plain sailing though. This is heightened by the fact that Solo and Kuryakin aren't sure they can trust each other and, to some extent, still regard each other as enemies.An entertaining action-espionage caper. Decent plot, though a tad basic and formulaic. Some great, humorous banter, and that's what elevates the movie above the average spy or action movie. Solid performances from Henry Cavill and Armie Hammer in the lead roles. The stand out performance, however, is from Alicia Vikander who is delightful as Gaby.The cast also includes Hugh Grant and Elizabeth Debicki, and neither of them disappoint.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another brilliant action-comedy from Guy Ritchie. I never saw the 60s television series of the same name, but this was very convenient for his style of portraying the tough men showing off their strength. The actors were simply wonderful, two year commitment by the two lead guys for this project definitely payed off well and Alicia Vikander filled the feminine void perfectly. I think it was one of the best trio in the movies I ever seen, very powerful and I hope it lasts for a trilogy.The story sets in the 60s during the cold war tension between the world's two superpowers. But the film's specialty was, it does not render clash between them, instead they come together to fight the rogue forces who plan blitz against them. Very humorous, highly entertaining with a swift pace and amazing action sequences.I don't think the narration had any unique twist and turn, instead I call it a smartly written screenplay. So the overall movie was so good, but not a top-notch. My disappointment came from the technical side in some of parts, especially the bike and car chase in the last quarter that you can clearly tell a fake (greenscreen/bluescreen shot). Other than the main plot and its clever scenes, the movie did not offer distinctive features. Just taking away a ? point is what places it on a line between good and average, but I definitely consider it a good.6?/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It starts out quaint enough ? a gentleman introduces himself to a mechanic whom turns out to be a woman. Not only is there some straight to the point banter between the two, but the gentleman has business with her ? he needs to know about the disappearance of her real father. Turns out he is related to some atomic bomb activity with Nazi Germany.I'm sure where you know the rest of this goes, so I'll leave that part out.The man from uncle has a very tongue-in-cheek, but also very impressive car chase that ensues and is probably one of the better ones I've seen in a movie. Not only is it completely unbelievable and choreographed dare what I would call 'perfect', but it is also quite humorous and this movie needs it ? as the movie tends to be quite serious with itself and I can see why. The Man from U.N.C.L.E. might play out similar to a James Bond film in scope and feel, but lacks many of the expected action sequences, disrespectful humor and otherwise killings. On the topic of disrespectful humor ? most of the protagonists and antagonists have an air of respect for each other ? in regards to humor scenes, there is quite a bit of 'respectful' play and banter that ensues. This helps lighten the movie a bit and makes for an enjoyable watch when the movie otherwise maintains the same 'serious', but at times 'dull' capacity towards the end of the film.There is some point-to-point romance determined by their fates for whom they work for, but the main characters tend to be strictly business ? it is about getting the job done. There are a few clashes between many of the main characters, and less so of the 'narrowly got away' trope that seems to plague bond films. There is usually a climax to chase scenes in this film, but I will not spoil them and how they work. I will say that the villain almost wins here, but it would be any fun if I spoiled that either.I recommend the movie as a watch ? it is different from other types of spy films in the fact it doesn't rely on over the top special effects, out of this world situations (this one is believable) and it does not resort to action sequences to make up the bulk of the film. If anything, a sequel to this movie could start quite a good seriesOriginally posted to Orion Age (http://www.orionphysics.com/? p=10475)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One fun 'UNCLE:' an enjoyable, clever retro spy flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Finally, a franchise-starter fitting of Guy Ritchie. The director who shot to fame with British crime comedies "Snatch" and "Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels" was errantly assigned to Hollywood's revival of Sherlock Holmes, which wasn't a failure by any means, but a venture with limited upside. With "The Man from U.N.C.L.E.," Ritchie's filmmaking instincts are put to more appropriate use in a period spy flick.The entire "U.N.C.L.E." operation from the onset has a much more low-key approach than "Sherlcok Holmes," with younger up-and-comers in lead roles: Henry Cavill of "Man of Steel" fame, Armie Hammer ("The Lone Ranger") and Alicia Vikander ("Ex Machina"). It's got plenty of flash per Ritchie's style, but there's something humble about the film from its period trappings to the showcasing of emerging talent.Based on the Sam Rolfe TV series from the '60s, which is to say the built-in audience is extremely small, "U.N.C.L.E." sees American spy Napoleon Solo (Cavill) and Soviet spy Illya Kuryakin (Hammer) in Cold War-era Europe forced to work together with an East German defect (Vikander) whose father was captured by a private criminal organization in Italy and forced into building them a nuclear bomb. It's the kind of predictable plot the spy thriller was founded on, but as a period piece, it's a welcome throwback."U.N.C.L.E." is bursting with colors, clothes, hairstyles and accessories that'll make you pine for the Sean Connery "Bond" years. With no shortage of contemporary spy franchises (featuring Bond, Bourne and Hunt), a retro action movie with a plot utilizing minimal technological devices (literal devices and plot devices) is refreshing. It also means really strong direction, writing and production values are needed to engaged and thrill the audience. The action and pace of "U.N.C.L.E." isn't exactly high-octane (though it has its moments), so it takes wit, creativity and style to keep the audiences surprised and engaged. Good thing, then, that wit, creativity and style are Ritchie's specialties. There's a boat chase, for example, that we see only in the reflection of a windshield behind which Napoleon Solo eats a sandwich ? with an ironic soundtrack in the background, of course. On the other hand, a climactic off-road chase employs a lot of modern techniques including an impressive eye-in-the-sky view that quickly zooms in and out onto characters in disparate spots in the same general location.The plot isn't exactly gripping, but the characters make up for it. Cavill is at his leading man best as Solo, an American James Bond (the irony being that Cavill is British). The sense of humor and smugness of the character really fits Cavill's strengths. Hammer gets a bit more of the dramatic work as the stoic, hot-tempered Kuryakin. And Vikander is far from their love interest, a good thing considering her talents aren't worthy of anything less.Even with all the great talents and costumes, "The Man from U.N.C.L.E." doesn't quite do enough to stand out in its genre, but there were far more things that worked well in the film than poorly, and there's a lot of potential for the series going forward, especially if Ritchie remains involved. Hopefully, movie renters will give it the fair shake it didn't get from moviegoers during its theatrical run.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit Movie Muse Reviews for more</fullReview>

The movie stars Henry Cavill as a CIA agent and Armie Hammer as a KGB agent who have to work together to take down a crime organization that is planning on creating nuclear warheads. The movie itself bears a very sleek and stylized look through out as most of Guy Ritchie's movies do. The movie also does a very good job in capturing the 1960s European feel with its costume design and set design which provides for compelling viewing. The movie yields a lot truly entertaining comedy mainly being conjured through Cavill and Hammer's chemistry on screen. The film is genuinely funny at times which is harder to find in today's action flick. The film does not have any obvious flaws which made the film less entertaining, however I did feel as though there could have been more character development for the villains as I felt as though they were to cartoonish at times and needed to have more relatable human like qualities. Overall The Man from U.N.C.L.E is a beautiful, entertaining espionage movie that is definitely worth watching if you are looking to entertain yourself momentarily.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Man from U.N.C.L.E. is a spy film based on the 1960s TV series of the same name. For the most part I enjoyed it. Even though I've never seen the original series, this adaptation takes enough liberties with its source material to make it watchable for today's modern audiences.In 1963, American CIA agent Napoleon Solo (Henry Cavill) and Russian KGB agent Illya Kuryakin (Armie Hammer) are forced to work together by their respective superiors to stop a mysterious criminal organisation from reproducing nuclear weapons to the rest of the world. Being sworn enemies, Solo and Kuryakin don't take kindly to one another's way of approaching their jobs as a spy, but with the threat of nuclear annihilation looming, the two realise that there are bigger issues to deal with than their petty rivalry.As a throwback to the classic Cold War era spy movies, the film works reasonably well. Henry Cavill and Armie Hammer have good on-screen chemistry and I enjoyed the culture clash banter between the two of them. My biggest complaint however, is that the story isn't particularly interesting. It's the typical, clichéd "save the world from destruction" plot line that we've all seen before. Despite offering nothing new to the spy movie genre, this film is still enjoyable popcorn entertainment and worth at least one viewing.I rate it 7/10.</fullReview>

Almost no flaws (a few explanations would be nice, for instance: what's a camera doing on a taxi and why, or: why are false eyelashes so obvious, but ...), with apparent mixture of many similar movies and themes, action and comedy, but done as it should be. I hope Mr. Ritchie continues to make sequels to this one and keep the level high as set by himself here. Highly recommended. Have fun as I did! :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Guy is Ritchie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed the movie with all my senses! Like always when I saw a Guy Ritchie's film. From the beginning, I felt that feeling that only Guy Ritchie can brings in cinemas, in my opinion. It's about the storyline, the high-speed happening events, the humor compound with drama or realistic scenes...and of course, it's also about the soundtracks.Throughout the movie, I heard in background (in the same time when the action caught my attention), a specific sound that rapt me suddenly to the other Ritchie's film like Sherlock Holmes (part I &amp; part II), Snatch, RocknRolla, etc. These specific sounds keep the auditor stuck on the screen till the movie's end. Subconsciously, the soundtracks works in each our mind and create an original trademark movie, a Guy Ritchie label. Compared with Sherlock Holmes, the soundtrack seems to be the same, but the storyline and the actions are different with at least a century of time events.I confess that I didn't see the original TV series, but I think that, this version compressed enough stories, details, humor and action...specific to 1960s period, when the Cold War born out, among others, these kind of terrors and false alarms.I think that, Solo is the American version for James Bond and Illya is the new version for a Russian spy, a character that doesn't appear until now on the screens.The Man from U.N.C.L.E., is a "2015 must see" movie. The Man is Guy and the guy is Ritchie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfect !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a long-time fan of the original series who has watched rights disputes, and cast and director changes over the years, I viewed the Prue-release publicity with high hopes and low expectations. But in the end, the film itself was a wonderful surprise! Witty, light-hearted without being a spoof and dramatic without being heavy-handed. The two main characters were updated from what was allowable in 60s television to satisfying and engaging modern versions of their original incarnations, and the attendant allies and villains were all one could want. The film was very much what the series could have been were it being done now, in the era of Game of Thrones and Mad Men. I've been twice and will be going again, as well as buying the DVD. Open Channel D; this film is more than I dared hope for!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a very fun and aesthetically pleasing film, with both action and comedy infused perfectly together. What I mean by aesthetically pleasing is that the visuals are incredible with the colour and images very crisp. Basically speaking, this film has style. The fast pace of the film keeps you engaged throughout and the editing and visual effects are also well executed.Cavill does a really great job with his character, playing the charming and confident American spy to a 'T'. Hammer is also very good and his sometimes awkward and shy demeanour around Gaby is hilarious, though his anger management issues is a bit concerning and I can't help but wonder if it is a bit stereotypical. Vikander plays her part well too, and the chemistry between her and Hammer is well established and too cute to watch. Cavill and Hammer also have good bromance chemistry, and their constant attempt at outdoing each other is fun to watch.The script is superbly written with both vocal and visual humour incorporated. In that effect, this is also due to the result of great cinematography and directing. The soundtrack goes well with the film, and is very influential in creating the comedic effect of scenes. The film does an excellent job at manipulating the emotions of the audience, with great music accompaniment, visual style, editing, and acting.The story is a little typical in the sense that it is a spy film, and includes what spy films usually have (a charming fellow, sex, a little violence, betrayal etc.) But does go a beyond being just a spy film with great humour, bromance and multiple protagonists (though Solo is a little more focused on). Although of course, this means that the film is highly testosterone charged and doesn't even pass the Bechdel test.Overall, a really well made film which is fun to watch and certain to hold your attention for its whole duration.Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Man from U.N.C.L.E.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the early 60s, United States and USSR were on the brink of war, but both countries had a far greater threat to worry about: two Italian Nazi admirers, a married couple, the Vinciguerras, Victoria (Elizabeth Debicki) and Alexander (Luca Calvani). They have brought in a former Nazi named Udo Teller (Christian Berkel) to work at their "shipping company", but he's actually developing a nuclear warhead for them to carry out what Hitler was unable to. Global anarchy is in store if the very rival countries don't attempt to keep them from success. However, the knowledge Udo has is quite well desired by both the States and Russia. So the CIA will use their safecracker (and former military sergeant) named Solo (the latest Superman incarnation, Henry Cavill) and Russia will team him up with their human weapon, Kuryakin (Armie Hammer). After Solo "secures" Udo's daughter, Gaby (Alicia Vikander), from East Berlin, after opposition from Kuryakin, neither is too pleased with having to join forces, but the mission itself requires a sacrifice no matter how unpleasant it might be for those involved. So Kuryakin and Gaby reluctantly pose as a couple in order to gain a closeness to Gaby's Uncle Rudi (Sylvester Groth) while Solo is under the disguise of antiquities dealer (while displaying his pickpocketing/thefting prowess to Victoria during a junction involving her husband driving an Indy car). Will the trio be successful or will the Italian Nazis get their warhead and nuclear tech to topple any and all that they so choose? As you might expect, Ritchie incorporates layers of Hollywood style and his savvy at using the techniques afforded to him by a large budget allows for plenty of camera and editing magic (see what he does with split screen, using the comic book box style in particular during the raid of a compound on an island where the nuclear warhead has been built by a German scientist). The leads are handsome and GQ enough to build a big budget Hollywood Summer action adventure around. While I think there's plenty of Ritchie directorial bravado and star stud testosterone heroism, along with colorful 60s décor and period art design, it is a lot of money spent with little in the way of emotional investment or heart. This often comes in the summer, as lots of Hollywood money floods productions putting out content that fails to generate much else except 114 minutes of empty entertainment. It looks great and the cast fits handsomely with the production. However, this had the misfortune of being in the theaters around the same time as the superior Mission: Impossible?Rogue Nation. The film doesn't have a lot of meat on the bones but the bones are attractive. Caville proves here is so comfortable on screen, almost carrying it singlehandedly on his star power, while Hammer is all brooding and intensity. They try hard to gel as the odd couple and sometimes are fun to watch. Debicki puckers her lips, owning her cold snobbery like a champ. Alicia is an unusual beauty, not the kind you normally see in her part?she isn't ever exploited as some bombshell, but her costuming brings out a lot of demure prettiness (she incorporates a toughness and brashness I liked).I think the best scene comes late in the film where Udo, who elaborates his psychopathy in a monologue about how the World War allowed him to incorporate torture into an artform, as Cavill's Solo is bound to a chair and electric shock the method of his potential demise (Victoria gives him a goodbye smooch wishing she could remain to enjoy the show but unable to do so due to the whole nuclear warhead transport and project conclusion). How Hammer's Russian returns a rescue from death Solo granted him earlier (he nearly drowns when they raid the shipping yard realizing uranium was there), and how Udo gets more than a taste of his own medicine is neat poetic justice. Hugh Grant as a MI6 head gets some brief time to make his presence felt but he's still rather wasted.A director like Ritchie, when given a lot of money, is turned loose to go crazy, as he does with the climactic buggy chase (with Hammer on motorcycle), as a vast countryside with plenty of curving roads are shot in a variety of ways he exploits to the fullest. The guy's talented regardless if most of his films are all flash, with little else.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a shockingly weak action movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really expected something much better. I've seen some of the Guy Ritchie's movies and honestly each one of them was better than this. I'm not really sure why does it have such a high rating like 7.6, because 6, which I give it for entertainment values, is already overrated. The movie does not thrill or hold in suspense. The acting is okay, but surely not above average. I expected some good humour, but it was also very lame. The story is really weak, like from a Van Damme or Seagal movie. There are a couple of moments when the form of the film shines, but the content never does. And the worst of all is being (or, in fact, not being) realistic/authentic/credible. I don't want to waste my time for listing all the specific examples, like I usually do, but I just want to spare other people wasting two hours of their time. Almost none of the fragments of this movie hold together, have logical sense or is coherent. This is just one of the worst "classic action" movies I've seen lately. It's even worse than a typical Bond movie.I don't recommend it to anyone who expects some level out of a movie, even if it's just an action movie. Don't count on me to see the next part ;)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The odds were against this project before the cameras even started to roll.With possibly one exception -- Kingsman, more of an homage than anything else, and surprisingly entertaining -- every attempt to recreate content from this period, or even capture the spirit, has failed, and miserably.This is yet another coulda, shoulda, woulda film that seems to start off with a clever premise, and tries extra hard, but in the end leaves the viewer watching the clock and wondering which outfit to wear to work the next morning...Aside from being massively overwritten, to a point almost of absurdity, the failure here is less due to specific factors than to the premise itself. And the premise was that it could be possible to recreate the fun, the allure, the joie de vivre, of an entire decade merely by cool outfits and clever dialog.Were this the case, the DVD collection of HAPPY DAYS would be a major bestseller.

		<shortDescription>Nothing too special about this handsome spy romp</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With more style than a Kardashian's wardrobe and with a trio of unnaturally attractive leads, Guy Ritchie's modern take on the moderately successful 1960's TV show The Man from U.N.C.L.E is certainly a film that's easy to look at and has a breezy carefree nature but it's also a film that stays so incredibly close to playing it safe that for a director known for his energy and non-conforming style, it remains a curiously questionable adventure that when judged on Box Office numbers, not many people were calling out for.From my understanding a passion project for Ritchie who has a great fondness for the original property, UNCLE is a film driven by Ritchie but it's destination isn't what we've come to expect from the man that gave us the one two punch of Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and Snatch and found success with his modern take on the Sherlock Holmes stories. Uncle lacks the action and more dark nature of many of Ritchie's greatest successes and there's an overhanging cloud that follows the films runtime that can't be shaken, a cloud of misjudged scenarios that promise much yet deliver only in parts.It may seem twee or even wrong to suggest that UNCLE is boring but in the modern day and age of movie making you can't help but escape the fact that UNCLE could've benefited greatly from more exciting set pieces. There are small glimpses of this, an opening car chase and a snappily edited later car chase and a scene where Henry Cavill's Solo has an impromptu picnic in a military truck is quite witty, but for much of UNCLE's runtime you'll be wondering where the real excitement is going to come from as its most surely not coming from it's two dull male leads.Much has been made of the questions being asked of both Henry Cavill (after Man of Steel) and Armie Hammer (after The Lone Ranger) and their abilities as leading man and UNCLE will do nothing but strengthen the argument against them. Delivering potentially ripe dialogue with an ever dry dullness and seemingly incapable of more than a handful of looks, Cavill and in particular Hammer (with bad Russian accent in full effect) bring UNCLE down where it could've made inroads and the films acting trope is saved by yet another impressive turn from Alicia Vikander as the mysterious Gaby.With a plot line almost to lame to bare and with a two pronged attack of boorish male leads, UNCLE is quite lucky that it doesn't fail more harshly than it does which is thanks to a clear love from director Ritchie and the increasingly likable Vikander. With signposted intentions of this film being the cornerstone of a new series, on the basis of this entry I think we've officially seen the last of UNCLE team despite a small sprinkling of life that can be found in the film's most efficient scenes.2 ? perfectly packed picnic baskets out of 5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spies, sex, suits, music and a collection of the greatest sports cars in history.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Man from U.N.C.L.E. is a masterpiece that ticks all the boxes; quality soundtrack, superb script, spectacular acting and one hundred percent addictive. I have never considered myself to be a Guy Ritchie fan (Snatch, Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels), in fact I never would of even considered this film to be one of my favourites from watching the trailer, but I thought, to hell with it, and added it to my watch list. After all, Ritchie's attempt of resurrecting the Sherlock story was a huge success. Two films that I can't find many flaws in, if in fact any at all. Once more Ritchie has made a film that I can watch over, and over, and over again. And I'm so glad I have. The 1960's is my favourite period, and being such a fanatic, I can tell you it's difficult to find a good film that contains every aspect of the swinging century, including spies, sex, suits, music and a collection of the greatest sports cars in history.This film is spectacularly set, to begin with, in the Eastern zone of a recovering post war Germany, where we find the stunning brunette Gaby Teller (Alicia Vikander), that runs her own chop shop. However, as swiftly as Gaby is "saved" from the Soviet Sector, by Napoleon Solo (Henry Cavill), from Illya Kuryakin (Armie Hammer), we are taken into West Germany. Here, after a ruckus in a public restroom, the narrative is set. After the undesirable pairing of CIA agent Solo and KGB operative Kuryakin, we are taken to Italy, an unlikely setting for a cold war film I thought. It is here where the friction filled duo, and our "helpless damsel" that is dragged along with them, must stop a group of Neo-Nazi's, who obviously didn't get the message after the previous attempts of a fascist state didn't work out so well. Here in Italy we see all the sights; the gorgeous Roman architecture, the dazzling blue Mediterranean Sea and a packed racetrack, which plays host to a decedent afternoon garden party. The collection of seductive, exotic European accents, and a slightly annoying American one, pulls you into the film more than anything else. The exotic and the suave and ridiculously cocky captivates.Not only are the performances and settings superb, the attention to detail gives no room for mistake. The props compliment every exciting setting, such as the little ice cream truck Kuryakin races around winding Italian mountain passes in, the Vespa that the two spies ride around the streets of Rome together and the variety of tumblers? often at the clutch of Solo. I wasn't joking when I said this film ticked all the boxes, the editing is expertly executed. The bright yellow slab-serif titles give the film its fitting theme for nostalgia. This film endlessly uses elements suited to the era.Fast paced editing is appropriately exercised for both the exciting scenes, as well as the tense action, which is captured in the comic strip style. The use of flashback narrative so brilliantly drives the story forward and tricks us as viewers into indulging in the "who's side are they really on". It also adds a little comedy, which this film is not short of. The editing of sound however, is the real gem of this film, with its use of sound bridging and synchronously adding romantic jazz to the soundtrack.Every character successfully makes this story real, particularly Solo's annoying personality. Who would of known anyone could be so in love with himself. Never wear a suit that "doesn't go" otherwise he would never let you live it down. I find it funny how he reminds me of a few people I know, which is just what makes this character realistic and not ridiculously fictitious. Kuryakin is the uptight, angry perfectionist that we all know, paired with the Soviet naivety makes him comically lovable and just plain charming. The pair's friction somehow works to make them the perfect team and in the end you actually see a friendship forming. The character I never expected to see in this film is the fair-haired, romantic-flick king himself Hugh Grant. His character cracks me up and for once he's playing a funny but sophisticated British gentleman that you just can't hate. After all the stick he gets for appearing in so many romantic comedies, the patriot inside me gave a little cheer as he sat comfortably in his genuine role. Of course no spy film is complete without a femme fatal. That role is filled by Victoria Vinciguerra (Elizabeth Debicki). The indulgent aristocrat is a fanatical fascist with a snivelling ex-Nazi as her crony, who is a little too comical for the grim reality of WW2.For me the soundtrack (Daniel Pemberton) is what finishes this film off and gift-wraps it. I fell in love with it and haven't stopped listening. I have discovered my love for smooth jazz and Latin American rhythm. My favourite scene, that I have fond memories of watching every time I have stuck this film on, I play over and over in my head. Solomon Burke's 'Cry To Me' gives the little East German girl dancing around in her pyjamas and sunglasses such gravitas. The soundtrack is a certainly a romantic one that is bound to make anyone fall in love with this film as much as I have. My heart sinks a little every time the movie ends and is wrapped up by Nina Simone in the credits.Read more of my reviews at www.filmcritblog.wordpress.com</fullReview>

Definitely in my Top 5 of 2015!I don't know if it was my low expectations but it had a pretty awesome cast, it was entertaining, full of action, drama and comedy. It was classic looking, sleek, gritty and smooth.I loved that the villain was a strong, smart woman who wasn't scantily dressed and another thing was an awesome split screen action montage.This was a movie that I could have turned around and gone back in and watched it again.Most certainly worth a watch, I will be watching it again and even buying it on Bluray as soon as possible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Retro All the Way?A Bold Experiment in Style that Mostly Works</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gimmicky Director Guy Ritchie is on full Restraint in this Reboot of the Popular 1960's TV Show. Deliberately making a Movie that Bucks postmodern Trends and audience Expectations.It's a Smoothy of a Groovy Movie as it takes its Time presenting Action Scenes with Screen Time that allows the Brain to take in what the Eye Sees, and what the Eye Sees is a Beautifully Crafted Film that not only takes place in the Sixties, but could have been a Movie Edited in the Sixties. Elegant, Frothy, and full of Eye Candy that often times looks like Magazine Ads and just as Glossy. There is no shortage of Beautiful People on Screen as Armie Hammer, Henry Cavill, and Alicia Vikander try to find a Nuclear Scientist that has been Kidnapped, before He can Deliver a Device.It's standard Cold War Stuff and the Movie handles it Cool. It is a welcome Breather from the Hyper-Ness of other Franchise, Super-Hero, Spy Stuff and Audiences should be Prepared for the Change. Because Frankly it is quite a Different way to Present This type of thing Today and the Knee-Jerk reaction is to Reject its deliberate Style. But it mostly works as one can see the Pendulum Swinging Back to another Era in the way Movies were made and Enjoyed.It's Retro in the purist Sense and deserves Kudos for giving it a try, because it isn't a Given that this Type of Thing will be Accepted. Overall, if one gets the Vibe, it can be a pleasant Diversion and a Delightful Experience if nothing more than a Contrast to Current expectations.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a big fan of the original Man From U.N.C.L.E. And when I first heard George Clooney was going to be Napoleon Solo I was excited. then he pulled out and tom Cruise was in and I was heartbroken. then Cruise left and Cavill was in and I was happy again. Armie Hammer is pitch perfect as Kuryakin the Russian Solo is forced to work with. both Agents have a strong dislike for each other and when ordered that they must seize a disk that can make the nation possessing it the most powerful nation on earth. The problem is the disk belongs to a bomb maker who is the one bomb maker in the world who can make a atomic bomb that no other nation has. He's so far ahead of the curve. The problem is he's gone missing and a terror organization has him. They recruit the man's daughter Gaby to help find him. Solo and Kuryakin are ordered to retrieve the disk and kill the other agent if needed. There is twists and turns .And you never lose interest. The 60's setting is perfectly in place. you get the feeling you're watching a 60's flick and that bit of magic is Guy Ritchie's light touch. At no time does Ritchie lose his touch. nor does he let the film run away from him. He reins it in and keeps us glued to the movie wondering what is going to happen next. I would love to see another Man From U.N.C.L.E as this one was too wonderful to leave at just one. First Class all the way.</fullReview>

Truthfully I don't know that the source material really provides the blueprint for anything more than what we get here anyway, so anything we get above the rather low hanging bar is simply a bonus to be savored.The film itself looks gorgeous, and this may be the best looking cast ever. Definitely not the sort of film you want to watch if you're feeling a bit insecure that day. They do more than look pretty however.

		<shortDescription>An okay movie, but not really tied to the TV series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was raised in the 1960's. Even before the original series of The Man From U.N.C.L.E. aired, I knew I was going to love it. And I did. Watching the adventures of Napoleon Solo and Illya Kuryakin each week was a joy -- until the dreaded third season, when a show-runner was brought in who clearly had no understanding of the show. That's also what happened with this movie. Don't get me wrong: the movie is enjoyable enough -- it's just not The Man From U.N.C.L.E. They borrowed the names, but then gave us some other movie. Worth seeing? Perhaps. It's a decent enough adventure flick. U.N.C.L.E.? Not even close. The casting was somewhat on-target. Henry Cavill as Napoleon was pretty good, and he looked the part. Hugh Grant was nice as Alexander Waverly (though a mere shadow of the always wonderful Leo G. Carroll.) His part was small, so hard to get a complete read. Armie Hammer as Illya? No, sorry! As a generic action performer, okay. But as the sophisticated Russian agent, way off target. Another example of this actor being miscast... which seems to be the bulk of his career, so far. Also miscast was the director: Guy Ritchie. He tried to throw in Every Trick from Every Movie he's done. Some of them worked, but not most. As a screenwriter, he gave his lead characters backgrounds that were particularly lame. Solo's was downright hackneyed. I don't want to engage in spoilers, here: Ritchie just added a background that's been used in about 2 million spy movies in the past 50 years. (Well, maybe only 1-1/2 million. Consult The Ipcress File for more information.) Alicia Vikander, by the way, was good, and suitably attractive. Her part was not in the original TV series, so stands alone in the film. The villain name Alexander was used in the movie, but appears to be no relation to the excellent villain in the series (played by the also wonderful Rip Torn.) The screenwriter borrows a couple of additional names from Ian Fleming, possibly due to Fleming's short-lived connection to the original series. We were all treated to the extreme over-use of the name "Count Lippe" (refer to Thunderball.) To sum up, if you want an average action spy movie, this one will do. If you're after The Man From U.N.C.L.E., buy the series on DVD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a fan if guy Ritchie and enjoy snatch and his Sherlock Holmes films. After seeing the trailer I was really excited for the man from uncle and I enjoyed it even though I wish it had been a little better. The premise of the film is that in the 1960s an American and Russian agent have to work together to stop a group of terrorists from setting off a nucleur bomb. I love Henry cavill as superman but I've been looking forward to seeing him in something else and he is good in this movie. He plays the smooth wisecracking ladies man and it is easy to like his character especially due to his chemistry with armie hammer. Hammer is an actor u haven't really liked in the past but I also thought he was good in this movie. He was the more tough of the duo but he had some well placed humour and his chemistry with cavill was great. Alicia vikander is great in this movie also, she isn't just your simple damsel in distress she was a pretty well fleshed out character and a worthy member of the team. The problem for me was the villain of the film and that you really didn't care at all about them or their motivations and in a film like this it hurt it a great deal. The story is very generic, I did like the bickering between cavill and hammer and how that story arc went throughout but the rest was just very bland and predictable. The script had some pretty good humour to it which helps in a film like this. However, some of the humour missed and not many of the dramatic moments worked either. There was some good action scenes in this film that was necessary for this film but there was too much guy Ritchie at times. I just felt that he put his eccentric style in places that it wasn't necessary and it hurt the style. There is also some unnecessary shaky cam as well. Overall this is a pretty fun film but I won't really be that bothered if I don't see it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Man From UNCLE it a decent movie. It does not boast great acting, nor great direction, nor a good script, but overall it is entertaining and in today's world of explicit sex and consistent F-bombs flying - it is a movie that you can actually take the family to see.Henry Cavill is average as Napolean Solo. It was not a good idea to have a Brit play an American. Cavill decided to play it as the snobbish, prissy British spy - ala James Bond - and not as the hip American that would have come from the 60's era.It would have been better to have the American, who is playing a Russian, play Solo. It probably would have worked better if Hammer played the American and Cavill the Russian.Every performance is average to below average. Not one single performance stands out and there is very little to no character development. The script is highly predictable and there is nothing spectacular in the entire film.Like I had mentioned before - average to below average on every single scale - but a movie that you can take people to see without the fear of explicit sexual scenes and without the consistent ignorant usage of the F-bomb.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Superb. Great storyline. Great characters. Awesome action. Very clean. Not a lot of debasing rubbish. Cavill is fantastic. He is THE ONLY OPTION for the next James Bond. Plan to get it on Blu-Ray and watch it at least 50-70 times. The cinematography is great. Sets and locations...... awesome. Very sexy women in this movie. I love the back and forth between the two main characters. Backstory is good. Time period is classic. We need to see more of Cavill in movies like these. Hopefully he doesn't get into a bunch of crappy movies. Now that he's Superman, I doubt that will happen. The scene with the powerboats, the wine, music, and the sandwich is HILARIOUS!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film made of models and entertainment...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A charming and entertaining film with a very easy-going tone and with some what cheesy feel to it that sort of works. Bringing back the 1960's to life with some classy producing and editing skills this film is based on the TV-series that ran between 1964-1968 with Robert Vaughn and David McCallum in the leading roles. Guy Ritchie is now back with his first screenplay movie since RocknRolla adding the uprising Hollywood star Alicia Vikander from Sweden to the United Network Command for Law and Enforcement team. The other two team members of U.N.C.L.E. that have no choice but to work together against some sexy and hot Italian villains working to proliferate nuclear weapons are KGB operative Illya Kuryakin played by Armie Hammer and CIA agent Napoleon Solo (Henry Cavill) with Waverley (Hugh Grant) as their boss. Set up in Italy with what looks like to be a huge bunch of models filmed in amazing settings the film ends with a huge flirt for a new film franchise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely Great period detail and Snappy Dialogue</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must admit after seeing the trailers for The Man From Uncle I was excited but was unsure whether it would live up to initial promise. I have fairly fond memories of the TV series as well, due to it being repeated fairly regularly in the UK on BBC2 during my childhood so I really wanted this to be good.Well the potential delivers, not only is this a great tribute to the TV series but this is a really enjoyable film in it's own right. The characters are funny and engaging - there is a lot of really snappy interchanges between them and they are all likable and good fun to see on screen. Both Henry Cavill and Armie Hammer are really well suited to their parts and have great banter. Alicia Vikander is brilliant as well, and really adds spice to a role that might have been nothing with someone else. The costumes and design are superb - really reinforcing the 60's feel and providing context for a lot of the things happening on screen. There are lots of gadgets with red flashing lights as well as 'bugs' hidden in Hotel rooms and great suits and dresses. The storyline is also actually good in a 60's spy show / film kind of way - with nods to the paranoia that was about on both sides of the Iron Curtain and the mistrust between the nations. As well as showcasing the dominance that they both wanted to reinforce over the world with their nuclear weapons programmes...And finally it looks and sounds great with cracking music and a gorgeous look. I think this is probably Guy Richie's most complete film and it would be shame if it doesn't do well enough to warrant a sequel as I would really love to see more of their adventures. Highly recommended!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An enjoyable movie to watch but not without its faults</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Man From U.N.C.L.E. brings a not so serious spy movie to the table in a form that is enjoyable to watch. Taking place in the 1960's at the height of the Cold War, this movie does a great job of not only showing that tension, but also the rivalry that the two super powers had for one another. This rivalry and tension is showed through the two main characters Napoleon Solo (Henry Cavill) and Illya Kuryakin (Armie Hammer). The American spy Napoleon is this arrogant, suave, cocky smart aleck and most stereotypes that a typical American would have while the Russian spy fills the stereotype as a temperamental strong Russian man. These two do not like one another and are constantly trying to outdo one another and the result makes for an enjoying dynamic to watch. They are accompanied by the beautiful and the talented Alicia Vikander who is coming off an amazing performance in Ex Machina. Having said this, this movie is not without its flaws. With any Cold War period piece, you can almost always assume that there is a nuclear bomb involved and this of course was the case. This has been played out time and time again in spy movies and it just gets repetitive. For me, the biggest flaws for this movie have to be the weak plot and a weak villain. Comparing to other recent spy movies like Kingsman, Spy, and the new Mission Impossible, this movie just wasn't up to their standards of special effects and spectacle. Like I said though, this was a fun movie to watch and it was not without its enjoyable moments.Average Man Score: 6/10</fullReview>

I knew the TV series existed, obviously, cos I'm of a certain age, and knew who played the original characters. Anyhoo, enough blather. Guy Ritchie returns with another awesome film. It's cheeky, it's action-y, it's sexy. Mr Cavill was born to wear close fitting outfits, Ms Vikander rocks the 60's look and Mr Hammer isn't horrible to look at either. All of the characters played really well with each other. This film hasn't yet hit general release and it's already in my list of "to buy" films! Furthermore, as my significant other wasn't available to attend with me, I have to go again to watch it! Such a drag, NOT!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slick and Stylish, But ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2015 has been a great year for espionage films. From the beginning of the year, there was "Kingsmen: Secret Service". Just this past summer, there was "Spy" followed by "Mission:Impossible - Rogue Nation." All of these were very successful, both commercially and critically. And now, another spy film is gunning to join that illustrious list. 'The Man from U.N.C.L.E." was originally a TV series from the mid-1960s developed by Sam Rolfe. It starred Robert Vaughn (as American agent Napoleon Solo) and David McCallum (as Russian agent Illya Kuryakin). U.N.C.L.E. was an acronym for the United Network Command for Law and Enforcement, a secret international counter-espionage organization, aiming to maintain worldwide political and legal order. This series lasted for four years from 1964 to 68, becoming a cultural icon of sorts at that time with its audacious theme of US-Russian cooperation at the height of the Cold War.This reboot of "The Man from U.N.C.L.E." for the modern generation retained the Cold War setting. American agent Napoleon Solo and Russian agent Illya Kuryakin are forced to work together to prevent the nefarious plans of glamorous but ruthless arms dealer Victoria Vinciguerra. They connect with Gaby Teller, the daughter of a kidnapped German nuclear scientist, as a means of getting closer on Victoria's tail. But it would appear that Gaby also is not all she seemed to be, or is she?Henry Cavill carries the film as Napoleon Solo. With his elegant chiseled looks, Cavill credibly portrayed the cool and capable spy Solo, as much as he was able to credibly portray Superman last year. He also succeeded in pulling off the smart-alecky personality of Solo, a man with a bristling sense of humor -- something we would not have expected from his deadly serious Superman performance. Henry Cavill was suave personified here. Considering George Clooney and Tom Cruise were the first choices for the role of Solo, I'd say Cavill did not do badly at all in this lead role.Armie Hammer is quite a handsome actor himself, but he could not really lift his career off the ground after his breakthrough role as the Winklevoss twins in "The Social Network." Forgettable films like "Mirror Mirror" and worse "The Lone Ranger" did not do his career any favors. Here in U.N.C.L.E., Hammer was able to hold his own against the charismatic Cavill in the charm and action fronts. However, since he is basically the straight man here, he often found himself behind Cavill's shadow. I have been looking forward for the next big project of Swedish actress Alicia Vikander since I first saw her in "A Royal Affair" three years ago. Her Hollywood career is picking up with her turn as the enigmatic automaton Ava in the acclaimed "Ex-Machina" released just earlier this year. Now with her role as the mysterious Gaby Teller, she finally gets her biggest break. It is just too bad that she did not get as many slambang action scenes like that other Swedish babe, Rebecca Ferguson, did in "M:I Rogue Nation."Elizabeth Debicki makes a good impression as the main villain Victoria, with her towering beehive, striking haute couture and naked ambition. Luca Calvani also registered well on screen as Victoria's husband, the debonair playboy Alexander. It was also great to see Hugh Grant again, playing British agent Waverley. I am thinking that if a franchise was ever made out of this film, we would see more of Grant since this character Waverly was the officer in charge of Solo and Kuryakin in the TV series.Compared to "Kingsman", the technical hardware we see in "U.N.C.L.E." would be described as less spectacular. Compared to "Spy", the wit we see in "U.N.C.L.E." would be described as less riotous. Compared to "M:I Rogue Nation", the stunts we see in "U.N.C.L.E." would be described as less breathtaking. However judged on its own, this film version of "The Man from U.N.C.L.E." as directed and co-written by Guy Ritchie is not at all bad. The 60s-inspired production design, hair and costumes were so fab. (Those huge yellow subtitles can be distracting and hard to read though.) Despite having tentative pacing in some scenes, it was still fun and entertaining to watch overall.But do I dare say it, after Superhero fatigue, could it be that there may also be Spy fatigue setting in? 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The look of this movie was all good. The locations looked great, Cavil and Vikander looked great, as did most of the supporting cast.Ritchies frenetic directing style was turned down a notch from his previous movies, because quick cuts and dutch angles don't suit a movie like this.I thought both Cavil and Hammer were alright in the roles, Hammer arguably better than David McCallum in the original, and Cavil was certainly at least as suave as Robert Vaughan as Napoleon Solo.So the casting and the locations was all good to see. A shame then that the script was so....boring. Now I know the original was inspired by Bond, but I distinctly remember it being a bit more exciting than this movie.It lacked punch, it wasn't quite as humorous as it could have been. Don't get me wrong, there were brief elements like the torture scene that went wrong and the rescue of Kuryakin from the water that were quite well done, but it needed more. It didn't need to be an outright comedy, but more humour in the situations that called for it would have worked, if only for the forced relationship of the East versus West leads which should have provided more laughs.Its not a terrible movie, its just, it comes and goes without really announcing itself, and after a week, I can imagine entirely forgetting most of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quirky family spy comedy-action packed movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As the title suggests, this movie is suited for a family night in! It has quirky spy action moments, at times funny and a little bit cheesy, but it works for a Saturday night in. The movie's main focus and priority (spies, the action, and so forth), was overshadowed by its consistent focus on fashion (though it is understandable fashion was a focal point in the 60's), I can definitely say this will bore the ordinary man. The chick flick romance between Gaby and Illya was fun but again a little bit cheesy. The main title for the movie is a little bit deceiving, as the watcher is expecting more of a James bond manly sort of action-spy movie. It has nothing to do with the movie until the very end and it focuses on 3 people instead of 1 - 'the man'. All in all good movie for a rainy evening, but considerably forgetful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Henry Cavill, doing his best George Clooney impression, teams up with Armie Hammer and Alicia Vikander in this carefree and breezy romp which is an homage to the 60s - and it shows. There is not much in terms of depth here, but it is a fun journey, expertly crafted by Guy Ritchie, director of 2009's Sherlock Holmes with his trademark visual flair and panache. There is some cool action and plenty of humour, even if some of it borders on being too silly and we get into the realms of over- acting, but for the most part it works well. Ultimately, there is not much to say about The Man from U.N.C.L.E. - it is good summer fun (at the time of release) and was a little swallowed by the other big spy films of 2015 like Spectre and Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation, not to mention the similar and superior comedy Spy with Melissa McCarthy. Still, it's worth a watch and you'll have fun with the well-gelling cast, even if the film doesn't stay long in the memory.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For me, simultaneously too dark and too light</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm old enough to remember viewing the four-season television series (1964-1968) and even to have seen a couple of the eight spin-off movies (again 1964-1968) and, after all this time, I never expected the concept - which seemed so much of its time - to be revived. But, with the Bond movies back to top form with "Skyfall" and "Spectre", it seems that we are ready for more spying capers. British director and co-writer Guy Ritchie has borough his trade-mark flashiness (we even have various split-screens) to produce a lively, if rather silly, piece of entertainment with more humour than tension.What makes this film different from the television series is that it tells the origin story of the United Network Command for Law and Enforcement and gives us a third (female) agent, so we have a Briton (Henry Cavill) playing an American (Napoleon Solo), an American (Armie Hammer) playing a Russian (Illya Kuryakin), and a Swede (Alicia Vikander) playing a German (Gaby Teller).I confess that to my eyes visually the film was too often too dark while tonally it was too often too light. But it might yet spawn a new cinematic franchise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's 1963. German nuclear scientist Dr. Udo Teller had been working for the Americans when he disappeared. CIA agent Napoleon Solo (Henry Cavill) crosses over to East Germany and brings back Teller's daughter Gaby (Alicia Vikander) escaping from KGB agent Illya Kuryakin (Armie Hammer). The two agents are ordered to join forces to find Udo who could be developing a bomb beyond the control of either side. The Vinciguerras siblings and Teller's brother Uncle Rudi are suspected. Gaby and Kuryakin pretend to be engaged. They encounter Alexander Waverly (Hugh Grant) who turns out to be a British agent.Guy Ritchie infused this with a light tone and a very cool style. However, it isn't exciting enough and the two guys are too similar. Cavill and Hammer are both pretty and do stoic acting. They are not exactly the same but they are not different enough. They don't have enough combative chemistry. Vikander is most engaging of the trio. The story is paper thin for an espionage movie. Compared to others of its genre, this is a simple A to B movie. There is one twist that isn't terribly twisty. Ritchie seems much more interested with the style than the material. That also goes for the action. In one of the big action scenes, Cavill literally takes a picnic break while Hammer is in a shootout at a corner of the screen. It's trying to be cool when I need it to be exciting. This is too cool for its own good and I also need better energy from the trio.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but forty years too late</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In many respects this is a great film -- solid acting, realistic sets, decent cinematography, face-paced action almost from start to finish. It does a great job of evoking the spy movies of the 60s and 70s, starting right from the opening title sequence. The music, the cars, the hairstyles -- all perfect. If there was anything anachronistic, I didn't spot it (and I was there at the time).And yet...The Cold War was the constant backdrop to my youth. I saw it played out in movies and books but, more importantly, in the daily newspapers. Movies like "The Ipcress File" were based (more or less convincingly) on popular understanding of current events. We didn't know at that time, and would not know for another thirty years, that there were no criminal masterminds hell-bent on taking over the world, and that the real Cold War was an exercise in incompetence and confusion. Characters like Napoleon Solo never existed, and never could have; if they had, no doubt they would have been sent on futile missions to remote jungles and died of snakebite. Or something.All of which brings me to the problem, as I see it, with this film. There is a place for serious movies about the historical past that really happened; and there is a place for comedic, satirical movies about the historical past that never did. Nobody's going to criticize Mel Brooks's "Men In Tights" for not depicting an accurate representation of medieval crime and punishment. There is even a place for movies about a wholly fantastical past ("Lord of the Rings".) I question, however, the place for a serious (or even semi-serious) movie that is based on a non-existent past, but which falls far short of fantasy.To be sure, "UNCLE" is a light-hearted movie, but it's still filmed and acted as if it was about events that might really have happened, that we now know never did, nor never could. Had it been just a bit funnier, or just a bit less earnest, it might have worked for me. Had it been a bit more outlandish and overtly fantastical, that might also have been OK, odd though that might sound.In short, the real problem with this movie is that it should have been made in 1975.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'The Man from U.N.C.L.E (United Network Command for Law and Enforcement)' began as a television series, running form 1964 - 1968 ? a stylish, sophisticated spy series that in many ways broke the ice for the plethora of offshoots that followed an still imitate). Now along comes (groan) another remake of a fine original ? this time altered on every level by Guy Ritchie in an attempt to make it compete with the many and constant spy thrillers that flood both the television and theater screens. Does it work? That depends on the viewer's history and tolerance.Ritchie did cast the film with classy actors and that helps. Henry Cavill, Armie Hammer and Alicia Vikander manage to infuse some style into this otherwise heavy-handed caper film.The story is capsulized as follows: 'In the 1960s with the Cold War in play, CIA agent Napoleon Solo (Henry Cavill) successfully helps Gaby Teller (Alicia Vikander) defect to West Germany despite the intimidating opposition of KGB agent Illya Kuryakin (Armie Hammer). Later, all three unexpectedly find themselves working together in a joint mission to stop a private criminal organization from using Gaby's father's scientific expertise to construct their own nuclear bomb. Through clenched teeth and stylish poise, all three must find a way to cooperate for the sake of world peace, even as they each pursue their own agendas.'Fill out the cast with such figures as Hugh Grant and Elizabeth Debicki and Sylvester Groth and the style remains intact despite the Guy Ritchie attempts to 'modernize' the concept and story line. A bit long - both in the tooth and in length ? there are still moments that remind us of how excellent the original truly was.</fullReview>

They also help distract from a formulaic script. Incidentally, this marks the first time the KGB and CIA have worked together since the Kennedy assassination.

		<shortDescription>Sometimes fun, but mainly out of date</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In order to give it a more authentic historical taste, or maybe because Guy Ritchie was directing it, they added that horrible, tasteless, disgusting heist feel to the film. You know, the jazzy kind of music that tells you that everything that happens (shootings, thefts, murders, torture, nuclear enrichment, international espionage) is to be taken lightheartedly, because it is fun. It is the sound of the Ocean's 11 remakes that are just as horribly out of place and out of date and out of ideas. While the original TV series was silly because it was the time when all things were silly, this was silly on and off, often with some good scenes soiled by the "ha ha" aftertaste.I liked that they didn't try to take too much from the original (which was a bad low budget TV series to begin with). The film acted as the origin story of the U.N.C.L.E. organization and, thankfully, they only used the acronym once and never explained where it came from. I disliked that the Russian character was obviously constructed by an American, with all the clichés that that entails. Better than the Russian in the TV show, but still. Would it have hurt to have a Russian national consult on the script?Alicia Vikander was great playing a robot in Ex Machina. Unfortunately, I don't think she can play anything else, and the propensity to be cast in the same boring role of the cute girl that ends up betraying you is muddying any possible shine of her performance. The chemistry between Solo and Illya was great, although the Russian character was a sloppy caricature of what it could have been.Bottom line: I barely gave it an average rate. For me it felt like a failure of absurd proportions given the rather fancy way the remake was created. The film had no idea what it wanted to be, switching the focus from characters to silliness, from action to heistiness and ending up being a late and a poor man's contender for a James Bond clone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Upfront disclaimer that I never saw the TV show (a decade before my time) but I was aware of its success and pop culture relevance. Henry Cavill and Armie Hammer have teamed up as suave American Agent Napolean Solo and Russian-with?anger-management-issues Agent Illya Kuryakin. I understand that this movie presents their origin story, whereas the TV started with them already running missions together. Good choice. Also a great choice to keep the setting in the 60's; I do so love that retro style and feel. Unfortunately all the pieces of this film add up to just short of even. The chemistry is good, especially since both characters are bent on proving they are the better spy backed by the better government, but there's not enough of it, with plenty of obvious missed opportunities for the characters to play off each other. That's what made Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law so good as Holmes &amp; Watson. I thought Guy Ritchie would be perfect to direct a buddy spy movie after the Holmes movies, but it seems the script just wasn't up to the task. There are some good scenes, such as the opening escape from Germany and a great sequence where Solo decides to have a meal instead of help Kuryakin.I'm a guy Ritchie fan. His films are fun and I have enjoyed multiple viewings of many of them, especially the Sherlock Holmes films. The production value on this film is top notch, just as all his films. Unfortunately, I don't think this film will get any extra viewings. The performances were acceptable, with recent newcomer Alicia Vikander being the most consistent and showing the potential for better things to come. I kind of feel sorry for Armie Hammer, who had a decent performance, but I just couldn't get past the angry Russian stereotype or the accent, which wasn't even that bad. I wonder if the British audience has the same problem when they watch Henry Cavill with an American accent as Napolean Solo or Superman? The biggest disappointment was the script. It gets bogged down by some poorly presented exposition to the point where it's hard to remember who some of the characters are and why they're important to the story. At one point I actually forgot what the original mission was. Some of the James Bond movies have struggled with the same problem over the years. It's hard to explain the mission to the audience without them feeling like they should be taking notes during a briefing. A significant amount of screen time is spent on Mr. Ritchie's snappy and fun visual storytelling that unfortunately wasn't very helpful to the audience, and tended to make you feel like you watching a movie instead of enjoying a story. My wife and I both agreed that the star of this movie was the score and soundtrack, which brought the fun when the story was dragging. I do hope to see another Man from UNCLE movie, but it doesn't look likely. A shame since the right story could really propel these characters to the pop culture forefront. For Special Agents, they didn't have a very special movie.I give the performances a 7.5, the story a 6 and the score/soundtrack a 9 for an overall 7.5</fullReview>

He owns Napolean Solo. Armie Hammer equally owns Illya. And Alice Vikander was the most pleasant surprise of all! The period sets and all the clothing help to teleport the viewer back to the 1960s. The sound track was excellent especially the jazz pieces with a flute lead. (Herbie Mann) I hope they make another one. Keep the cast and the music. The hard part will be coming up with another compelling story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched The Man from U.N.C.L.E. movie in bits and pieces over the last few days, and was surprised at how good it was. Henry Cavill was even more wooden than in Man of Steel, but as Napoleon Solo the woodenness came across well as Solo being cool as a cucumber. Armie Hammer was so good as the Russian with anger issues that I forgot he once also played a too-campy Lone Ranger. Much to my surprise, Hugh Grant really managed to pull of the whole Chief Waverly vibe I recall from the original 1960s TV series. The film has earned $190 million in world-wide revenues on a budget of only $75, so I'd hope that the studio would make a sequel, although a quick web search didn't turn up any evidence of plans for a sequel. Even working 65 hours a week I found the 116 minutes of diversion well worth the time. :-)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fun Filled Spy Movie !!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Man from Uncle is a different genre of spy movies. I always believe spy movies are either serious type or the non serious like Bond films. Last year, Kingsman was a spy film which balanced both the genres with ease. In the hand of Guy Ritchie, we get a spy movie which has suspense and drama but is also witty and humorous.There is not much of a story here and it reminds you of The Spy who loved me where UK and USSR join hands and fight for a same cause. Here US and USSR join hands to stop an evil villain and that too a lady.The movie is witty thanks to the two opposite heroes - the cool smooth talking Henry Cavill and the cold serious Arnie Hammer. And add to this, the delicious Alicia Vikander who plays a simple but sexy car mechanic.Franky, neither Cavill and Hammer pull off their US and Russian accents with ease. They are bad at times especially Cavill who sounds more British than US.But who cares. And Guy is so smart that he tells the story so fast that we don't have time to ponder.So watch this movie on the weekend and relax.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Old school spy film brought to modern day</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>U.N.C.L.E. impressed me with its ode to the classic spy works of entertainment. It did not over do it with action like some present day spy movies try to do. It was filled with witty jokes, classic espionage spy operations, and old school plot lines and plot twists. It was a respectable re-make and it was refreshing to see a film that reminded me of the old school Bond films that did not over do it with comedy or action. Armie's Russian accent is comical and the constant back and forth contests between the two leaves the audience wanting more as their chemistry is clearly evident. Enjoyable, refreshing, and relaxed, The Man from U.N.C.L.E. is a ride for movie lovers that want a film different than the present day style of action/comedy movies we have been constantly fed lately.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good acting, plot, direction, but awful score</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The plot is deliciously twisty. The decision to reinvent the characters almost from scratch was a good one. The sex is a bit too concealed as if directed by a an ex-nun. So it kind of feels overly censored.The most distracting is the amateur-level score that fails to generate the right atmosphere and just functions as an annoying loud and irrelevant noise. It's almost as if someone just cut and pasted it from some flop film from another genre. Frankly they did a far better job in the 1960s although even that would not exactly earn awards.If someone can let me have a version without the score I'll do it for free! My inclination would be to give it a jazz feel like they used to in the 60s and early 70s. For me a lot can be learned when doing retro remakes from the brilliant Tinker Tailor score of 2011.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not gonna lie. I kinda over-hyped myself for this one. I was hopping for something more fast paced like Spectre ended up being, but this was defiantly on the lower scales. It should be noted that I loved Henry Cavil. His attitude in this film was soo amazing. He really became someone new. I never saw Superman with him only a secret agent spy. Armie Hammer was also great in the film. Hell sometimes even better than Henry, but together it doesn't always work. There are a few good funny moments in this film, but there not on the level I had hoped they would be on. Also the story isn't that interesting or engaging either and neither are the villains. Nothing about those areas of the film are that engaging. The only villain that works is Alicia Vikandar who is coming off her work in Ex Machina. She still holds her on in this film as well, but not in the way I was hopping that she would. So what am I getting at this film overall. This film has funny and engaging characters with a lot of funny moments, but the story in this film is soo weak and boring that it hurts the film.It is still a decent film overall and I recommend it, but it is nothing special either. Tho it does have a great soundtrack :-D</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Didn't expect the series and I was not disappointed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched the original series in junior high. I later grew up to understand that most Hollywood "remakes" are not efforts at remaking anything, but are instead efforts to lure timid investors by wrapping a movie in the security blanket of a recognized brand. I had no expectation that the movie would be much like the series, and therefore I was able to watch it unencumbered by false expectations.I enjoyed it. The action grew a bit tiresome now and then, but at least it was well done. The story line was adequate, the script more than adequate. Where the movie fell somewhat short was in its characters. I never know exactly where this particular weakness lies...actor, script, director, or some combination thereof.Solo's character was just too slick and one-dimensional. They wanted a thief-turned-agent, they would have done much better to transfer Matt Bomer directly over from White Collar. Gaby's character was acceptable, but nothing special. I don't think she brought enough to the table to warrant expanding the team from two to three. Ah, but Kuryakin...he was great. Newly invented, yet somehow with a bit of the same appeal as the original, and a bit of the same mysterious nature. Given that everyone had the same director and writers, I credit Hammer for this. I was impressed...not just another pretty face, this one.I'm not sure how much Grant was actually acting. He seems to always play the same character, not that I'm complaining. That same old character fit surprising well into this rather different context. For that, I credit casting.</fullReview>

However I think this movie was done extremely well in that it was very James Bond like only with three main under cover agents instead of one. The action was intense along with the character opposites and the plot was built up well. The actors and actress that were picked to portray the three UNCLE agents did excellent in bringing the characters to the big screen. When doing an action flick to me it's all about being believable and this movie does it.This movie falls in with the James Bond and Jason Bourne series which I really love.</fullReview>

I watch all Guy's movie and I can say they are almost the same, not in every way but both hero here are too arrogant, flamboyant and stylish, just like Ritchie's trademark. When I watch Napoleon Solo's character, its very similar with Sherlock Holmes's character but just in different era and people. Everyone keep saying that Cavill &amp; Hammer's acting is so bad and I'm totally agree with it. They are natural born pretty but not a really natural born actor, Alicia Vikander and Uncle Rudi is a lot much better. Other than that, the action are decent with total obviously-simulated fight, boring shooting scene, plot is pretty much average, don't really have any shocking twist that will making audience shock, just an average spy movie that people will forget after one night.

		<shortDescription>If you liked the original series, this movie is for you</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For those complaining it was dull - I think the issue might be it successfully tried to invoke the feeling and optics of the original series. I have run across several people who think TV shows like I Spy, The Avengers, and The Man From UNCLE were/are dull because of the 60s style.Having grown up with those shows, lying in bed at night and listening to my parents TV as they watched them, I love those shows. It's true they emphasized style and characters over action and many modern viewers don't care for that. But for shows like, for example, I Spy, the bantering and relationship between the leads was more important than whatever situation they found themselves in.In the original The Man From UNCLE the relationship between the two wasn't as important as I Spy - they did rely more on episodic action and drama. But there still wasn't a lot of action.I think this movie succeeded admirably in re-establishing the style of the original and, against my expectations, I enjoyed Armie Hammer's Illya Kuryakin and Cavill's ultra-smooth and suave Napoleon Solo.All in all, I think this was a much more successful remake of a 60s series than, say, the dreadful 1998 The Avengers with Fiennes and Thurman. This movie is beautifully shot, the dialog works for the most part, the two leads carry their parts well - almost, but never quite, sinking into parody.The object of the mission, to stop a rogue group from getting a process that would allow them to easily enrich and weaponize fissionable material, really is secondary to the establishment of the male and female leads and building their relationships.If you liked the original series, I don't think this is going to disappoint. If you didn't grow up on shows from the 60s, it very well might not - but not because it's a bad show.On the whole, I liked it much better than I thought I would.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fast-Paced, Light-Hearted &amp; Consistently Entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the director of Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Snatch &amp; Sherlock Holmes, The Man from U.N.C.L.E. arrives as another stylish, glamorous &amp; swiftly paced action spy thriller in the year that already has seen enough of it, and although it doesn't bring anything new to the genre, its vintage setting, kinetic direction &amp; mesmerising performances manage to take it above the required notch.Based on the TV show of the same name, the story of The Man from U.N.C.L.E. is set in the early 1960s and follows a CIA agent &amp; a KGB operative who, amidst the Cold War, must join hands against a mysterious criminal organisation that's building its own nuclear weapon to disrupt world peace. Also assisting them in their mission is a woman who has an important role to play in the outcome but she has some agendas of her own.Co-written &amp; directed by Guy Ritchie, The Man from U.N.C.L.E. makes use of all trademarks of his and oozes with style from start to finish. But that doesn't mean that the film is entirely devoid of any substance for the plot does have its moments of escalation &amp; excitement and then some more. The screenplay may lack the sharp dialogues &amp; idiosyncratic characters of Ritchie's earliest works but it manages to be captivating for the most part.Production design team does a marvellous job at recreating the 1960s atmosphere which is further improved by its timeline-specific costumes, props &amp; fashion. Cinematography makes energetic but effective use of its camera, colour palette &amp; lighting while extensively applying split-screen techniques to capture all the unfolding action in an exuberant manner. Editing is brilliantly carried out and keeps the plot moving at all times while the soundtrack gives its tale an extra boost.Coming to the performances, The Man from U.N.C.L.E. features an interesting cast in Henry Cavill, Armie Hammer, Alicia Vikander, Hugh Grant &amp; others. Both Cavill &amp; Hammer manage to impress equally and their chemistry together is a highlight in itself. Vikander continues to have an amazing year and adds another good work on her résumé. Grant doesn't have that much of a presence but he does fine with what he's given. Rest of the supporting cast chip in nicely in their respective roles and don't leave much to complain here.On an overall scale, The Man from U.N.C.L.E. is a fast-paced, light-hearted &amp; consistently entertaining picture that brims with style, charisma &amp; pleasant humour for the majority of its runtime and delivers the thrills Ritchie's films usually promise. It may not be a great cinema on a narrative scale but it still feels refreshing on many levels, has a fun vibe to it which is wonderfully maintained, and although its plot turns out to be easily predictable despite the numerous twists &amp; turns it goes through, The Man from U.N.C.L.E. still succeeds as one thoroughly satisfying feature. Delightfully recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Man from U.N.C.L.E. is a beautifully crafted spy based film which feels like watching a double dose of James Bond on speed in some areas of the film and in others it has it's very slow crawl tortoise speed. The styling of this film fits the time period very well minus a few small unnoticeable items, but for the most part it was perfect.The acting within The man from U.N.C.L.E. is for the most part fairly played, and the story is smooth; though I do think the best factors in this film are the stage settings, and detail to time period. I'm a sucker for films revolving around Russian culture and language so this is the biggest point of interest for me to watch the film, I did catch a few hiccups within the Russian language spoken in the film but yet nicely done and concealed. If you like spy related films this one plays out very nicely.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A Good, Sometimes Comedic Spy Movie In the 1960s during the cold war the leaders of Russia and the United States decide to have one of their best agents work together to find Dr. Teller (Christian Berkle) who may be making a nuclear bomb for bad guy Alexander (Luca Calvani). These best of the best agents Napoleon Solo (Henry Cavill) and Illya Kuryakin (Armie Hammer) must also work with Dr. Teller's niece Gaby (Alicia Vikander).The first half of this was entirely enjoyable watching the two agents who don't like each other work together. Their "I'm better, smarter than you" banter was funny at times, and you just knew, in time, they would become friends. Cavill's delivery was spot on and yes, you saw flashes of Clark Kent/Superman as that couldn't be helped. But most impressive was Hammer's Russian accent. I like the Russian accent whether it's coming from a real Russian or someone imitating the Russian language. Thoroughly enjoyable. Alicia Vikander's Gabby was okay, but too petite for the role we later learn is more than we were told at first. The acting all around, cinematography, stunts, and the music were all good. The music sometime let us know some comedic moments were afoot as it foretold a light-hearted approach to serious work for these agents. Kudos. I never watched the Man from U.N.C.L.E. TV show back in the day, but did see snippets from time to time. So I was not aware the Solo was basically a thief, and con man that the C.I.A. took a liking to his abilities and got him out of prison to help their cause. Robert Vaughn played Solo in the TV series. Kuryakin was a tremendous athlete and excelled at everything and big as a giant. That's curious because David McCallum who played Illya Kuryakin in the TV series was not of this type from what I remember. Anyway????.One goof in here: When Solo's suit jacket was burned in the torture room, he mentions that he forgot to take his suit jacket, but we see him in the same suit jacket on the aircraft carrier and we know there was no time for him to get another jacket. (Ha! Fire the Continuity person)The second half didn't have as much comedy as in the first half but there were moments.All in all a very good comedic spy movie, but serious by necessity, of course. Look for sequels as the chemistry between Cavill and Hammer was very good. Notable: Hugh GrantAt the end we learn what U.N.C.L.E. spells out. (7/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No.</fullReview>

Acting was OK, but two main characters were more like caricatures then real person, but i guess it kinda worked for this material. Settings were gorgeous, cinematography is kinetic and very nice as well as craftsmanship overall. Story is some blah blah blah about someone trying to blow up the nuke and super agents trying to stop them in cold war era. The overall tone and feel of the movie is far more easier then lets say latest Bond movies. It has some nice and funny action, i laughed very hard during the boats chase / wine drinking scene. Overall, "The Man from U.N.C.L.E." is an enjoyable action / adventure flick witch always plays like a parody of serious movies with same plot. It strength is that is knows that it's not serious.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Style over substance, but what style!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the moment you hear Guy Ritchie, the man who gave us such fare as Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, is reviving The Man from U.N.C.L.E., a swinging sixties spy series, you kind of know what to expect. Reviving such a show today already ensures a sufficient amount of tongue-in-cheek material, so Ritchie's style easily blends in. The result is a mostly entertaining ride that's only hampered by the occasionally dull comedy.The year is 1963. CIA operative Napoleon Solo travels beyond the Wall in Berlin to extract Gaby Teller, a woman working in a chop shop. Her father's being forced to build an atom bomb for the Nazi's, so Solo wants her to set up a meeting with her uncle who will in turn lead them to her father. They escape, but not without heavy resistance from Illya Kuryakin, a KGB operative. The next day, both their bosses inform Solo and Kuryakin they are to cooperate on the same mission. They'll go to Rome where Solo will pose as an antiquities dealer and Kuryakin will pose as Gaby's fiancé. They've a hunch the place where Gaby's uncle Rudy works is most likely a front for the Nazi's, so that's their way in.The sense of style and action is wonderfully stylized and easily the most memorable aspect of the production. From the opening car chase to the KGB-patented bitch slap Kuryakin employs to knock out a guard while keeping him standing perfectly still, it's all quite exhilarating and funny.Speaking of stylized, the score by Daniel Pemberton enhances every scene it accompanies. Whether it's Morricone-inspired action music or jazzy interludes, it always made me swoon and bob along. While these kinds of pastiche scores are not exactly new, Pemberton's score features the best kind of pastiche, because it still feels like I'm hearing Pemberton and not just a collage of cheap references.There are a couple of downsides: some of the attempts at verbal humor (one-liners, etc.) don't generate the laughter it feels like they should. Also, the film has a few too many false finishes. You've got this exciting infiltration mission and you think it's over. Oh wait, there's an even more exciting chase scene incoming. Well okay, I'm up for that, but then it's over right? No, after all that excitement, let's kill the bad guy/gal with a short scene featuring basically nothing but talking. Ritchie tries to compensate the lack of action with some great editing, but it's no use. The film's lost momentum. It's just one climax too many.As far as modern action films go, The Man from U.N.C.L.E. feels complete in that it's got the full package: a decent, spy-ish narrative with a few twists and style to spare and that's not even mentioning that music. I wouldn't know whether it's a faithful re-imagining, but it's a fun watch nonetheless.</fullReview>

However, I am hugely disappointed with the film. It starts off very well with a lot of promise and then somehow manages to fade away. It seems as though he lost interest somewhere while making the film. Henry Cavill as Solo is convincing. Though I felt he would have done better as Illya. Alicia Vikander is flat throughout the film. Armie Hammer, well, he has done the job, just about. I am not convinced that this was the best casting. This may become a new film franchise, but I wont be eagerly waiting for a sequel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Man from U.N.C.L.E. is based off the TV series of the same name which came out in 1964 if my information is correct. It's a spy story, which I think is enough explanation as to what it's about. The plot is just like almost any other spy movie. Although I can't really complain, an original spy movie is kind of difficult considering how done-to-death they are at this point and how limited the genre can be. However I think that this movie pulled it off pretty well. It wasn't horribly original, but it wasn't really cliché either. It had enough different ideas to keep it feeling fresh and new, but, of course, the overall plot isn't horribly original. The presentation for the most part is good though. It's great fun, and pretty self-aware of how goofy it is sometimes, which I really appreciated. The characters are good. Not particularly great, but the actors were all very competent and they certainly sold themselves as their characters quite well. Overall The Man from U.N.C.L.E. is great fun, but it's not fantastic. There's a lot to like about this movie, from the ideas to the humor, it's fun and at times a little over-the-top, but that just adds to the fun. In the end I'd certainly recommend this movie to anyone who likes good humor and good action.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The sets, scenery and wardrobes are beautiful. The movie was a disappointment. It was so stylized that it quickly became boring. To me, there was no real excitement to the action sequences. Everything was shallow including the villains, the heroes and the plot. It was like watching a bunch of well-dressed mannequins try to make an action film. What they did to Illya's character is sinful. He is now a psycho with a terrible anger disorder, but he still manages to be a mind-numbing bore. Henry Cavill is so bland - not suave, not clever and amusing. I don't know what this movie wanted to be. The comedic lines weren't that funny, the actors had very little good dialogue to work with, there was no suspense, no plot twists, no real evil bad guy to be frightened of. I didn't even feel the atmosphere of the Cold War as I watched. It could have been any time, any place. Generic is a good word for this movie. There was not much action, either. I'll pass on the next Man from Uncle if there is one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Based on the popular television series, "The Man From U.N.C.L.E" aspires to be a big-budget Cold War spy saga. Three contrasting characters, Napoleon Solo, Illya, and Gaby join forces in the attempt of thwarting a dastardly rogue organization attempting to assemble a nuclear warhead.Unfortunately, the story gets mired in subplots and too many characters. At one point a fourth organization led by Hugh Grant's character Waverly enters the fray to either help or hinder the enterprise.Alicia Vikander does a good job of stealing nearly all of the scenes in which she appears. There was good location filming in both Berlin and Rome. The action scenes and camera angles were all acceptable. Still, something was missing in this film, especially with the villains. After the build-up to the finale, the husband-and-wife team who were building their bomb had minimal screen time and character development. The film would have been stronger if their characters had appeared much earlier.By the end, the United States, Great Britain, the Soviet Union, and East Germany are all involved in the effort. It was unfortunate that these nations could not have cooperated better in the 1960s. If that were the case, the Cole War would have ended much earlier than it did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watched it twice in an open air cinema in Athens. Afterwards, i had the urge to show it to my friends and family so I've watched it a few more times. Very stylish movie, with a lot of funny scenes and witty lines. A true Guy Ritchie fan couldn't be disappointed with this one. The cinematography is good as well as the photography. Henry Cavill is enjoyable to watch and shows that he is well suited for spy movies. Proves that he is a strong candidate for the role of James Bond = when he gets a little older. In three words: Stylish, Glamorous and Entertaining</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The man from UNCLE is a pretty awesome movie. The man from UNCLE is a pretty irrelevant title since the only reference to it is at the end of the movie. But anyway that doesn't mater because it doesn't stop this movie from being awesome. So the man from uncle is about two spies, one Russian one American, that must put aside decade long rivalries to stop a bigger threat, a scientist with a nuclear bomb and a disc with instructions on how to make a nuclear bomb. It's a great movie because of the action, humour and story. The Man From UNCLE is not a movie you can watch absentmindedly. Well you wouldn't understand a thing about it if you did. That's because the story can get pretty confusing. It's not original but the fact that it strings together many unoriginal ideas makes it original. Plus it has a good twist at the end.This movie has a lot of great action set pieces which almost all stand out: for example a Dune Buggy chase, a rescue scene in East Berlin, a mission on an island and many more. This assures you're not bored because they're well done. Plus you can't help but respect it's done in a PG-13 manner.Another thing that assures you're not bored is the humor. 85% of the time it's funny. It does fall flat sometimes though.The characters are also very awesome. It surprises me how such stereotypes can be awesome. Unfortunately the movie's story isn't that different then other movies in the genre. But that only affects the final product a little bit so that's fine. All in all the man from uncle is a very awesome movie and I would recommend it to an action movie fan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A nice blend of the buddy cop &amp; spy genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although during the mid 1900s filmmakers were beginning to expand their range of experimentation in their projects, things were still very separate. Many genres during the time stuck within their boundaries. If you made a drama, it stuck to the highlights of personal conflict. If it was a sci-fi film, it focused more on the futuristic aspects of it. The same went for action, horror and comedy films respectively. As the 1980s rolled around, genres began mixing even more. One of the more popular hybrids of the time was the buddy cop genre, which was the fusion of the action and comedy. Now when it comes to adding in another genre to the recipe, that can get tricky. Depending on who's writing, trying to find an even blend for more than one category is not easy. The idea is to produce a product that appeals to each fan of the particular style without alienating them simultaneously. For director Guy Ritchie, it seems that making a feature length movie to the TV show of the same name seemed like no problem considering his previous works.Before this comedic action spy film, Guy Ritchie also directed Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (1998), Snatch (2000), which were action comedies and the Sherlock Holmes (2009) series, which were action spy films. Written by Lionel Wigram (Sherlock Holmes (2009)) and also Ritchie, this spy action comedy successfully sets out what it was made to do and that's blending all the genres evenly together. During the Cold War era, American professional thief Napoleon Solo (Henry Cavill) and Russian professional KGB spy Illya Kuryakin (Armie Hammer) are paired up under their ruling nations to try and stop a unknown organization from distributing nuclear warheads. As far as overall execution goes, most of it is straightforward. Only occasionally does the plot get muddled with information for no real reason. This happens when information is being passed between informants. In some ways it's understood that the writers are trying to make this information hard to attain but it does feel overly convoluted.Co-starring with the two main leads are Gaby (Alicia Vikander, Ex Machina (2015)) as their main ticket of getting access to the unknown organization because her uncle Rudi (Sylvester Groth) being connected to them. Suspected of possessing the warheads is Victoria (Elizabeth Debicki, The Great Gatsby (2013)) for being related to a World War II fascist. In it's entirety, almost all main characters receive the development they require in order for the audience to understand them. Of the cast, the top three rightfully go to Cavill, Hammer and Vikander. Hammer and Cavill have great chemistry for the bickering duo that they are. What's great is not only that they don't like each other because of each other knowing their partners' background, but also for the fact that one is Russian and the other is American. Working with the enemy probably is not a job anybody wants to do. The buddy cop trope of opposite personalities exists but instead of it being shown in attire it is demonstrated through personality, which is different.Cavill plays it cool and slick, while Hammer plays it brash and hot tempered. These are two extreme opposites yet they both get the job done and that's extraordinary. This also helps in the comedic delivery because of how well they bounce their zingers off each other. Vikander also works because of her ability to be her own character and have her own moments. That also means she doesn't need Cavill or Hammer's character to support her; she can actually manage her own. The action is nicely stylized as well. More of this element goes hand-in-hand with the spy genre where Solo and Kuryakin are required to go around as other characters. Another situation might be when the two are trying to outrun another character so that they aren't caught and their cover is blown. It's crafty business and it looks fun with the energy put on screen. The only thing that may be a bit off putting is the costume design for the finale build up. The costume designer to this production was Joanna Johnston (Hellraiser (1987) &amp; Forrest Gump (1994)).For the display on screen much of the color schemes and designs look very much like Cold War era clothing. Yet when it gets closer to the finale, Hammer and Cavill dress in military suits that resemble that of The Expendables (2010). The rest is fine though. The cinematography shot by John Mathieson is brightly lit and has plenty of landscape to see whether it's urban or rural terrain. The musical score provided by composer Daniel Pemberton is interesting too. Although he doesn't have a main theme for the franchise itself, he does give separate themes for the characters. An example would be Kuryakin where every time he gets angry. But even this, Pemberton also creates a score very close to that of what someone would hear from the era. It's psychedelic and also relaxing to listen to. Pemberton also includes drums and timpani for various action cues although they are a not as memorable as the other tracks mentioned before. However, this is largely a solid effort that should not be ignored.Its main leads have natural chemistry thanks to some adequate writing. It does however suffer from infrequent times when the plot can get confusing for no reason because of it being in the spy genre. But it's not much to say when the music and visuals to the movie add to the style of how closely it matches the era that its source material spawned from. The action is also fun seeing how the characters get around.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fast paced spy film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film tells the story of a group of secret agents from several countries, who work together to stop an sonic bomb from going off in the hands of an Italian businessman. This film is stylish and cool to look at. The scenes of cars in the countryside towards the end are cool, with the camera panning out and then zoom back in on another car. The characters are fun, and the tension between the agents are funny as well. There is a lot of action in the film. The action is fast paced and sometimes I have trouble following the story. Despite all the action, somehow the tone is still light and not rushed with adrenaline. The woman playing Victoria is very beautiful, and very slim! Let's see if there will be a sequel, the film is set up for one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great postmodern recasting of 1960s action films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(No, I'm not going to give this one 10 stars because I liked it...) If you're unfamiliar with Ritchie's previous films - and I mean the Sherlocks in particular - then you're in for quite a ride. I recently tried watching the series on which this film is "based," and this U.N.C.L.E. is on some serious steroids. There's basically anything you want from a Bond-like action flick - a stunning car chase in classy rides (such as a Trabant), an audacious break-in at a secret lab (including a motorboat chase), and a heinous antagonist that just wants to make money off of splitting atoms. And it's even funny. Compared to the series, the film focuses more on what was previously left out: the back story of Napoleon Solo and Iliya Kuryakin. In Solo's case, this back story is suitably glamorous and involves a solid nudge-nudge for Cavill's fans. Kuryakin, on the other hand, is given a properly overblown Soviet background, with a hint of Siberia, some Stalin, and a piece of Lubyanka. So much for what they say - but what they do first is battle. In the series, Solo played a cunning man of the world to Kuryakin's straight-faced romantic; here, Solo is a cultured, self-assured super-thief and his Soviet counterpart a moderately psychotic, well-tempered killing machine. Both characters are very likable and the mutual tensions increasingly betray a hint of communion between them. As for the film itself, it's not spotless, but it's smartly done. It lifts little from the series, but certain moments are obviously inspired by the original. The pace is high and the editing sharp, but not too tiresome. Lots of stunning visuals, partly explaining why they chose Italy in general, and Rome in particular, as the setting. Glitches do appear and some ideas seem pretty ludicrous - but most of them are very much akin to the silly stuff from the Bonds, which is in character for a film set in the 1960s. As a whole, the film tends to make good fun out of a somewhat subversive critique of the genre. Generally speaking, it's just too much fun to be cross with.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I miss the 60s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why do I miss the 60s? Because I was 10 years old when the Berlin Wall went up, but I was living in Osnabruck listening to the Beatles singing Love Me Do on the radio. People dressed well before going out, I wore a tie to school, and children weren't cruel to one another. In short I lived in a better world. Man From UNCLE fleshes out the characters better than the TV show (which aired on BBC to counter ITV's Avengers), The new Napoleon Solo far exceeds Robert Vaughn's portrayal. Think a new, improved Piers Brosnan. The new Ilya is amazing -- I never thought the original David McCallum was up to the task.The ChrisCraft boats, the mod fashions, the Italian backdrop! I can't get enough of it! There were plenty of laughs, plenty of excitement, sexy villains, and snappy James Bond type quips. This is being set up (along with Kingsman) to outdo the James Bond franchise which is going to suck for reasons which are patently obvious.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the original, but original fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Guy Ritchie directs this new film version of a great 60's TV show. I enjoyed the period piece reality and the stars, all whom are very good looking but the film is not the Man From Uncle; it is rather a story about he origins of UNCLE.Alicia Vikander plays well with the boys, and the boys seem to have little to do with each other until they realize their need for each other on this save the world from nuclear disaster mission.Good to see the Nazis are back as the villains again and a lot of the humor is tongue in cheek.The very tall Debicki is a wicked woman and held her own as the villain, but the film needed a more sinister one. The film worked as an action film, but not as a comedy or thriller. It could have been all three. Too much suavity and style, not enough feeling or engagement with the story.I would've brought in Hugh Grant early as head of UNCLE and explained the deal to all of them in order to save the world. Then let's them all work together with their differing fortes.All in all - do another one and get it right this time. Still watchable and enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Stylzed Revision of a 60's Bond Theme Show 4 out of 5 stars</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my first time reviewing a movie anywhere. I saw this with a friend after watching American Ultra. Hollywood has a tendency to release similarly themed movies in close proximity. I don't know why they do this but it seems to have the effect of right or wrong diluting the public's interest in an otherwise capable movie.U.N.C.L.E. was originally television's answer to Bond. It had the cool gadgets, hot women &amp; bad guys galore with ultimate baddies Thrush which were the equivalent of Spectre in the Bond universe. But as most viewers were born way after U.N.C.L.E. went off the air, Guy Ritchie chose a different way of re-introducing the public to these iconic TV characters. He chose to do this via an origin story in a very stylized modern way but set in the 60's.Like Casino Royale where we were introduced to Bond, Ritchie has chosen to strip down the characters without the gadgets &amp; show how Henry Cavill's Solo &amp; Armie Hammer's Kuryakin first meet &amp; eventually reluctantly become partners to save the world from atomic anhilation. At this point there really is no U.N.C.L.E. as both characters really work for the CIA &amp; KGB respectively which of course were bitter enemies.All of this is done with very capable acting from all parties involved, a good script with plenty of plot tension, slick action sequences, a cool soundtrack, and humor a plenty. This movie has the style of Oceans 11 crossed with the execution of Focus. its smart &amp; funny and I for one would love to see a sequel to see where Ritchie can really take this. My friend &amp; I both enjoyed this &amp; would recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stylish and witty? a must see</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into the cinema having never heard of the original Man From U.N.C.L.E TV series, although this did not stop be from enjoying this film. Even from the first minutes I knew this would be filled with action and humour, yet still manage to be stylish and witty. The credits at the beginning impressed me right off the bat, leaving me excited for the rest of the film. The first thing that struck me was the soundtrack, which was classy and energetic, and is one of the main things that sticks out. It tied in well with the 1960s period and the sophisticated locations in the film. Man From U.N.C.L.E had me on the edge of my seat right from the beginning, because not far into the start an epic car chase broke out on screen which left the audience with many questions about what would happen next.This film was colourful and to me was unique, down to the way that the subtitles appeared on-screen. I particularly liked the ultra close ups which left the audience in even more suspense and also reminded me a lot of comic strips. The plot was very interesting and consistently shocking, as it constantly leaves you wondering which characters could be trusted, as well as keeping your mind racing. I also found this film very funny. This added a lighter feel to the danger that the characters faced. Henry Cavill's performance as Solo was smart and witty, in contrast to Armie Hammer who played the icy Illya extremely well. I recommend this film to everybody, as there is something in it for everyone even if you do not like action films. I saw this film with my Grandma and my younger brothers and they all equally enjoyed it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cool Cold War</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Quickie Review:A criminal organisation is on the verge of acquiring nuclear weapons. In the height of cold war a CIA agent Napoleon Solo (Henry Cavill) and KGB operative Illya Kuryakin (Armie Hammer) put aside their differences for a joint mission. This uneasy alliance must succeed to ensure world stability. The Man from U.N.C.L.E. is a surprisingly fun homage to the earlier Bond type films. The team-up of two rivals for a common mission also added a new twist to an otherwise predictable story. The stylised approach to the film is part of the charm and the great chemistry among the cast brought moments of amusing tongue-in-cheek humour.Full Review:I am not familiar with the original show, it was way before my generation. However, with the dark tones of many blockbusters nowadays, it's refreshing to return to a lighter and more vibrant movie in the spy-genre. On top of that with Guy Ritchie directing, known for his witty dialogue and often odd humour, I had to check out his latest effort.The style of the movie is what will immediately grab the attention of the audience. Although it may be a little over-romanticised, Guy Ritchie beautifully captures the glamour of the 60s. From the locales, cars, outfits, even the music are all aesthetically rich and beautiful. Still this movie is not all style, the three major characters are perfectly cast leading to an entertaining chemistry among them. Henry Cavill plays the more suave gentleman using his charisma to get what he wants. Whereas Armie Hammer's character is a more rugged man, and you really don't want to be on his bad side. These differences between the two complement well with each other and that's why half the fun of the movie is just watching them interact. The third major character is played by Alicia Vikander, a resourceful woman who should not be underestimated. And thank god, they didn't introduce any useless love triangle here. I was afraid that Vikander's character's only purpose would be a love interest, but she is very much integral to the mission. Although this is an homage to the early spy movies it is still quite grounded, in that there are no ridiculous gadgets. So I like how they were able to balance the realism with the stylised nature of the movie.At the same time a spy homage does come with its disadvantages. The threat in the story is very predictable, and you know exactly where it is going. There are no major surprises, and most likely even the little twists you will see them coming from miles away. Nevertheless the movie is peppered with clever humour and even the obvious innuendos are funny because of the characters, that you have satisfying ride. On a side note, there was a missed opportunity with Hammer's character, Illya. The movie constantly refers to his rage but we never really witness him fully lose control. I would've liked to have seen more of that side of him than being simply suggested to us.Overall, my friends and I had an entertaining time in the cinema watching The Man from U.N.C.L.E. If you are looking for a funny adventure or action-comedy to enjoy with your friends and family, this is a very good choice for you to consider. In fact, I'd say I would actually like to see a sequel to this movie and go on more spy adventures with these characters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A slick, retro spy thriller that's pure fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Close on the heels of 'Rogue Nation' comes another espionage thriller to tease the mind while providing popcorn entertainment with its charismatic characters and slick action. Guy Ritchie (Lock, stock and two smoking barrels, Snatch, Sherlock Holmes, Sherlock Holmes: A game of shadows) has almost mastered the retro theme and with this adaptation of a 1964 TV series, he gets to have fun with his stylized direction and intuitive handling of the script. 'The Man from U.N.C.L.E' salutes the pop culture of the 60s with its fine details in set design, costumes and props. It also pays tribute to the good old spy thrillers with few gadgets and special effects so as to keep wit, charm and luck as the tools for success by the agents. Visually, the film is slick and resembles this year's 'Kingsman: The Secret Service' with its breezy elegance and cheeky humor. Napoleon Solo (Henry Cavill) was a master thief who now works for the CIA as their valuable agent. His mission in east Berlin is to extract Gaby Teller (Swedish Alicia Vikander) and have her dissuade her father from developing a nuclear bomb for the nefarious Vinciguerras. His attempt at escaping with her is challenged by the KGB operative, Illya Kuryakin (Armie Hammer) in a smooth and exciting opening sequence that will leave you applauding with sheer joy. Later, the CIA director Saunders (Jared Harris) informs Solo that he will be joining forces with his KGB counterpart to form an unusual alliance in the middle of the cold war. The trio travel to Rome, faking their identities in order to gain the trust of Victoria Vinciguerra (Elizabeth Debicki) and during their investigation of a shipping yard, find evidence of the uranium that will be used for the weapons. Their subsequent discovery by the security leads to the film's best sequence that is cheeky in nature and brilliant in execution by Ritchie. After further set-backs for Solo and Kuryakin where they get close to being captured and killed, the MI6 operative Waverly (Hugh Grant) proposes an assault on the Vinciguerras' hideout in order to rescue Teller's father and prevent the deployment of the nuclear warheads. The multi-frame shots of the attack sequence showcase the slick and improvised style of Ritchie's direction that moves past the obvious and re-focuses on the chemistry between the actors as they get closer to intercepting Victoria and the weapons. The disc containing data of Teller's nuclear weapons research is still sought after by both Solo and Kuryakin as part of their individual missions and its possession by either, will test the dynamics of their relationship.Armie Hammer's Kuryakin is an awkward, temperamental agent who is of course competitive with his American counterpart. His awkward, fake romance with Alicia Vikander's Teller is where is portrayed convincingly and results in some funny situations. Alicia's charming Gaby Teller is lovable at first sight and she can be a mean agent as well. Elizabeth Debicki plays the stunning vixen with finesse and enough aura of evil to be the convincing antagonist. Henry Cavill's suave American agent possesses the charm of the earlier James Bonds although, he's definitely more MI6 than CIA material. He is versatile when it comes to maintaining composure in the thick of the action, being naughty with the antagonist, trying to better his partner or simply, being too cool as Napoleon Solo. The music by Daniel Pemberton is first rate with playful themes to maintain the breezy feel of the film even in the tense moments while building the tempo when needed. For a budget of $75 million, the set pieces, costumes and art design match up very well to the theme of the 60s and the action also looks better than the medium budget could afford. Guy Ritchie brings nuance to the spy genre by keeping it refreshingly entertaining through witty situations, slick cinematography, dialogues, crisp editing and a constantly zippy plot- line that demands much from the actors. There's never a dull moment here and these men from U.N.C.L.E do their business in a style that's almost incomparable. Several sequences are hilarious because of the way Guy Ritchie treats an otherwise ordinary piece of action. It's his deft touch that delivers this refreshing take on old school cinema that has just enough oomph with the appeal of its cast, production and entertaining theme.- 8.881 on a scale of 1-10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why Not "Men" From U.N.C.L.E? Leads Have Equal Time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Man From U.N.C.L.E (2015): Dir: Guy Ritchie / Cast: Henry Cavill, Armie Hammer, Alicia Vikander, Elizabeth Debicki, Jared Harris: Based on the TV show from the 1960's, this well produced crime caper should be called Men From U.N.C.L.E since both male leads share equal screen time. It stars Henry Cavill as agent Napoleon Solo and he opens the film by locating the daughter of a nuclear scientist who has gone missing. Armie Hammer plays Russian agent Illya Kuryakin who is at constant odds with Solo especially after the high chase opening where they are opposing factors. They must put their differences aside to locate a disc and stop a nuclear bomb. Guy Ritchie has directed such celebrated treasures as Sherlock Holmes and Snatch. Here he delivers a visually impressive update with a screenplay full of twists and turns where trust becomes a factor. Cavill is appropriate casting as Solo who is a thief and a charmer but unable to avoid situations that have him strapped to an electro chair. Hammer plays Illya as someone struggling to control his temper, which leads to an amusing scene where he is mugged at knife point. It is Solo's wit and Kuryakin's strength that combine to solve the case. Alicia Vikander as the nuclear scientist's daughter has fun decoying as Kuryakin's fiancé while also proving to use her wit to her advantage. Elizabeth Debicki plays the seductive villain whose wit matches Solo's. Other roles are not as broad including a somewhat wasted appearance by Hugh Grant. While silly and corny it is generally a tamer version of what audiences expect from 007 films. Score: 7 ? / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Man from U.N.C.L.E. was a slick, witty, and action packed send up to the classic spy genre. Admittedly, I don't remember a lot of it after the fact, but there was enough of Guy Ritchie's charm and quirkiness that makes the experience as a whole stick with me. The characters aren't the deepest, but they are still interesting, with special props going to Henry Cavill as a super-suave spy and Arnie Hammer as the tortured KGB agent. It can get pretty heavy, a lot heavier than other Guy Ritchie films, and the jokes aren't always laugh-out-loud, but it's cleverness and sense of fun is present and that's what makes directors like Ritchie and Wes Anderson my inspirations.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>2015 has been a very good year for spy movies. Early on Kingsman arrived, which surprised a lot of people. Melissa McCarthy made her comeback from the awful Tammy with Spy, a very funny secret agent comedy. Then the new Mission Impossible came out and it was outstanding. Later this year we have the new Bond movie and it seems promising. Plus the Man from U.N.C.L.E: I liked it a lot. The action scenes are stylishly done, as to be expected from a Guy Ritchie film. Plenty of fast camera moves and zooms and clever editing. There's also a neat storytelling device: something happens but music plays over it so we can't hear what the actors say, and their actions don't make sense. Then they show it to us later on with the sound, and it all fits into place. That was quite ingenious. The characters are all good, I like the contrast between the two spies: one is very uptight, the other almost too loose. As befits a spy movie there is plenty of double crosses, stakeouts and chases. Because it's based off a classic show, it feels pretty retro: the theme is cold war espionage. It's a neat throwback element to it. I enjoyed the music montages; they were originally done. The mix of humour and seriousness really worked. All in all, it's another good spy flick to add to the list of good 2015 spy flicks</fullReview>

		<fullReview>FOREWORD: I don't think this contains spoilers, but just in case, I checked the box.A mix of Spy Vs. Spy (comic), White Collar (TV), and James Bond movies - The World Is Not Enough AND Quantum of Solace come to mind and that's not a good thing. Henry Cavil (Solo) did well - the character really was a remake of White Collar (Matthew Bomer's character of a super-thief forced to work for the U.S. Government); he played it well as a super-cool super- spy.Armie Hammer (Ilya) did a very good job of showing a conflicted Russian spy with Daddy/anger/loyalty issues during the Cold War. Wish I hadn't caught him dropping his Russian accent. 99% of the movie, I expected him to "come out" as a gay Russian when gay was REALLY bad to be. A plus to the movie, to be sure.Alicia Vikander (Gaby)... not sure if it was the character or the actress, but can't tell where my lack of give a damn on her character living or dying came from. Going with the former due to writing. Writers - no, I'm not saying I could do a better job .. because I've never tried.Elizabeth Debicki (Victoria) did a good hot-but-bad girl, although, if they'd slapped more eye makeup on her, she might have fallen over. Beautiful and sexy, if she were going for sensuous, she missed.The movie seemed somewhat of a British take on an old style of American spy flicks from the 1970s. Guy Ritchie even threw in a mini- Tarantino for fun. Some of the humor was very British; from an American perspective, somewhat dry ... although some of the humor was good ... must have had multiple comedic writers involved. A twist here, a minor surprise there, I'd see this on TV if it comes on. I was entertained - biggest regret = I spent $18 on concessions!</fullReview>

Carroll as the real United Network Command for Law and Enforcement ? shortened to U.N.C.L.E. Of course, these days, the movie industry is committed to remakes, sequels and re-boots, and it's not surprising that it takes "Superman" and "The Lone Ranger" to try and fill the shoes of Napoleon Solo and Ilya Kuryakin.Henry Cavill as Solo and Armie Hammer as Kuryakin join forces with Alicia Vikander (Ex Machina) as Gaby in a mission to thwart the sale of a nuclear warhead built under duress by Gaby's estranged father. Also joining in the fun are Jared Harris as Sanders, Hugh Grant as Waverly (Mr. Carroll's old role) and Elizabeth Debicki (she made quite an impression as Jordan Baker in The Great Gatsby), who makes a very intriguing "bad guy" as Victoria.A one word description of this movie would be pretty. Most EVERYTHING and EVERYONE are pretty. The clothes are pretty. The sets are pretty. The Italian locations are pretty, and Lord knows the people are pretty. Most of the lead actors have spent some time modeling: Cavill, Hammer, Vikander, Grant, Debicki, and Luca Calvana. Heck, David Beckham even has a cameo just to make sure every scene includes someone really pretty.In the same year with the latest Mission: Impossible and James Bond movies, it's understandable that the Sherlock Holmes writer/director team of Lionel Wigram and Guy Ritchie take a less serious and more tongue-in-cheek approach. Unfortunately, the comic chops are a bit weak on the leads, so while they look pretty ? many of the punchlines come off pretty weak.For any other surviving loyalists to the original TV series, the best advice would be to accept the movie for what it is, and avoid comparing to those classic memories. Even Jerry Goldsmith's original theme song only merits a few moments of airtime. Those unfamiliar with the original material will likely accept this as the Pirates of the Caribbean of spy movies, and understand that the current TV show "The Americans" handles the Cold War much more dramatically and intensely. However, if anyone is looking for pretty ?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the early 1960s right after the Cold War started CIA agent Solo (Henry Cavill) and KGB agent Illya (Armie Hammer) have to work together to find a kidnapped scientist who can make a nuclear warhead. Helping them is the scientist's daughter Gaby (Alicia Vikander). They also get involved with the beautiful but deadly Victoria (Elizabeth Debicki).Updating of a 1960s TV series which I never saw. It's well-done with some cool action sequences and fairly tame violence (except for the end). Cool use of split scenes during some of the action too. They capture the early 60s fashions, cars and architecture perfectly. This film is VERY colorful. The acting is mostly good. Cavill is suave and very fun as Solo. On the negative side the plot is overly convoluted--a LOT is thrown at you at the beginning. There are at least three endings also--two too many. Worst of all is Hammer--he's TERRIBLE in his role. Very wooden and unconvincing. Still I was never bored and enjoyed it. So I marginally recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was wavering on whether I would want to see this TV Series type of remake. I went and was pleasantly surprised that it held to the concept of the TV show, but had it's own character.I felt the casting was well done and spot on. Henry Cavill pulls off the suave gentleman spy and Armie Hammer is believable as a KGB agent. The story of well done, the cinematography has bold colors, but many of the daytime, outdoor work has the look of a 60's time period.I will say that you need to pay attention to the mission briefing so you don't have to do the math on it later. I looked away to answer my son and then had no idea who a couple of the key players were. So do yourself a favor and check out a film that you can get immersed in.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Man from U.N.C.L.E is an action comedy starring Henry Cavill, Armie Hammer, and the incredible Alicia Vikander in a 1960's period piece spy film, that i have to say was a little better than i thought it was going to be. Now the film is based off a TV series that aired during the 60's by the same name, but i don't expect you to remember watching that show unless you are at least 55-60 and even then it doesn't matter because this might as well have been called something else and no-one would have made the connection. I will start by saying that this was a little more comedic than i thought it was going to be, not so much the laugh out loud kind just some funny gags throughout the film to keep you laughing the mood light and fun. There was action in the film and it was handled very well but not as much as i thought there was going to be as there was quite a bit of dialogue taking up a lot of the movie, but the comedic moments were well timed and the action set pieces were entertaining enough to contrast the more slower exposition filled scenes. The cinematography and directing of this film were great, Guy Ritchie utilised a very comic-book like visual style to shoot the action scenes and transitions and it gave the film a fresh feel to it, like something more than your generic action film. The plot itself had a lot to offer in terms of surprises and taking turns that always kept the film interesting and not predictable at all. The only thing i thought could have been handled better were the lengths of some of the exposition scenes because it slightly affected the pace of the film at times where it was swapping from fast paced to slow paced pretty quickly and was a little jarring. But that was my only gripe with this film. I have to talk about the best part of this film, the characters. Henry Cavill, Armie Hammer, and of course the amazing Alicia Vikander were astounding in their roles and the chemistry between the three of them was hilariously fun and entertaining, i could watch these three go at each other for hours and not get bored. The back and forth between Cavill and Hammer was the star of the show, their contrasting backgrounds gave some hilarious moments and when they clashed it was great to see their interactions. The other thing i have to commemorate this film for doing is handling character setup and development incredibly well. A lot of the film was focused on these characters and you could really see their progression throughout the film, how much they changed and/or did't change and i made for a very fun ride. But the setup of these characters was undoubtedly flawless, they were all introduced and setup right away and no time was wasted on long introductions. They managed to capture the characters' personalities in one sequence which is what more films should strive to do.This is no masterpiece but it is definitely a very fun theatre experience with great action comedy and characters. More people should definitely see this film, i feel the lack of knowledge of the original property and lack of a big leading man would turn people away from seeing it but this really is a film worth seeing. - 7.8</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Smart Comedy-Thriller a Throwback to the 1960's Setting and Culture: Sort of Bond Meets Bourne</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unlike the recent James Bonds films where 007 uses cell phones, laptops and the world wide web (the days of the lethal ballpoint pen are over), the recent film "The Man from U.N.C.L.E." relies on the sensibilities of 1960's thriller films and televisions shows as its setting and culture. Not only are the cars and the old-style phones from a bygone era present, secret agents kiss the hands of beautiful but wicked heiresses, the managers of hotels offer complimentary champagne to their guests in lavish rooms, and everyone dresses as if they just had a shopping spree, spending $1000's at Neiman Marcus. There are even a few split-screen sequences. This was the way these kinds of action films and shows were presented from circa 1956 to 1969 before the counter-culture dismissed them as being elitist. During the era, Cary Grant, Audrey Hepburn, Sean Connery, and Diana Rigg often starred in these light-hearted entertainments which often combined action and comedy, and now three new actors have taken the reigns to offer us a recap of these films with higher budgets and high definition.Napoleon Solo (Henry Cavill ), a dapper Sean Connery-type whose character we learn at the story's beginning had broken some serious international laws is the American's star agent among their counter-intelligence/espionage syndicate. Instead of allowing his talents to waste away in prison, the counter-espionage division has drafted him into their organization. At least he's no longer behind bars. His missions involve rescuing dissidents from the so-called "Eastern Block" controlled by the USSR after World War II. At his disposal are fast cars, automatic weapons, and sarcastic wit, all used equally.Solo's current assignment is to "liberate" Gaby Teller (Alicia Vikander), an auto mechanic residing in East Berlin, East Germany. The organization wants her rescued, not because the counter-intelligence organization is benevolent and wish her to be "free" in the west, but because she's the daughter of a German nuclear scientist who turned during World War II but has now disappeared. He's possibly working for a criminal syndicate who wants to sell nuclear weapons to the highest bidder, run by a sexually alluring but no-holds-barred baddie name Victoria Vinciguerra. (She could easily date Hans Gruber, the baddie from the first "Die Hard" film.) After a chase in which Gaby and Solo confront and escape from a KGB operative who would give the Terminator a run for his money, Illya Kuryakin (Armie Hammer), Gaby and Solo are given an assignment in Rome and paired with another operative. Much to their dismay it's also Illya Kuryakin, the KGB agent who tried to stop Gaby's defection by chasing on foot a car going 45 mph. Turns out the Soviets are just as fearful of this underground syndicate as the Americans, and Kuryakin has been assigned to partner with Gaby and Solo. Which is one of the points of this film: this film has a lot of unexpected twists and turns, this one being the first of many. At times, to show us what's really going on, the film has short flashbacks where a previously unseen nuance is revealed. As this device isn't used too often, strangely it works.So the three go to Rome with Kuryakin posing as Gaby's fiancé and Solo assigned to find out about Victoria. Many of the devices, settings, and scenarios used in the films and shows of the late 1950's to 1960's are present: the daytime social gathering, in this case an auto race, the lavish hotels, where Gaby and Illya pretend to be a couple in love, and the American agent causing a bit of romantic interest from the evil but alluring woman who runs her crime organization like a dicta-tress. She wears draping silk and chiffon while planning her next Lex-Luther-like endeavor. However, as intriguing as Victoria is, Gaby, on the "good" side, is even more enchanting. Vikander plays Gaby with the vulnerable appeal of an Audrey Hepburn along with the European strength and sexuality of a Sophia Loren, and a little bit of Diana Rigg thrown in for good measure. Even her hairdo is a throwback to the era with a little bit on the top with soft waves cascading down her shoulders. Her personality and demeanor may be closest to Joanne Linville who played the Romulan Commander in the Star Trek episode "The Enterprise Incident" which originally aired in 1968.Overall, a pure fun and escapist film. There are some moments where while one very dramatic action sequence is occurring, something else, often more mundane but amusing, is happening at the forefront. There are a lot of in-jokes about the films and sensibilities of the action films and shows which were popular several decades ago. An unexpected chemistry evolves from the three leads, Cavill, Vikander and Hammer. What makes it work is they are all somewhat different which makes their interactions interesting and compelling. Solo is the Bond-type who doesn't take things too seriously while engaging in his missions contrasted with Illya whose temper easily flairs when he feels he's being insulted, clenching his fists like a Soviet henchman. Gaby's character lies somewhere between the two, serious but not easily enthralled with the American or the Russian. The three are essentially reluctant bedfellows in a dangerous game, until an interesting twist reveals one of the three may not be "on the level".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Style manages to overcome lack of depth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Man from U.N.C.L.E is a spy film based on the 1964 TV series of the same name and basically re-wraps the characters into new looking people. The movie boasts fine action, style to blow your eyes out and a nice little score to go along with it too, this movie is after all that happens, a fun little ride. That said I think there are things wrong with it and that comes more from the directors chair and writers than anywhere else but nevertheless don't get me wrong, I kind of liked this movie.The movie works mostly because of its loud action scenes and booming but stylish score which both combine well to ensnare the senses. The movie can at times get a little congested with things going on and the ending is a little messy but overall the film is enjoyable and I felt some will love it very much so. It has its likable leads, for me it is Armie Hammer who stands out, not necessarily just because of his acting skill, but more because I think his character is nicely done. Henry Cavill overcomes a not always on point accent to be humorous as well as good in his role, makes the character of Napoleon Solo not only fun to be around but also a person that works with Armie Hammer's character Illya Kuryakin. Alicia Vikander is fun in her role as Gabriella and although I wasn't as keen as some people were on her character, she still provides at times light humour. It is Guy Ritchie who directs, bringing with him bags of gangster movie experience and comedy, well maybe he only needs the comedy here. I felt Ritchie does well but not great and can at times feel as if he just didn't know how to make the scene work so it looks rushed, doesn't happen a lot but can at moments. It is Ritchie who also co-writes this piece too creating a script that although is acceptable for this movie, it is still a poor piece of work and sometimes the actors are the one's who improve the scene.One thing that the film is really good for and a thing that will probably be overlooked is the score, a fine mixture of sounds combined together to create a movie that feels like a spy movie crossed with well, a spy movie(but one from the 60's). This movie is all about showing you it's a spy movie, it really tries to make you think that scene was cool and the next one was too, the style is layered on top of little substance and a plot that although funny and filled with good action, is still not the best made or not made as good as it could have been.If you're looking for a new James Bond type movie you won't find it here, it does breathe that feeling that Sean Connery brought to the screens of the 60's but fails to make it exciting enough to match it. That all said the film is good stuff and boasts all round entertainment, maybe seeing it in the cinema like I did makes it seemingly more enthralling but I think in any format it would still be entertaining for most. I wouldn't say this will make Guy Ritchie say this is his best work but also this is not in anyway's a bad movie, the kind of film that anyone can enjoy just so long as they look past the script and parts of direction, and enjoy the feast of style that is so plainly on show like a bag of 60's style thrown onto a canvas. I must also add this is the kind of movie that is not memorable, the kind of flick I'd maybe watch again but not be desperate too, I do however think some will fully enjoy much more though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A slick, stylish thrilling entertainer. Guy Ritchie is BACK!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have always been a Guy Ritchie fan, from Snatch to Long Stock and Two Barrels I have always appreciated his style of cinema,,but I was left a bit disappointed with Rock N Rolla. Following mixed reviews for his latest offering The Man from U.N.C.L.E. I was feeling a tad underwhelmed before entering the cinema hall. But boy was I surprised with The Man from U.N.C.L.E. Guy Ritchie is back. The film was throughly entertaining from the first frame to last, the pace was breezy, there was never a dull moment. The film is slick, stylish, and the films locations leaves you in awe. The 60s looked so beautiful places like Germany and Rome are breathtaking.The films action is top notch and the film is shot in a ultra stylish way. And the film has the signature Guy Ritchie twists that you never see coming.Story wise the film is about about a American and Russian CIA agent working together with a German girl to stop the remaining German Nazi's in the Cold War period from getting there hands on a atomic bomb.The German girls father is the one who is creating the bomb, they need her to contact her father through her Uncle and his company who are the ones trying to make the bomb.Acting wise the film has two master class performances by Henry Cavil and Armie Hammer, they kill it in there respective CIA roles. There comic bantering is absolutely hilarious and a huge reason why the film works.Alicia Vikander has a meaty role and she is good in her part.The only minor thing the film could have improved on its story a bit. It moves in a pretty straightforward predictable manner until the signature, twist or two that all Guy Ritchie films have. But honestly the ongoing proceedings are so entertaining that you wont even notice any blemishes.Overall after last weeks The Gift,The Man from U.N.C.L.E. is easily the most satisfying, and Kick ass watch of this summer.I think I now have a tie for the best summer film of the year. I highly recommend this stylish, slick, action filled, thriller. I mean the film even has a touch of comedy, and the film just looks so beautiful. Its the totally package a smart entertaining film, and if your a Guy Ritchie fan, run to the theatres!4/5* or 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun Spy Flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw a trailer for this and it looked okay so I decided to go out and see it. Based on a TV show, (I haven't seen it so I can't compare) it's set during the 1960's and is about an American CIA Agent who is teamed up with a Russian KGB operative and they're forced to work together by their superiors to stop a criminal organization from harnessing Nuclear Weapons. The two main leads, Henry Cavil (Man of Steel) and Armie Hammer (The Lone Ranger) both give pretty good performances as their respective parts as the U.S and Russian Agents. The movie starts out with an exciting chase scene which sets up the chemistry and rivalry between the two leads. This year has been a great year for spy movies (Kingsman, Spy, Mission Impossible 5, the upcoming James Bond movie) and this just added to this great year for the genre. Besides some good action, there was also a lot of humor in this which payed off and I loved this movie. idk if there's any plans for a sequel but if there is, I'm all for it, definitely recommended for action and spy movie lovers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Renewed High Standard for Spy Films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the old days, Hollywood could make action movies with vim and elan. Movies that tasted like a finely aged Serrano ham sliced to the whisper breadth of an onion skin. It looks like Guy Ritchie and (co-writer) Lionel Wigram have re-discovered this lost formula, and The Man From U.N.C.L.E. is what they've made with it.Loosely based on the old Robert Vaughan television show, we can hardly consider this a re-make. No one here is channeling 1960's afternoon television. Rather, it is the deadly serious geopolitical scene of the same decade these pros are playing with, and that scene was all about nukes. The film starts in East Berlin, and looks to be a standard issue tail and chase, dark alley affair in its first twenty minutes, moving at a leisurely pace. Henry Cavill is Napoleon Solo, and while that is a James Bond-ish name, his character couldn't be further removed from the oft-copied Bond type. Cavill's free safety sized frame aside, his Solo is a silky viper, more comfortable with picking pockets and advising chaffeurs on optimized escape maneuvers than using any 'license to kill.'Solo meets Gaby, played by Alicia Vikander, an East German seemingly in need of rescuing, the daughter of a sought-after nuclear weapons designer. Vikander, it must be said, delivers a knock-out performance benefiting from certain welcome plot choices that give Gaby strength and control where other spy franchises would keep her 'helpless but hot.'Armie Hammer is a Russian agent countering Solo's advance into the communist east, when, to the consternation of the two agents and to the audience's clucking amusement, "something happens," and they are ordered to work together. The film is now off and running, a tri-lateral buddy cop story set in a realistic mid-1960s Cold War milieu, but with heist-film hijinx and the impossibly stylish surfaces of the Steve McQueen version of The Thomas Crown Affair. Cavill as Solo and Hammer as "Ilya" are rivals from the start, even when they are supposed to be teammates, and their rivalry sparks fantastic momentum, as well as delicious consternation from Vikander's Gaby, whom they may be falling secretly and not-so- secretly into infatuation with. Ritchie directs the film like a tyro. Several assault sequences are downright balletic. The head villain, an Italian Countess, is played with convincing deadly brio by Elizabeth Debicki, another welcome evolution for the espionage genre. This is a spy movie for adults. Savvy and elegant.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stylistically awesome; Guy Ritchie at his best!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'THE MAN FROM U.N.C.L.E.': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Spy flick, directed by Guy Ritchie, and based on the 1964 TV series, of the same name. It stars Henry Cavill and Armie Hammer, as two secret agents, one American and one Russian, assigned to work together; to stop a mad couple from building a nuclear weapon. The film also stars Alicia Vikander, Elizabeth Debicki, Luca Calvani, Jared Harris and Hugh Grant; it was written by Ritchie, Lionel Wigram, Jeff Kleeman and David Campbell Wilson. I found the film to be stylistically awesome, funny and immensely entertaining; despite a weak plot!The film begins in 1963 East Berlin. CIA agent Napoleon Solo (Cavill), has just tracked down a woman, by the name of Gabby Teller (Vikander, of 'EX MACHINA' fame). He's being followed by a KGB agent, named Illya Kuryakin (Hammer), who also wants to apprehend Teller. Gabby's father is a Nazi scientist, who's been aiding the U.S. government, but went missing. It turns out that the scientist's knowledge is being used to create a nuclear weapon; for a rich Italian couple (Debicki and Calvani) in Rome, with former Nazi ties. After Solo and Kuryakin try to kill each other, they're forced to team up, by their employers, and stop the completion of the nuclear device. Teller helps them, on their mission in Rome, as well. Like many previous Guy Ritchie films, I couldn't follow the storyline nearly at all (while I was watching it). Also like previous Guy Ritchie flicks, it didn't matter though. The movie is funny (the jokes almost always work) and the characters are very likable (you actually care what happens to them). I wasn't involved in what was going on with the plot, at all; but I was very involved in what was going on with the characters. Cavill and Hammer are both brilliantly cast, and they have great chemistry together too (the film turns into an awesome buddy flick). Vikander and Debicki are both stunningly beautiful and good in their roles as well; Debicki makes a great femme fatale also. The film is also beautifully stylistic, action-packed and always fascinating to watch; even if you don't always know what's going on. Besides a coherent plot, you can't really ask for a lot more in a film; this is definitely not a movie that demands one though. It's Guy Ritchie at his best!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/iHtyjLDJ1Ko</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Entertaining Throw-back to the Spy Movies of Yesteryear</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sandwiched between two juggernaut spy movie franchises, The Man From UNCLE could and seemingly has been overlooked by many movie goers. While not filled to the brim with spectacular action and stunts like MI: Rogue Nation, UNCLE delivers an entertaining 60's Bond-style experience. The Good: Napoleon Solo (Henry Cavil) and Illya Kuryakin (Armie Hammer) work well as spies with opposing methods and demeanors. Cavil is calm, collected, smooth, and opts to use his intellect more than his muscle; while Hammer is more volatile, straightforward, and emotional. Their constant rivalry and "one upsmanship" with each other helps add just enough comical spice in what would be considered an average spy story. Cavil's performance is what surprised me as I found his character to be quite "one note," but Cavil gives just enough to make the character seem more keen than the actual story does.The Bad: *Possible Mild Spoiler* The love story between Kuryakin and Gaby (Alicia Vikander) felt totally forced and out of place. I can see what they were trying to accomplish with it, but the execution was bad. It also has some slow moments and feels just a tad bit too long overall, but nothing that would make me dislike the experience.Overall, I found this to be an entertaining spy movie with some nice action pieces, great comedic moments, and interesting characters. While not groundbreaking story wise, the movie as a whole is a worthwhile experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Armie Hammers another Remake Role</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For some reason, some folks are just destined to try to recreate roles instead of getting something new and fresh to get after. In this one Hammer gets to recreate David Mccallum's Russian agent. The recreation of Robert Vaughn's Solo role is no small task in itself. Kudos to Guy Richie. This film appears to be sharp on location and it escapes the obvious TV action trap of falling into just another action remake. The addition of a Swedish Bombshell to peak the males interest is no bad idea. The film does prove at points how hard it is to recreate the 1960's but doe update enough to get rid of the incessant ringing of a telephone so much of this periods original work is loaded with if you watch Columbo re-runs. Bravo to this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In terms of what this film is trying to do: surround a retro plot with likable characters, sparky dialogue, beautiful locations and gorgeous accessories it succeeds totally. The action sequences are exciting, and the way that Guy Ritchie deconstructs and explains certain sequences within the film adds to the exposition, and brings cocksure flair to the direction. I hope that this film makes money, and I would be delighted to see a sequel. Ritchie cops too much flack. This film carried off the 'sixties thing just as well as American Hustle did the 'seventies. And this film had more wit and zip. I also preferred the Man From U.N.C.L.E. to either Casino Royale or A Quantum of Solace. They could do worse than approach Ritchie when Sam Mendes gets sick of Bond. I have awarded 8 out of ten because although the film succeeds in achieving its aims, it's aims are relatively modest. We're not talking high art or truly memorable cinema here, but as the cinematic equivalent of a special chow mein, its a tasty one, and a great example of what it is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although I'm old enough to have remembered the original TV series airing; I have to confess I never watched it. So I went into the theater with no preconceived baseline on how the characters or film should play out.The film did a nice job of capturing the fashion and background of the Sixties. I also enjoyed Henry Cavill and Armie Hammer's performances. Cavill's Napoleon Solo played like an American version of a Connery-era James Bond, while Hammer was convincing as an ill-tempered Russian.Unfortunately the story felt like I had seen it several dozen times before. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't memorable either... much like the film's villain. I also felt Guy Ritchie's multi-scene action sequences were more of a distraction than a visual treat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Man from U.N.C.L.E ? The Prequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, I have always been a devoted U.N.C.L.E. fan all my life from the very first episode which was aired on September 21, 1964. I was only 9 years old at the time but "the man from U.N.C.L.E" left a lifelong impression on me. It's one of the driving reasons I went into Law Enforcement. I collected anything and everything that was U.N.C.L.E related and still have that collection today! So, with all this in mind, here is my take on the movie and a word caution: If you is expecting to see the show with hopes of re-experiencing our two favorite agents entering the secret entrance to the New York HQ via Del Floria's Tailor Shop you are going to be disappointed! Because this is NOT the premise of the movie.However, for all the new fans and us old timer's that can get into the idea of seeing a prequel on how, Illya Kuryakin, Napoleon Solo and Alexander Waverly first meet (and getting to know a lot more about all their backgrounds); then you are in for a treat! The movie does a remarkable job of capturing the essence of life in the early 1960's and set stage for a great spy thriller of two agents (one CIA and the other KGB) being forced to work together to prevent an international criminal organization from using a Nuclear bomb to instigate a world crisis. While THURSH is never mentioned by name; fans of the original series will know all know who is behind this! The movie is fast paced, full of car chases, plot twists, intrigue, plot twists and even double twists to keep the most avid spy and mystery lover guessing all the way through the end of movie! You can take nothing for granted and many things and people are not what they seem! And, for all us hardcore U.N.C.L.E. fans we get to see our beloved "U.N.C.L.E Carbine Special" again! Bottom line this is a classic spy/action thriller! With lots of classic U.N.C.L.E humor thrown in to break the mood when thing get a little too intense!

		<shortDescription>More of a prequel than a spin off I found the film very entertaining and most enjoyable.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all I DO remember the original TV series and was a huge fan. A 12 year old huge fan but still. I was a little worried that someone thought the TV show needed up dating; not so. This was not a spin off or an update but a prequel firmly set in the Cold War 60's right where it should be. It dealt with material not really touched in the series as I remember and so did not "get it all wrong" as so many remakes do. The movie was fast paced and stylish. It was funny without being tongue in cheek or mocking (don't care for that). It was grim in a couple of spots, after all, there was a diabolical mastermind to be defeated; but I came away smiling and completely entertained. GOOD JOB</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good adaptation of a TV classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to be honest and say when I first heard that they were planning a big screen adaptation of another 60s classic TV show, I was very sceptical as in the past they have not been very good (for example Lost In Space, The Loan Ranger etc). So I went to see this movie with an open mind, hoping it would beat the odds, and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised how much I actually enjoyed it.I am not normally a fan of Guy Ritchie's movies, but he certainly has pulled out all the stops with this movie. Giving it own style and panache but still managing to keep the humour from the original TV show. From the start it the audience a fun ride, with an amusing action set piece at the start and then slowly gathering pace towards a climatic finale.Henry Cavill and Armie Hammer were a good choice two leading men, their on screen chemistry shined, both managing to bring across an on-screen rivalry which was fun to watch. Hugh Grant was pleasantly surprising as British Secret Agent/Mysterious "boss" pulling strings from behind the scenes.For a spy movie it was Bond used to be, stylish, full humour, action and also it was tongue in cheek, not taking itself too seriously. Also had a great foot-tapping sound track to match.My only disappointment is that we never got a cameo from the original Napoleon Solo &amp; Illya Kuryakin - Robert Vaughn and David McCallum, which is a shame but understandable it was intentional.Overall a very good film and a great cast. If the end scene, with the formation of the UNCLE team, I hope we get to see more future missions from this merry gang.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Man From U.N.C.L.E. Is A Beautiful Throwback Of A Spy Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most of the spy movie genre is now taking more cues from Jason Bourne than James Bond. This is fine, I personally enjoy both. But I do miss the days where spy movies weren't so serious. We got Kingsman: The Secret Service which was a old school spy movie mixed with a parody but if there was a movie that had the feel of the classic spy films, it was The Man From U.N.C.L.E.. Starring 2 actors that were coming off of mixed box office success, this movie didn't change that but judging from the IMDb score, I think that most people who got a chance to see it really enjoyed it. I hope that overtime it finds the audience it deserves because I really enjoyed it.*Minor Spoilers Ahead* After a beautiful introduction of the events leading up from World War 2 to the Cold War in the 1960s, we join our two leads Napoleon Solo (Henry Cavill) and Ilya Kuryakin (Armie Hammer) entering East Berlin separately. The year is 1963 and they are both spies but for separate agencies. Napoleon is a former master art thief who the CIA turned into a spy and Ilya is a KGB elite operative with a temper and a checkered family past. We follow Napoleon first who walks into a garage looking for Gaby Teller. Gaby (Alicia Vikander) is a mechanic there but the reason Napoleon is really there is that her father Dr. Udo Teller is a famous ex-Nazi nuclear scientist, who is in demand because of his genius. Gaby isn't terribly receptive until Napoleon promises to get her over the wall (that and the fact the Russians might not be so friendly when they get to her). They depart as quickly as they can with Ilya in pursuit.A movie shouldn't be solely judged on the money that the studio put into it but one of the best parts of this movie is how visually gorgeous it is. The costumes, the locations, the set design, the vehicles and the cinematography were some of the best I've seen in a while. It really helps you dive into the world this movie exists in. You can say that about a lot of big budget films today but I really felt like this movie made the extra effort to help transport you into that era.Another way this movie delivers is that while the plot isn't completely new and the action scenes aren't to level of a John Wick or Kingsman, it does deliver a welcome change of pace when it comes to its story. Spy agencies fighting terrorists who may have nuclear weapons has been done before but I actually found it refreshing considering when the movie takes place. What also helps is that U.N.C.L.E. moves at a quick pace, it has some good interplay between the characters and some funny scenes that help move the movie along. The action is also fast paced and fresh enough that you want to see more.One of the interesting aspects in The Man From U.N.C.L.E. was that the two lead actors had a mixed track record but I think that they both show that they can carry this kind of movie. I liked Henry Cavill in Man of Steel but I think this movie gives him a chance to be a little more expressive. He works as a James Bond type and he's pretty charming. As good as he was, I think Armie did the better job of the two of them. Armie just seems to have the worst luck picking projects since The Social Network. He does a decent job with a Russian accent and he plays off of Henry and Alicia really well. Alicia Vikander is solid, she shows again why she's a rising star. Elizabeth Debicki was a pretty good as the villain considering she doesn't have a ton of screen time. I also liked Jared Harris and Hugh Grant in their respective supporting parts.We had a ton of spy movies last year and most of them were really good. My personal favourite was Kingsman: The Secret Service but this movie wasn't far behind. It looks great, it moves quickly and the main characters are both interesting and funny. I will agree that it doesn't have the freshest plot overall but The Man From U.N.C.L.E. is still creative and a lot of fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just watch it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first heard about this movie, it was because it showed up on some "Worst Movies of 2015" list, but rather than one of the worst movies of 2015, I watched a pretty entertaining innovation on a beloved series.Guy Ritchie movies tend to be fast-paced, and TMFU was certainly no exception; appropriate since this is supposed to be a spy movie. However, it was a spy movie that didn't take itself too seriously, so it was still a lot of fun to watch.Another feature of Guy Ritchie movies seems to be actors doing over the top accents (e.g. Snatch), but despite this, Vikander, Hammer, and Cavill have great chemistry. The movie included some background on Napoleon Solo and Illya Kuryakin that wasn't really present in the original series, which certainly added depth to the characters. Also Elizabeth Debicki!! This was the first time I've seen her since The Great Gatsby, and I'm looking forward to seeing her more! She played a very cool and sophisticated (but still ruthless) villain. Anyway, I've never actually watched the original series, so maybe I have no idea what I'm talking about, but regardless of what mainstream critics say you should watch this movie! I think it has something fun for everyone, and I would definitely watch it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maybe this film could have been better but it turned out a little disappointing. The plot was a bit predictable and at some point the film gets boring. It doesn't hold the attention well enough and you can be easily distracted. There are some funny moments but the humour lacks the class and the originality that other Guy Ritchie films have. In terms of acting the performances are average and the characters themselves are quite straightforward and undeveloped and, perhaps, that is the reason why none of them is catchy or memorable enough.Despite all these things the film is pleasant to watch but it is easily forgettable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Man from U.N.C.L.E." is a very enjoyable film and I hope it becomes a franchise. Cavill and Hammer make a great team and play off one another quite well, as opposing professionals with clashing styles who grudgingly respect each other's abilities. Vikander is a better "Bond girl" than any of the female leads in the Bond films, with the possible exception of Eva Green. She's intelligent, beautiful, sexy, poised and handles herself well in a fight against a much more powerful opponent. But I enjoyed "Man of Steel," "The Lone Ranger" and "Ex Machina" and thought they each handled their roles in those movies exceptionally well. The action scenes are well choreographed and cohesive. Production values are excellent. Compared most of Ritchie's other films or with the Mission Impossible films, the plot is fairly straightforward, but that allows for more interaction between the characters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, I got hooked seeing the trailer and before I built up the suspense I actually looped the trailer a lot of times. Yeah it is that good and as a member noted I simply cannot fathom why they didn't market it more.It is my favorite movie of the year so far with Straight Outta Compton coming as the second favorite. I loved everything about the movie- the stylized effect, the credits and intro, the spy vs spy tet-a-tet, the delicious accents... everything. My only qualm is it is a bit too long. Two hours would be a bit of a chore to watch it at theaters although I watched it at home.Remember, you guys - see what I did there- need to make it like a shot. Moviegoers wanna get a guilty shot of the most potent substance but not overdo it.Having spitted out the only chink in the armor (not Armie Hammer) here is my revelation. I think Cavill's character deserves an Oscar. Oh come one why not! He made the character like-able. I mean isn't that what you want? Look at all the cool memorable characters to get Oscar: Ledger's Joker, Anthony Hopkins in Silence of the Lambs. Well it works for me.Although it may not happen with strong contenders as Depp and Gyllenhaal, but it is PRECISELY because of the suave characteristics of Napoleon Solo that would make me watch this movie over and over again.Ars gratia artis, but it also helps when art is something that can be watched over and over again.Tout court: It works. See it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Captures the 1960's spy show genre beautifully....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Man From Uncle captures the 1960's spy show genre beautifully. Its loosely based on a 1960's series with the same title, which many modern film goers are probably not going to be familiar with. The storyline, through to the characterizations and cinematography, are thoughtfully crafted and the film skillfully directed. Thankfully there's nothing "camp or retro" about this title. It does have a sense of humour but its applied with a light hand and wisely avoids self satire, for the most part. The result is a a film that is not self conscious and, as a result, really captures "that 60's feeling" and holds it throughout its ninety or so minutes. The key characters have a real chemistry too, that only serves to enhance this already well rounded film. There is, of course, a lot of familiar and at least one, oddly novel, action sequence(s) on offer, which take on new life with a 60's "make over". For my money, The Man From Uncle, is is a superior remake of a TV classic, that has been cleverly and capably transferred to film. I genuinely hope there's a sequel. Nine out of ten from me.</fullReview>

You get thrown back into an era you might (very likely) not know. But that shouldn't take away the fun you can have with this.It's a mystery why this underperformed at the box office, but might have to do with the fact, that people could not really tell what this is. The TV show is not as accessible as other (A-Team, Mission Impossible and so forth). If you get a chance and you like spy comedies, you should check this out. Even if it goes a bit overboard towards the end (a twist that doesn't make too much sense), it still pretty fun</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Instant classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a shame that this excellent Guy Richie film doesn't seem to earn the money it was expected to, since of all the sequel-potential movies of the year(apart from the great Mad Max, of course), it is the one I would mostly like to see having sequels.At last, a TV series we used to love has the big screen adaptation it deserved(I think it is the best adaptation of a TV series ever, including the first Mission impossible, which I also love).Guy Richie proves to be a very underrated director;with true inspiration, he restores to adventure cinema the authenticity that the logic of the blockbusters has taken away-the logic that says that you must not present something different, because people will not get it-and brings in a cinematic delight that is stylish, funny, genuine and full of subtle feelings and memories.Superb acting, imaginative scenes, and an attitude that without effort makes the film a classic, being as close to a modern version of The man from UNCLE as possible without neglecting the retro elements that other movies chose to forget about(the terrible Wild Wild West, for example), and easily beats the new Mission Impossible, despite the fact that it was one of the best of the series.What's more, I consider it shameful that Tarantino, who begins with a similar love about cinema and the past , enjoys more critical appraisal because of his deconstructive- and shallow-use of cinematic means.Richie's cinema is also fun, but in a more subtle and at the same time deeply satisfying way and this Man from UNCLE may be his masterpiece till now.</fullReview>

The conversation between main characters were awfully funny (as expected from a Guy Ritchie movie). But I was missing the typical English accent till Hugh Grant came to the plot.

		<shortDescription>A Comeback To The Old Spy Movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Man from U.N.C.L.E. is latest movie of Guy Ritchie, who already has a considerable number of well-praised films due to his particular style, and it's based on a TV series of same name that went on air during 1964-68. The picture succeeds in having a 60's atmosphere through the characteristics clothing and hairstyles, besides the movie sets and portrayal of historical events which the world was suffering. The plot although being very predictable is actually funny and amusing. It might be related to the old spy movies where they didn't take them too seriously having a straightforward, more lighthearted plot and nearly cartoonish characters. The first action scene where the main characters are presented is noteworthy, because of the scene's fluidity combining the anxiety and humour. The others aren't good as the first but what is present in all of them is comic moments and a soundtrack composed by Daniel Pemberton responsible for making the movie more engaging and possessing a particular charm.The characters aren't complex, but still are interesting and enjoyable. The main characters are very charismatic. The rivalry between Napoleon Solo (Henry Cavill) and Illya Kuryakin (Armie Hammer) as well in the chemistry of Illya and Gaby Teller (Alicia Vikander) are situations that work very well in the story's construction. Another aspect which emphasizes the similarity between old spy movies is Victoria Vinciguerra played by Elizabeth Debicki, she's the classic, egocentric and crazy Bond's villain.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's a plot that glosses over the history very quickly,gives a brief mention of Hitler and the Russian and American conflict. However the events might arguably be set at any time, the threat of the flick being that nuclear weapons are being manufactured by dangerous hands. It's a theme that's been already handled many times on the big screen. In this story we see an excellent chemistry between the Actors but all in all The Man From U.N.C.L.E. is much more about fun than it is about substance. Aesthetically in general, the film marvels but then this wasn't really in doubt given its era and the glimpses seen in the trailer. There has been Ritchie's evident dedication to making his pictures look grand and to adding a classic sophistication to the world of espionage we haven't seen since early 007 days.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know what the critics saw (or didn't see) because this film is one slick stylish spy movie that James Bond could've been.The story is pretty standard for a spy movie (extraction, infiltration, secret stealing, and a bombing finish), but what's interesting isn't just the story. The characters' banter between the American and Russian spy with the additional female wit was amusing! The style is all there, beautiful cars, boats, costumes, hair, set, and music was top notch. I had to find the soundtrack immediately after watching this show.It also helps that both the leading men were sexy in their own way, much more than Bond himself. Sexual tension between Ilya and Gaby was so strong I could not take my eyes off them.And it is fun! If there's one thing to take off of this movie it is the fun that's lacking in most spy movies nowadays. This is entertainment. Do not be discouraged by the critics, I suppose they were looking for something heavier.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was not into the TV show of UNCLE but of course knew of it and was familiar with the story/characters. I knew little enough, however, that I went into this with an open mind and few preconceived ideas. I was thrilled with this film! Cavill and Hammer were perfectly cast as the suave conman and giant, tough Russian assassin respectively. I wasn't familiar with Armie Hammer and only knew of Henry Cavill from Superman really. I loved Armie Hammer; he played Terminator- esque hit-man but soft sweet and protective very convincingly. Cavill was the comic relief almost, with funny facial expressions and nonchalance. Alicia Vikander was unknown to me too, as the pretty and petulant Gaby and she was believable in her role as both asset and vixen. Set in the sixties, amongst the Cold War, it was a fun and well delivered "period" piece in terms of fashion, cars etc. The begrudging chemistry between Vikander and Hammer was charming, although, who can blame her looking up into those darkly lined eyes! Hammer had an incredible screen presence, every move was magnified and he had a pleasing comedy timing, underplaying facial expressions in a beautifully Slavic way. His accent was pretty enjoyable too. Cavill ? a Brit ? played typically American; confident, brash and self-assured and he played that with aplomb and a great deal of charisma. I could see him playing Bond now (as I have heard he has been tipped). A gloriously fun, entertaining and immersive film, not highbrow or requiring much intellectual attention but with a sufficient amount of plot, eye candy and exciting action with a lot of giggles for any viewer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Man from U.N.C.L.E is a refreshing spy thriller tale adapted from the series by the same name which featured in the 60s. The movie is good and impresses the audience in certain scenes. Guy Ritchie is back with a bang but just falls short of what is expected from his direction. This movie is quite different from the ones he directed before. It's not well paced like Snatch or Sherlock Holmes or Lock,Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. But at the same time, he makes sure that as the audience becomes aware of this slow venture, he bursts out with a scene that forces you to grab your seats till the climax.The storyline is a blend of a stylish plot with good-looking spies and manipulative twists. The background music keeps the movie well-equipped as is needed in a thriller movie with a spy mission in hand. The movie is sure to entertain you with fine performances from Henry Cavill, Armie Hammer and Alicia Vikander. Cavill, Man of Steel fame, plays Napolean Solo in the movie and this CIA Agent is quite impressive, except for some romantic scenes imposed forcefully. Armie Hammer who plays Illya is fun and remarkable and blends quite well with Cavill. Now, coming to Alicia Vikander who has already impressed with Ex Machina this year, plays an impossibly glamorous East German car mechanic and can be said that she is a hot new actress gaining a lot of attention.Cinematography is excellent in the movie and leaves us with splendors. Beautiful costumes and nice production design also makes it watchable. This has already been a spy thriller year with movies like Mission Impossible:Rogue Nation, Kingsman and Spy. So if you expect a visual treat with a revitalizing story and cast, don't miss it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Time for Guy Ritchie to introspect, the magic is gone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had completely written off Guy Ritchie, Lock stock and two smoking barrels and Snatch remain enjoyable albeit flawed classics. However he had rubbed me off the wrong way ever since he caused irreparable damage to Sherlock Holmes mythos. And here his downward spiral continues. TMFU follows the usual Ritchie tradition of more style than substance but this time the characters are laughably bad and shallow. We have a psychotic Russian agent who has mental fits played by the fifth lead of The Social Network and the American agent played by the latest Superman who CIA pimps out, seriously his job is to have sex with women and distract them. Both of these admittedly handsome men are there for eye candy and can't act their way out of a paper bag, they are Megan Fox equivalent of acting. I get that the movie is showing it's rebel streak by objectifying men and not women but why not get good looking actors who can act? Well the film also has that covered by hiring a rising star, Alicia Vikander, who is easily the most talented cast member, has a character arc in this movie while everyone else is a very plain, vanilla and one dimensional character. However there are so many logical loopholes and even Ms. Vikander cannot escape from them, why hire a psychotic soldier who has mental fits to do non front-line work? How are even Nazi sympathizers surviving let alone thriving when USSR and USA carried out a witch hunt? Why is there a foolish high school romance angle? These are spies for Pete's sake aren't they bred to kill? The romance is so bad it's not even explored properly, Ek Tha Tiger had better romance between spies and that says something, you either commit to romance or you don't show it at all, this will they, won't they just harms the end quality of the film. Also don't even get me started on the technical flaws, those who have an eye for detail will notice bad research done in the film, that's not how things happened in the 60's, for starters that disc something like that wasn't used to store data back then, the weapons and the cars accuracy is also misstep, not every time but quite often.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Spy Who Bored Me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Rating: &#x2606;&#x2606;? out of 4)This film is mildly recommended. In brief: Without a good script and some needed humor, Mr. Solo &amp; company should have cried uncle and given up on this caper. GRADE: B- Long ago, even before Star Wars introduced its heroic Hans Solo to fans of all ages, another Mr. Solo was just as popular an icon. His name was Napoleon and he was the central character in a 60's hit spy series called The Man from U.N.C.L.E. Along with his faithful and crafty Russian sidekick, Illya Kuryakin, both super agents united in their efforts to enforce law and order during the Cold War era. The series was fun, a send-up of the James Bond phenomena with ample doses of humor and comradeship generously applied. This film version lacks both elements, but it is well-made and diverting enough.&#xfffc;The Man from U.N.C.L.E. wants to capture those cool retro vibes of 60's fun but its director, Guy Ritchie and his flashy modern style of filmmaking continuously upstages the action with realistic touches that hamper the film's mod look. With Ritchie's trademark quick cuts and his more serious tone and attitude, the film never quite meshes into a unified whole. It more like a disjointed hole with large gaps of logic that looks stylish but empty. The only thing that makes sense is, in fact, the period costumes by Joanna Johnston that successfully parody the era so well.The director takes out the fun factor in his send-up of the spy caper genre with his penchant for extremes. He overdoes the split screen effect which tones down the action and limits the suspense. After an initially exciting opening chase sequence, the film plods along in its convoluted plot to stop a nuclear warhead from causing world annihilation. (The film also has the distinction of possibly having the slowest and most boring chase scene on film with its ATV pursuit scene.) While the series itself never really had characters of great depth, neither does the movie, so on the count the filmmakers were on par. However, the villains here are not that menacing and underused, especially Elizabeth Debicki as the wealthy Victoria, the evilest of femme fatales. This talented actress is wasted.&#xfffc;The leads are a mixed bag. Henry Cavill plays Napoleon Solo and while he is physically perfect for the role, a spot-on throwback to the debonair leading men of yore ala Tyrone Powers and Cary Grant, his stilted line delivery and robotic movements never amount to anything substantial. He's a walking Brooks Brothers ad. (Cavill has yet to impress with his film roles in comparison to his television resume.) Armie Hammer plays Illya and he, at least, provides some comic moments. Mr. Hammer is handsome, charming, and believable, the perfect foil, while Mr. Cavill can only muster the former. Their chemistry is out of balance due to two styles of acting: good and bad. Giving ample support is Alicia Vikander as Gaby, Illya's cover and possible love interest. The actress brings some nuance to her one-dimensional part. She looks smashing too in pop outfits that 60's fashion icon Audrey Hepburn would envy. Hugh Grant is also in the cast but he fails to register in his small role.&#xfffc;The Man from U.N.C.L.E. has good production values and looks great. But ultimately the weak script, by Lionel Wigram and the director, goes nowhere. As spy capers go, this is a second- rate secret agent film that should have remained a secret.Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Original and entertaining, despite its seemingly cliché plot description!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I genuinely loved this movie. The actors were all incredible, and the chemistry between the three main characters is perfect. It's a really fresh and original take on the whole "spy movie wherein they must prevent global catastrophe". The plot line is fresh and full of its own twists, and the film itself does a beautiful job capturing the 60s and its European setting. The film boasts the perfect combination of comedy and action; they are cleverly intertwined throughout. I especially enjoyed how the movie managed to be constantly funny without being vulgar and crude. If you're looking for a an action-filled, fast-paced comedy-drama, look no further! I really loved this movie, it's the best I've seen in a while, and I'm very much looking hopefully forward to a sequel!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Matthew Vaughn started off the race with Kingsman and now here is his pal Guy Ritchie going ahead and winning it. Just about.I have been waiting for the movie to open in India (28th August) and at the first available opportunity, got my eyballsfull. And I have never been happier.I cannot remember the last time I was as taken in by the good looks, the capabilities and the on-screen chemistry of the two male leads who, in every frame hold their own while producing an output so seamless that you marvel at how capable Guy Ritchie is at doing this stuff.If I had to choose between the two leads, I would have to pull my hair out and poke my eyes. They are that good. One a picture of cool elegance combined with the debonair chutzpah of an accomplished moonlighter, and the other counter-balancing half, of a stereotypical, half-deranged, fully-indestructible, three-quarters-vulnerable, and four-fifths-ruthless KGB agent played to orgasmic perfection by Armie Hammer, we shouldn't be asking for more.It is here we experience true generosity. Ritchie offers more. Italian settings,period style car chases, Going over the Berlin wall, and the oh so honeyed British voice of Hugh Grant.The laughs are real, and they are loud, the tension is titillating, the chases engaging, every scene crafted to perfection, doing just what it is meant to do.If I were a betting man, I would have bet my house and your too on the movie. Heck, I would still bet them if I weren't. Watch it, and like it. There is no other way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was one of the best mystery movies we've seen in ages! Not tainted with unbelievable graphics and bloody scenes which turn one's stomach making you proud of this director and writer. There was an excellent intensity between main actors and the surprises held our attention and interests. No dosing through this one! Scenes and graphics were a joy to watch. For a movie, it was somewhat in the genre of James Bond as 007, but nicely updated without being a fantasy beyond reality. Couldn't find negatives and pleased with my memories of it, especially some of the most humorous ones. Looking forward to the next Man From Uncle!!! Well done!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to admit although I'm not a fan of Guy Ritchie and his films I felt urged to go and see this film purely from my affection towards the original series and it's stars Robert Vaughan and David McCallum to ensure it wasn't just another Hollywood creative talent blackout reboot. well I can definitely say I am more than impressed with the look, style and general approach to whole thing. I also found giving the main characters a bit more back story quite interesting. the only negative from my personal taste was the use of the split/segmented screen sequence, it was abhorrent when used in Ang Lees Hulk and I find it rarely comes of well when used especially in an action sequence. other than that it was thoroughly entertaining and enjoyable.*spoiler* Look forward to a sequel as the ending sets it up very well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Say Uncle: Why The Man from U.N.C.L.E. wasn't as fun as advertising.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is probably the first time I have been disappointed by a movie. Going in I was expecting a fast paced retro comedy with outs of style and an intricate story, but four minutes in I already felt a little betrayed. I can only break down my problems with the film one problem at a time. At that is what I intend to do.Action: I describe this movie as "an action film allergic to action." I say this because the fight scenes in this scene very restricted and used sparingly. There are no gunfights or on screen violence to be honest, all the action consists of barely missing gunfire, shooting tires, turning over cars and stuff. Which may sound amusing but this is only 15-20% of the movie. And it gets very dull after a while. Which is why I nickname the action in this film as being so minimal that it seems like "Hypo-Allergetic Action."Characters: I like the ideas of these characters, just not the characters themselves. With Solo being a suave American spy, Illyah being an angry Russian man, and Gaby being a determined woman on a mission. But they are all so uninteresting. Solo sounds like he's not sure if he's British or not, Illyah is pretty dull, and Gaby isn't a lot to talk about. And honestly everyone else doesn't really stand out as much. Editing: This one is weird, the editing in this movie has a bad habit of showing clips of what's happened in the movie two minutes ago. I don't even know why it does this when they could just play it out linear and just refer back to what's happened. When it does this it makes the movie so much more long. And sometimes the scene divides into multiple panels to make it look more stylish (Hulk 2003) but unlike Hulk, this movie isn't based on a comic. It's based on a TV show. And the show never did this so why is the movie? Also the final chase scene between all main characters is just odd. It shows one person driving, zooms out to a crane shot, focuses in someone sales then zooms in on them to see what they're doing. Another style thing but it's just so pointless, and doesn't do anything for the action. There are things I like in this movie like the soundtrack, some of the costumes and some of the jokes. But the movie is just so dull and uneven that I started getting lost in my own unrelated thoughts while watching. That's how you know your movie sucks, when the random crisp your thinking about interests you more than the film you're watching. Maybe if this film were more like Kingsman and just didn't have any restriction it would probably be a more fun experience, but then again there are so many retro spy films that came out this year that it simply wouldn't fit in. And even with the different things it does, it still doesn't make it shine. The Man from UNCLE is a reminder of how dangerous it can be to not have a story. Sorry to say but this movie is an unfortunate skip.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Guy Ritchie's best, but it sure is stylish..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Superman and The Lone Ranger star in the Man from UNCLE, another Spy film from 2015 directed by Guy Ritchie. I have been longing to see Ritchie take his stamp and put it on this genre as a fan of his work and for the most part it doesn't disappoint. It's like Sherlock Holmes meets James Bond.. in the 60's!The film opens with an awesome action sequence with Henry Cavil as agents on two separate sides. They learn they will have to work together on a case to take down a nuclear weapons manufacturer with the help of a beautiful woman. As you can see, it is a plot we have seen before, but it is done so well in a setting that we don't always see that it still feels fresh to an extent. As the leads Henry Cavill and Armie Hammer are great. I liked Hammer's performance especially. It is hard to put on an accent for a whole film, but his didn't come across as annoying or hammy. His character is a KGB agent who you can see has issues with his anger and struggles to keep it together, whilst this wasn't exactly shown to the best degree it was something that made him more relatable and human. I say human because honestly, when this guy is in action he is like a raging bull.. and i hear he did a majority of his stunts, which is pretty believable.The cast and settings are slick and stylish, you can see they are having a great time. Hugh Grant makes a small appearance and he is as stylish as Cavil's slick CIA agent, which is no easy feat. I also have to give props to the soundtrack, i loved it. There are some negatives however. The film at times has so many things going on that it becomes easy to lose track of the plot. There were certain times where scenes would cut from Cavil to Hammer doing different things and i was confused as to what the plot actually was. Its explained in the end sure, but could have been done better. The film is also a bit long for its own good. I honest to god thought it had ended, was getting ready to leave the cinema, and about another half an hour was left. If it were a bit shorter or better executed it could have benefited.all-in-all this is something that we haven't really seen Guy Ritchie tackle. The closest has to be his take on Sherlock Holmes because the action is similar and as good as that series. Great cast, loved the chemistry between Henry Cavil and Armie Hammer. We will obviously see a sequel if this film does well, and i would like to see what these characters get up to next. Not as enjoyable as other 2015 spy films such as Kingsman or Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation, but a fun time and worth checking out. Just did anyone else find it weird a British character played an American with an American playing a Russian? Well if it works..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Man From U.N.C.O.O.L???</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The man from U.N.C.O.O.L? On the contrary, the excess of style, class, and imagination in The Man From U.N.C.L.E makes Guy Ritchie's latest film worth more than the price of admission. The film delivers on numerous fronts; combining spectacular visuals, entertaining story, and of course, some fabulous 60's fashion. To an extent the overarching plot feels somewhat clichéd with a more than typical series of spy movie twists and turns. It is, however, a beautiful blend of subtlety and overt absurdity: "it's so overt, it's covert." Unlike so many modern movies, the Man From U.N.C.L.E is severely hindered by its unconventional and overstated storytelling; the kind that demands imagination. The story is multi- faceted and well-paced, rather than a great jumble of events loosely strung together with artistic liberty. In part the plot is predictable, yet not so much as to ruin its narrative and overall entertainment. It is true that the film has an easily forgettable villain (a seemingly typical 2015 trait), however the focus is primarily on the chemistry between main characters. Henry Cavill (Solo) and Armie Hammer (Kuryakin) give delightful performances as enemies-come- partners and the playful competition between them brings a quirky sense of character to the film; along with its aptly overstated score.Your expectations going into this movie will decide the degree to which you enjoy it. While it requires no knowledge of the original 60's show, The Man From U.N.C.L.E pays homage to a different era of film, and includes overtones of Robert Redford and Paul Newman's Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, amongst other classics. What it lacks in action and undercover spookery it makes up for tenfold in humour; and not just cheap gags and throwaway quips at that. So the verdict? That's up to you. For an action packed ride with a slightly more convoluted storyline then I would recommend going to see the equally jovial Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation. However if you've been dying for an excuse to wear your three-piece-suit to the cinema then by all means take a bottle, a picnic; and enjoy the show.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I skipped this movie because the general consensus was that, it "isn't as fun as it think's it is". This maybe true but that doesn't mean it isn't fun at all. The characters are delightful, the cinematography is gorgeous as are the actors. Most of the cast are putting on an accent and for the most part they're serviceable, overall the cast does a good job and have good chemistry. The movie has some pacing issues, some scenes go for too long, certain things don't have sufficient build up. The story is decent but the screenplay is a little messy. There is some fun action but nothing too memorable and of course there is some great music.I would definitely recommend checking it out, it's fun, stylish and very entertaining if you go in with the right expectations.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Based on the 1964 MGM television series of the same name, 'The Man from U.N.C.L.E.' is a cheeky entertainer, that turns out to be Great Fun! Cult Director Guy Ritchie &amp; Co., make sure the proceedings remain smooth &amp; crisp. And they succeed.'The Man from U.N.C.L.E.' Synopsis: In the early 1960s, CIA agent Napoleon Solo and KGB operative Illya Kuryakin participate in a joint mission against a mysterious criminal organization, which is working to proliferate nuclear weapons.'The Man from U.N.C.L.E.' is time-pass entertainment. Its stylish, over-the-top, humorous &amp; action-packed. Of course, there are some flaws here. This isn't a perfect blockbuster, that has everything going for it. Its pace, to begin with, is wobbly, but overall, the pluses take over the minuses. Ritchie &amp; Lionel Wigram's Adapted Screenplay is quite engaging, but it could've been a bit more solid. Ritchie's Direction is all-out. The legend has left no stone unturned &amp; has packaged this high-budgeted flick, like a true stunner. Cinematography is top-notch. Editing is mostly sharp. Action-Sequences are FANTASTIC! Art &amp; Costume Design are perfect. Daniel Pemberton's Score is superb.Performance-Wise: Henry Cavill as Napoleon Solo &amp; Armie Hammer as Illya Kuryakin, are in complete heroic mode. Their on-screen love-hate relationship, only adds to the fun. Alicia Vikander is first-rate. And she looks Gorgeous throughout. Elizabeth Debicki is seductive. Jared Harris &amp; Hugh Grant are fun to watch in minor roles.On the whole, 'The Man from U.N.C.L.E.' gets it right, on most counts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Man from UNCLE Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even though this is a Cold War thriller, this is not a movie you'd want to see for action. Sure, there's a couple of big chase scenes and some shooting in the middle, but most of this film is all about the characters. On one side, you have the suave, skilled, confident American thief who struck a deal to work for the CIA. On the other side, you have the strong, blunt, rigid Russian superspy who suffers from some anger management issues. Put the two together on a mission, and the sheer chemistry really makes the sparks fly.What the film lacks in actual action or setpieces, it makes up for tremendously in the characters. All of the film's fun is in watching the sharp banter between the two polar-opposite male leads. The dialogue alone is often witty, amusing, and shows great color and personality. Best of all, it's brought to life vividly by the actors, who offer top-notch performances. To say nothing of the female leads, who offer even more dynamism to the plot.Fortunately, the plot is pretty interesting and solid too. The actual mission the characters go on carries over a lot of familiar tropes and elements you might see in other spy movies - dense conspiracies, elaborate games of deception, megalomaniacs, torture, etc. The characters are very well-developed and their volatile relationships keep the pace rolling for the whole runtime. Unfortunately, all the color seems to get sucked out in the last big chase, before the endgame rolls out. The last few scenes tie together some pieces of the plot that you'll never even notice throughout the picture, before its reaches a strangely short ending. It's more of a punchline than a climax.One more thing that makes this movie shine will be its production and style. Filming looks fantastic, and it is edited in a fairly flashy way. There is a ton of really great, hip music throughout. If it was any flashier, it would feel like a Tarantino picture. Performances are awesome by the whole cast: Henry Cavill and Armie Hammer are both great in their roles, and they play off of each other very aptly. Alicia Vikander is just as fun to watch. Elizabeth Debicki is especially entrancing to watch - her performance is like the antithesis to Audrey Hepburn (same sense of fashion and everything), and it's all the more effective that way. This production uses very good, real-looking sets, props, and costumes.I have no idea how good of an adaptation this movie is to the original TV show, but I love it for its style, its playful tone, and its characters. If that appeals to you, then the film is certainly recommended. If it's action you crave, better go watch Mission Impossible instead.4/5 (Experience: Good | Story: Good | Film: Very Good)</fullReview>

And it works beautifully.I was expecting another over the top action remake of a TV classic, or worse, a spoof. What we get is an intelligent, (sometimes silly and humorous intelligent) retake of a classic. Many films that try to be too much.. both drama and action and comedy get lost and fail at it all. This movie blends all three in just the right dose and pulls it off smoothly and with class. And surprise, instead of "updating" it to modern times, it was set in the original 60's! From the beginning I was surprised by this film, and loved it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Man from U.N.C.L.E. is an action comedy spy film, set in the 1960s. CIA agent, Napoleon Solo(Henry Cavill) is tasked with rescuing a woman named Gaby(Alicia Vikander), from some unknown threats. Although Solo successfully saves Gaby, they face some trouble along the way from KGB agent, Ilya Kuryakin(Armie Hammer). It is later revealed by Solo's boss Sanders(Jared Harris) &amp; Ilya's boss Oleg(Misha Kuznetsov) that, Solo &amp; Ilya are supposed to work together to take down a common enemy of the USA &amp; Russia. A secret malevolent organization that is working diligently to create nuclear weapons. Now, Solo &amp; Ilya have to put their differences aside &amp; learn to work together, if they want to effectively take down this unknown threat. The Man from U.N.C.L.E. is a super cool &amp; entertaining film. It's another addition to the spy action comedy genre after Kingsman: The Secret Service(2015) &amp; Spy(2015). I still think Kingsman is the best spy movie of the year, so far. This film is a close second. It has all the workings of a classic spy movie. Two ridiculously good looking &amp; charismatic leads, beautiful &amp; intelligent women, stylized action sequences, exotic locales &amp; finally, the special ingredient, dry humor. No surprise considering, director Guy Ritchie has successfully helm- ed Sherlock Holmes(2009) &amp; Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows(2011). The action sequences are more one-on-one fist fights than, over the top shootouts. When there are shootouts in the movie, they take place in split screen style so that, they don't seem overly long &amp; get repetitive. The boat set piece is one of the highlights of the film. The performances from the principle cast truly makes The Man from U.N.C.L.E. memorable. Henry Cavill is outstanding as Solo. Cavill's suave CIA agent is Guy Ritchie's answer to British MI6 agent, James Bond. It's not a surprise considering, Cavill was shortlisted with Daniel Craig to play Bond in Casino Royale(2006). Armie Hammer is spectacular as Ilya. Hammer completely immerses himself in the role &amp; mastered the Russian accent. Alicia Vikander is great as Gaby. Elizabeth Debicki is brilliant as Victoria. Luca Calvani is effective as Alexander. Sylvester Groth is menacing as Uncle Rudi. Hugh Grant is superb as Waverly. Jared Harris is awesome as Sanders. Christian Berkel &amp; Misha Kuznetsov are impressive as Udo &amp; Oleg respectively. The Man from U.N.C.L.E. is a must watch. This U.N.C.L.E. is a stud!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>US and USSR secret services require two of their agents to work together to foil a nuclear conspiracy. However, the two agents have encountered each other before, and it did not go well...Based on the 1960s TV show, and set in the same era, if you bleeped out the names, nobody would know the origins of this fast-moving, enjoyable spy caper movie. Henry Cavill is even more urbane as Napoleon Solo than Robert Vaughn was, and Armie Hammer's Illya Kuryakin ? an enormous bundle of muscle and anger - is nothing at all like David McCallum's version. The chemistry between the two principles is great, the scripted interplay between them is highly entertaining, and they both work well with Alicia Vikander as the third member/maguffin. Hugh Grant's Alexander Waverly is far from Leo G Carroll's avuncular spy boss.But comparisons are irrelevant, because most of the audience isn't going to remember the original. Instead, they are presented with a highly entertaining action adventure, directed well (if sometimes distractingly) by Guy Ritchie, and an obvious franchise starter.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not knowing what the television show The Man from U.N.C.L.E. is like I went into the theater with the background of being an avid Guy Ritchie fan. If you are a fan of his dry wit humor and his pacey action this film is for you. The film is set during the early 1960s and the catalyst is a criminal organization getting hold of a scientist who has the capabilities of building a nuclear bomb. The unique aspect of this if that the scientist can make the bomb with ease that the USA and Russia know not. This threat is to be dealt with by top agents from both sides: Napoleon Solo (Henry Cavill) and Illya Kiryakin (Armie Hammer). Even though I am a Guy Ritchie fan I was put off a bit by the casting of the main roles. I thought that Henry Cavill, who's claim to fame is being Superman, did not have the acting chops to pull off a believable and likable secret agent. And the counterpart to this thought was Armie Hammer, who played the Winklevoss brothers in The Social Network, another actor I thought untested. However, both pleasantly surprised and showed good acting chops. The film's strong points are the action and the chemistry of the cast. The story is a bit straight forwards but the direction is superb. There are some great shots that shouldn't go unnoticed. All in all the film had the jazziness of a James Bond film and the wit of Sherlock Holmes. It's definitely not a huge hit but it could garner a sequel or two. Guy Ritchie gets another thumbs up for this latest film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Coming into this movie, I was unsure what to expect. I initially intended to see this movie because I had thought that Michael Fassbender was playing a significant role in it. However, I was pleasurably let down to see Armie Hammer play that role instead. Nonetheless, this movie was a wonderful film. The night before I attended this film, In watched Inglorious Basterds, and felt like nothing could overshadow that. Boy was I wrong. Henry Cavill shines as "Napoleon Solo", a fugitive spy who went from a taker to one who assists those taking. He plays the role of a 60's spy agent PERFECTLY. Prior to seeing this movie, I saw the atrocious movie that was Fantastic 4... and oddly enough, like IMDb I gave it a 4/10... ironic. Anyways, Armie Hammer, Henry Cavill, and Alicia Vikander round out a solid cast put together by director Guy Ritchie. PLOT: Two agents, from Russia and the United States combine to form a "super alliance". Illya Kuryakin(Armie Hammer) is a KGB agent, who is both brutal, strong, and takes no nonsense from anyone. Napoleon Solo(Henry Cavill) is a cunning, and witty CIA agent. The two of them are sent off to either capture, or destroy nuclear coding/files. The movie may lack slight action thus being a somewhat turnoff to teens requiring an explosion every other scene. Yet the methodical plot, humorous statements, lack of chemistry between both agents, and well put together plot and cast make this movie a fantastic choice for a Friday night. RATING: I give this movie an 8/10, primarily because I love these types of movies, definite must see from myself. AGE: I would say 13+ for this movie, as most of the jokes are intended towards a older age. VERDICT: GREAT MOVIE!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A spy movie that's really worth watching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nope, the speech isn't going about the black old man named Ben whose smiling face I used to see on rice packages or ketchup bottles back in 90's. The man from U.N.C.L.E is a spy, either the Russian or the American one. I was born in Russia so I prefer the first variant (kidding). Strangely but to eliminate ambiguities for Russian movie goers the original name was translated into "The Agents from U.N.C.L.E." Well this story goes about special agents again.Guy Richie's spy comedy comes from the half-remembered eponymous series. Two hours picture is about two high profile agents from the USSR and the USA who had to bury the hatchet to cooperate against the well-off fascist remnants elaborating mysterious atomic bomb of a new kind. In the early 60's we walk from misty Eastern Berlin to sunny Rome to the soft Italian pop music of those days and watch a very stylish image of many subgenres. Henri Cavill (you know that Man of Steel) as a natty con artist Napoleon Solo, representing himself a mixture of James Bond and Archer, working for CIS and his colleague from KGB, smart man machine Illya Kuryakin (Armie Hammer, if you remember Lone Ranger) mocking each other for their differences in methods or technical equipment during the mission. The humor which Mr. Richie has been never lack of is witty, sometimes dark but always relevant and fills almost every frame so you have no time to get bored.Hats off to Richie for the Russian character free from stereotypes widespread in the most of other Hollywood movies. The Russian man from U.N.C.L.E. has even more common with Steve McQueen than with the odious pseudo Russians such as Ivan Drago from Rocky or Ivan Danko in Red Heat. Richie consolidates all his knowledge and feelings about Russians who he showed in most of his filmography (don't you forget Boris the Razor?!) and made a real KGB Russian man of the past. It's significant that Richie equitably depicts two men of different nationalities and ideologies so we can empathize with them both equally. During the well-directed action scenes one character completes another and when it comes to help each man reveals compassion and bravery to save his partner. However it's not only around two heroes in the movie. Here we have a young and pretty British undercover detective Gabi (Alicia Vikander) who has to play a role of Kuryakin's charming wife according to their plan. Don't reckon to see a bed scene between fake marriage partners. Russian and British agents just attempted to kiss whereas the hotter part is given to Napoleon Solo and vamp woman Victoria (Elizabeth Debicki), lady boss. The small part is taken by Hugh Grant who's like the icing on the cake with dark sheds. Among the other actors you will also meet posh speed cars, nice suits and lots of Italian moustaches.The Man From U.N.C.L.E. is the vivid image with the smell of vintage. Style is ubiquitous throughout the plot. The director elaborated every detail down to the bits, each item corresponds to the time shown on the screen: attire, weapon, cars, bugs and spy technics. The movie is relaxing. You know that at the end everybody will be alright so sit back and enjoy the movie. Watching it is like savouring the wine. Red as the opening titles.The Man From U.N.C.L.E. reminds John Sturges's or Robert Aldrich's men-on-a-mission classics. With Richie's recognizable dynamic montage the picture stands out from the stream of spy movies. Brisk, funny, dynamic ? it makes you laugh or keep a breath or even think a minute that it doesn't matter who you are, a bolshie or a cowboy. The truth is that someday here will come a real enemy you can knock down only together.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Man of Classy Wit and Debonair Spy, but Diluted Action</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hollywood is really big on making mountains of money from molehills of ideas. This weekend, that molehill is a sixties television series about a spy group bent on stopping global terrorism from occurring. My movie review today is the Man from U.N.C.L.E, a movie that has been greatly endorsed in the premovie showings at my local theater. So with all the hype, and the potential for another good spy movie, I have once again gone back to my home away from home to bring you another review. Let's get started!When it come to spy movies one never knows what directions they will take. Will it be a comedic one where spies bumble around like idiots? Is it going to be action packed and filled with guns and bombs? Or maybe a very technical movie filled with high specks and stealth? For this movie the answer was a blend of action and comedy, and in a way that wasn't overly cheesy. The Man from U.N.C.L.E takes you back into the world of old fashion spy films where our leading spies were sent to uncover by use of deceit and stealth. The whole film is laced with numerous sequences of our team sneaking around highly guarded facilities, using simplistic tools to quietly get to their goals. This isn't some James Bond or Mission Impossible moment where overdramatic music blares in your ears as guns blaze and explosions rattle the walls. Instead it's got more cleverness behind it, involving coordination between the two countries as they put aside their differences and played to their strengths. It took a more "realistic" approach, where adaptation, observation and a silver tongue go farther than any pistol can. While I do appreciate the cleverness, the action sequences the cast promised were somewhat lacking. An opening chase scene was rather bland and a little overdone, but did have some impressive moves that an elite spy would have. Past that there are a few chase scenes, and a couple of quick shoot em up moments that took on an interesting, and somewhat dizzying, camera perspective. Without those adrenaline rushing moments, I can't lie that I was a bit bored at all the stealthy maneuvering. The lack of a unique plot also didn't help move things along and at times the movie dragged for me as they dodged around the goal. Some plot "twists" help liven things up and help give a little unknown to the film, but it still didn't do much to bring excitement to the film. What makes up for the action though is the witty comedy this film carries. Instead of crude vulgarity or stupid one-liners that will surely make memes, this film chose to let the situation bring the funny. Many times I chuckled as the spies blunders led to some other fools misfortune, a dark twist often following that was quite humorous. Our two spies hardly reacting to the situation further made the comedy better, their moot expressions syncing with the simplistic dialog. The banter was fun too, as the rivalry between the two male leads had them acting like fighting siblings, with the lady spy acting the role of the mature mother. Eventually this trick got old school, but there were some real comedic genius moments. Putting the comedic aspect aside, the biggest strengths of this movie are the setting and the acting of the film. Our design team did a fantastic job bringing the feelings of the 60s, and the classic series, back to life in high definition glory. The outfits are the backbone of the look, the various skirts, cardigans, and thick blazers really popping out amidst the retro scenery. Bringing the classic cars into the picture only further amplified the blast to the past, especially the old radios and tunes that blared through the speakers and further capture the energy of the ages. The soundtrack of the picture is really fun as well, and the symphony score further ups the dramatic edge that gives a little flair to the mix. All of it blends well together, and helps take the nostalgic flair up a notch!Acting wise the movie is solid as well. Henry Cavill takes the generic spy caveat and runs with it, making himself sound like a pompous twit. He uses that debonair and cockiness to speak his silver tongue and accomplish his goals, while fighting the emotional turmoil set on him. Armie Hammer going the Russian path was actually not as bad as I imagined him to be, and he captures the accent decently to sell his role. Hammer's done a 180 and added a creepy edge to his portfolio with quiet intensity and an insanity complex that makes him dangerous on multiple levels. However, his downfall is the temper tantrum moments and dramatic shaking of his hands when his anger comes to full boil. I think the director may have gotten a little to into a comic book character if you know what I mean. Alicia Vikander does a nice job with her role as well, managing to cover a broad spectrum of characters and play all of them fairly strong. Not to mention she looks cute in all her retro outfits and pumps. Together the three of them make a good team together, and have a natural chemistry to their teamwork that could make for some interesting sequels. The Man from U.N.C.L.E is not the most exciting spy movie I have seen, but it certainly has class and realism to it. Sure it could have used some action kick to it, and I would have liked a little more originality to it. Overall though, it's not a bad movie and I think it would be a good rent movie in the long run. I still recommend Mission Impossible 5 over this one, but fans of the series should give it a shot.Scores:Action/Adventure/Comedy: 7.5 Movie Overall: 7.0</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Man from U.N.C.L.E. is a thoroughly enjoyable film and there is hardly anything to fault. The acting was superb: Henry Cavill and Armie Hammer's characters shone out. Both actors had excellent screen presence and there was natural chemistry between them. It must also be mentioned that Alicia Vikander and Elizabeth Debicki added intriguing female allure. The movie's editing was spectacular making the film's cinematography stand out and highlighting all of the excellent shots achieved by Guy Ritchie. The shots captured were incredible, representing the 1960's perfectly. Fantastic costume design also helped attain a 60's feel. Product placement was clear throughout the film, however nothing seemed out of place or blatantly obvious. Overall, I think this spy comedy was very entertaining and I would recommend it to anyone looking to watch a very slick and stylish movie. It is clear from this film that Ritchie has his eyes on other spy franchises (Bond) and I have no doubt that he will get there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Delightful and Tantalizingly Original Spy Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie almost defies description because of its very originality and the difficult exercise of finding any comparable spy movies of significance. This full-length movie version based on the 1960s television series and becomes a sort of prequel to the series and allows the film's director to re-vitalize the period of the 50s in a stylized retro look. What director Guy Richie has accomplished is a more ambitious fusion of witty humor and serious emotive drama than his Sherlock Holmes (2009) and its accompanying Game of Shadows (2011) helmed by the mega-star Robert Downey Jr. and his character sidekick well-known Jude Law. Through casting lesser known actors, Henry Cavill and Armie Hammer, Richie relies more on the strength of success of his directing, the script, use of cinematography and accompanying music to bring out a wealth of comedy and appealing storyline in their performances.Some of the brilliance of this movie comes from one of a number of elements such as the heightened impact of music on the mood and energy of the movie reminiscent of Theodore Sharpiro's use of music in The Devil Wears Prada (2006) or Mark Isham in The Cooler (2003). Additionally, Ritchie has evolved the use of serio-comedy to a new level of achievement. Unlike the almost scientific precision and sophistication of Doug Liman's outstanding Bourne Identity (2002), Ritchie has opted for an earlier Cold War spy setting that focuses more on the intuitive and playfulness of the original bumbling Casino Royale (1967) with a strong infusion of Martin Campell's more serious drama of the 2006 version. Ritchie's casting of Henry Cavill and Armie Hammer resembles an duo performance of director Jonathan Lynn's casting of Bill Nighy in the witty Wild Target (2010) and Bill Nighy's more serious performance in the television movie Page Eight (2011). The Man From U.N.C.L.E. might derive some of its appeal in its ability to ? Blending the outlandish zaniness of the original Casino Royale (1967) with the serious, raw performance brought on by director Martin Campbell's contemporary 2006 film, ? capture the playfulness but in a more subtle way than that of Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie's in Mr. and Mrs. Smith (2005), ? bringing out the stylized power yet less chaotic, frenzied nature of the hyper-active spy thriller of Matthew Vaughn's Kingsman: The Secret Service (2015), ? using the chemistry and humor with action of Jan de Bont's action blockbuster Speed (1994) yet allowing the characters themselves to promote the action instead of the blazing special effects and overdramatized impossible scenarios, ? portraying a more somber, realistic, and yes smarter than the entertaining and delightful Peter Segal movie version of the comedic spy television series Get Smart (2008), ? incorporating the intelligent dry wit and musings of Matt Damon's mental thoughts percolating in the crime comedy drama of The Informant! (2009), ? and evokes the same light-heartedness found in the more surreal and off beat assassin movie The Matador (2005) where Pierce Brosnan became one of the first actors to portray a new formula for witty espionage movies where director Richard Shepard was able to take a more established spy persona James Bond and change the standard movie rules of the spy game or even earlier John Cusack's Grosse Point Blank (1997).Ultimately, what makes this movie special is its ability to bring to the screen an amazing psychological twisting movie, mental amusement, all set on a lavish but believable spy canvass.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dull, poorly written and utterly boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing a promising and action-packed trailer, I was very pumped expecting to see a film that would give James Bond a run for his money. Sadly all the exhilarating scenes of this film were spoiled in the trailer, thus we are left with an borderline unwatchable waste of celluloid.The plot is difficult to keep up with, not because it's intricate simply because it is much akin to a lullaby in that it puts small children to sleep and challenges adults to stay awake. The humour is a different beast entirely, as the bad acting, the lack of meaningful dialogue and the slow developing plot lulls you to sleep the awkward sexual innuendos wake you right back up like a bucket of cold water. The main character "Solo" played by Henry Cavill is not smooth nor suave he's in fact as coarse as sandpaper.I honestly cannot be bothered to write anymore on this god awful film, this is the first review I have ever written and it is to warn people to stay away from this snooze fest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE MAN FROM U.N.C.L.E. takes place at the height of the Cold War, where a mysterious criminal organization plans to upset the fragile balance of power between the US and USSR. CIA agent Napoleon Solo and KGB agent Illya Kuryakin are forced to put aside their differences and work together to stop the evildoers in their tracks. With movies such as Kingsman: The Secret Service, Spy, and Mission: Impossible Rogue Nation, as well as Spectre coming out in November, one could say that 2015 is the year of the spy movies. Joining this list is THE MAN FROM U.N.C.L.E., which doesn't have the uncompromising charm of Kingsman, the riotous fun of Spy, or the thrilling action of Mission Impossible, but it does have something neither of the other three have: Guy Ritchie. This is a really cool and stylized film that confidently captures the era without ever going overboard. The main problem I had is that it's a bit too confident; the movie isn't as clever or funny as it thinks it is. There are moments where the jokes hit and then are moments where they miss. The plot is forgettable and, at times, boring, leaving you with charismatic stars, winking dialogue, and implausibly dazzling set pieces. Despite questionable accents at times, the two leads share some great on-screen chemistry. Known for his role as Superman, Cavill plays a different kind of superman here; he's that relaxed, fly by the seat of your pants American secret agent. Conversely, Armie Hammer plays an uptight, badass Russian spy; it's that contrast between the two protagonists, which serves as the film's source of comedy. In that regard, they're entertaining characters to watch, albeit one- dimensional characters, but entertaining nonetheless. Alicia Vikander, from Ex Machina, impresses me every time I see her, and that's certainly the case again as she plays the fiery and sensual link between the two agents to perfection. Despite the tentative pacing here and there, THE MAN FROM U.N.C.L.E. is still an, overall, entertaining watch. Style over substance is acceptable, as long as the style is substantial.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pitch Perfect! Armie Hammer is fantastic as Illya Kuryakin</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you want to see a fun action-adventure film without gratuitous violence and gore go see this one!This is definitely not a remake of the TV series though it is set in the early 60s cold war period. Armie Hammer plays Illya Kuryakin (a more tortured soul than in the series) with the right combination of toughness and vulnerability. In contrast, Napoleon Solo (played by Henry Cavill) is smooth and even dapper, a bit reminiscent of James Bond. Their reluctant collaboration to stop Victoria Vinciguerra (played by Elizabeth Debicki),the beautiful iceberg who is wielding a nuclear bomb, provides friction that grows into mutual respect, as well as moments of comic relief.Make no mistake there is plenty of action and excitement! There is also bit of romance between Gaby Teller (played by Alicia Vikander), the German defector who aides them, and Kuryakin which takes several twists and turns. It allows both characters to express both their fears and sensitivity while they pursue the mission.I highly recommend it for fun at the movies!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Uneven, but Enjoyable 60's Spy Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Man From U.N.C.L.E. is an action packed, spy thriller in line with early Bond films, but is admittedly inconsistent. While it's not the first film this year to try to capture the magic of the 1960's spy thrillers, and it has it's fair share of clichés, The Man From U.N.C.L.E. is quite entertaining. The acting was serviceable, however both actors had accents that distracted from the film, while Alicia Vikander shined as usual. The villains are weak, as we're told they're fascists, but never really get their motives, or any real understanding of why they are this way. The film tries to be funny, but the humor is inconsistently funny, and the story remains inconsistent as well. In the end the film is nice to look at, well paced, with good action sequences, but suffers from inconsistent humor, storytelling, and character development. It is however very entertaining to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Remake of a Classic Television Series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched the movie tonight. It was great. I went into it expecting some eye candy and explosions. I was impressed by the movie trailer and decided to give the movie a try. Sometimes all the best scenes are shown in movie trailers and the rest of film is lacking in a lot of big studio Hollywood productions nowadays, but that was not the case with this film. I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the movie. The pace of the MFU movie had no lags and the script had moments of comedic irony which came across as naturally funny and not strained. The sets and everything drew viewers into the world of the cold war era. There was lots of action and the chemistry between the actors and plot was good. Alicia Vikander shines as the female lead. She was clever and and held her own against the male leads. She was not written into the script just to look pretty and she looked good in the sixties fashions. The costuming in the film was excellent. I thought the movie paid tribute to the best aspects of the MFU TV series without going over the top with camp humor. There were a lot of quips and the actors stayed in character throughout the film. Armie and Henry were great. Henry Cavill does a good job portraying a suave Napoleon Solo and makes the role his own without slavishly copying Robert Vaughn's portrayal. He is sexy and charismatic and like Vaughn's Solo he is also an epicure and fond of living a rich lifestyle and is impeccably dressed in bespoke suits. Like Vaughn he uses his charisma and good looks to seem harmless while also having the skills of a master spy. The main difference between characterizations from the original series is the physicality of Illya. Armie at 6&#x2032; 5&#x2033; is much larger than David Mccallum who is 5&#x2032; 7&#x2033; and who was shorter than Robert Vaughn at 5'8". In the movie, he is seen as having enhanced strength and combat skills. McCallum's Illya was also good at combat but was much more flirty with the ladies. It's been awhile since I've viewed the original series, but Armie's characterization seemed to be much more stoic and less charming than that of David McCallum's portrayal which is great. I really like Armie's acting in the role and the way Illya has to struggle to control his temper. The closeups when he is trying to stay inconspicuous and undercover are great and he and Henry play well off each other. I think it's great that the director and screenwriter took a fresh look at rebooting the MFU franchise and had each actor make the roles their own and not a slavish rendering of the characters in the TV series. Hugh Grant was great as Waverly. He did not have a lot of screen time but the minutes he had in the film were great. If they make a sequel I would definitely be interested in viewing a second offering in this universe.</fullReview>

The acting, the dialogue, the action, the comedy, everything in this movie I enjoyed a lot. The acting was great by the whole cast but the one person who stood out was Alicia Vikander, she was great and funny when needed to be. Henry Cavill and Armie Hammer also did a great job. The action was very good and there was a lot of action but the one thing I found great throughout the whole movie was the comedy . There were lots of funny moments but once in a while there was a joke that just didn't work but overall it was very funny.

I took both of my families in Russia and in the UK, and everybody utterly enjoyed it - young and old, gentlemen and ladies. I cannot remember the last time I loved a movie so much, so much that I am even writing my very first IMDb review!Guy Ritchie has created an absolutely genius movie. It has all the right ingredients and in all the right proportions to make every viewer happy. Witty British humour, packed with action which is smart and not boring (that is such a rear talent), perfect acting, juicy accents from everywhere across the world, music that will not allow you to sit still in your seat, genuine chemistry between the characters. I can continue forever :)That is why it saddens me so much to see this movie not doing well in the theatres. What has happened to the viewer who is ready to pay for stupid empty blockbusters nobody will remember tomorrow and is willing to miss this masterpiece? I do physically need The man from UNCLE movie to have a sequel! I need to see which adventures Guy Ritchie will take Illya, Napoleon and Gaby on next!So if you haven't seen this movie yet, do yourself the biggest favour, go to the cinema now and enjoy this gem of a movie on a big screen. Trust me just once - you will love it :)</fullReview>

Stunningly photographed,well paced and with excellent characterisations the film is a delight.Henry Cavill is Napoleon Solo, a suave CIA agent who is tasked to get a young girl out of Berlin. Solo is a charming, funny, vain womaniser and Cavill gives an excellent performance.Armie Hammer is Illya Kuryakin, a devoted KGB agent, assigned to stop Solo. Hammer is mesmeric in this film.The chemistry between the two is first class, and both work well with the adorable Alicia Vikander. This is the first thing that I've seen Vikander in anything, but I may have fallen in love with her.The rest of the cast is superb.

There is a timely break between action sequences with a right amount of humour. What stands out most for The man from Uncle is the strong characters. Solo and Illya are likable but strong in different ways. Solo is slick and Machiavellian while Illya is vocal and strong. The duo compliments each other. The 1960's creates an entertaining cold war environment. Great supporting actors! The handlers, nemesis, and extras create perfectly the spy games experience. A surprise ending leaves room for a part two. Eight out of ten. Hugh Grant makes a surprising stage presence at the ending for a second movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is flopping at the box office, and that's a terrible thing on several levels. First, the movie itself is great fun. Second, it deserves a sequel. Third, Hollywood would do well to make more films of this ilk.I'm not going to dwell on the major strengths of the script and performances, as others can do that better than I. Instead, I'll point out some things that stand out as details elevating this from 6-or-7-out-of-10 status to 8/10."Man From U.N.C.L.E." is solid because it not only checks off the "witty repartee" and "stylish" boxes, it goes the extra mile in recreating the vibe of the 1960's era...most of the time. Oftentimes, period pieces go as far as procuring nice costumes and sets, but the actors and actresses themselves don't sound or look right. People talked and looked differently back then. (I've never seen "The Artist," but would love to if only because Jean Dujardin and Berenice Bejo actually look like people from the time.) Henry Cavill actually adopts a tone and speech pattern straight out of a 60's television show, rather than deliver his lines in an out-of-place 21st century fashion.If you don't understand what I mean, contrast this with Alicia Vikander. Her character is likable, fun, and real, but when she opens her mouth it's sometimes distracting; she doesn't nail the verbal side of things like Cavill and Armie Hammer (whose accent is great). Her character is supposed to be German, but she literally slips in and out of an accent from scene to scene, and sometimes breaks the immersion by sounding like an actress in 2015 playing a role. Thankfully, it's not a train wreck, but it's noticeable. I don't really know how to explain this issue of era-specific dialects any better; it's really an aural thing.Moving to another nice touch, the score is beyond fantastic. There are three main focuses, really: Italian pop music of the decade, a modern flair to older sounds, and, best of all, some stuff straight out of Danger Man (a.k.a. Secret Agent), the classic Patrick McGoohan spy show. I've seen most if not all of those Danger Man shows, and when I heard the moody harpsichord and electric guitar in this flick I thought "oh man, this guy knows his stuff." Of course, that sound could have been used in a hundred other movies or shows, and for all I know, the original U.N.C.L.E. TV series used that vibe (haven't seen it; now I want to), but it screamed "THEY'RE USING THAT IDEA FROM DANGER MAN" to me. Small thing to others, perhaps, but I loved it.As I watched the film in the theater, there were one or two points that seemed a bit far-fetched. (I refuse to divulge them as I am diligently avoiding spoilers.) When I walked out of the movie, though, I felt that they were closer to strengths; I would rather a movie entertained me than split hairs to make sure everything made perfect sense and was totally realistic. So even that comes out as a sort of win.For pete's sake, see this movie. It deserves a better fate then that which awaits it on the box office returns spreadsheet. It avoids some action/spy movie clichés, it's funny, well-written, well-acted, and it looks and sounds the part. And there's harpsichord in the soundtrack.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After all the endless massive hype and spin before it shown, I should of realized they why they were trying so very hard , obviously to recover its costs before the word got round how bad this was. This was an insult to any fans of original series/films . It was not even funny when bad , as original often was, no-one or anything was likable or memorable. The storyline was worse than any were in series , in the original there was so much to like ,cool guns, secret weapons ,stunts , over the top enemy, etc. This was also an insult to these good actors who were meant to portray Napoleon Solo, not his camp twin brother. His partner has a silly metamorphis and become instead of a cool slim and silent but deadly spy, becomes his muscle bound personal trainer, with little skill or any memorable lines or scenes, there was no balance of characters, no feeling of perfect opposites, a perfect team, ultimately an expensive flop, verging on utter boring rubbish. which could never be said of man from uncle before, watch to see how not to do.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you like the old TV series (like I did) then this movie is worth a view. As a movie on its own, it just didn't cut it. There were too many holes in the story to fill in. The movie had a ton of unbelievable moments that threw my mind out of the movie over and over again. There were some cheeky moments that were funny, but not enough to make the film great. At one point there appeared to be a love story brewing, but that fizzled out. It is supposed to be a period piece back in the 60's, but I didn't find the connection to that time period interesting in this movie. This movie might be a good watch as a rental or streaming, but I'm glad I missed paying a lot to see it at the movie theater.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Aggravating to Watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story was fun, the action was fun, and the plot twists were enjoyable. The acting was decent. The locations were enjoyable to see. However, I did not enjoy watching this film for two reasons. The first reason is because many of the scenes are shown twice. The first time the scene is shown, information is deliberately left out, even though the information that is left out is not too difficult for thinking audience members to discern. Then, almost instantly, the scene is shown again filling in the missing information. Were the filmmakers deliberately trying to pad the running time of the film by showing everything twice? This was both irritating and unnecessary. In addition, the split screen scenes added nothing and just increased the aggravation of watching this movie. This could have been much better. Touches that I'm assuming were meant to be touches of artistic flair made the movie tedious and annoying.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember that I used to love The Man from U.N.C.L.E. when I was young. I loved that show, where Napoleon Solo and Illya Kuryakin got all my attention in every episode. But that was with Robert Vaughn and David McCallum, and both did so much better then Henry Cavill and Armie Hammer. When I read Guy Ritchie was going to be the director of The Man from U.N.C.L.E. I was pretty excited because I absolutely loved Snatch, Lock Stock and two smoking barrels, as well as RocknRolla. So I was looking forward to watch this movie, but at the end I have to say I am disappointed. It didn't reach my expectations at all. Didn't see anything that reminded me of the series nor the signature of Ritchie's good movies. The spies here were just boring and dull, nothing enjoyable to follow. The music was also quite boring during the action scenes. If you have the choice then just watch the series from the sixties instead of this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Expected Better! 3/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Review: I was expecting much more from this movie! The acting was quite poor, from the two leading men and there constant bickering just got on my nerves after a while. I know that Guy Ritchie was trying to bring something fresh and new to the big screen but the whole look of the film just didn't work for me. I wasn't that impressed with the storyline and the action wasn't that great but Alicia Vikander did put in a good performance. Anyway, the film is set during the 1960s, when the cold war was in play and Napoleon Solo (Henry Cavill) is sent on a mission to bring a mechanic, Gaby Teller (Alicia Vikander) from East Berlin, to the other side of the wall. Whilst fighting against KGB agent IIIya Kuryakin (Armie Hammer), who does impress Napoleon Solo with his determination, he manages to get Gaby to safety and completes his mission. Solo is then blackmailed into taking another mission by CIA chief Saunders (Jared Harris), to stop a criminal organisation from building a nuclear bomb. The head of the criminal organisation, Victoria (Elizabeth Debicki) has captured Gaby's father and forced him to make the nuclear bomb but Gaby's uncle Rudi, still works for Victoria so the CIA wants Solo to team up with Gaby and KGB agent IIIya, to worm there way into there organisation. Gaby acts like she is IIIya's wife and uses her uncle Rudi to find out were her dad is and to retrieve a disk with the design of the bomb, while Napoleon Solo uses his charms to seduce Victoria. Whilst in Rome, they fight against Victoria's henchmen to find the bomb and to make sure that it doesn't get into the wrong hands and with the help of there new team leader, Waverly (Hugh Grant), they successfully complete there mission and form a new team of government agents. Guy Ritchie tried his best to bring dry wit to the script but the two main characters were the wrong choice for this project. There are a couple of funny scenes, like when Gaby is dancing in there hotel room and when Rudi is getting electrocuted, but that was about it. I was hoping for a big showdown at the end between Victoria and the new elite team but that was also a big let down. It just seemed like a fashion piece, with some funky music and a couple of detailed car chases and I must admit, I did struggle to keep my eyes open. If they come out with another movie in this franchise, they really need to think about replacing the main characters because Napoleon Solo and IIIya Kuryakin wasn't in the same class as Robert Vaughn and David McCallum. One thing that I liked about the old series was the way that they pieced together there investigations and how the two opposites worked together to fight crime but in this movie it all seemed like a big joke to the agents, which is why it gets the thumbs down from me. Disappointing!Round-Up: Guy Ritchie, 47, was lucky to make his money back on this project because he really did have a big budget to play with. I'll give him some credit for taking on such an enormous project and he did make it look like it was filmed during the 1960s, with the fancy clothes and the fancy cars but it wasn't enough to tickle my fancy. I loved his previous movies, like Lock Stock, Snatch, RocknRolla and the Sherlock Holmes franchise but I wasn't too keen on Revolver or the terrible Swept Away which he made with his then wife, Madonna, who really can't act. He plans to remake Cannonball Run, which is another hefty project to take on and he is in post-production with Knights of the Round Table: King Arthur starring Jude Law, Charlie Hunnam, Katie McGrath, Eric Bana, Djimon Hounsou and David Beckham, so he has some big projects in the pipeline. There isn't any talk about a sequel of this movie and with Robert Downey Jr. playing a major role in the Avengers, I doubt that we will see another Sherlock Holmes movie anytime soon. This film did go down well with some of the critics but I personally didn't find it that entertaining.Budget: $75million Worldwide Gross: $109.5millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their action/adventure/comedies starring Henry Cavill, Armie Hammer, Alicia Vikander, Hugh Grant and Jared Harris. 3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not great, though it was better than I expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was never a fan of the TV show "The Man from U.N.C.L.E." - or for that matter, a fan of Guy Ritchie, which are the reasons why I avoided this movie when it was in theaters. I broke down and rented the Blu-ray today after hearing a number of positive reports about it. After watching it, I can say that it was better than I expected... though not as good as I hoped it would be. First, the positive stuff. I was thankful that the production did not go for a strong campy approach. Yes, there is comic relief, but only here and there - it's mostly played straight, which I appreciated greatly. The production design is top notch, really bringing the early 1960s back to life (it also helps that Daniel Pemberton's musical score fits this world perfectly!) The cast also plays their various roles very well.However, I had a couple of problems with the movie - problems that I think explain why the movie didn't do well at the box office. It all has to do with action. First, the action scenes, while they are not terrible, come across as routine. The second problem with the action is that there is not enough of it. There are long stretches of the movie with a lot of dry chat. While I realize that the movie was trying to be pretty realistic about the world of spying - in real life it IS mostly routine work and with little action - I think significantly more juice (either with the investigative work or with action) could have worked wonders for the movie.Don't get me wrong, I didn't think the movie was awful. But it's just an okay viewing experience in the end. It's probably better than you might think, but all the same you'll see potential that was not quite realized. Wait until it comes on free TV before watching it.</fullReview>

That being said the movie really started to lose steam for me and toward the end I found myself wandering and finding it difficult to pay attention the entire time. Even with that problem I still thought this was a decent movie and is worth a watch. Just don't expect a James Bond type action movie. Overall, nothing amazing but worth watching at least once.

		<fullReview>How I missed a movie like this in the era of "brute Bond", "kids" Marvel, "over played" Bourne and others. This movie is a real "breath of fresh air" from 1960. Where to start: cast, director, music, costumes, photography they all deserve great praise. ? Cast, they aren't using their own accents for the roles they play, Henry Cavill (British) playing the American Napoleon Solo, Armie Hammer (American) playing Russian Illya Kuryakin and Alicia Vikander (Swedish) playing German Gaby Teller. Part from that you don't know who has more charm and presence on the screen. ? What to say about Guy (director)?(spoiler alert) The scene where Napoleon and Iliya are running away by boat,is the best combination of action and song that I saw on the movie screen for a long, long time, and Guy deserves Oscar just for it! ? Music, spot on in every scene going from Retro to Rock, from "Che vuole questa musica stasera" (by Peppino Gagliardi) to "Compared To What" (by Roberta Flack) and back to "Five Months, Two Weeks, Two Days" ? (by Louis Prima) outstanding! ? Costumes, remember the time when Dior, Yves Saint Laurent use to make clothes you can wear? ? Photography, OMG : lake Como, Rome, Berlin, should I say more? All in all: master director, great cast and movie of the year so far!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Above-Average but Not Memorable Prequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although it was co-written and directed by gifted "Sherlock Holmes" director Guy Ritchie, "The Man from U.N.C.L.E." is largely a disappointment. Essentially a prequel to the landmark NBC-TV show that Sam Rolfe created, this posh Cold War era espionage thriller unites American agent Napoleon Solo (Henry Cavill of "Man of Steel") together with Soviet KGB agent Illya Kuryakin (Armie Hammer of "The Lone Ranger") in a joint effort by to prevent Nazis from obtaining a nuclear warhead. Indeed, Ritchie and co-writer Lionel Wigram do a better job of recapturing the Cold War than reconstituting the TV show that ran from 1964 to 1968. As an adventure thriller, "The Man from U.N.C.L.E." provides loads of exposition about our heroes that the TV show never revealed. Solo is a black market art thief who got caught and rather than serve time has agreed to work for the CIA. Illya is trying to live down the crimes of his sticky-fingered father who stole funds. Another character from the series, Alexander Waverly (Hugh Grant of "Four Weddings and a Funeral) is a high ranking British spy who steps into coordinate our heroes' mission. While it is above-average in all respects, "The Man from U.N.C.L.E." is so far from the show that it really isn't even a prequel. The United Network Command for Law and Enforcement doesn't get mentioned until the end of the movie. The chemistry between Cavil and Hammer is virtually non-existent. This movie works like the Mona Lisa. Everything is half-baked, half-witted, and half-way, despite superb production values and a celebrity cast. Cavill seems stiff as Solo, while Hammer fares better as the blond KGB agent. One scene in a crowded restaurant concludes on an amusing note as one half of the customers are CIA and the other half are KGB. As Gabriella "Gaby" Teller, Alicia Vikander of "Ex-Machina" plays the daughter of a noted East German nuclear scientist and she winds up with Solo as he smuggles her out of East Berlin with Ilya hot on their trail. Gaby worries that her dear old dad ( ) is being forced to build a bomb for the nefarious likes of Alexander (Luca Calvani) and Victoria Vinciguerra (Elizabeth Debicki). Victoria turns out to be a genuine villainess of the first order. "The Man from U.N.C.L.E." qualifies as above-average, but it didn't rekindle happy memories of the TV series for me. Based on its dismal showing at the box-office, no sequel will appear.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A cool and bright action.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Man From U.N.C.L.E. is your typical action film. A number of aspects make it a cut above the rest. Firstly, is the relationship between the two agents, American CIA smooth-talker Napoleon Solo (Henry Cavill) and Russian KGB mad-man Illya Kuryakin (Armie Hammer). Their connection and mockery towards each other is witty. It's their job to protect the daughter of a nuclear weapons expert and bring down those who intend to make them. Alicia Vikander is simply sexy without trying, making viewers melt with her looks and accent. Henry Cavill can't help but look like Superman in disguise, but plenty for women viewers to swoon over too. The story frays, stretching out to last, but the trio of actors keep U.N.C.L.E smart and bright so it doesn't bother. This film and the Downey Jr. Sherlock Holmes films are marginally different from Snatch and Lock Stock in context, but far more PC. Guy Ritchie does, however, keep us infused with a decent script, fantastic production and intelligent action, giving Mr. Bond a run for his money.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all will start of by saying that I haven't seen the TV series of the same name so won't be able to tell you in this review how the film measures up to that series. The beginning of the movie and the chase seen between Henry Cavill's American agent being chased down by Armie Hammer's Russian was a good and was well thought out and a bit different to your normal car chase seen. From there on the film plays well showing the rivalry between Russia and America and the two agents. Henry Cavill was very good playing the slick Napoleon Solo and I thought Armie Hammer delivered well and his Russian accent was good.Now the part I'm not so sure about and that was Gaby played by Alicia Vikander. She was good but I wasn't sure what nationality she was supposed to be as her accent seemed to change a lot. But she was good although she seemed a bit third wheel in most of the story.Overall I really enjoyed the film, if you enjoy spy films and action films with a bit of comedy then you will enjoy this film. What I would say is if you go in without high expectations then you will probably enjoy it more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Henry Cavill is a high-class and high-tech criminal whose talents in deception could not be wasted, so of course the U.S. intelligence hires him for international purposes. Enter an enemy Russian agent, played by Armie Hammer. In the beginning, they are on opposite sides, but soon they learn that, with a common goal, their countries have paired them together on a mission - find a scientist who is missing and central to certain parties constructing a bomb. The key - befriend his daughter and get close to the - well, find him. While the plot and ongoing flow of the film seems to meander, this film oozes with style. I said, style! Finesse! The metrosexuality of the actors permeates throughout the film and there are innuendos aplenty, just between them alone. This film cliques, flashes and sizzles before your very eyes. The moments between Henry and Armie sparkle as they work well together, and, the soundtrack is awesome. I had to buy it, and I listen to it all the time now. I've never seen the original TV series, so I have no comparison complaints. For a lively and enjoyable time with international intrigue, you can't go wrong with this team. I'm already getting impatient for the sequel. Come on already, Cavill and Hammer! Save the day!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really Expected Better...from everyone concerned</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, where to start? Firstly, my reviews usually only come after I see something for the first time. I generally watch films for escapism so the film only really has one chance at impressing me.Guy Ritchie is a bit of an enigma. Lock Stock and Snatch are pretty much cult classics, then come the years of Madonna and self indulgent carp; which in turn are followed by the OK Rock n Rolla and the two enjoyable Sherlock Holmes films.The Holmes films were somewhat more of a Hollywood blockbuster formula; well shot, great scripting, superb chemistry between the leads, humour where required, great costumes (although perhaps erring slightly on the comic book side of things), excellent locations and generally very high production values. I loved both of those films and have watched them both several times over.Is that not what we were supposedly to expect with The Man from UNCLE?Well...I was born in 1962 and grew up watching some of the best TV kids will ever see (argue as much as you want, but those of us that grew up with The Saint, voyage to the bottom of the sea, land of the Giants, the time tunnel, thunderbirds, the persuaders, the protectors, dept. S, Randall And hopkirk, the champions, captain scarlet, lost in space, ufo, Mannix, the Wild Wild West, and The Man From U.N.C.L.E etc etc etc ...we KNOW that was the best TV ever!). As such, I continually have a longing for a great old TV series that is made into a film to be good. ISpy...terrible, Starsky&amp;Hutch terrible, lost in space first half great second half ...terrible,The Avengers...terrible, thunderbirds....beyond terrible, wild Wild West....passable...just, you get my drift? The only reason that the MI series isn't included is because the first was actually very entertaining 2 was OK, 3 yup terrible, 4 OK and the recent one was very enjoyable...so it comes out slightly ahead on points.Uncle has me sat on the fence. I am an avid film watcher of epic proportions but only if escapism is on offer. I'm not interested in reliving the struggles of peasant potato farmers in Ireland in 1836, nor am I interested in watching families dissolve into disarray because of drugs, alcohol, infidelity, incest or necrophilia...take your pick. A good plot driven thriller with decent cast members and decent dialogue, the odd shoot out and an explosion or two for a good measure would be perfect. So at face value this is Uncle....isn't it?Well, no. Unfortunately not. For as much as I really wanted to love this film, I couldn't. The sets are beautiful, production values are high and there is (almost) a sense of it actually being set in the 1960s. However, as previously mentioned, I was born in 1962, and as much as it tries to capture the feel of the 1960s set out in films such as the Ipcress File, Modesty Blaise and From Russia With Love...it fails. But it's not the sets or locations that make it fail. It is the actors. The actors are 18carat 2015 Hollywood and unfortunately they act like it. There is no chemistry between any of the actors at all, be they goodies or baddies. We, as viewers, need to believe in the relationships of our heroes/villains if we are to invest our time in seeing what they get up to. If you fail at that then everything else becomes just that bit harder to buy into.There is none of the kitsch or cheesiness seen in the original series as Ritchie tries so hard to focus on the set pieces and in the only part of the film that would have provided the best shoot out scenario, he opts to put in a series of 1960s style split screen cuts to tell the story from several viewpoints at once. This just smacked of lazy editing as perhaps the film would be too long so someone said...hey, let's put in one of those crazy multi screen scenes and we can cut this epic battle scene down to under a minute. Guy...really? This should have been the finale type scene as in the storming of the volcano lair of Blofeld but instead it was all a huge anti climax. Split screen cuts are fine, but sometimes you just want to see the entire battle unfold. Big mistake IMO.I understand that Ritchie wanted to put his own stamp on the UNCLE theme, but just as Jonathan Frakes did with Thunderbirds, you have to include more than a passing nod at your predecessors if you want to bring on board all the people that loved the series the first time around. Unfortunately for me, as someone who grew up idolising Napoleon and Ilya's constant battles against the villainous THRUSH, this film fails to bring me on board.OK so this has been long and waffley but there again, so was the film. They still don't make them like they used to. Shame.EDIT. I have a sneaking suspicion that the 1966 film 'Modesty Blaise' and 1967's 'Fathom' were used more for the feel of the era than old UNCLE films/progs as more of this film seems to take place around the Mediterranean. Have a look, see what you think.</fullReview>

You can make success without being extravagant, without any effects, as long as you are a good director. The plot was fast and kept the audience's interest.

The look and style of the film is the main reason why I really like it. It is a fun, fresh way to watch the usual action movie. The acting in the movie isn't especially impressive, and Henry Cavill's American accent is really fake. There are also multiple action sequences that aren't very memorable. There are certain sequences in the film, though, that are much more creative and memorable. The soundtrack is also great. The film takes place in the 60s so most of the songs are foreign 60s pop music. There are some flaws in the film, but overall this is a great movie that is really fun to watch.</fullReview>

The performances are without a doubt the highlight, Henry Cavill delivers one of his most professional portrayals to date, his accent and overall characterisation is perfect, he is joined by Armie Hammer, who also clearly put a lot of work in to his role, and Alica Vikander, who does her very best with a boring, underdeveloped character. The plot wears thin very fast, Guy Ritchie certainly offers impressive visuals and set pieces, but it simply is not enough to hide how predictable and straight forward this movie is, it lacks excitement, there is not a huge sense of adventure, and predictability occurs throughout. The villains are all poorly written, I never found myself worried for the heroes, as they always had the upper hand, the bad guys have the poorest dialogue and never make their motives clear, they are not one bit intimidating or even intriguing. While it has some fun moments, the plot is uneven and the characters are lacking scope, you would be better off avoiding The Man from U.N.C.L.E. An American and Russian agent team up in order to uncover a secret organisation. Best Performance: Henry Cavill</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cool "Cowboy" and Rough "Russian"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked the whole spy thing, the very cool "cowboy" and the very rough "Russian", it actually plays well together.I haven't seen the series, but this film seems to have been adopted right from it, with the old school spy stuff, the explaining sequences, long streaks where something slow happens in the foreground, but strange or fun or different stuff moving fast in the background, it is a cool effect.In general the film is cool and clever, moving slowly along, with fun episodes where either don't want to help the other and they mess things up, but it is missing something to be really good and interesting for my sake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a pleasant surprise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was expecting either a dull, Bourne - style spy thriller, with pointless noise and racing around, or a smug, 'aren't we cleverly spoofing the 60s' superficiality but actually this is quite an enjoyable, stylish piece. My 13 year old complained for the first few minutes then was hooked! The characters are pretty simplistic, yes, but great to watch, and the chemistry between all the three leads works well. You do find yourself caring what happens to them which is a good sign. The plot is no dafter than most Bond films, and a couple of nice twists kept it interesting. The chases are low key which made them more involving to watch than the overdone exploits of recent Bond films, for example, and its definitely worth a look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>cool idea, lousy execution</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've only seen a few episodes of the original "Man from U.N.C.L.E.". To me it seemed as if the show didn't know whether it wanted to be funny or serious. However, I liked the concept of an American agent and a Soviet agent having to collaborate on cases.So now, Guy Ritchie directs a big-screen adaptation. He keeps the setting in the early '60s, and maintains the nationalities of the leads. However, the movie tries too hard to be an action flick. I did like the contrast between the suave Napoleon Solo (Henry Cavill of "Man of Steel") and the uptight Ilya Kuryakin (Armie Hammer of "The Social Network" and "The Lone Ranger") but it seems like the movie ends up unintentionally silly. I think that Ritchie should stick to movies about organized crime in England ("Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels" and "Snatch"). As for TV shows about espionage, I far prefer "Get Smart".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw this film last night and it wasn't as bad as i thought it was going to be the first trailer or the posters didn't impress me but the film wasn't that perfect also it had a somewhat weird humor and it was kinda boring at times. I think Henry Cavill needs a film that will show much more of his talent like Man of Steel did it has a good cast and the story was a James Bond mash up meets True Lies and also it needed a better villain or in this case an actual villain if they make a 2nd one i hope they learn from their mistakes and make a much better film than this one was. It wasn't perfect by any means but i enjoyed it as a movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A stylish innovator of the genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2015 appears to be a banner year for spy films, we have already seen two original vehicles, Matthew Vaughn's slick veteran-and-newbie paired-up KINGSMAN: THE SECRET SERVICE (2014), and Paul Feig's Melissa McCarthy headliner SPY (2015), subverts the established stereotypes in gender, in looks and in its tones, then two successful sequels of money-grubbing long-lasting franchises across the Atlantic Ocean, MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE - ROGUE NATION (2015) and the latest 007 SPECTRE (2015). So what makes Guy Ritchie's spin-off of the titular 1960s TV series distinguishes among them?Firstly the enchanting flair of swinging 60s, hits the right spot of our nostalgia with Italy as the main location, stunning scenography of the vintage hotel rooms, automobiles and haute couture, plus the four leads' multiplied sex appeal, Guy Ritchie had it all to make a crowd-pleaser. But he didn't, according to its underwhelmed box-office performance (a worldwide 100 million dollars gross income against a 75 million dollars price tag is a far cry to call it profitable), audience might find it eccentric since the movie doesn't rely on mind-blowing action pieces to bombard viewers' expectation of this genre, and the humour vs. seriousness apathy is too confusing for broad appeal.In any rate, the film is a stylish innovator, two top spies of CIA and KGB, Napoleon Solo (Cavill) and Illya Kuryakin (Hammer), are reluctantly teamed together to investigate a criminal organisation headed by an Italian villainess Victoria Vinciguerra (Debicki, her family name literally means "win war", and the family is an old associate of Nazis), for privately producing nuclear weapon, through Gaby Teller (Vikander), whose father is a former Nazi scientist now reported missing, but in secret, held hostage by Victoria and her hubby Alexander (Calvani). With their respective ulterior motives known to spectators (they can kill each other if necessary), Solo and Illya ladle out their deadpan banters and unpredictable behaviours during their dangerous mission, which gives off a refreshing air to erase the tedium of the modern high-tech routine. Gaby is not the corny "good bond girl" type, a double agent subplot gives her the edge to outperform her male co-stars, and Victoria is also not in the default mode of a femme fatale, she is ruthless from A to Z and never fall into Solo's charm except for her own cocksure confidence.All four actors are beautiful creatures designed for big screen panache and glamour, although the same cannot be said to Hugh Grant's Alexander Waverly, the head of the U.N.C.L.E. organisation, in a way, Guy Ritchie sanguinely toys with the unimpressive story development and puts a mien of insouciance and repeatedly deploys several anti-climaxes to label the film with his own signature, fairly speaking, it leans more towards a male-bonding comedy than a white-knuckle action-er, at least, it is unexpectedly satisfactory for my taste.</fullReview>

The movie has amazing music and really well-directed chase sequences which will definitely put you to the edge!Take the wit and humor from sherlock Holmes and put it into a bond movie. Very subtle and humorous stereotypical references from the cold war era: Americans using shitty technology, Russians with simpler smarter tech. The fear Gulag (Siberia)...

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly fresh and entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A couple of weeks ago I heard the 80's song "99 red balloons", and remembered the decades of the Cold War when, even in happy moments, people couldn't shake off their minds the possibility that the leaders of the world could press a button and destroy civilization. Then I recalled the many movies covering this topic, and decided to watch a personal cycle of the best Nuclear War movies and documentaries. I watched "The day after", "A boy and his dog", "Trinity", "Games of war", "The world's biggest bomb", and "Testament". In the next weeks I plan to see, "Countdown to looking glass", "Miracle Mile", "On the beach", "Fail safe", "The war game", "By downs early light", and I will finish with "Thread", the highest rated nuclear war movie.In the middle of all this depressing fest I wanted a relief and decided to view "The man from U.N.C.L.E." (Fortunately, I didn't knew the plot included a nuclear bomb). I don't know if it was because of all the disheartening scenes I have seen in the last weeks, but I found TMFU extremely entertaining. From the first scene, things happened in impossible ways. That always seemed to be impossibly calculated by one of the characters, and always results hilarious.The plot is not original, it is impossible to count the books, movies, and TV episodes, where crazy people attempts to use an atom bomb and good guys try to frustrate it. Even the comedy approach to that plot have been used innumerable times. But I liked the particular take of Guy Ritchie, and the performances of Henry Cavill as Solo, and Arnie Hammer as Kuryakin, are refreshing, engaging and amusing.Of course, if you are expecting to see the exact lookalikes of Robert Vaughn and David McCallum, performing exactly as in the best episodes of the original series, you will be disappointed. But as a new approach to the original concept of the series, I found this movie surprisingly fresh and entertaining in the spy genre, I definitively recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun movie from start to finish</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Guy Ritchie is a director that knows to to make fast-paced, quick witted films with charming characters that actually sticks with you for the most part. I just really like the action in this to the character interactions and how they go about on the mission. Now when it comes to the plot, it has been done many times before in other actions movies. But the execution is what makes this movie stand out. It's just really fun from the beginning sequence to the ending. Now the premise of two guys on the same mission loathing each other, but have to work together in order to succeed has been done many times before as well. But I really liked how this duo worked together in this. I thought the title "The Man from U.N.C.L.E." was a bit odd. That is because this is based on a TV show of the same name by Ian Fleming. Who is also the creator of 007 novels and the super iconic spy James Bond. Henry Cavill is swell as Napoleon Solo who was a thief that got caught and now works for the CIA. He is a bit of a jerk, but has this laid back attitude about everything even in dire situations. He is basically has this live and let live attitute, a guy uses his charm to get what he wants and also knows how to get women in bed by using sex appeal. The character is a bit of a jerk, but like I said he has his charm and has his moments that makes him stand out. The other guy who is teamed up with is Illya Kuryakin played by Armie Hammer is more of the serious, get the point type of character that is very proficient when it comes to getting things done. He is also a pro in hand to hand combat and quick witted when it comes to his movements. He like the perfect partner in a premise like this, especially since this direction really brings out each of their attributes and give each of them time to shine. I like rivalry stories, and this has the right balance of rivarly and partnership. To sum it up, I really had fun with this film because it just had the right combination and chemistry. Lastly the cinematography is also flat out awesome. Highly worth checking out.8.5/10</fullReview>

Henry Cavill was so slick and he actually seems like a candidate for the next Bond movie, easily. Alicia Vikander was gorgeous and really really good as well! Put that together with a nice storyline, awesome photography and a nice "vintage" feel for the entire movie, and you need nothing more! The costumes, the clothes and everything about the movie was so tastefully done that you felt like living at the time of the movie. That's invaluable!Myy favorite part was when I realized that it will probably get a sequel and I guess a trilogy, etc. Guy Ritchie has become one of my favorite directors with movies like this.

		<shortDescription>Hilarious - In A Good Way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been looking forward to watching this film for a while now and i am so happy that it didn't disappoint. The film looked amazing, The costumes, styling and sets were spot on and really helped set the tone of the film, my only slight grumble were the transitions, they could distract from the action a bit but i presume that was a homage to the TV series of the same name. Also i felt that most of the time the music worked superbly but sometimes it was perhaps a little too much and unnecessary for some scenes. I knew the film was going to be humorous from what i had previously seen in the trailers but i wasn't prepared for just how hilarious it was. I absolutely loved the sense of humour throughout. The film had a perfect mix of funny and serious moments. The actors were all amazing! I loved them all. I was so happy to see Henry Cavill back to his usual charming self, i always loved him in The Tudors but in Superman he was so cold and came across as very wooden. In this role however, he was perfect and i think he could have been a great Bond. Armie Hammer was perfect as always, I absolutely love him so i'm maybe being a tad biased but he was definitely my favourite character and i felt that he did the Russian accent justice. Alicia Vikander was super cute as usual and the chemistry between her and Armie was absolutely breathtaking. They sizzled together on screen. Special mention to Elizabeth Debicki and Hugh Grant who were also brilliant. The only reason that i haven't given this an even higher rating is for personal reasons, i often find myself losing interest with spy films and at points my interest started to drift off but i don't understand why Bond fans wouldn't enjoy this film too. I have no idea why it didn't do brilliantly in the cinema and i'll be very disappointed if it doesn't get the sequel that the ending sets it up for. I'd love to see these actors back working together again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cool, cooler, U.N.C.L.E. - if style is your thing, do not miss this</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's really sad that Warner did not believe in this film. Otherwise they would have marketed it more aggressively, giving more people a chance to hear about it. So I guess many folks fared like me - I was really curious how Ritchie would adapt the source material, since he is indubitably the one director everyone would expect to direct an 007 picture, but has not done so. However, the theatrical run was cut so short that I had to wait for its digital release. And while it was immensely entertaining to watch, it would have been absolutely glorious in a theater, what with the splendid set designs, costumes, editing and soundtrack.Ritchie tends to be underestimated as a director even though he has his share of movies in the IMDb top 250. That is because he always goes for entertainment rather than artsy stuff and because his ex-marriage still undeservedly haunts his reputation. He has a tremendous skill for both timing scenes and eliciting good performances out of actors who are not necessarily Oscar material. In "Man from U.N.C.L.E.", this is just as evident as in "Snatch" or"Lock, Stock and two Smoking Barrels". Hammer, who was stiff and wooden in "Lone Ranger" and "Mirror Mirror", is pretty good in this one because his scenes are timed very well and his character fits. Cavill, who often seems more like a model than an actor, is used very effectively as just that - a model playing a super spy. That comes across as quirky, ironic and therefore totally in sync with a 60s spy flick. The real steal however is Elizabeth Debicki's performance, which should push her career for greater things to come. In a role very similar to Eva Green's in "Spy", she looks less bored, more poised, with a perfect balance between self-irony and over-the-top evil, exactly how a spy movie villain should come across.The main character in this film is, however, 60s fashion. That may make this film not everyone's cup of tea. Everybody looks absolutely gorgeous in absolutely every situation. The attention to detail is almost ridiculous. Cavill's suits are just as stunning as his turtleneck sweaters; The escape boats, the safe to be cracked, the henchman's shoes, the eavesdropping bugs are all incredibly beautiful. Which makes this particular spy film very, very camp. Which may be a little out of zeitgeist. But if you know the original TV series, you will appreciate the overdone styling, because that makes it a spot-on homage.In short: much more entertaining than a 20-year-plus development hell and the leads could make you assume, "The Man from U.N.C.L.E." is an almost too perfect tribute to spy flicks of yonder. Ritchie, who not just directed, but also produced and wrote the script, shows that he is still at the top of his game. It's almost as if this is a calling card to Barbara Broccoli - Ritchie would definitely be the top choice for a revamp of the Bond franchise.</fullReview>

To be specific, the start scene, the torture scene, the boat chasing scene, and the car chasing scene in the end, are all artistic and humorous. However, lack of tension and boring characters are just not enough to support all these awesome scenes. Deserves to be counted as a good movie but not an epic one. Suggestion to the sequel (if there is one), thicken the plot and enrich the characters, and at the same time keep up the good old Guy Ritchie style.</fullReview>

The trailer made me want to see it, but evidently most other people didn't think so; it only grossed $13.5 million its opening weekend, which is a shame because it was a great summer movie that more people should have seen. It isn't even close to making it's budget back yet, so even with home video sales, it seems unlikely that it will get a sequel. I'm not some franchise fanatic, but I would fully support Guy Ritchie making a sequel if that's what he wanted to do. It's a shame it didn't do better.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fast and fun Friday night popcorn flick, but not memorable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's swift, funny, breezy, and has about as much substance as a soap bubble... but then that's all part of the fun! This movie applies a very simple formula: put beautiful people into gorgeous places, keep the plot moving with intrigue but keep it light with humour, then top the whole thing off with just a frisson of sexuality. It's the perfect Friday night at the flicks.Everything looks gorgeous. Car lovers will spot a Ferrari 350 GTO quietly nestled into the background in several scenes - one of the most beautiful cars ever made - which is there, purely and simply, because the location is a whole lot prettier with it sitting there. Nobody gets into it, nobody drives it anywhere. The car isn't integral to the plot in any way. It's just there because, well, why not.The other major strength of the movie is its sense of humour. There is something to have a chuckle at in almost every scene, from the interplay between the three lead characters, deliberate subverting of spy and action movie clichés by the director, and even making jokes that rely purely on character to make sense. This last is an area where the movie really scores aces. Guy Ritchie manages to take two good-looking but one-dimensional leads and actually turns their flat acting to comic effect. He turns what could have been a movie-killing liability into an asset, and not just once either.Deliberately keeping it in the '60's has worked out brilliantly. Sure, it's the vision of the '60's that we'd all like to believe in, but it works. World powers facing off? Sure. Fast shifts from one Cold War hotspot to another? Par for the course. Everyone - and I do mean everyone - dressed in fab outfits and looking glam to the max? You bet. Over the top villains and diabolical plans fit right in, which is where the movie becomes a victim of its own success.None of it carries any weight. It's just too frothy. Even a comedy has to have some substance, and this just... doesn't. The rapid pace of the plot, the quick getaways, the heroes getting out of one fix after another in the minimum possible screen time - it keeps the entertainment factor high, but the tradeoff is that it can't generate any tension.The acting is pretty flat, too, even by the jokey standards that this movie runs on. None of the characters ever feel like more than cardboard cutouts. They're very stylish cutouts, they have the moves and the lines, but they're still cutouts. They don't grow. They don't become people, even the cartoony type that an audience would expect here. As a prop for jokes flung at that character, that's fine, but it's terrible for getting an audience to identify with them in any way.The worst weakness of the whole thing is that there's a resolution around every corner, and not just for the plot lines. Every time a problem comes up it gets immediately solved. At first it's very engaging, but after a while everything just ends up looking easy.In short, it's as light as a soufflé, and about as satisfying. It's fun along the way, but ten minutes after you've left the theatre, you'll struggle to remember any of it.</fullReview>

Only scene that is equally good is docking scene from Interstellar, Hans Zimmer, No time for caution. Awesome scene with awesome fitting soundtrack.

		<shortDescription>The Man from U.N.C.L.E. Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the middle of the Cold War, a mysterious criminal organization led by a woman named Victoria Vinciguerra (Elizabeth Debicki) is trying to acquire nuclear weapons and technology to create friction and upset the balance between the United States and Russia. CIA agent Napoleon Solo (Henry Cavill) and KGB agent Illya Kuryakin (Armie Hammer) are forced to set aside their differences and team up in order to stop these criminals in their tracks. This duo must use the help of a missing German scientist's daughter Gabby (Alicia Vikander) who they must find to stop a possible global catastrophe.First I'll say this film is not Bond or Bourne, but it is fun. I've never heard of the TV show this is based on either. When the film starts, you'll notice that it serves as a period piece in that it exudes 60s culture with the outfits, the technology, the soundtrack, and the overall look of everything. It doesn't beat you over the head with it as it takes a backseat to the plot. The story is pretty standard here and is not too overly original for an action movie. You get all the normal stuff: fight scenes, car chases, shooting, explosions, etc. These are all done well as you can see that they spent a decent amount of time working on each of them. All of these were shot nicely as well but I could definitely have gone without all the spit screen stuff. I thought the acting was very good in this with Cavill being the cool, sly American agent and Hammer providing the counterbalance to Cavill's many quips. This brings me to my favorite thing about this film which is the writing. It brings smarts and some comedy to lighten things up a little and to break up all the action sequences. This is evident in a few scenes near the middle and end. I thought Vikander was okay but she didn't really have to much to do here and Debicki was great as an icy, cold villain who I wish I could have seen more of. Hugh Grant was good as well in a minor role. What I didn't like about this film was the chemistry between Cavill and Hammer, I thought they were good individually but I did not enjoy it as much when they were together. Something just did not seem right to me. Finally, this film does not compare to all of the other action films that have come out this year but it gets a recommendation for just how fun it is to watch and it does have a lot of enjoyable moments.Score: 7.5/10 keithlovesmovies.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Sensational Spy Action-Comedy with Impeccable Production Values and Nifty Direction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDKK0Rating: 4.5/5 starsWith great action sequences, deadpan humor, charming wit, unbelievable chemistry between its two leads, and Director Guy Ritchie's signature panache of slick execution stamped all over the canvas, "The Man from U.N.C.L.E." is everything a fun spy film should be, and above all, a fun homage to action-thrillers centered around the Cold War. Along with remaining faithful to the spirit of the original TV show, the film unfolds with a hyper stylish mix of action and comedy that seduces by virtue of its visual appeal, which should please fans of the original series while also entertaining modern moviegoers.The story, though relatively straightforward, works well and is infused with intriguing plot elements to keep you enthralled. In terms of being an origins story, it does the job perfectly well by introducing its characters ? and more importantly, arouses interest in them ? creating a defined cinematic world, and setting things into motion to establish a new franchise ? showing how debonair thief turned CIA specialist Napoleon Solo (Henry Cavill) is forced to team up with no-nonsense KGB operative Illya Kuryakin (Armie Hammer) at the height of the Cold War to thwart a nuclear threat that could bring about the end of the world. Helping them is the attractive Gaby (Alicia Vikander), who has familial links to one of the men building the bomb, while standing in their path is a playboy, race-car driver (Luca Calvani) and his scheming wife, Victoria (Elizabeth Debicki).Where "The Man from U.N.C.L.E." succeeds superlatively is in fusing Ritchie's undoubted eye for style with the retro elements he is clearly seeking to pay homage too. Hence, the film looks right for the era it exists in, while incorporating Ritchie's previous penchant for slick but hard-hitting action with an ultra-cool soundtrack and enhanced set pieces. The attractive use of location, especially Rome and its surrounding area, also enhances the visual appeal of a film not wanting for glamour.Cavill is as charming as he is clinical and very good at dry, deadpan dialogue delivery. Hammer is the likable straight man with muscle and endears despite being limited in terms of his material. Vikander is suitably sultry and spiky and an appealing presence, while there's eye-catching (if under-used) support from Hugh Grant as a possible ally and Debicki as the sinister villainess.This latest Guy Ritchie offering boasts highly charismatic leads, exotic locations, high fashion, romping action, clap-inducing moments, and a cool soundtrack (mixing Morricone with Holmes)?what's not to enjoy? It provides solid, crowd-pleasing entertainment that excites and amuses in equal measure, and certainly merits a sequel or two, regardless of its subpar box-office returns.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Where do I start??? Firstly, the casting of Henry Cavill and Armie Hammer was masterful. I felt dubious over AH but was pleasantly surprised at how good he was, and how decent his Russian accent was. As for Henry, I'm a huge fan and I thought he aced both the accent and character. (I also think he should be in serious consideration for the next James Bond! But I digress.) Loved the music, the way the film was shot and edited and the glam locations. Also loved the vintage clothing. And the way the female characters both kicked ass. I also loved the comical elements and the way certain scenes were spliced.I do remember watching the original TV series as my first ever crush was on David McCallum. (Well, him and William Shatner's Captain Kirk.) I couldn't stop thinking about how he and Robert Vaughn thought about this movie remake. (Interestingly, Guy Ritchie is friends with fellow director Matthew Vaughn who had grown up thinking Robert was his father.) Another thing that I found intriguing was the intro theme music reminded me of the theme music to the British TV series "Hustle" and Robert Vaughn was a star in that show. Also the way some scenes were explained in flashbacks reminded me of how the grifters show their clients how they hoodwinked the marks.I have to say how impressed I was to go see a movie with my husband and two teenage girls and not be bombarded by even ONE swear word. Just goes to show you can make movies - good movies - without having to resort to bad language. How refreshing!I also loved watching a movie set in a different time period where there were no crazy technological gadgets nor were there any mobile phones or computers. Again, refreshing. Didn't think Gaby's accent was very German, as she pronounced "what" with a "w" whereas most Germans say "v". But other than that can't think of anything negative.Am really hoping there's a sequel but have a feeling there won't be if the box office is anything to go by.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tons of charm to spare, but it's like drinking a gas refrigerant, it feels like your stomach is full but its not.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Guy Ritchie is one of my favourite directors, so i was very excited about this film, and had high expectations. Did the film meet them?No. The film is great, but there's two things that fail, the plot and the action. This is one of those films that are very entertaining, and 2 hours fly by. The cast is beyond perfect, but the villainess steals the show and its a shame she doesn't appear more. Alicia Vikander don't get far behind.There's charm all around, magnific visuals and production values, and a score like no other, a score that elevates the film and has to get an Oscar nom, but while the cold war and spy themes provide a great premise the plot is mundane. There's not a single boring scene or moment, but the plot in barely existent, and the film goes on entertaining because of a lot of factor, the cast among them, but mainly because all the scenes are very good, the plot just isn't, and if you think a bit, there's not much happening.There's two or three awesome twists, but the plot around them steals a bit of their thunder, you end the film with the feeling that there's something missing. One of the more obvious things is the action, there's few action scenes, but the problem is that the ones that do exist are very strange, in the way they are filmed, and they are so short that barely register. Something i found very strange considering this is a film by Guy Ritchie.Overall this is a great film, and one that entertains a lot, thanks to magnific visuals, a perfect cast, a brilliant score, and tons of charm to spare, but is like drinking a gas refrigerant, it feels like your stomach is full but its not.The end is very promising, i sure wanted a sequel, but unfortunately the audiences didn't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun spy movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Man from U.N.C.L.E. is directed by Guy Ritchie and it stars Henry Cavill, Armie Hammer and Alicia Vikander. The movie also has a lot of, I wouldn't really call them cameos, but includes other notable stars like Hugh Grant.The movie really tries to be a throwback to spy movies of the 1960's and the TV show of the same name, and I think it really worked most of the time, Guy Ritchie actually did a pretty good job directing this. I would even dare to say (as a huge fan of Snatch) this is Rithie's most stylistic movie. The movie looks great, nearly every shot is very stylish and cool. But the main problem I have with the film is that it is simply so much style over so little substance.Don't come into this movie expecting to see anything new, here, you have your basic spy movie plot: Two spies that don't really like each other but have to work together have to stop some evil people that have a bomb, etc. You've seen this stuff before. And it may work in the sense that the movie is a throwback to the spy films of the 1960's but the truth is that as a modern viewer, most of the plot may simply come off as uninteresting.I'm not trying to say I wasn't entertained by the movie, cause I really was. Although the plot was predictable and not really interesting I really enjoyed Cavill and Hammer's chemistry on screen. Also, by now I'm a pretty big fan of Alicia Vikander, who was amazing in Ex Machina as well. The rivalry between the CIA agent vs. KGB agent is pretty fun to watch. I mentioned Hugh Grant earlier and the truth is every scene he's in he just steals it, he's great in this.In the end, this is a spy movie with endless clichés, from start to finish, from characters to villains, so it's pretty predictable. But The Man from U.N.C.L.E. manages to entertain. It's fun that won't make your brain work hard, and it's also pretty funny.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent spy movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is not only refreshing because of its style, which stands on in the current generic batch of flicks. It has cinemagraphics that can compete with the very high profile atmospheric and artful movies. This year I haven't heard so many people "awww" or laugh or gasp in a theater.I'm often very critical and went in without knowing the TV-series nor any expectations. I'm glad I did: the movie really engages you from the first frame. It comes across some moments as a comic-book while others like an exciting Bond movie. With less erotica but more innocent and honest chemistry. Yet less silly as other "spy comedy" movies. You get a nice feel for the different characters and they make you feel and live their part. All tied together with a humorously wink. I especially liked the way "action scenes" are "compressed" (you'll know what I mean) in favour for character development and story. The attention to dressing and setting is also very appreciated - which was the cherry to the pie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Oh, and you have a new codename. Rather a good one: UNCLE."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>60's set spy comedy film. Well, there you have all the ingredients. And Guy Ritchie knows how to use them. I've never seen the original TV Series, but after watching the film, I'm compelled to do it. The acting is top-notch - although some people have crictised the accents, I didn't see any misstep on them - and the chemistry between the leads is as good as you could think you'd get. Henry Cavill(Napoleon Solo) is awesome, really awesome. Armie Hammer(Illya Kuryakin) is awesome, really awesome. Alicia Vikander( Gaby Teller)is awesome, bloody awesome. She is sexy, she is beautiful, she knows how to act and you can see she committed to the project. Besides these names, you have Hugh Grant, the beautiful Elizabeth Debicki as the main villain, Sylvester Groth as the mad Uncle Rudi. Jared Harris is also there. The plot is the strict necessary for keeping the film going, not too complex, not too simple, indeed, the necessary. The character development is not in any way revolutionary, and just for watching the trailers you 've already figured it out. Solo and Kuryakin become pals - with the shadow of the antagonism of their countries still in their heads - and the latter develops a romance with Gaby. The movie itself is, from my point of view, well shot and edited. I just found the first fight scene - Kuryakin beating the crap out some Russian Officers - too jump-cutted and shaky-cammed and I thought "Is this what we're getting?" but "No, this wasn't what we get". Many may have crictised the technique used by Rechie to hide/conceal some plot points/developments to two minutes later reveal to the audience, but well, although a bit exxagerated at times (that Condessa scene) I very much like it. Guy Richie's movie are heavily stylized and that is indeed the major reason why I like them. This stylization sets them apart from other "mainstream" action flicks.The sequel is inevitable, the Turkey hint - as some said, although I didn't notice, some footage from their mission there makes the cut in the credits scene - and I want to see that sequel. I just hope it reaches the theaters in two/three years from now. I just can't get enough. "The Man from U.N.C.L.E." is a fresh take on the spy genre, a comedy heavy one - I don't think the movie thinks of itself too smart or funny as some might say - which departs it from the Bond and Bourne series. A Kingsman like approach, which went fairly well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Man from U.N.C.L.E.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Man from U.N.C.L.E. is one of the TV series I intensely admired as a kid, but not as an adult. Yes, I occasionally re-watch some episode (particularly when I find a special one, such as when William Shatner shows up, or the ones written by Harlan Ellison), but it doesn't capture my imagination as it used to before. Now, I find out the fact that almost all the episodes tell the same story, besides of the fact that the "suspense" is almost inexistent, and there aren't as many futuristic "gadgets" as I remembered. However, I keep enjoying the humor and the interaction between the main characters: a North American agent and a Russian one who must cooperate despite the political rivalries among their nations. In that aspect, the film The Man from U.N.C.L.E. fulfilled with my expectations, keeping the same sardonic sense of humor and creating a likable patriotic tension between Napoleon Solo and Ilya Kuryakin, but with more violence than in the innocent TV series. And Henry Cavill and Armie Hammer make a pretty good job in those roles. I had previously never swallowed Cavill, but in this film, he shows credibility in his character while having a good chemistry with Hammer. Unlike many people, I didn't hate his performance in The Lone Ranger, and I think Hammer has enough talent and charisma to lead some future blockbuster; pity that, due to the various box office flops in which he worked (Mirror Mirror, The Lone Ranger and The Man from U.N.C.L.E.), I don't think that is going to happen. Alicia Vikander is absolutely credible and simply adorable as the damsel in distress; I was even left with wishes to see a sequel with her in the leading role (after all, the TV series The Girl from U.N.C.L.E. also existed... even though it lasted for only one season). Regarding the screenplay, it's basically a variation of any Mission: Impossible film, but substantially reducing the scale of the action, stunts and espionage sequences. On the one hand, the adventures of Solo and Kuryakin feel more realistic inside the idealized setting of Cold War; but they aren't as ingenious to hold the whole film. And I didn't like the presence of too many special effects which clash with the "retro" visual style present in every frame of the movie. What takes me to the biggest pro of The Man from U.N.C.L.E.: the '60s setting, including costumes, music and even saturated and grainy cinematography which evokes the Kodachrome look from that decade. After all, the pure style doesn't compensate the narrative problems of The Man from U.N.C.L.E., or makes its diffuse narrative full of unnecessary tangents and forced complications more agile, but it makes even the weakest scenes become a visual delight. In summary: I liked the performances (I also have to mention Hugh Grant, who makes a perfect work as the refined/insensitive Waverly), the interaction between the characters and the general style of The Man from U.N.C.L.E. Comparing it to other recent films about secret agents, I found it very superior to Hit- man: Agent 47, but inferior to Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation. The best I can say about The Man from U.N.C.L.E. is that, despite its problems, I would have liked to see future sequels, but its box office failure will probably destroy any attempt to continue the franchise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well what an interesting film, this turned out to be. I was completely lost with the plot. Although the Music was unreal, I totally enjoyed the music. Henry's character was fab. Totally enjoyed his soothing voice and his strong American accent. Bottomline, guys YOU need to have seen the TV Series that was released in the '60s/'70s. I was completely lost as I said, like one minute Solo and Kuryakin are fighting EACH other, next Gaby is actually betrays Solo and Kuraykin. Like whats going on. And now we learn at the end that Gaby, Solo and Kurayakin have a "code name" for the thrio, as stated by Waverly(Grant). They are now known as UNCLE(United Network Command for Law and Enforcement). So overall great movie, Music WOW, so ENJOYABLE. I was there like the conductor.The plot being from what I can get, is that Solo(Cavill) is teamed up with Kuryakin(Hamemr). Initially Solo teams up with Gaby(Vikander). They are pursued by Kuryakin. They each learn that Kuraykin is actually now Solo's partner. So with the niceys niceys done, Gaby is to play Fiancé with KUryakin.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE MAN FROM U.N.C.L.E. (2015) **1/2 Henry Cavill, Armie Hammer, Alicia Vikander, Luca Calvani, Sylvester Groth, Hugh Grant, Jared Harris. Style over substance with this big screen adaptation of the classic '60s TV series about Cold War spies in the mix - one American, Napoleon Solo (stiff Cavill articulatingly uncannily like George Clooney); one Russian (boxy Hammer, resplendent with 'moose&amp;squirrel' accent - reluctantly paired up to find a missing German physicist with the help of his estranged, comely daughter (Calvani providing some subtly sexy steam) involved with a terrorist plot to launch nuclear missiles (that old chestnut). Luckily filmmaker Guy Ritchie - who co-wrote with Lionel Wigram, Jeff Kleeman, &amp; David Campbell Wilson the routine yet lively and frequently funny screenplay - gets his full-throttle on with the well-crafted chase sequences, shoot outs and fisticuffs. Hats off to costumer Joanna Johnston for pitch-perfect suave and slinky apparel for her well-intended mannequins.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Meh from U.N.C.L.E</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Man from U.N.C.L.E is directed by Guy Ritchie, and stars Henry Cavill and Armie Hammer, and this movie is based of the hit TV show with the same name. When a mysterious criminal organization get their hands on a nuclear weapon, America and Russia are forced to team up. They both send their best agents to work together and save the world. America sends dashing young smooth talking CIA agent Napoleon Solo (Cavill), whereas Russia sends cold hearted killer KGB agent Illya Kuryakin. Together they most learn to work together and save the world.This movie takes its audience back in time to the Cold War. Visually, this movie is stunning, from the beautiful set pieces, to the costumes, even the music. Even the actors themselves were easy on the eyes. The movie successfully captured the tone and look of a 60's spy movie, however it fails to have any real content. This movie is a very shallow and uneven attempt at a spy thriller. Throughout the story, it seemed fun and self aware, which were the best parts of the film, but then it tried to get serious. The serious and drama-like parts in the movie seem odd and out of place in the 60's spy movie. Perhaps these scenes would have been better if the story wrapped up the open ends they left: Like Illya's rage fits. Several times the KGB agent goes into fits of uncontrollable rage where he smashes anything or anyone close by. Unfortunately, the story never explains why or even tells how Illya is dealing with them. Other than that, Hammer's character was very interesting. He pulled off the thick Russian accent extremely well, considering he is American.Speaking of Americans, CIA agent Solo (Cavill) managed to charm his way into the audiences heart. From the cool demeanor he keeps in the intense opening action scene, to the charismatic way he talks his way out of problems, Solo truly is the American Bond. As amazing as Henry Cavill is in this role, he might have been the wrong choice. When a man who is literally Superman trying to talk his way out of a situation, it really suspends the audiences disbelief. If Agent Solo had been given just one more action sequence, it would have saved the character. The action in general in Man from U.N.C.L.E left something to be desired. From the trailers the movie looked to be a non-stop thrill ride of action, but we got something very different.The opening scene was amazing visually and really excited the audience for what is to come. However this first scene was never topped. The opening chase was the greatest action sequence in the whole movie, including the gun fight between the heroes and the criminal organization. That gunfight seemed to be a very interesting and awesome action scene, but it was hardly distinguishable through all the quick cuts and weird transitions. If it was supposed to be a tribute to its 60's roots, it didn't add anything to the film, but actually ruined a perfectly good action scene. Thankfully, the film avoided shaky camera work except during a chase sequence where it is used in a way to add something to the film. Although the movie steered clear of shaky camera, they did do lots of quick cuts that made it hard if not impossible to see what was happening. In general the action left something to be desired.Another shortcoming for Man from U.N.C.L.E, was its lack of a compelling villain. Although Elizabeth Debicki has an outstanding performance as the mastermind Victoria, the character herself was weak. She never showed a human side for the audience to connect to or relate with. The audience never once feared for the lives of the heroes. Perhaps if the villain had been or fleshed out, the danger would have seemed more real.Although its action and plot left something to be desired, the film was fun to watch and a great throwback to the 60's. It was a film that generally left its audience saying, "meh". Truly a beautiful film, but it suffered from unfocused writing and mediocre action. In the end Man from U.N.C.L.E receives a 7.0/10 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a lot better than I thought it'd be.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has that Guy Ritchie's fingerprints all over it, obviously cause he's the director. If you're a fan of his work then you'll like this film as well. I wasn't a big fan of his Sherlock Holmes films, but this is a solid entry by him. To be honest, up until I found out this movie was going to be made, I had no clue that it was a television show prior. So this is a review coming from someone who has no clue about the show. With that being said I really enjoyed this film. I did think it did take a little while to get started. I wasn't completely sold into the film until the meat and the conflict of the story became apparent, but even then it was a little muddled. It was a little hard for me to follow in the beginning with choppy story-telling, but it eventually picks up steam. The story is almost generic. It doesn't really bring anything new to the table at all. You've seen it before, a criminal organization that is working to proliferate nuclear weapons. Been there and done that, but all that is covered up with two sharp performances from Henry Cavill and Armie Hammer. Cavill is Napoleon Solo, who is a former thief, forced to work with the US and the CIA in order to escape jail time. He's got a lot of swagger and charm to him and is well dressed. Armie Hammer is Ilya Kuryakin who's a KGB agent with really bad anger management issues. Obviously these two would not get along, and when you force them to get along and work together for a higher purpose, fun oozes out of the big screen. Cavill and Hammer gives the film it's heart and it's very fun to see them play off another. Cavill nails his American accent very well, as displayed in Man of Steel, and Hammer surprisingly pulls off Russian accent as well. The cast is pretty much solid. I would have liked a little more development on the villains, they were a little weak, but for however much time they appeared on screen it worked for the most part. There is one particular sequence involving Sylvester Groth and Henry Cavill that was a little chilling to watch. We also get a nice small appearance from Hugh Grant. I also liked Alicia Vikander as Gaby, Ilya's love interest. Normally romance sub-plots don't interest me at all, but here I really liked her banter with Hammer's character. Should there be a sequel I'd like to see their relationship develop. I really liked that it wasn't over the top, but rather subtle. Guy Ritchie's trademark actions sequences are there. As expected they're pulled off with style and very fun to watch. The set pieces look great and the costumes looked very retro, it really gives off that 1960's vibe. It's great looking film, populated with some great looking actors. The usual convoluted espionage shenanigans are at play, in which we're not quite sure until the very end who's really on who's really good and who's really bad. But honestly, I didn't care that much, because it's more about the ride than the plot payoffs, so I guess in a way I'm complimenting Ritchie and his writing team for not taking it too seriously. I'd say this film is like a mixture of both James Bond and Mission: Impossible, it plays low key like most Bond movies, but it has that fun, not to be taken seriously, but somewhat seriously flavor like the Mission: Impossible films. The Man from U.N.C.L.E. is not a film we were asking for, it's not a film that we all expected, but it's a fun film that will pleasantly kill two hours of your time. 7.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Back to the Sixties (again)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie gets off to a slow start as the script gives a lot of exposition to establish that we are revisiting the 1960s and the Cold War. We are also treated to some back story on Solo and Kuryakin, making this feel like an 'Origins' story. The main plot, brazenly borrowed from THUNDERBALL, is about a SPECTRE-sized gang of (mostly Italian) criminals intent on stealing a nuclear weapon to sell on to the highest bidder. The mastermind, Victoria (Elizabeth Debicki), must be intended as a female Blofeld but the role is underwritten and underplayed and not different enough from the other female lead (Alicia Vikander) who seems to be working for both sides. There are confrontations and chases and even a torture scene (another borrowing from the 007 canon). The end suggests that this could be the beginning of a series, but I'm not holding my breath.As they did with Sherlock, Ritchie and his team have gone to great lengths to get the period flavour right, but the performances, especially from the ladies, are much too modern, and the clunky screenplay somehow keeps the movie in the wrong gear. The Austin Powers series did a better job of sending up the early Bond pictures; there's not much humour here. This remake has too much the feel of a 1960s TV series. If that was the intention, then they've got it pretty well right, but in the age of Iron Man and Jason Bourne, audiences surely expect a few more bangs for their buck.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't read the blurb about this movie so I was surprised when it was set in the 1960's-but not turned off-I thought it worked well and was a pretty good film. I don't feel like it was representational of an action comedy though-it was-at lest to me-more of a straight ahead action film. It was like a 007 movie really-as if they had used the 1960's Bond movies as a guide on how to make a decent film. Great shots of East Berlin that looked like the real thing circa 1960 something. I also saw the newest Mission Impossible movie recently which I thought was OK-but I think this film was the better of the two newer action flicks. Maybe the MI franchise is getting a bit old and people are ready for something different. I think this works to fill what has come to resemble a bit of a creative void where action films are concerned. I also think that rebooting the first Transporter movie is a joke. Its not like it is some 1950's classic cinema noir that has been begging to be remade for decades or something like that. Eight out of ten for this film-even if it was based on old Bond it is still classifiable as original work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>1963. After meeting each other with the wrong foot in play and tried to kill each other off while extracting Gaby Teller from East Berlin, criminal turned CIA agent Napoleon Solo and a KGB agent with serious rage issues Ilya Kuryakin get teamed up in pursuing the leads about Gaby's father, a nuclear scientist, who's gone missing, presumably kidnapped by Neo Nazi elements to force him to build an atomic bomb. They resolve to find an "uncle" Rudi to help them find him. The leads bring them to Alexander and Victoria Vinciguerra in Italy. Soon Ilya has to suppress his rage and accept being mugged so as to pass his cover smoothly, making him lose his father's watch to thugs. They then come to a party hosted by Victoria. Solo steals his invitation from a guy named Waverly, and charmed his way into talking with Victoria herself. On the other hand Ilya leaves the party suppressing his rage after being insulted by Rudi. But Ilya used the energy to instead develop photos from his spy-cam which captures traces of radiation, confirming Gaby's father is nearby.Based on that info, that night Ilya and Solo both break in to the Vinciguerra's factory. They team up eventually with Ilya breaking their way in and Solo cracking the factory's safe. But Solo missed out on the alarm which eventually sounds and they get busted. While escaping on a boat Solo gets thrown off. But he conveniently swims ashore and finds himself a cozy resting spot in a truck while Ilya tires off and gets his boat blown off. Solo rescues the drowning Ilya. Next Gaby meets Rudi and reveals she used Solo and Kury to track her father. Victoria drugged Solo and Rudi gets ready to torture him. But Ilya comes and rescues him. Solo and Ilya each receives a call from their own handlers instructing them to secure the bomb, the nuclear research files and kill their partner if necessary.Gaby is brought by Victoria and Alexander to an island where her father is working on the bomb. They then try to sneak away some bomb parts but Victoria catches them on it. Victoria kills him anyway after he finished the bomb.Ilya and Solo break into the island with the help from Waverly, who is actually a member of MI5. Solo finds Ilya's father's watch from a guard there. Alexander flees bringing Gaby with him while Victoria escapes the other way with a boat. Ilya and Solo chase after Alexander and eventually Ilya kills him. But they find the bomb he's carrying is a decoy. Solo remembers that the Vinciguerra has a fishing boat and they radio the boat. Solo manages to irritate Victoria long enough for the navy to track the boat and sends the decoy bomb on her. Ilya's handler calls him saying that Solo has the research disk. This enrages Ilya so he pays him a visit. But Solo gives the watch back to Ilya and they together burns the disk. Waverly informs them that team will stay under a new code name: U.N.C.L.E.The story is really serious and indeed worthy as a spy movie's plot, although the critical story elements are clearly predictable; manipulations, deception, and an evil plan involving the world's fate. The script on the other hand is a nice mix of splices of many things. We can see a significant amount of the director Guy Ritchie's signature comedic story developments, yet there's also the adequate amount of seriousness like found in spy thrillers like the Bourne and Jack Ryan movies. The sixties time frame and the dominant Italian background places this movie in a unique spot which makes it quite hard to compare with other spy movie franchises.The action still retains Guy Ritchie's perspective well enough, despite it being way toned down. The Guy Ritchie signature flow from a simple dialog to the characters suddenly springing into action with some added jokes is still very much detectable. I really enjoy how the movie starts and stops its sequences quite abruptly but without losing the suspense. The early chase sequence demonstrates this very well where the mood suddenly holds to a slow as the car hides in a parking spot, just so the action can resume some moments later.The comedy inserts is indeed funny. And again they're really blatantly Guy Ritchie-ish by being exploiting hard on the ironies the characters display. Two sequences that clearly demonstrate this are the time when Solo eats cozily while Ilya gets chased and shot at, and the time when the two men discuss things as Rudi burns up. The dialog jokes are also quite nice. Although for me it really felt like the dose is severely reduced as I anticipated Guy Ritchie's movies to be at least as funny as Snatch or at least Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels.The acting in overall is just a little bit above the standard. Henry Cavill id well enough in portraying a character with quite a complex background as a criminal recruited by the CIA. Yet it's also funny that he didn't even bother to explore and develop his own image for his character, for we can see he tried hard to insert a lot of Sean Connery's or Roger Moore's Bond mannerisms into his performance. Armie Hammer did also just enough for his role. He did well in creating an image for his character but his acting feels very flat with only rigid emotional variations depicted. Alicia Vikander did just enough as the movie's female angle to balance the story.A 7 out of 10 score goes out from me for The Man from U.N.C.L.E (2015). A recommendation goes out also, due to this movie being good and entertaining enough. It has quite a complete package for a spy movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Hey Gibbs, what did Ducky look like when he was young?" "Ilya Kuryakin."That's right, NCIS star David McCallum got his big break on a now almost- forgotten TV series from 1964 entitled The Man from U.N.C.L.E, a spy series with a twist: the two superpowers of the Cold War, the United States and Soviet Union, would have their agents work together to combat threats that affected them both.This film has KGB agent Ilya Kuryakin, now played by Arnie Hammer, at first at odds with CIA operative Napoleon Solo, played by Robert Vaughn in the original TV series but now played by Henry Cavill. In a pseudo-origin story, Kuryakin and Solo must learn to work together to stop a nuclear bomb, and the technology to easily make more, from getting into the hands of the wrong people.From a historical standpoint, the set designers should be proud of themselves for delivering a nearly seamless representation of 1962/3, with technology that is not nearly a stretch of the imagination to exist for the time period as, say, most of the 1940's tech in Captain America: The First Avenger.From an acting standpoint, the duo of Cavill and Hammer seems to have an almost perfect movie rapport. Cavill's Solo plays the cool under pressure, debonair know-it-all opposite Hammer's assassin trying to be a spy Kuryakin. Throw in Alicia Vikander as Gabby Teller, the glue that binds the two men together in common cause and keeps them on mission, and you have a great working team.Plot-wise? That's where it gets somewhat shaky. You get told who the people trying to make the nuclear bomb are (Teller's father is held hostage by them), but once you find out who the 'real' villains are, you feel like it was added on the last day of script writing when they suddenly realized 'Hey, who's behind the curtain, again?' However, the out-of-context clues laid throughout the film explained later Ocean's 11-style will keep you guessing who is loyal to who so the flimsy bits of the plot will be forgotten about.Finally, the music is something to be praised in this film. A simple mix of period songs and period-accurate big band inspired score gives the film a good pace and really conveys emotion well in key scenes.In short, if all you want is a true spy film that doesn't involve James Bond (although Ian Fleming, Bond's creator, helped create the original series) or Jason Bourne, filled with intrigue and subtle humor throughout, then this is the film for you.For those wanting a true tribute to the original TV series, be prepared to be disappointed. McCallum and Vaughn, sadly, do not even make a cameo...</fullReview>

I did not think I would love Mr Cavill in anything more than I did for Man of Steel, but he was so good in this. So good. But not just him, Armie blew my mind away too. They all played off so well off each other. They were funny,sexy... and the pace,the action. I think this is how I used to feel about the old Sean Connery 007 movies.The ladies were so wonderfully fresh. The villain perfect. I liked that I could not guess where the plot twists were going to end. Oh, did I mention that the music was awesome too. Especially that song that Mr. Cavill is listening to in that truck as he watches Armie being chased on the boat.I hope they do more. I hope to see them further blossom in their characters.

		<shortDescription>An exuberant and exciting spy caper.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Guy Ritchie doesn't do substance. But why bother with a silly little thing like that when you have style to spare. Much like Sherlock Holmes and the cockney-crime films that made him popular, Ritchie's throwback to sixties spy capers (this movie itself is a remake of a TV show from that era) has an energetic visual flair to lap up. Employing split screens, crash zooms, rotating cameras and a gorgeous soft-style lensing, cinematographer John Mathieson proves to be an ideal partner for the frenetic Ritchie, helping him capture the romanticism of Cold War espionage flicks. There are also a handful of exciting set pieces that are superbly choreographed and admirably executed; none better than the invigorating opening chase sequence where our leading trio cross paths for the first time. Balancing between endearing homage with tongue-in-cheek elements and suave thriller with flippant brutality, the zig-zagging tone somehow works too ? thanks to a lightness throughout ? although it's now understandable why this film was reportedly so hard to market. Undoubtedly the weakest element is the plot, which is entirely unoriginal and working on the surface level only, yet there's a silver lining: it forces the focus to shift from the narrative to the characters, and gosh darn it these covert agents are fun to hang out with. Henry Cavill is all cocky elegance as American smooth-talker Napoleon Solo, Armie Hammer is gruffly tender as stoic Russian bruiser Illya Kuryakin and Alicia Vikander is enthrallingly enigmatic as intelligent German beauty Gaby Teller. The seesawing tone may put off some, but the classy action and eminently watchable cast made this an immensely entertaining experience that ? with the door being left open for more ? will hopefully spawn a sequel or two.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Man From CreepyUncle.net is a spy film directed by Ritchie the Guy. If you expected this to be another mediocre, unoriginal spy film like I did... think again.Napoleon Solo, played by Henry Cavill, has the most bad-ass name for a film protagonist since Rocky Balboa. His performance is even better: a hilariously smug CIA agent who simply doesn't give a damn. His Roger- Moore-Sean-Connery-Bond-esc character makes a perfect partner for Armie Hammer's super serious KGB. Throw in Alicia Vikander's masculine mechanic, and Hugh Grant's not unfunny "well done chaps" Boss, and you've got an excellent cast.But it's Guy Ritchie's outstanding direction that really makes the film. It's stylish, fun, fun, stylish, fun, stylish, and reminds me of Edgar Wright (AKA The Greatest Director Who Ever Lived). Why the hell hasn't he directed a Bond film yet?! The score is also stylish, and great fun to listen to.The only real problem with this film is the plot. It doesn't make that much of a difference, as this is clearly an action based film, but the "we ned 2 get stop de misil or de wurld wil end!" motivation wasn't that original.Overall, The Man From Creep Uncle.net* is a fun and stylish spy film I recommend you see with your friends.*(I know I've already made that joke, but I'm so proud of it)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fast Paced Spy Story, That Relies Much On The Style Of Its Director</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the early 1960s, CIA agent Napoleon Solo and KGB operative Illya Kuryakin participate in a joint mission against a mysterious criminal organization, which is working to proliferate nuclear weapons.In a year with many spy, espionage films and many great adaptions on the classic genre, the premise of the Man From Uncle didn't really seem like anything new but with a director like Guy Ritchie who can inject life into an overused subject matter and a talented cast including Henry Cavill and the immensely talented Alicia Vikander this take seemed to be a thrilling one.With a opening that introduced the characters as well as sparked off the action, The Man From Uncle's sleek style and energy jolted onto the screen ready to leave its mark. Henry Cavill is perfect for his role as the highly skilled, suave and charismatic American agent "Napoleon Solo" who is an entertaining protagonist throughout. Alicia Vikander brings a likability and charm to the character of "Gaby" a mechanic with internal ties to the mysterious criminal organization. It is very entertaining to see the two play off one another and there comedic moments work best in the film. Guy Ritchie's unique style is always clever and it is extremely fun to see how scenes are resolved. Also the films soundtrack must be mentioned as it is one of the highlights, a perfect score and thematic sounds works brilliantly from scene to scene. However there is a lot that doesn't work for this feature including the horribly miscast Armie Hammer as KGB operative "Illya Kuryakin" his Russian accent and uptight domineer is hard to watch at times. Elizabeth Debicki is also miscast as lead antagonist "Victoria" she does not seem strong or villainous enough to be head of such an evil organization.Tonally this film is confused, it seems to be an action comedy for the most part but then at times it opts to have a more dramatic, darker tone and this just doesn't work in the long run. The way certain action sequences are captured by means of shaky cam really took away from the impact of some scenes and lowered the entertainment value as a whole.Overall despite some flaws I did enjoy The Man From Uncle, Guy Ritchie's style is unique and always fun to watch. I am going to give the Man From Uncle a 7.5/10.</fullReview>

Usually, the romance in spy movies are clich? and typical, but this was played out and unusual. It was refreshing to see more to the characters than some meat heads and a girl with nice legs. The plot was a tad confusing, but if they had gone into great detail, the movie would have run about two and a half hours. The characters could be developed more if this was turned into a series, but for one movie, they did quite well. All-in-all, I had great laughs and enjoyed my movie going experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stylish, Witty, Retro Fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Guy Ritchie's "The Man from U.N.C.L.E." is a fun, retro romp. It's a 1960s-style spy movie. The spies in this film are witty, smart, and impeccably dressed. Henry Cavill, as Napoleon Solo, and Armie Hammer, as Illya Kuryakin, are stunningly handsome men. I couldn't help, while watching this film, but compare them to the kind of schlubs who populate Jud Apatow movies. TMFU's emphasis is retro style. From tiny, miserable East German apartments that are on screen for only seconds, to the large, chunky, sixties jewelry, everything on screen is beautifully put together. For a film with so much style, there's heart, too. Illya Kuryakin really moved me. He has a tragic backstory. His father was exiled to a Siberian Gulag and his mother also misbehaved. Illya is huge and strong like bull. He's a stereotype of the superhuman Soviet man Americans had to confront during Cold-War-Era Olympics. He has trouble controlling his anger and his strength. When he's about to blow, the soundtrack plays marching sounds. It's effective.Henry Cavill as Napoleon Solo is the more cool and suave of the two. There's a breathtaking set piece where Solo confronts tragic disaster by calmly sampling, and then abandoning, a fortuitously discovered sandwich and bottle of wine. The plot is pretty conventional. Udo, a scientist from Nazi Germany (Christian Berkel, who played the "the Good German" ? an ethical doctor ? in "Downfall") has been recruited to make a nuclear bomb for some Italian fascist bad guys, the Vinciguerra family. His evil brother Rudi (Sylvester Groth) has also been recruited by the bad guys. Rudi was a torturing fiend under the Nazis. There is a torture scene and the movie licks its chops building suspense, leading the viewer to believe that there is going to be a really cruel, squirm- inducing scene served up, but the film surprises you. In general the film is much smarter, and much less violent, than many films of this genre, and I liked that a lot. The final action sequence is played to dramatic percussion. Overall the sound and music in the film are very effective. Elizabeth Debicki is icy and evil as Victoria Vinciguerra. I enjoyed this movie from start to finish. I liked its intelligence and style and I liked looking at two gorgeous male leads. TMFU has not done well at the box office. That's too bad. I think this movie may just be too stylish, too grown-up, for today's action audience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having seen the red carpet interview I was not impressed by the two lead actors who came across as 'Never studied the original 'The Man from U.N.C.L.E' (raise eyebrow!). For me that was already a thumbs down. So, settling down in my seat, the last words I spoke before the movie started was 'Be prepared to be disappointed'. Was I disappointed? Not really, I was however surprised by the overall presentation. The movie kept it's tempo of the 60's feel. Fast paced, smooth criminals fashionably dress and the acquired sense of humour only the British can grasp in an instant. The story takes us to the very beginning of how two agents, CIA agent Napoleon Solo and KGB agent Illya Kuryakin are forced to work on a joint mission against an International body moving some nuclear weapons. A fresh approach made to revive a golden oldie. Something that I remember from my childhood as a classy, appealing and intelligent TV show. I must say the original actors Robert Vaughan and David McCallum are a hard act to follow; bearing in mind Mission Impossible - Rogue Nation is still on the screens too. How will they move forward with this? I do believe a franchise is in the pipe line. Maybe they should consider 'The Girl From U.N.C.L.E?' It's a watchable movie. Oh!

		<shortDescription>What a year for Spy Movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having never seen a Guy Ritchie movie, I was very indifferent about seeing The Man from U.N.C.L.E. I knew that Ritchie has a very distinct style, but I had just never seen it in action. I do know that a lot of complaints of Guy Ritchie movies is that they are a lot more style over substance. This film is no exception. However, Ritchie's style is just so much fun to watch on screen that it adds The Man from U.N.C.L.E to the list of great spy movies released in 2015. While it may be overshadowed by movies like Mission Impossible, Kingsman, or the soon to be released Spectre, it is still a very enjoyable movie experience.The story is your basic Cold War, nuclear bomb threat plot where spies must infiltrate the enemy bases to try and disarm and destroy a bomb that has the intent on beginning a nuclear war. We've seen it plenty of times before in films such as Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol, but the execution in this film is so great it allows The Man from U.N.C.L.E to bring something fresh to the table while having a familiar plot.As for characters, I thought they were all great. Henry Cavill is very charismatic and fun to watch being the cocky American spy. Armie Hammer caught me off guard a little at first with his accent, but it grew on me and became enjoyable. Alicia Vikander, who I, like many, first took notice of in Ex Machina, was fantastic and should continue to be seeing great roles offered to her. The chemistry was great between the three and really propelled the movie going forward.Lastly, a mention must be made about the music. It was phenomenal. It gave the movie a throwback feel while simultaneously increasing tension and the viewer's interest. This came from Daniel Pemberton, a name I have never heard of but will begin to look forward to seeing in the future. Overall, The Man from U.N.C.L.E is a familiar espionage action- adventure story with a great cast, fantastic score, and enough unique style to differentiate it from similar films."These. Are. American. Made... And low-tech."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was a lot better than some of the reviews are giving it credit for, It was a fun classy throwback to the 60s spy craze TV shows but with modern sensibilities. It actually had a bit more of an " I Spy" (Culp/Cosby) feel to it with it's beautiful globetrotting scenery ,high fashion and beautiful architecture than it's namesake TV show. The 60s setting, scenery and fashion are like an extra character unto themselves. I thought both Cavill and Hammer were excellent in their respective roles and had good chemistry together. Cavill proves why he SHOULD have been the next James Bond. The film has a nice mix of comedy and action and witty one-liners,...while not being as hilarious as "Spy" or as much frenetic action as "MI Rogue Nation" it has an appropriate mix of both while still having it's own unique feel to it. While the film was not perfect,it had a few minor flaws ,such as a bit of a convoluted plot and weak villain, these are minor gripes and should hopefully be corrected if this does well enough to greenlight a sequel. I would really love to see these guys on future adventures now that we have their origins established. It is definitely worth your money to see it on the big screen and was a great way to spend a sweltering afternoon in the record breaking 115 degree Phoenix heat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A half-way decent tribute to a classic TV series.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, I love the way they kept it in the same setting as the original show: the 1960's. That's one of the reasons why CASINO ROYALE (Daniel Craig's debut as 007) was such a dismal failure with me. Instead of taking place at the tail end of the Cold War, Eon Productions set it in the present day!I also loved how they kept the ethnicities of the two main characters the same. Instead of, say, jazzing up Napoleon Solo the same ill- advised way Denzel Washington "jazzed up" Robert McCall in the latter's remake of THE EQUALIZER. Furthermore, this movie gave both of the main characters highly credible back-stories for the way they operated on behalf of their respective original employers (prior to their recruitment by the titular organization at the end of the movie). It also kept the comedy relief to a necessary minimum, instead of trying to exaggerate it, a la the campiness of the equally classic BATMAN series! English translation: no implausibly high-tech gadgets, then-20 years ahead of their time.But, I can sense what most of you reading this are thinking to yourselves: "If he loved it so much, why not ten stars?"Three reasons, actually. First of all; they could have had, at least, an uncredited cameo by the original Napoleon and Illyia (Robert Vaughn and David McCallum, respectively). If only as the CIA and KGB bosses of Messrs. Cavill and Hammer! Secondly; I half-expected Gabby Teller (Alicia Vikander) to turn out to be a surgically altered April Dancer! But, I was doomed to be disappointed in that regard,too. Last, but not least? It would have been the piece-de-resistance if the original TV theme song had been a bit more recognizable in the ending credits. Instead, I'll have to try to take a "quantum of solace" from the (admittedly clever) little in-joke the writers pulled with the name of one of the Italian henchmen.** "Napoleon Solo" was originally one of the ill-fated gangsters double- crossed by Gert Frobe in the 007 movie GOLDFINGER. While "Count Lippi" was the over-confident S.P.E.C.T.R.E. agent terminated with extreme prejudice by Luciana Paluzzi in the 007 movie THUNDERBALL.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Bland Story Saved by Intriguing Characters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stylish movies always pose the question, What is the value of style over substance? Some movies get ridiculed for it and others get praised ( Quentin Tarantino for instance). The director of The Man from U.N.C.L.E, Guy Ritchie is divisive in this argument due to his trademarked energetic style all his movies are marked by. One could argue though, that there (I'm one of those) is significant substance to warrant the blatant style in his best movies like Snatch. and Sherlock Holmes. So the real question is, where is the substance in The Man from U.N.C.L.E.? Characters. This film at its core is driven by a plot of an over told and bland spy story that is covered with effective and ineffective style, and ultra intriguing characters, namely The KGB stud Illya who is played shockingly well by Armie Hammer. One disturbed and complex look off of Mr. Hammer's face holds more depth and weight than the whole plot. The other characters are Solo, played also surprisingly well by Henry Cavill, and Alicia Vikander's Gaby. Vikander is what you would expect, a marvel. She made her name known by her brilliant portrayal of a robot that achieves AI (Artificial Intelligence) in Ex Machina, All three of these characters meet in the first few minutes. Solo goes to a garage in East Berlin, where Gaby is a car mechanic. Solo tells the story of her real father, a man forced against his will to build atomic bombs for the Nazi's. I won't get into the plot too much because how bland and conventional it turns out to be, but we have to hit this first twenty minutes because it is fantastic. In their attempt to get Gaby out of East Berlin they run into KGB's best Illya, and in a stunningly amazing set piece, Solo, Illya and Gaby play a cat and mouse game that is a brilliant intro to this film.Style. As said before, the first 20 minutes or so of The Man from UNCLE was such a great start, before getting bogged down by its familiar plot exercises. The real reason was because of Ritchie's incorporation of style into the action scenes that worked effectively.The problem with the style of the rest of the film was instead of laying off the gas slowly from what was shown in the beginning, Ritchie hits the gas and beats his style into the audience in a rather hit and miss way. Some scenes it worked, and some scenes it failed....miserably. Ritchie, probably recognizing the weakness of the story that he co-wrote, overcompensated at times with style that was so bold and gutsy that I applaud with chagrin in the same moment of feeling sick and overwhelmed.A place with a complete lack of substance was in the end, and the way it was told lacked creativity, which Ritchie lacks very rarely does. No spoilers so don't worry. In the end there is a scene that the fate of main characters is discussed over the phone, and Ritchie gives us information in an incorrect order to try and add weight to a 5 pound dumbbell. The misappropriation of story and the chopping up of a 5 minute scene and revealing it in that same 5 minutes was a poor attempt at clever story telling. Also, the conclusion and purpose of the phone call was an insult to the audience, and characters intelligence. You had a feeling with the whole ending Ritchie...struggled, and struggled to close it. The redeemable scene in the later parts was an effectively shot and built up (throughout the film) scene between the two lead male characters. The characters and their relationships for the most part, made up for the unimpressive ending, and the whole story in general.Humor. Guy Ritchie really knows how to make me laugh, UNCLE was hit and miss for me in that department. During a set piece where Solo, and Illya are getting chased by boat, Solo jumped off the boat and escapes rather easily while Illya keeps getting shot at for a few more minutes. Solo is eating and drinking with a front row seat. It was hilarious and in the end, a big scene for some character development. There's a couple other scenes with big laughs, but others that drop a bomb.The Man from U.N.C.L.E. tells a forgettable story, but gives us memorable characters. Ritchie hits and misses with style, humor and action set pieces, and straight up miss fires all together with the plot. The actors work hard, and mainly achieve at making up for this sin, with powerful acting and great chemistry. I'll see a sequel, if someone else writes the story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lack of Substance but Stylist and Fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warner Brothers clearly knows the success of Sherlock Holmes, Mission Impossible, James Bond series, recent outstanding performance of Fox's Kingsmen and Spy but with much competition of the same genre, they decide to surprise the audiences with this remake of the 1960's popular TV spy series. The film opens quite impressive with Impossible's style of action sequences between the two main protagonists which one of them is being featured as the villain. The first twisting part of the story line is predictable and it gets more thrilling when Director Guy Ritchie goes further to add twists and turns. The WWII setting is well designed and crafted, the humorous chemistry between Cavill and Hammer is promising, the scores by Daniel Pemberton that keeps pounding 60's style soundtracks match the film perfectly while the cinematography and editing have presented the extended climax creatively and fast- pacing. While the dialogues are not as intelligent as in Sherlock Holmes, the whole film is still fun, engaging and stylish to cover its lack of substance.</fullReview>

Lets be clear, The two main protagonists , Henry and Armie gave stellar performances with good support from Hugh and the young lady whose name I cant remember but the plot line was so hard to follow initially and getting used to an Illia kuryakin who was directed as a bit of a thug with a Napolion Solo who was clearly just as capable physically, was all a bit odd. I appreciate that It was never going to be a big screen version of the series but take a tip from Tom Cruise(Mission Impossible reboot) couldn't we at least have the music from time to time, lets face it , in the 'Lone Ranger' which I loved , it was definitely made more exciting by including the original TV theme at the appropriate moments as with MI 1,2,3,4&amp; now5. I understand that as a director Guy Richie has a style all his own but it owed more in this revamp to Michael Caines Harry Palmeresque spying world than to the much lighter definitely fictional world of U.N.C.L.E. (not Uncle) and T.H.R.U.S.H.(don't remember what that stood for but they were the baddies). I think the biggest problem was the attempt to say this was real spying during the cold war but the TV series never made any attempt at reality and thats what made it so much fun and I think this movie whilst the acting was great I doubt they had any fun making it and it wasn't much fun to watch, what a shame, what a waste of a great genre of non reality. I have had the release date on my calender for six months , my expectations were high with an excellent cast ,but I really was not expecting a remake of 'Funeral in Berlin' but thats what it felt like. Oh yes and my cinema marketing billed it as an action comedy. Trust me, all the funny line(yes I mean line, not lines) were in the trailer and that was it! I doubt it will run to a sequel or two but clearly that is the expectation from the ending.Not a chance unless they've already been canned.what a shame,I feel so let down.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice Trip Back to the 1960's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw "The Man From U.N.C.L.E.", starring Henry Cavill-Man of Steel, Immortals; Armie Hammer-The Lone Ranger_2013, The Social Network; Alicia Vikander-Ex Machina, Anna Karenina; Elizabeth Debicki-The Great Gatsby_2013, A Few Best Men and Hugh Grant-Cloud Atlas, Notting Hill.This is based on a 1960's TV series that ran from 1964-1968. I remember watching it vividly. I am a big fan of the spy genre with Bond, James Bond being my favorite. This version is directed by Guy Ritchie, who also directed the Robert Downey Jr Sherlock Holmes movies, RocknRolla and Snatch. This is an origin story that takes place before the actual formation of U.N.C.L.E. and shows how it came into existence in 1963. FYI:U.N.C.L.E. stands for United Network Command for Law and Enforcement. The movie takes place in the 60's, right after the Cuban missile crises and about 18 years after Hitler and WW2. You get to learn how Henry/Napoleon Solo is recruited by the C.I.A. and how Armie/Illya Kuryakin, a KGB agent, becomes his partner in trying to stop a threat to the whole world. Alicia plays the daughter of a scientist that the boys hope she will lead them to and Elizabeth is an arms dealer trying to sell a nuclear bomb. Hugh plays Mr Waverly, who helps form the future spy organization. It has a lot of the 60's atmosphere-clothes, cars, etc. and both Henry &amp; Armie do good jobs in their roles; you know how it usually is, they don't get along at first but soon are friends. As the end credits start, there are some files shown on the main characters, but there is nothing shown at the very end. Overall, I thought it was a nice little trip back to the 60's. It's rated "PG-13" for violence and sexual content-partial nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour &amp; 56 minutes. I liked it and would buy it on Blu-Ray.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was all it could be given that it's certificate was 12, however that isn't to say it would have benefited from it being given 15, this film might perhaps of lost it'self in the more provided freedom it may seem to have wanted, regardless this film was fast-paced from it's start to it's slightly abrupt end, most of the time.Elegance was not hidden, Vikander was remarkable and Cavill alongside Hammer set balance within the film, each carrying seemingly one half of each side, side being good/evil. They both carried somewhat of a neutral motion.A film such as this could perhaps be compared, in fashion to the likes of recently released on DVD, Kingsman: The Secret Service, had Kingsman been tamer, that is to say by a fair bit!The plot was as you imagined a film (a spy film) set in such a time- period would have, not to complex, a simple goal was to be achieved.But given the two main stars' characters circumstances, it becomes a little more extensive if even it not need be perhaps.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Crikey this film is awful! Stilted dialogue, clichéd set pieces etc etc Never have I seen two more wooden leads in a blockbuster movie. Both Cavill and Hammer are obviously struggling with their accents so much that they have to speak slowly. You can actually see them concentrating on their words. I swear I saw smoke coming from Cavill's ears one time.If they spoke at normal speed the film would be 30 minutes shorter (and better for it)PG13 would be a fair rating if the ratings were reversed, I.E. if no one over thirteen was supposed to watch it. 13 is in fact probably the ideal age to view this.The locations are beautiful and it is a visual treat, Alicia Vikander is good, but the plot is nonsense and, dear oh dear Henry and Armie are absolutely awful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie finds itself in the unique position of not fitting into the genre it was marketed for. I put this in the same category of "The Princess Bride." It was an unfortunate release in theaters because the marketing department did not know how to send this out to an audience that appreciates exceptional writing, smart acting, great directing, well crafted character development and a story that does not fit into a simple box of "Action" or "Drama" or "Comedy." The Man From U.N.C.L.E is truly a movie that plays to a full story experience. Characters start with depth and grow and progress. Comedy and whit take the place of bad acting. Exceptional writers and directors take the film to a level of making the audience think and become attached to these characters. I am sad it did not do well in the box office. I cannot say enough good about this film. I only hope this will find strong footing in the rental world to support a second movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As always, Ritchie cleverly subverts each set-piece, letting chase scenes unfold in carefully staged but enjoyably inventive ways, often putting the real action in the background while the characters act as if they're above all this nastiness. As popcorn entertainment, this is first-rate, with a cast that's more than up to the challenge. Cavill is particularly smooth, a Bond-style spy who seems unable to resist seducing every pretty woman he meets. Hammer's role is pricklier, since Illya never quite relaxes, although his petulance makes him just as likable. Their interplay is snappy and often very funny but, unlike Ritchie's similarly toned Sherlock Holmes movies, this strains to avoid being a bromance. Solo and Illya continue to spy on each other right to the end, maintaining their Cold War distance even as they team up to save the world.Even more oddly, Ritchie infuses the movie with a vague sense of the sexist and homophobic attitudes of the period, while the script never bothers to explore the tricky politics that drive the plot. The women may be fiercely strong-willed (both Vikander and Debicki are terrific), but they are essentially little more than a sexy distraction for two men who are perhaps too determined to prove their masculinity. Thankfully, the film is nearly bursting with style and wit, looking great as it continually makes us laugh. It may skim merrily along the surface like a cool speedboat on the Mediterranean, but the ride is so much fun that we don't mind switching off our brains for a couple of hours.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Long-awaited remake a disappointing waste of money and talent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the start, I had my doubts. Solo is an American but uses a very English phrase and an English word rather than the American equivalent. This is the kind of sign that a film has been made sloppily. The director is English and should have known better. The set up is not what I expected as a remake of the slick 1960s series that was so ahead of its time in all sorts of ways, but this is explained right at the end. But the movie is the damage done. None of the main three characters are in any way appealing and there is no tension between them at all due to lack of characterisation. One just doesn't care about them. The plot is absurd and very hard to follow (I didn't really care but as I had rented it for a fixed time from iTunes, I wanted to get my moneys worth and saw it through although I did stop and start a lot). Because the dialogue and action are so dull it would have seemed to long at 90 minutes but this turkey goes on for almost two hours. The introduction of Hugh Grant as Mr Waverly was the last straw. Don't they know he can only do drippy romcoms? And making him a Commander of Naval Intelligence as a nod to Commander Bond of Naval Intelligence, created by RNVR Commander Ian Fleming of Naval Intelligence, who also helped create the Man from UNCLE is just a bit of a stretch. And if he did hold that command, he would have been dressed in an RN Commander's uniform when aboard one of Her Msjesty's ships. Avoid this film at all costs. And the sequel!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The man from UNCLE is a film that definitely has the problem of putting style and glitz and glamor over the substance of the overall plot. The plot falls flat and is pretty boring. The style and the good looks is definitely hit spot on, but the plot is lacking. The acting is just kinda so so, nothing special. The characters are just alright at best as well. There really isn't anything all that special to see with this movie unfortunately. I really was expecting better, but the man from UNCLE just does not deliver, it falls pretty flat :/ Henry Cavill is nice to look at least. And as far as family friendliness goes, there is shots of shirtless men and a shot of a woman in her underwear after getting out of bed with a man. Not that much profanity, some mild language. There is action sequences/mild violence, not graphic at all, you might enjoy the action sequences, personally, they didn't impress me that much. 3/10 for the man from UNCLE.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A professional thief turned CIA agent teams up with KGB operative and mechanic named Gaby Teller to prevent a nuclear disaster.It's a cool action comedy spy film directed by Guy Ritchie, and co-written by Lionel Wigram with Ritchie, based on the 1964 television series. Set in 1963 it's plays as an origin story of sorts.As with recreating old London in Sherlock Holmes Ritchie here recreates the sixties with great nostalgic glasses aided by a score composed by Daniel Pemberton. Its packed with suave style, The Man from U.N.C.L.E. has a hi jinx cold war James Bond-esque story with charismatic stars, exciting set pieces and on point action, notable is the opening escape across the Berlin Wall. With a great supporting cast including Hugh Grant, oozing charisma and screen presence is Henry Cavill who is outstanding as Napoleon Solo, but Armie Hammer steals the show as the more developed character Illya Kuryakin.Even though it's arguably over longer, with slick direction, a spin on every spy trope and littered with East versus West gags, it is a piece of wonderful executed entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Man from U.N.C.L.E. is a movie released on 15 August 2015. It's a story happened in the 1960s during the Cold War period, Napoleon Solo, who is the agent from CIA, helps Gaby Teller defect to West Germany despite the intimidating opposition of KGB agent Illya Kuryakin successfully. Later, all three unexpectedly find they working together in a joint mission as a team to stop a private criminal organization by using Gaby's father's scientific expertise to construct their own nuclear weapon. Through clenched teeth and stylish poise, all three must find a way to cooperate to protect the world peace; even through they all have their own agendas. This movie shows the audiences that teamwork is necessary and important to get the mission successfully done; they all are indispensable to this mission. If any one of the three made any mistakes, the whole plan of stopping the private organization to drop the nuclear bomb would be ruined. Such as, without Gaby, both Solo and Illya would not find a way to get close to the private origination to get more information in order to make specific plans to stop everything. Without Solo's corporation, Gaby would be died at the beginning of the movie since she didn't have the ability to protect herself from the bad guys. Without Illya, when Solo made mistakes careless, the enemy would found them a long time ago. Only if they are consolidated and work as a team, the plans they made will have a huge chance to be well done. Teamwork is always important, it make impossible things become possible, and it also make things easier to do. The Man from U.N.C.L.E. is not only an action movie, it does teach the audience life experience.On the other hand, the movie shot in a wonderful good order, the whole thing is cohesive and efficient, the whole movie has no extra scene and the story is perfectly smooth. For example, without shooting the scene that Solo saved Gaby, they would not meet Illya and become a team to start planning to get into the private organization through Gaby. At the same time, Gaby changed the plan made with Solo and Illya earlier in order to earn the trust from the private organization. She decided to tells the enemy that her team is following her to find the place the organization products the bomb. This leads the story to Gaby gets into the place successfully and tries to convince her father to stop helping the organization doing bad things. All these connected scenes make the whole movie become smoother and more accurate when the movie expresses the story to the audiences. The Man from U.N.C.L.E. is a very meaningful movie not only because the positive message of the importance of teamwork, it passes to the audiences, also because it's concise and to the point, no wasting of any scenes in the movie. I do recommend to see it in the theater because it's worth it.</fullReview>

I thought it was going to be a regular spy movie with a hint of Mission Impossible here, James Bond there, and Jason Bourne in the middle. It was quite the opposite, which to me is what made it enjoyable. It had it's own style. Guy Ritchie put in some hilarious moments and very cool action scenes, all filmed very uniquely. The more I think about it after I saw it, the more I love it. I've listened to the soundtrack like crazy. There was some plot uneasiness, it was fast sometimes but maybe that adds a little reality to it. Henry Cavill and Armie Hammer were fantastic even though Armie's Russian accent was sometimes pretty rough. I don't know how he did as good as he did. They worked really well together.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tons of style with more story and character than you might expect.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To answer the elephant in the room, yes this is another super-spy movie, but no, it is not a ripoff of James Bond or Mission Impossible. Granted, the plot is pretty mainstream for a cold war spy film, but it has a very distinct feel thanks to Guy Ritchie's directing and the presences of multiple main characters. The forced friendship of Ilya Kuryakin and Napoleon Solo brings together a couple of very familiar cinematic elements in a new way.The characters' interaction is very prominent, though not very important in a plot sense. Right away, we can see that Ilya and Solo, while not polar opposites, are drastically different from each other. You might be right in saying that they wouldn't plausibly become friends, but they do go through some very rough situations together. I bought their friendship more than Ritchie's portrayal of Sherlock Holmes and John Watson (which obviously has similarities to UNCLE, but I won't bother with those). They share the role of main protagonist in a separate but equal manner, by which I mean that there aren't parallels between their situations (excluding the scene where they find each other's surveillance devices) or blatant moments where one repay's a debt to the other as in something like Book of Life or the Prestige. The climax of their alliance is pretty well done. Napoleon is more of a traditional suave spy type that has a degree of disrespect for authority. We see less of Ilya's past and relationship with his superiors, but he does have more emotional conflict than Napoleon with his relationship with Gaby and his nationalist anger. I really liked the way they presented how his anger escalated and how much it bothered him to not fight back in certain situations. Gaby Teller is developed a bit, though she is a superficial plot motivator for most of the movie, so having her go through a complete arc might have been too revealing in a plot sense. She's not the strongest of female roles, but has a respectable amount of personality, dignity, and importance. At first, I thought her synthesized accent might have reflected poorly on Alicia Vikander's acting, but when it was later revealed that she was meant to be German, British, and American, I realized that the rotation of accents might be intentional. Victoria is quite a formidable villain and has a stone-cold stage presence, and consequently very little personality. It's not an incredible antagonistic showing, but you certainly can't call it lame. The minor characters consist of Napoleon, Ilya, and Gaby's respective superiors, who I had a hard time keeping track of, along with Gaby's father and Uncle Rudi, who don't interact much with Gaby herself and serve more as plot catalysts than anything else. The plot is interesting in it's progression of what the protagonists, and therefore the audience, learn as the story goes on. The nuclear war plot basis isn't anything new, but tensions like in the cold war still exist today, so we keep making movies about it. The truth is, nuclear war could start at any moment, but I prefer not to think about that because it won't succeed in anything except making me paranoid. Anyways, the plot is motivated by the military tension between the second generation Nazi's and the collaborative CIA, KGB, and UNCLE. If you've seen Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes movies, you're at least somewhat familiar with his technique of only including certain parts of a scene, and then filling in the important stuff later. That technique is used around four times in UNCLE, which might be annoying to some people.As you probably noticed in whatever trailers you saw, this is a very stylistic film with a good deal of artsy camera-work. It all looks pretty cool in much the same way Tarantino movies do. The jazz score added a great mood to each scene and was spot on throughout. Most of the fight scenes are done pretty well, but there are a few times where the combat is a little difficult to follow. However, this does not apply to the various chase scenes where you know exactly what's going on. Despite how the characters' personalities might come off, they are acted pretty well on the whole. The quality of the script is more a matter of taste than anything else, so I won't give my judgement of that.I would definitely consider renting this if you like spy movies, action comedies, artsy movies, or "unlikely friendships". The trailer is a good representation of the final product, so that should be one of the biggest things you use to decide whether you want to see it. I can't say whether it's a good tribute to the TV show it's based off of, but I haven't heard any complaints that it isn't. As a final word of advice, it helps to have a general knowledge of post-WWII history going into it. Overall Rating: 8.3/10.</fullReview>

There's so much eye candy - Cavill, Hammer, Vikander and Debicki are exquisite specimens and they are convincing in their respective roles (especially Cavill, Hammer and Vikander).I enjoyed Guy Ritchie's direction. His creative style brings this spy movie to a new and superior level with a fast paced and layered approach that kept me interested and gave the audience credit that they would be able to keep up. Action scenes were cleverly edited; they were quick and clean. No shaky handy-cam shooting, yay! There were a few twists and turns that kept the audience guessing and the film, like the secret agents we've come to know over the years, had genuine class. True to the post-war 1960's time period, the film and its characters are not over the top, but measured and sophisticated. The film has a neat measure of humour delivered well by Hammer and Cavill with Hugh Grant in support.An very enjoyable cinematic experience! 7.5 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The man from U.N.C.L.E is a good movie to finish the summer, it has humour, action, espionage and a fine plot. This is no 007, neither Mission:impossible, neither Bourne nor Kingsmen. This is the good old classic spy movie where 2 spies, Russian and British, have to work together to save the nations from a world war 3.This movie takes place in the 60s but you won't see anything related to those times except in the beginning when they spend some time in Berlin. The movie focuses more in the relationship of the spies with each other and it brings some humour to that, they both have very different methods and are extremely different on their results. The girl is also important to the plot but she doesn't do anything as important as the other two.The villains aren't very interesting not are they dangerous, the only difficulty in the mission is the teamwork between both spies, it fails a little at being a classic Spy movie, but the method is almost the same. Spy goes to another country, infiltrates, Villain starts to show how evil he is, Romance and a lot of action in the end with a big chase and a shoot out.The plot gets really interesting at the beginning but later starts to get a little bit boring, with some spy movies clichés and predictable events, but yet the characters will make it more enjoyable. The characters are interesting in their own way, both actors play very nicely in their roles and Henry Cavill shows that he could be a good James Bond.It's very fun to watch and I'm sure you will enjoy this movie if you like spy movies, only remember that this is not the same as the rest, but a new take on spy movies.</fullReview>

Again, thanks to Ritchie, the two female leads were nice to watch, femme fatales with nice figures (unlike the drippy Maggie Gyllenhaal's, Kristen Stewart's, Kirsten Dunst's, Cameron Diaz's, kill me now Gwyneth Paltrow's, washed up Jennifer Aniston's, ugly as a horse Julia Roberts', I do like her as an actress but PLEASE make her wear bangs Amanda Seyfried's).Also, thank you Mr. Ritchie for putting in some male eye candy. The girl at the hotel who delivered champagne to Cavill's room? Hubba- hubba. One of the best bodies I have ever seen.The head Russian guy, Jared Harris, kept losing his Russian accent...lost a point for me.All in all, a very fun movie.

For the 21st century version however, we have Henry Cavill and Armie Hammer, who are both remarkably effective at communicating the initial distrust and then, later, grudging respect for each other. This central dynamic helps make the film never less than entertaining and several set pieces are memorable precisely due to the tensions and unexpected similarities between the two.In keeping with the Cold War setting, Ritchie recreates the 1960s with a nicely chosen soundtrack (Roberta Flack, Nina Simone) to a fun opening title sequence (reminiscent of Maurice Binder's titles for early James Bond films). However, just as in Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes pictures with Robert Downey Jr., he never truly captures the atmosphere of the sixties beyond the fashion of the period. Yet Ritchie demonstrates his ability to put together a very good action scene with Solo's extraction of Gaby from East Berlin at the start of the film. Ritchie though, does understand that it is the shifting relationships between these three which is the most engaging aspect of the film, with the character scenes being handled with a deft touch.Ritchie's visual pyrotechnics at times, such as the tiresome flashbacks and over-edited chases, keep interrupting the flow of a film whose script (by Ritchie and Lionel Wigram) is uneven to say the least. High comedy and grave seriousness alternate, not always comfortably, highlighted no more so than by the tonally misjudged torture scene of Napoleon Solo which ranges from the Holocaust to slapstick comedy.The cast though, can't be faulted, with Jared Harris, as Solo's controller, delivering a creditable Brooklyn accent, and Hugh Grant does his perfected debonair English gentleman impression. Alicia Vikander is fine, as is Elizabeth Debicki as the principle villain. With most of the film set in Italy, it looks, due to cinematographer John Mathieson, excellent, although some ugly digital inserts do mar the aesthetic."The Man from U.N.C.L.E." went through many production difficulties and permutations of director and cast (George Clooney and Tom Cruise were both cast at different points to play Napoleon Solo) and the sometimes generic plotting (particularly the climax) seem like below par Bond material. Ritchie, to his credit, does maintain an enjoyable style and it's a film easy on both eye and mind, even if it only ultimately makes a shallow impact.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Analogy Watched in a long time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If could I resist, you would be spared from following spoilers but I can't. Man from U.N.C.L.E. is the best analogy I have seen or read in some time, PERIOD. So, what do we have. We have a Post World War II scenario based on the same war. How? 1. We have major players, US of A, Russia, Britain and our beloved master-mind Nazi Germany. CHECK! 2. Germany creates the trouble. Here, we see them by getting hold of Mr. Teller, mastermind behind a better Nuclear weapon, with whom and his technology any country can become the most powerful country and they set out for attacking some place. Sounds similar, eh? CHECK! 3. US intervenes by taking charge of it. Here,US agent Solo helps a British counterpart assuming her to be someone 'normal'. Immediately faces difficulty from the Russian. US taking care of British with difficulties from Russians, CHECK! 4. Seeing the menace to be too big and bigger than their rivalry,they come together. Here, the same thing happens. CHECK! 5. Even though the alliance, American and Russian despise each other. BIG TIME CHECK! 6. Past two-third of the movie, we come to know Britain is the mastermind and used US and USSR. Past two-third of the European war, we see Britain's ass is saved by US and USSR. CHECK! 7. The movies said even though Russian(s) have the better technology, better prepared and may be better emotionally justified, its only the American(s) who at last seems to win.(Better emotionally justified = Germany attacking USSR). THIS HAPPENS TILL THIS DAY. CHECK CHECK! 8. But still here we have a trouble British is still in control of Germans. American + Russian = Save British. CHECK! 9. How the conflict resolves? You know the fate of Germany and the end of the second world war. (If you don't, why are you reading this?) CHECK!! 10. The film is not yet over but American, Russian and British are put into a team (quite forced and unexpected for US and USSR), U.N.C.L.E.. An organization, huh, do me a favor and remove C.L.E.. Thank you. 11. I didn't get it first and was gong to post as an ending for the post as something I didn't get, but your bad luck. The only thing was Russian-British love affair. It becomes clear at the end, when everything is over. In that scene Russian agent lets the British agent keep a ring saying, Keep it as a souvenir and I can keep track of you. Does the name, KIM PHILBY, ring some bell? DOUBLE CHECK!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>*****The Man from U.N.C.L.E movie is typical.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Great movie! Quite entertaining. Great scene where we have a very attractive actor proposing himself to his actress as her fiancé, and numerous times! Great characters! Another great scene where we have our brunette model driving off the ledge, in a truck, of the street onto a boat, CRUSHING IT, they both sink deep into the depths of the waters very late at night, only to have Mr. Solo rescue his work partner from drowning, risking his own life to save that of another. This all happened right after he had a picnic which included booze in his truck! The BEST scene though, BYFAR!, was when the beloved cute couple (chic woman &amp; handsome man) drive in between two houses, caught in midair, get stuck in a car in between two houses! SPECTACULAR! Credits GRANTED to the producers and film directors of this movie. The actors did okay. Great job! 10/10! 5 STARS and no rotten tomatoes!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An absolutely fun filled, funny, action packed film. We cant wait for the sequel and hope they make it into a movie series. Cavill and Guy Ritchie nailed Solo's cool and Hammer was funny but achingly hot as Kuryakin. The sixty costume designs on track and yummy, the action scenes fast and body achingly intense. James Bond, roll out of the way, the original spy boys are back. Fast, glib and sexy. If you loved the original series, you will laugh with joy at this new, artfully crafted version. A big nod to Ritchie's writing and direction. Trust me, go see this movie...it is, without a doubt, the ultimate definition of entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So Much Better Than I Expected!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to this movie not knowing anything about Guy Ritchie, other than he was once married to Madonna. But I had seen the original MAN FROM UNCLE on TV when I was six or seven, over forty years ago. You might say my expectations were pretty low. Well, I was blown away. The new MAN FROM U.N.C.L.E. is the funniest, sexiest, most action-packed spy thriller I've seen in at least twenty years. To tell the truth, even though Guy Ritchie is the director, it reminded me of a Quentin Tarantino film. And I mean that as the highest possible praise. The winning, charismatic performances, the dizzy, fast-paced action, the exquisite use of period music and clothing, all reminded me of Quentin Tarantino at his best. Now I will say that while Guy Ritchie directs brilliantly, turning routine chase and sex scenes into sad, funny, haunting routines that stick in your mind long after the movie is over, (that truck sinking under the water, that strange Italian song playing all the while) I was equally impressed with the cast he put together. Henry Cavill is so amazing as Napoleon Solo. I've been a fan of his ever since the dark days of THE TUDORS, where he played the put-upon nice guy forever reduced to groveling to spoiled-brat Henry VIII. Even then he had a natural charm and ease before the camera. In this film he turns it up about ten notches, creating a character as cool as Don Draper in MAD MEN, completely cynical yet underneath someone you can't help cheering for to the very end. Armie Hammer is soulful, menacing, and yet somehow screamingly funny as the conflicted, mournful KGB agent Ilya Kuragin. The thing about Armie is that he looks like a classic movie star -- a younger, tougher, Robert Redford. But what he puts across so effortlessly in his films is the little man's frustration, the classic slow-burn. (I first noticed this watching THE SOCIAL NETWORK.) Somehow this modern day golden- boy has mastered the dark arts of fat-slob comedians like Jackie Gleason and Rodney Dangerfield. Armie Hammer "gets it" that Ilya feels cheated, second-rate, just like the U.S.S.R. in competition with the U.S.A. And he connects the character with the guy who always get the shaft in every day life. The chemistry between slick manipulator Solo and bruised, tormented Ilya is really much too deep for a fun summer movie. The two of them remind me of odd-couple male pairs in classic literature, like sour Prince Andrey and sweet Pierre in WAR AND PEACE, or cold Woodrow Call and warm Gus McCrae in LONESOME DOVE. These two guys should make a dozen movies together!Alicia Verkandis is the only major cast member I wasn't a huge fan of going in. And she totally, totally blew me away. It's funny, when you look at her in still pictures she doesn't look all that pretty, just sort of dark, intelligent, and vibrant in a Natalie Portman sort of way. But when she takes on the role of Gaby she summons up the most devastating combination of innocence and sex appeal. It's like she has this incredible range, going from the coltish comedy of Audrey Hepburn at her most playful to the sultry, exotic allure of Penelope Cruz at her most deadly serious.Usually in spy thrillers the sex is either just to build up the male spy as a real man (blecch) or just to speed the plot along. But the romance between Ilya and Gaby is actually touching, and even dare I say it, romantic. Watching Armie Hammer and Alicia Verkandis dancing to "Cry to Me" by Solomon Burke was literally a breathtaking moment. I mean, I haven't seen a truly romantic sex scene in years! And the utter rightness of early Sixties soul, sung by a master, really sealed the deal. Now was there anything wrong with this movie? Anything I didn't like? Yes, but only in terms of wanting more. I wanted more classic soul on the soundtrack, more romance, and more Elizabeth Dabecki. I first noticed Elizabeth in THE GREAT GATSBY, and I knew she was going to be a sensational breakout star in the very near future. Here she is so over-the-top sexy as villainous Victoria, ice cold but steaming hot, refined but brutal, untouchable but irresistible. Everything she did was perfect, but I wanted more, much more for her to do. This whole movie was amazing!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Expanding the above alliteration... It is a suave, sophisticated Spy/Thriller with plenty of international espionage, not-so-high-speed car chases, action, subtle comedy, a not-so-innovative plot but a well executed project altogether. The certain parts with the noir-London feel were the highlight of the movie and I wish there were more of it. However there are parts when the only thing that would remind you that the movie is set in the 1960s is the costume donned by the characters. Henry Cavill's role resembles Neal Caffery's from White Collar. Guy Richie knows how to keep someone occupied with the numerous amount of puns. Bottom-line, I would highly recommend watching this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A chaotic mess but I have a feeling it will be a cult classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wasn't sure what to expect from The Man From UNCLE. I have only seen a few of Guy Ritchie's more mainstream films and I know he has a very select group of followers that adore his style. I don't hate remakes, in fact, I love if they can redo a classic idea again for a new audience. But there is one thing I absolutely hate and that is when they supposedly "remake" a movie that has very little in common with the original subject matter and it could have been anything. Guy Ritchie could have made this an original concept and very few people would have said "this reminds me of The Man From Uncle." It isn't a remake...it barely holds together other than their names and the tiny little Easter eggs hidden within. The movie is certainly stylish but I just don't get Ritchie's style I guess. Its not gritty...its sort of a splashy, vibrant James Bond style (which makes sense.) I loved that they kept it in the 1960's because that makes it stand apart from other espionage films right now. It isn't a comedy but has humour, it isn't action but has some, it isn't a romance but has some of that too...its hard to peg what they are trying to do with it. It just didn't have anything that really gripped my attention.I will say that I enjoyed the cast. Henry Cavill still desperately trying to find a place outside of Man of Steel (an over-hyped mess in its own right though he was great) plays Napoleon Solo and he is one suave super-spy. Cavill just oozes cool and he is a great character and gives a good performance. Its unfortunate that the film doesn't stand up to his performance. Armie Hammer is also very good as the stoic and hard KGB Agent Illya. Hammer and Cavill have decent chemistry and they are good opposites to each other. Alicia Vikander plays the mysterious Gaby and is very good in her role. She has great chemistry with Hammer and they're scenes together are a lot of fun. Elizabeth Debicki is our main villain and she is decent but a little over the top. She doesn't quite come across as perfectly evil and seems more campy than anything. Hugh Grant and Jared Harris have very small roles unfortunately because both are strong character actors with good roles that are underplayed.There is no doubt Guy Ritchie has a unique style but he is one of those directors that I think feels like he has to always have this flare that is blatant and in your face. There is nothing hiding the fact that the plot and story is overly complex, confusing and silly. It should have had far more focus on action rather than trying to be witty and stylish. I knew when I saw trailers and advertising for this film that it would be in trouble because it would appeal to a very small audience that really like Ritchie's style and the score on IMDb proves it because its decently high because movie fanatics write reviews and they like art and style but someone just looking for entertainment, will find this very loud and splashy but ultimately forgettable and unfulfilled. I suppose I was disappointed in some respects and yet I appreciate the characters and the fact that Cavill and Hammer did their own stunts and some of the cheeky comedy but the film doesn't work when all is said and done. Its an average entry that could have been done very differently. 6/10</fullReview>

The movie is said to recreate the 1960s,which were before my time. It did create a gorgeous fantasy world far nicer than our drab one.I think this movie is easily as good as kinsman or rogue nation, and it deserves to be a big hit.I am only slightly familiar with the TV series but it has been well served by this imaginative and quirky remake. I look forward to seeing how uncle develops, and if it matches the international unit from television.I would love to see a sequel or two and will be buying the bluray.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first thing that you feel when you watch this beauty of a flick is its rad score. So brilliant that you can't take your ears off it! It gives you a constant pleasure and reminds you of how a movie can be made into a complete package by doing every little part justice it deserves. Then comes its humour, which is strewn all across 2 hours of one helluva bad-ass plot. The rhythmic ups and downs of the spy storyline blended brilliantly by some top-notch Ritchie humour and some exceptional acting by the stellar cast are some of the things that make it thoroughly entertaining. Henry Cavill nails this movie by donning an exceptionally cool demeanor and gives Solo a gorgeous primping, quite James Bond-ish and we are talking Pierce here. His style is swift. His moves are written in elegance and he doesn't, at any point, lose it. On the other hand, we have Armie Hammer, another protagonist who just can't control his temper. He does a great job as Illya, and wears the Russian accent quite nicely. Alicia Vikander slithers her way like a pro into her Gaby character. She is charming and adorable.There is a constant cold war that reeks of dislike that goes on between the two spies that makes this movie constantly hilarious. It is great to see them pull each other's legs every now and then. There is a subtlety in the humour which makes it a complete laughter riot.The technology, since it was a period movie, brings out the best the two big superpowers had back then. They exploit it well too, and make you wonder how oblivious we are to the little stepping stones that our past paved for us.There are moments where Guy Ritchie loses his subtlety when he keeps showing flashbacks to prove his point. I think the public is smart enough to understand, and we could have lived without those evident explanations. Also, if we stand back and look at it from a distance, there is very limited action that mostly gets lost owing to Ritchie's banner like frames that keeps chipping the screen to depict different vantage. Other than that the movie is a complete adventurous and humorous package. We have an excellent franchise in the making. Giving you a heads up for an impending bad-ass series!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The 60's have stylish production, cool soundtracks and lots of sexual innuendos.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a throwback to classic spy thriller, The Man from U.N.C.L.E. spares no expense in producing incredible amount of flair. It's almost as though they took the cues from old James Bond flicks, then overdoses it with jazz and posh. At its core, the story is just slightly above average, but the production keeps the interest going and prevents it from getting stale.Henry Cavill plays as Solo, Napoleon, not Han. He's a United States spy tasked in securing a high value target Gaby (Alicia Vikander) in hope to gain information on his scientist father who allegedly finds a way to produce nuclear weapon. Along the way he must face and also inexplicably joins forces with Russian spy Illya (Armie Hammer). These colorful characters eventually banter their way through the movie.It resembles odd cop buddy premise a lot as the two spies understandably don't work nicely with each other. Although the plot doesn't have striking development, the two leads have chemistry and the movie relies on them to create humor. Both actors perform in light fashion, there are a couple heavy themes, yet it mostly plays around with comical stunts or verbal jabs between them.It has no shortage of retro music as they play almost every five minutes. The pop vibe is infectiously effective in creating merry spirit. While many thrillers opt for darker premise, the movie stays in the exuberant mood, literally throwing sexual puns, occasionally so bad they're good. Visual looks fitting for the era, though slightly embellished to emphasize the suave personalities.Honestly, it doesn't possess much depth or that shocking of a twist. What it does unabashedly well is presenting the characters in much charming and playful tone against the contrast of their hazardous mission, and it's enough to be delightfully enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I always like Guy Richie's movies. They belong to a different genre altogether called The Guy Richie genre. The Man from U.N.C.L.E is no different. After 4 years of break, Guy Richie comes with this fast paced, tongue in cheek humour action movie. Based on the TV series of the same name (which I have not seen at all), the movie is about 2 top agents of the CIA and KGB working together to solve a nuclear crisis. The storyline on the surface sounds very simple and repetitive. But the movie is beyond the story its about the narration, the crispy editing, the chemistry between Armie Hammer and Henry Cavill and above all the background score. Yes, the background score is so good and unusual, it makes most of the scenes look way better than they actually are. Classic songs from different languages have been added to perfection. The film is stylish, almost like a Bond movie with 2 lead actors and more humour. Old school, because of how it portrays the leading men: angry, headstrong and competitive.This movie seems to be a nice break for Henry Cavill after the very serious promos of 'Dawn of Justice'. Alicia Vikander is my new favorite lady, she is so beautiful!! Hugh Grant though having less screenspace is fun to watch. Elizabeth Debicki with her sexy accent and looks makes a very good villain. But Armie Hammer surprises everyone with his portrayal of the KGB agent Illya. He is so good, intense and innocent. The movie may have its flaws, but if you are a Guy Richie fan you are not disappointed. Even if you are looking for 2 hours of fun, you are not disappointed either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Without the Slightest Inspiration</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I never thought I'd do this, but here it goes: I didn't finish the movie, yet I'm writing a review. It was always against my policy to write a review if I didn't see an installment multiple times entirely. Here's my attempt to explain what's so bad about this movie.Let me first say that the overall production value is good, the coloring scheme, lenses, filters, that was all quite nice. At the same time, this is where the good parts end for me.The movie throws you back into the age of ultra-heroic spy-dom during the cold war. I've been told the movie was supposed to be campy just like many movies were in those days. However, campiness has been confused with corniness and bad jokes. Nor do I think any of the main actors cared. It's not the actors, it's the lack of direction, I'm sure of it.Two spies, one from the west and the other from mother Russia are forced to work together after having fought each other in the opening scenes. The result of their forced cooperation is that one tries to outwit the other through futile bickering. Just like Arnold Schwarznegger in the 80's flick Red Heat. "My gun is bigger than yours." Or something like that.Times sure have changed because nowadays our spies bicker whether a Dior dress goes with a Rabanne belt. I kid you not. An attempt to make them communicate like shopping girls ended up in a cringe-worthy performance. I think this scene has been created within the context of Hollywood's ongoing push for the gay agenda on top of attempts to emasculate the men by denying the differences of the genders. Clearly this part of the feminist lobby made it to Hollywood as well.From here on the movie overloads us with endless bickering between the formerly competing spies. It became clear quickly that this movie is as predictive as a movie can be. The fights ? la Matt Damon's Bourne franchise is glued together with cut-scenes, cam shakes and bad zooming, merely creating an illusion of capable fighting. But it's obvious to the viewer they don't know what they're doing. Car chases are like you'd expect them to be in a predictable movie, which includes driving the car in a too narrow street, only to be held back by the walls exactly where a window of a house aligns with the side window of the car so they can escape. And that's exactly how our hero American spy planned it off-course.The crooks and heroes are indistinguishable because the only requirement seems to be that the men need to look like dress-men. One is replaceable by the other - you won't even notice nor would you care. Not to mention the horrific attempts at speaking English with a Russian accent, or the attempts at speaking German, which produced a barely understandable Germanic gobbledygook from three thousand years ago. I don't mind a lack of pronunciation - who cares right? - but the scenes insisted on itself, and that makes it different. Also, miss Vikander's role is that of an (east) German decent, yet she is not required to speak English with a German accent; double standards and inconsistency right here, as with almost everything in the movie.After bickering scene #53 and smugness scene #78 I couldn't take it anymore and stopped watching. There's a market for this and I wish those viewers lots of fun, but those who read my reviews know it's not for me.I rated the movie only a few stars because I'm convinced the executive producer(s) and the director didn't even try. Enough money was thrown in to make it visually decent, but that alone doesn't work for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really like this movie, a lot.I watched this 3 times in 3 days for certainty - it makes the grade on all points.Actors, portrayals, cinematography, script (engaging, catchy, polished, et al.)all hold together and are of the first water. It is in some ways like a very, very good Bond film that doesn't waste production money on a B-52 dogfight over Central Park and CG destruction fantasies of the Upper East Side in the process.Perhaps relatively restrained by today's "Take, Burn, Sink or Destroy" standards but the solid basics established in this first film hold great promise for a much-hoped-for sequel.Best scene: Solo slowly falls asleep to the laced libations of the consummately evil Beauty - "Only my Mother calls me Napoleon" he says, as she stretches out like a lithe, gorgeous, sensuous cat on the sofa above him as he drifts away.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Henry Cavil is impressive - and funny.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If one is expecting a conventional kind of who-done-it or an updated version of the 1960s television series, then you will be surprised. Henry Cavil gives an incredibly strong performance as Napoleon Solo, in the process revealing an outstanding flare for comedy. He delivers one liner after one liner with a precision comparable to that of the best movie comedians. In addition, the movie has a good story which fits well with the characters. In some respects, the movie is similar to that of an early James Bond movie, which offered straightforward stories intermixed with clever dialog, all driven by the commanding presence of James Bond. Armie Hammer is excellent as Ilya. Fundamentally the movie is a prequel to the Man from Uncle story. Surprising is how Napoleon and Ilya wound up becoming a team and how the "bad guy" is not male but female (and, of course, as beautiful as she is sinister). This movie is entertaining and worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Way Spy Movies Used To Be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Very decent throwback and homage to the 1960s cool spy. Many complain about the lack of spectacular action sequences but they are missing the point. This is not supposed to be a modern blockbuster action thriller, but a stylish, tongue-in-cheek adventure.I had no problem with the casting of Cavill or Hammer in the two leads; they were perfectly appropriate. However, I thought the introduction of the Alicia Vikander spy character was forced and unnecessary and not keeping in the spirit of the original in which the ever changing female character was not a professional spy.Great care was taken to ensure that the 1960s was accurately represented except for the fact that no one smoked. In 1963, over 50% of the adult population smoked. But, I understand the reason for this seemingly glaring omission. And that aside, you really do feel as if you were transported back to the era of JFK's Camelot.The only othe flaws for me were the lack of a memorable central villain and the uderuse of Hugh Grant's Waverly.Anyone who wants to see a spy movie the way they used to be done back in that genre's 1960s heyday will not be disappointed. However those expecting a modern day balls to the wall action flick might be. Overall, I enjoyed one of my rare visits to the movie theater to see this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So fake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I though this would be an action-packed movie, one of those you just don't care whether things are possible or not. But after 15 minutes it was so fake, so boring, so unreal that I gave up. I confess I walked away. The agent is SO conspicuous to start with. Any stupid guard would be suspicious just at looking at the guy. You then get to a garage, some hot chick is under a car fixing it, and in an instant you get her trust. Hmm. And then you have some implacable persecutor, a classic car chase that looks more like a ballet.I guess making an action movie nowadays is getting rather difficult since it appears everything has already been invented and done. The most incredible stunts and the most unlikely as well. But the line to be crossed is exactly to make incredible things be plausible in the context of the movie and engage the audience. That did not happen with me here. It looked just like a 007 for the poor of mind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maybe it was my fault for not screening this movie enough but I couldn't even finish the movie. Walked right out in the middle of it. I was hoping for it to be "clean" because it's a movie based off of a TV show back in the '70s..although it doesn't show nudity or people actually having sex, the sexual innuendos leaves little to the imagination. All I wanted was an action packed movie. I was looking forward to two of the top spies from two different different countries working together but nope. I guess it's too much to ask for a movie with a straight on plot, without anyone having to sleep with people, or inappropriate sounds or jokes. JUST GIVE ME A MOVIE WITHOUT JUNK IN IT, PLEASE!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every aspect of this film failed. If I narrowed it down to one thing, it would be the writing. The most important part of a film was its downfall. To make matters worse the bad script was matched with bad acting. Not to say that I hate the actors themselves, but in this film they failed. I gave this film 3 stars because that is what it deserves, if that. If I could gain back any 2 hours of my life, it would be the 2 hours that I spent sat in front of the silver screen watching this sad excuse for a film. I spent time doing two things during this movie. Looking for a moment of comedic relief that was actually funny, and trying to figure out the plot as I watched. Afterwards when I read about it I learned what the movie had failed to show me, the plot.All in all, I believe this movie was awful and I do not recommend it, unless, you're looking for an easy nap.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film with all the life sucked out of it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Man from U.N.C.L.E." is someone's film, but alas, it is not mine. Somebody who feels the espionage genre is an underserved market - and, to their credit, they have great validity with that statement - may enjoy the film being that it's been a while since "A Most Wanted Man" was in theaters and there's still a few months before James Bond will return to multiplexes, but that target market shouldn't settle for this. This is one of the most boring and uninteresting action films I've seen in recent memory.To begin with, much like the 1960's Television show this is based off of, the plot takes place during the Cold War, focusing on the United Network Command for Law and Enforcement (U.N.C.L.E.). We follow agents Napoleon Solo (Henry Cavill) and Illya Kuryakin (Armie Hammer), who reluctantly team up to stop an international criminal organization led by the sultry Victoria Vinciguerra (Elizabeth Debicki), who's focus is on blurring the lines between nuclear weapons and the rapid advancement of technology. The only lead the two agents have is Gaby Teller (Alicia Vikander), the daughter of a German scientist, and the two, despite having animosity for one another, must work together to achieve some sort of formal lead before a nuclear attack is commissioned.This all sounds like rich, entertaining material, perhaps suited for a film with the prime focus of bringing comic-book pulpiness to life in an engaging and spirited manner. Yet, despite a cast that has proved themselves capable and Guy Ritchie, a director who has been behind the scenes of some seriously fun and interesting films, "The Man from U.N.C.L.E." still winds up being an incorrigible affair.For one, each actor here seems to have every shred of life and energy sucked out of them upon arrival onto the film's set. Characters, particularly the protagonists, Cavill and Hammer, speak with an unattractive coldness, rendering most of their dialog in a monotone state. This makes it next to impossible to find any involvement with these characters, especially when they can't give the audience a reason to care or get excited for them, given all the peril they face with their jobs. There's so desperately little development and thought given to them that they practically exist as suave, well-dressed robots, complete with Hugo Boss suits, perfectly combed hair, and Johnnie Walker Green Label always nearby, serving as their much-needed beverage.Once more, at just four minutes shy of two hours, "The Man from U.N.C.L.E." drearily plods from one lavish set-piece to another, only instead of engaging us, simply flashing the 1960's aesthetic to us in a lazy and unconvincing manner. The jazz music, the vehicles, and even the overall feel of the film simply come off as wholly inauthentic and tacky, and does nothing but turn the film into a scenery-chewing display of half-baked costumes and decorations.Finally, there's just the lack of investment in the story. This is another one of those films with a fairly basic story needlessly complicated by an overlong runtime, too many characters, most of whom undeveloped, and a frustrating focus on empty dialog and the driest possible humor. "The Man from U.N.C.L.E." doesn't always play to the conventions of a comedy, but when it does, it's sure to include corny, and often, unfunny circumstances and zingers in hopes to obtain a laugh amidst the poorly paced story and the almost equally uninteresting car chases.The film this so desperately seems to want to be, despite the relatively close release window, is "Kingsman: The Secret Service." However, where "Kingsman" was stylish and actually suave (rather than appearing so), "The Man from U.N.C.L.E." is the equivalent of a professional sports teams' equipment managers putting on the actual team's jerseys and saying, "come on, guys, we can do it!" in an encouraging manner, when really, not a clue is to be had amongst anyone in the locker-room.I conclude my review by coming full circle, reiterating my point that "The Man from U.N.C.L.E." is indeed someone's film, despite it doing very little for me other than inciting incredible boredom. With a series of talented actors exhibiting uninteresting, monotone performances, contrived aesthetics, and poor pacing and plot structure, even the neglected espionage fans should simply not settle for this mess.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Profoundly Bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rebecca: This is so bad it's almost good.Enid: This is so bad it's gone past good and back to bad again.Felt far more like a dumbed-down version of "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" (1969) than a remake of a 1960's secret agent show. Ill-conceived and poorly executed attempt to cash in once again on the pre-sold audience for anything "remotely" related to the U.N.C.L.E. franchise. Since the main appeal of the original 1960's television show was its campy take on the 60's secret agent craze, a direction that the James Bond films would not take for another ten years, viewers would expect a homage with more of the same. This would mean cheapo production design, unrealistic action sequences, and Napoleon Solo in lip lock with six different beautiful young actresses every thirty minutes. Unfortunately nobody associated with this production had much of a grasp on subtle or even unsubtle comedy and the thing is turned into an typical exercise in special effects excess and hyper-editing. Pretty much the opposite of everything that gave the original series its charm.The target for this box office disaster was ladies and pre-teen girls getting off on Superman/Clark Kent actor Henry Cavill; whose minimalist acting style (or perhaps absence of acting talent) make him a worthy successor to expression challenged Robert Vaughn's Napoleon Solo. But this is a prequel and we learn that the first time Napoleon and Illya operated as a team was in pre - U.N.C.L.E. days. Robert Redford reboot Armie Hammer painfully plays the blonde Russian. For obvious reasons Hammer has generally been the kiss of death for all movies in which he has appeared over the past ten years. A "Springtime for Hitler" sort of thing.In an effort to expand the target demographic the producers seem to have geared the promotional campaign around eye scorching Elizabeth Debicki who plays the bad girl. Those viewing the film for that reason will be somewhat disappointed. Although Debicki's performance is fine her screen time is brief and almost entirely in wide master shots. And while the promotional campaign sets you up for a decisive catfight sequence with the other actress (someone named Alicia Vikander); nothing happens between them. Despite all this Debicki easily wins the memorable character battle and you forget that Vikander and her tedious character were even in the film.Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK but the series was much better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not a bad film but in my opinion spoiled by the way Guy Richie usually spoils films. He made a pigs ear of the Sherlock Holmes movies and turned them into the usual 'too many car chases and not enough character' type of films. Henry Cavill is OK as Napolean Solo, although George Clooney would have been perfect. What he does lack is any belief that he could have carried out anything like this. There is a fine line between making it light humoured and going to far so that you can't believe him as a Spy, a line crossed a few times by Roger Moore's James Bond. I have herd that Henry Cavill is being touted as the next James Bond and I could see him carry this off without the awful directing of Guy Richie. Armie Hammer is a poor choice as Illya Kuryakin, he is too much like a blonde version of Henry Cavell. David McCallum got it spot on in the series. I never understand why they deviate from good TV series when they make modern movies about them. This has been done before, such as The Lone Ranger and it is really annoying. The only exception being the earlier Batman films which were better than the TV series. So this film is a watchable light action movie, but it isn't anything like the man From Uncle.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>( A little tough on the title there but hey, they're big guys they can take it. ) Imagine Ian Fleming (creator of James Bond for the newborns reading this) creating his James Bond books, back in the 60's. He's writing and getting more and more credits and success, so because back then everything was an upfront race, the 'Mericans had to came up with something. So, super mega MI5/6 agent was taken, then will make an 'Merican one and let's add a Russian one too just to stay ahead.This is a spring push before the real deal: Sam's Mendes and Daniel's Craig James Bond movie Spectre. Great choice for the Russian agent and kudos to Mr. Hugh Grant who embraced a real appearance, instead of the same British awkward, misguided, shy playboy that he was doing in almost all of his movies.Henry Cavill is there, but he is not 10% convincing he is playing a super agent. I would be down also if my character's name was Napoleon Solo. (WTF?) Make another Kal-El movie and you're set Mr. Cavill.The Russian agent you might recognize from The Network. One of the brothers who sued Mark Zuckerberg in the movie with the same name. Blond tall, blue eyed Armie Hammer delivers like a hammer stealing the show and although the movie has a very short sided story, it benefits from the master hand of Guy Ritchie.Mr. Ritchie can create a great London type atmosphere wherever he goes. Even in sunny 'bela Italia'. I'll give you that. Ohh? Mr. Ritchie, why every movie you make has to end with twist after twist after twist?? Is that like a trademark or something?Great wardrobe display, cool soundtrack (check it out) and almost a brilliant sound editing job. Especially when Illya ? the Russian agent ? gets infuriated. It is Guy Ritchie after all.The movie is worth seeing with a beer in front a some friends around.Quote:"Illya Kuryakin: I was briefed on your criminal career. Your balls are on the end of a very long leash, held by a very short man." ? cleverest line in the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Round of applause, KGB clap style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Summer 2015 may as well have begun with the cast of Hairspray serenading audiences with "Welcome to the Sixties". Released only a week after fellow 60s TV spy remake Mission: Impossible (what's next: Hawaii Five-O, starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt? Hmm - come to think of it...), you would imagine The Man from U.N.C.L.E. to have somewhat of an inferiority complex. However, 'inferiority' is not in the vocabulary of director Guy Ritchie, here releasing his first film since 2011's latest Sherlock Holmes adventure. And while Ritchie's The Man from U.N.C.L.E. may not be his strongest or flashiest work, it remains a sufficiently fun, funny, and confidently slick spy caper to confidently stand out amidst its glut of summer competition, sixties-inspired or otherwise.Ritchie seems to be channelling not only the aesthetic and vibe of the sixties, but, curiously, the sensibility as well. After the opening (fantastically energetic) car chase, which delivers all of the laughs, whip-pans, howling musical cues, eccentric subtitles and contour freeze-frames any Snatch or Sherlock fan could lust for, The Man from U.N.C.L.E. largely seems to forget it's purportedly a 'Guy Ritchie movie'. Instead, the film settles into a more jovial Cold War spy vibe instead, but with a whiff of uneasiness, as if Richie is weighing his options between pitching for more hard-edged political satire or the cartoony pastiche of X-Men: First Class, and landing somewhat clumsily in between. Despite the film's marketing, the dial is firmly set to 'spy' rather than action thriller here. There are none of Sherlock Holmes' slow-motion beatdowns here; fights are brief, unshowy and efficient, and generally used as backdrops for laughs above all else, of which there are plenty (Kuryakin's 'KGB clap' is perhaps the best such gag, though a later bit with an electric chair is a close second, while Solo's boat chase turned unexpected snack would give Pierce Brosnan straightening his tie during a tank chase a run for its money in suavity). There's a pre-climax car chase, but it's shot mostly in long shots framed by the landscape, and bereft of intensified continuity ? minimal bullets, but very Bullit. Even the customary climactic showdown is foregone in favour of a comically quick-and-neat 'death by missile', as if a snarky response to the complaints regarding the overly busy, repetitive mayhem of the showdowns of the average superhero blockbuster. Normally movies would boast 'this is not your parents' spy thriller'; here, Ritchie appears proud to deliver just that.None of this would be a problem ? indeed, it's rather terribly appropriate ? if the plot itself did more of the heavy lifting, as in most such spy capers. Instead, UNCLE's feels at once overly simplistic (find the bomb!) yet oddly intricate, cavorting around Europe and spontaneously forcing character confrontations in a slightly listless fashion. The film is too breezy in its execution to feel urgent, dragging in its second act sleuthing, and unassisted by its sole 'Guy Ritchie tic' of showing the outcome of a sequence followed by flashbacks showing the progression of events leading up to it, which is more laborious and clumsy than slick and snappy. The joy, as in its period counterparts, is in the peripherals. The 60s outfits are great (Kuryakin's disdainful fashion advice is one of the comedic high points of the film), while Ritchie appears to take his musical cues from Tarantino instead of his usual jukebox, flooding confrontations with jaunty Italian operas, pop tunes, and rousing Bolshevik chorus dirges alike, as if Sean Connery's 007 had slunk into La Dolce Vita. Ritchie's film may ramble more than his usual rapid-fire clockwork romps, but, like its decade of choice, it is too fun and cocky to give much of a damn.The film's cast is its biggest saving grace, none such big stars that the film is transformed into a vehicle for them (as would have been the case for initial star, Tom Cruise), and all the more immersive because of it. Henry Cavill and Armie Hammer make a supremely watchable double-act, tweaking their plucky Butch &amp; Sundance chemistry with the Cold War tension adding a welcome undercurrent of potentially being contracted to kill one another on a dime. Cavill's Napoleon Solo is suave wit personified, practically gliding across the screen, and evidencing the best comedy through enunciation since Christopher Walken without ever dropping an arched eyebrow. It's also noticeable how rare it is to see a Russian lead who is not a villain, sidekick, or otherwise pantomime, but this only makes Hammer's Illya Kuryakin more compelling. He nails the accent and one-liners, but also plays surprisingly raw, allowing glimpses of tenderness to flit across his professional detachment, and, bug-eyed, barely bottling up his fits of violent rage (so intense they conjure their own musical motif!). Alicia Vikander, completely unconvincing German accent notwithstanding, is appropriately sassy and charismatic as their reluctant insider, despite being slightly on autopilot for many of her 'I don't need your help! ' outbursts (this is easily forgiven by her hysterical drunken dancing, however). Finally, Hugh Grant is an extraneous but unexpectedly vivacious scene-stealer as the cheery, immaculately polite head of the British secret service, complicating international relations with all the subtlety of Inglourious Basterds.While a vaguely clumsy and safe film from a normally raucous director, The Man from U.N.C.L.E. still has charm and fun to spare, with the hugely enjoyable Cavill and Hammer and the always reliable Cold War politics and sixties kitsch keeping the film breezily watchable throughout. Should it build into a franchise, as it clearly intends to? Ultimately, this foundation may be a bit too flimsy to further ride on. Hollywood would be better off using that money towards a remake of one of the other most popular 60s programs - perhaps Bewitched, The Twilight Zone, or The Fugitive? Oh wait? -7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underrated; One of the Coolest Spy Films of 2015</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was born about twenty years too late for the original television show and knew absolutely nothing about it until Guy Ritchie directed an adaptation. Seriously, I grew up assuming for no particular reason that the show was science fiction and the titular character was an alien, as if UNCLE was a planet. I'm older and slightly less stupid now, and Ritchie has set me straight on the subject. THE MAN FROM U.N.C.L.E. is an origin tale, detailing the first mission to team Napoleon Solo and Ilya Kuryakin. As the movie opens, Solo (Henry Cavill) is on a mission for the CIA to extract an important asset from East Berlin while Kuryakin (Armie Hammer) has been assigned by the KGB to prevent it. We come to find out the CIA and KGB have a shared interest in this asset, Gaby Teller (Alicia Vikander), because her father is a nuclear scientist who has gone missing and both agencies believe she might be the sole person who can get in contact with him. It's feared that her father has fallen into the hands of a rogue Nazi cell operating in Europe with plans to create atomic weapons. Seeing as how the world is in the midst of the Cold War at this point, the timing really couldn't be worse. The United States and the Soviet Union reach an understanding and assign their two best men, Solo and Kuryakin, to travel with Gaby to Italy and use the connection to her infamous uncle to discover the location of her father and prevent the release of atomic tech into the wrong hands.I may not have known the show but I'm a sucker for a spy film, especially one set in the Cold War when the espionage game was at its finest. Combine that with a talented filmmaker with his own definitive style and I'm on board. THE MAN FROM U.N.C.L.E. is an incredibly stylish film, relishing in its period setting and harking back to the cool vibes of early Sean Connery era 007 films. The character of Solo is very much in the vein of Connery's James Bond; he's suave, handsome, a hit with the ladies, and unfazed by danger. Teaming him with Kuryakin is akin to teaming 007 with Red Grant for a common good. This movie is in no rush to get where it's going and I could see some complaining on how slow it feels. It's very chill, and it's during these "slow" moments when a lot of the best character moments occur. And there are plenty of them. No worries, the movie's got its share of action; there are three or so actual action sequences and each of them is pretty awesome (particularly the opening escape from East Berlin). And filling out the meat of the movie are those character moments. THE MAN FROM U.N.C.L.E. is another odd-couple sort of film, humorously playing on the uncomfortable nature of teaming an American with a Russian during the tensest point in history. Then we have poor Gaby stuck in the middle, dragged into it through her family connections and hoping to survive if the two assigned to protect her can stop bickering long enough to see the mission out.It's infinitely entertaining thanks to our three leads and how well they play off each other. I'm a fan of Armie Hammer, having been one of the few who appear to have enjoyed THE LONE RANGER. He's a talented guy, with his role as Kuryakin giving him a chance to handle some subtle comedy while still filling the role of the brute strength and rage. Cavill is way more entertaining here than he was as Zack Snyder's Superman. Honestly, I would rather he put his time into creating a trilogy of U.N.C.L.E. films with Ritchie than do another Superman film. He's allowed to have fun here and he's got the super-cool 60's secret agent vibe nailed. He may or may not ever get the chance to actually play 007 on film, but he's definitely shown he's capable (and then he wouldn't have to hide his accent). Rounding out our trio of heroes is Alicia Vikander as Gaby. Vikander blew me away in EX MACHINA and, as is the case with Cavill, now we get to see her let loose and have a little fun in her role. She brings some extra levity to this film and avoids falling into a rut as any sort of "damsel-in-distress". Gaby's got some hidden talents of her own. She spends most of her screen time with Hammer, as Kuryakin has been assigned to go undercover as her fiancé and oversee her attempt to contact her father, and the two of them have fantastic chemistry. Sprinkle in some Hugh Grant in a supporting role and a decent villainess in the form of Elizabeth Debicki and you've got a pretty sweet cast for your 60's spy caper.THE MAN FROM U.N.C.L.E. might not be the best spy film to be released in the onslaught of them in 2015 but I think it was severely underrated as a contender. I really enjoyed it and I'm finding that I like it a little bit more with every viewing. Cavill and Hammer are a fantastic team and this might be the closest Guy Ritchie will get to helming his own 007 film. I only hope I'm not alone in keeping my fingers crossed for future missions for the team, newly designated U.N.C.L.E.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never watched the original TV show and was only made aware that it existed just before watching the movie. Blessing or not I couldn't say, it can sometimes be the case that a re-imagining can severely let down the source material.To my knowledge, it sat well with critics of all ages so stands out as an all round good film. The acting was great, it's nice to see Henry Cavill doing more work other than Man of Steel - he's a great actor and played the part of Solo extremely well (albeit I'm not sure how closely to the source material). If he toned the silliness of the character down I could see him making a fairly decent Bond at some stage. Armie Hammer played the part of a communist era Russian perfectly and some of the little dialogues between him and Henry Cavill had me chuckling. The story, although generic wasn't the main draw here and the globe trotting nature added enough variation that at no point did it feel stale or bland. Overall, if you're looking for a funny, stylish and action packed film this evening I'd certainly say The man from U.N.C.L.E could fit the bill..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visually stunning, but lacking substance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"America teaming up with Russia. That doesn't sound very friendly." In-between his work with the Sherlock Holmes franchise, Guy Ritchie has decided to adapt The Man from U.N.C.L.E., a TV series that aired in the mid 60's during the height of the Cold War. In a year where we were already getting the releases of the James Bond and Mission Impossible franchises it was quite a risk and one that didn't pay off as well as it could have. In order for the film to stand out from these and other similar spy thrillers, Ritchie put the emphasis on the style giving the film a unique and cool 60's look. Unfortunately the film doesn't have the substance to go along with the style. There are not many thrills, the villains in this movie are forgettable, and the pacing at times becomes monotonous. The style however is so invigorating and cool that it deserves to be seen for its visual appeal alone. It doesn't hurt that you have the likes of Henry Cavill, Armie Hammer, and Alicia Vikander in the lead roles, all actors who undoubtedly benefit from the stylish fashion of the film. More mature audiences might enjoy the film for its nostalgic and retro value, but most were probably not around that time to be familiar with it. In order to stand out from other spy films it needed a unique approach, and that is what we get from Ritchie here, but at the same time it was also its downfall because the film became all about style leaving it with very little substance. The story takes place in the 60's during the Cold War as two secret agents are trying to locate the daughter of a German scientist in hopes of finding her father that has gone missing. CIA agent, Napoleon Solo (Henry Cavill) gets to her first at her garage shop in West Germany. Gaby Teller (Alicia Vikander) hasn't seen her father in decades, but Solo offers his help to get her out of the country and set up a meeting with her uncle so they can find him. He believes that the Nazi's are holding him captive and forcing him to build an atomic bomb. While they are trying to escape, Solo discovers he is being followed by a mysterious man who we soon discover is a KGB operative. Illya Kuryakin (Armie Hammer) tries to intercept them before they escape and the two turn out to be an equal match. Solo barely escapes with Gaby thanks to the help of his team who are awaiting them. Later on, he is being briefed by his superior, Sanders (Jared Harris) where he is informed that he is going to be teaming up with Illya to go to Rome with Gaby to search for clues of her father's whereabouts. Neither of the agents are pleased with having to work with one another after having nearly tried to kill each other, but that is where most of the fun comes from for the audience. It is basically the origin story of The Man From U.N.C.L.E. Thanks to its unique style the film stands out from other thrillers, but I'd still recommend Rogue Nation over this. The cast here is great and they have an incredible chemistry. The story borderlines on conventions since you have your typical buddy comedy where two opposite characters are forced together and a bromance ensues. The spy elements aren't very exciting here although there is one great action sequence involving a chase through an island in the final act of the film that looks stunning. The comedy works, but the thrills don't as much, so even Spy is a better bet in that department. The cast makes this a much more fun experience than it should've been. Cavill and Hammer play off each other extremely well. I still think Hammer is a talented actor, but he hasn't been able to prove himself after that stellar duo performance in The Social Network. Alicia Vikander is always a treat to watch and despite not getting to do much she always delivers her characteristic charm. If you want to see her in a better film than you need to see Ex-Machina. Hugh Grant also delivers quite a surprisingly charming supporting performance and there are a few twists in this film that kept me interested. Other than that this film is a bit forgettable but still an entertaining ride. Ritchie still hasn't been able to match the success of his earlier works, but he still delivers a unique visual style of his own.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An homage to spy films of the 1960's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know that this is T.V. show from the 60's, which I never actually saw. The film is part cold war thriller, and part action buddy comedy. Guy Ritchie does not just make action film, but he makes an action film with a 1960's style to it. I mean this feels like a Sean Connery/James Bond like film.A smooth talking American CIA agent(Henry Cavill) is forced to team up with rough on edge Russian KGB agent(Armie Hammer), the two agents who have different styles, must learn to work together, in hopes to prevent a global disaster, but the question is will they? Henry Cavill really is awesome, I feel he was doing a Roger Moore like performance, the cool under pressure spy, the way Moore played James Bond, and has a great American accent. And Armie Hammer is also awesome, I can tell he worked hard on his Russian accent, he worked hard to prefect it, so it would not sound fake. And he and Cavill have great chemistry, and I can tell by watching this, that they had a fun time working together. And Guy Ritchie has director is also awesome. I really enjoyed this, and wonder if there will be a sequel?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Man from... U.N.C.L.E. - the spy who might've loved me..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Guy Ritchie starts off with a wonderful, very highly stylized car chase. From that moment on I pinned my hopes that the whole film would be just as good as this sequence. It ends up turning into rather a bumpy ride between plot highs..and plot lows..making it an overall fun, but uneven film.Henry Cavill as 'Napoleon Solo' and Armie Hammer as 'Illya Kuryakin' are the dymanic spy duo coming from differing enemy camps ? Solo being from the CIA and Kuryakin respectively, the KGB, who must work together along with help from German/car whiz girl mechanic/possible double agent (maybe even triple we're not sure) 'Gaby Teller' (Alicia Vikander) to battle the forces of mysterious and evil criminal organization ? The Vinciguerra Empire ? a rogue Italian group of ex- Nazi loyalists ran by "Victoria Vinciguerra" (Elizabeth Delbecki) &amp; her husband "Alexander" (Luca Calvani). The goal is to uncover the plot to stop them from obtaining and detonating a nuclear bomb.Following a fairly standard formula for spy plots that involves good guys vs. bad guys to save the world, here Ritchie throws intrigue to the back burner and instead ramps up the charm and personality of his characters. Each one has their own unique set of traits which set them apart, yet it also brings them perfectly together to create the type of "spy team" with palpable chemistry that works all the way around and delivers to us a most entertaining ride.Add in the always witty and charming delivery of Hugh Grant, Jared Harris and Misha Kuznetsov in their respective roles as head of differing agencies and you can't beat the overall fun that they dish out. As with any film of this genre, my motto of 'your only as good as your villains' once again applies as I did find those being the only characters the lacking the charm and chemistry of their counterparts, though still stylish, just missing what is truly needed to a baddie, the ability to still like them even though they are the villains.Ending with the perfect setup for a sequel, I do hope the wonderful stylization remains as do the characters, though with a bit better plot and new villains as it could prove that a sequel might even turn out to be better than an original.Grade: C @pegsatthemovies peggyatthemovies.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Enjoyable Spy Thriller, but Nothing Groundbreaking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Guy Ritchie's adaptation of the Sixties TV series, The Man from U.N.C.L.E., is a slick spy thriller with all of the charm of the Sixties spy genre. While this film wont stand out from the pack of all the other similar films, it is an enjoyable time thanks to the chemistry of the leads. Henry Cavill portrays CIA agent, Napoleon Solo, who is forced to work with KGB agent, Ilya Kuryakin, played by Armie Hammer, in order to stop the production and sale of a nuclear bomb by a criminal group. There is a great rapport between Cavill and Hammer in their bickering that keeps it from ever feeling tiresome and always feeling light. Then there is the added layer brought to the proceedings by the third wheel of this crew, which is actress Alicia Vikander as Gaby, an East Berlin car mechanic who may be more than she seems. Vikander seems to be having just as much fun as the guys are in this film, which is very infectious for the audience. When you can tell the actors actually enjoyed their work, it's a lot easier for us to do so too. One person you can obviously tell enjoyed their work is Guy Ritchie. He directs the film in a highly stylized, pop art way that really hearkens back to the style of the Sixties, using visual cues like split screen and zooms to highlight the early Sixties period that the film takes place in.When all is said and done, The Man from U.N.C.L.E. does nothing new for the spy genre. It is like a run of the mill Bond caper from the same period in which this film is set, and yet the chemistry between the leads and the style and sheer coolness of the movie will keep you entertained throughout. I most definitely would like to see a sequel, perhaps with a little more stakes the next go around. Here's hoping this one is successful enough, because it would be a shame for a cast this enjoyable, being relegated to a one-off mission on the silver screen.I give The Man from U.N.C.L.E. a 9 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overall fun, but definitively more style than substance.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The whole set up is a little different than what I'm use to. The Guy Richie movie adaption based on a 60s TV show, spends a lot of time being cleaver, than it does focusing on a plot.I'm not at all familiar with the TV show, so I don't have that to compare it to, which might be a good thing. Armie Hammer and Henry Cavill were pretty bland together as two enemy agents force to work together. They did not have the same charisma filled trivial banter that made Robert Downey Jr and Jude law so great together in Richie's Sherlock Holmes movies. All Cavill and Hammer have are two really good looking faces, which would be fine I guess if I was into that, but these guys did a whole lot of nothing on the screen.Sometimes I felt it was trying too hard to be fun and playful, and do everything to be different from your typical spy movie (The character of Napoleon Solo, played by Cavill, was interesting).If you are fans of Richie's style than this movie is littered with it. Very retro in design.Overall, if feels like the first episode of a new series, and it gets some cool points for the 1960s tone of the whole thing, but all this more so covers up the fact that nothing is really going on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a horrible movie. Watched the TV series as a youth. Can't remember a single episode, but at least each one hour show made some sense. This movie has a hard to follow plot you soon won't understand or even care about. None of the characters have any chemistry to one another. I love Alicia Vikander, but her lines and acting are wasted here. Why does Ilia have to be her pretend husband, when Solo is right there masterminding their every move? Lots of plot elements that don't make for good story telling.Henry Cavill may look suave here, but never shows emotion, is always impeccably dressed, and his hair is never out of place. Arnie is a little better in his role, but there is just NO chemistry between them. The movie is obviously set up for sequels. Can't image this movie will make enough money to justify future stories.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Impossible Mission</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Guy Ritchie blows the cobwebs of the fondly remembered 1960s television series, The Man from UNCLE. Ritchie goes for an origins story which he hopes will reboot a new 1960s based action adventure franchise.Henry Cavill as Napoleon Solo, a former thief recruited by the CIA as an alternative to doing a long prison stretch. Armie Hammer is Russian spy Ilya Kuryakin a sullen communist with anger management issues and super human strength.In short the characters have departed from their television counterparts and have little in common with the characters played by Robert Vaughan and David McCallum.Solo is sent on a mission in Berlin to seek out the daughter of a nuclear scientist who has disappeared. He is first pursued by Kuryakin but later in order to prevent nuclear disaster both have been ordered to team up and work together which they do reluctantly.The film is stylish but the plot is bland, dull and derivative. Even the premise of a wisecracking American agent teaming up with a humourless brute from the other side of the Iron Curtain was done better in Red Heat in 1988.This film aspires to be a rebooted Roger Moore era James Bond set in the 1960s. It comes across as a second rate spy caper with stiff actors showing little charisma. It has so little to do with the television series that spawned this, they really should had taken a cue from the Tom Cruise Mission Impossible series and set out its own path from the basic ingredients of the small screen series.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Meh</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Can we stop this foolishness of hiring British or Australian actors to play Americans? Yeah, Henry Cavill does a decent American accent but you know, if you hired an American actor, he wouldn't do a "decent" accent, he'd just talk. Army Hammer's "Russian" accent wasn't bad, but it sure detracted from the character. A little less would have been more. Maybe watching David McCallum do the original might have helped. We really do have enough good actors to fill these slots... Now, as for the movie... It was pretty good; the back story wasn't all that believable, but being a period piece I guess they're allowed to take some liberties. Illya Kuryakin was a more likable character than Napoleon Solo-- just the opposite of the TV show--but overall, a decent attempt. By the way, how tall is Henry Cavill? 5'4"?? So hard to buy him in anything like this or Superman when he looks as if he's staring everybody in the chest. And while I'm at it, could we please stop casting Americans to play Brits and Aussies? Robert Downey, Jr.; Johnny Depp; Meryl Streep... Come on... knock it off...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ritchie's bizarre directorial choices and Cavill's blatant Bond audition take away from what is otherwise a fun spy romp</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At several points, The Man from U.N.C.L.E. is its own worst enemy. For a film that had every right to try and stand on its own merits, Cavill holds it back and uses it as his audition to play James Bond. He is aided and abetted in this task by Guy Ritchie, who ensures his film contains everything a Bond film should contain. Whilst The Man from U.N.C.L.E. is far from a bad movie, those scenes take me out of the movie I was enjoying and I mutter "oh great, here we go again."The Man from U.N.C.L.E. stars Henry Cavill and Armie Hammer as a pair of spies from the USA and USSR who must work together to defeat a common (Nazi) enemy. Of the two, Hammer is far superior - his Russian accent is commendable, he has incredible chemistry with Alicia Vikander, and I always bought the little mannerisms Hammer brought to his rage-filled character. His hand trembles and clenches into a fist, while his face muscles fight furiously to keep a calm demeanour. Its very subtle yet surprisingly open at the same time, and Hammer is awesome in the action scenes as well. Cavill has an amazing debut scene during which he excavates Vikander from East Berlin, but beyond that he gets very jarring. His American accent is so jarringly fake that it sounds he should be voicing GI Joe in an animated cartoon, not a big screen spy. At several points, the accent is dropped whenever Cavill's character is required to show emotion beyond "charming indifference". In stark contrast with Vikander and Hammer, who maintain their accents despite acting their hearts out, Cavill is the weakest asset of the film.The other two primary characters are Alicia Vikander as a German asset and Elizabeth Debecki as the film's antagonist. These two could turn a gay man straight. Vikander strikes an incredibly difficult balance between adorable and sensual - she could seduce you with a slight look in one scene and make you want to tuck her into bed protectively in another. Her chemistry with Hammer is off the charts - see in particular one incredible dance/fight scene in their bedroom. She's helped by the goofily retro costumes Joanna Johnston gives her - big glasses, flashy colours - but its her incredible talent more than anything else. She dances around without a trace of self-consciousness but in the heavier moments she displays acting chops on par with some of the best actresses alive. Elizabeth Debecki's character is slightly thin, but she has the bearing of a queen and as she waltzes gracefully throughout the movie she makes herself memorable nonetheless. Hugh Grant is shamelessly wasted in a small part.Guy Ritchie's fingerprints are all over this movie - revelatory flashbacks, plot twists, banter. As an enormous fan of Sherlock Holmes, I like Ritchie's style - but in this film it becomes a little too much. In the final sequence, we get dozens of flash back scenes for stuff we just saw three minutes earlier. It definitely worked as a dramatic reveal and wasn't impossible to follow, but its extremely jarring and could have been simplified down. There's also a gross misfire in a scene during which British troops storm an island base - Ritchie splits the screen up into about 5 sections and the images change around like its the opening credits of Community. Its almost impossible to enjoy the action going on on screen, its painful to the eyes. Ritchie also makes the bizarre choice to mute the sound effects and dialogue in places to almost inaudible or just like its being listened to through dry wall. I don't know what effect he was going for, but it didn't pay off. I enjoyed watching The Man from U.N.C.L.E. quite a bit, but its nowhere near as good as Mission Impossible, Kingsman or Spy. Ritchie's bizarre directorial choices and Cavill's blatant Bond audition take away from what is otherwise a fun spy romp. As the sum of all its parts, it works on all forms (except Cavill) but I won't go around saying its a beautifully made film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The humour is dry, subtly shaken then stirred. The plot, pacing and character progression are as faithful as they can be while still taking itself seriously enough to laugh at origins. An homage to the period of the film just about everything is a parody or a shout out to 1960's espionage series of it's time.. I have found many people going out of their way to try and brand this flick as a serious period film. To do so is to rob yourself of the hundreds of easter eggs planted liberally in every scene.With that said; It is a fine film indeed.The soundtrack was fantastic and the score faithfully carries our heroes from adventure to adventure while maintaining its distance enough so this odd couple can banter freely.</fullReview>

I got really excited during the first ten minutes, which were amazing and thought that maybe the people that made this reboot knew enough to make it right rather than the dismal boring formula of the TV series. Unfortunately, I was wrong. The first ten minutes were the only good part of this movie. After that, it quickly descended into mediocrity at best.Its still on as I write this review and I lost interest in it nearly an hour ago. Do yourself a favor, watch the first 10 minutes, then watch grass grow, which will be far more exciting than the remainder of this movie.</fullReview>

They also teamed with a British agent(Alicia Vikander) who was also in Germany. They go to Rome, Italy to infiltrate and get information on a nuclear warhead. Gaby played both men to get to her father, However, the man she helped fix the race car, ended up turning on her along with the wife(Elizabeth Debicki) whom Solo spent time with. The action was great. Everything was just like the original show. Old school. I have seen, S.W.A.T., and other TV show that went on the big screen. It was in my opinion an improvement from "The Avengers" , another Warner Bros. movie. Whether I've seen the show or not, it's still good. 2.5 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

This trio of actors is simply excellent and each plays a role out of their 'depth,' with added accents, and a comedic twist. Yes, Armie Hammer was funny in "The Lone Ranger,' but here he shows us he can act! And Hugh Grants limited scenes still impact the movie in a very positive way. The chase scenes are intense, the rivalry is realistic, the bonding is believable, the characters remain human despite the extraordinary circumstances they find themselves in.

		<fullReview>Just viewed this abortion...wish a vote of zero or even negative stars was possible. I was a child in the 60's and as such appreciated some of the period detail...that being said I would have rather had less attention to period detail if more emphasis could have been placed on developing a plot, making you care about the characters, and making the viewer even want to stay in the seat to the end of the movie. This was an utter snooze-fest..according to IMDb's own trivia entries, at times the actors actually ad libbed their dialogue...and boy does it show. Its not the best publicity for your movie when your actors inadvertently admit that its just a paycheck to them (only one of them even bothered to watch the original series to begin with.) Makes you wonder if Guy Ritchie just pulled the name out his ass... or heard about a TV show from the 60's called The Man From UNCLE and thought "Yeah, I can do that. It was a much simpler time and audiences were easily entertained back then." The concepts from the TV show are not a hindrance to your movie making, they are the reason the audience fills the seats because they are hoping to have a real connection to what made the TV show great, not just in name only. Distracting ridiculous accents, dull dialogue...accents that make it hard to understand what is being said even if you did care... this seems like a rush job to get any piece of crap into theaters in the hopes of capitalizing on name recognition. Younger audiences will not connect and might on some level appreciate the humor that is few and far between, older audiences will bemoan the fact that everything that was good about the series was jettisoned. Don't waste your time. I enjoy Guy Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes movies, and that's what made me even consider watching this in the first place. This dog better be followed by a much better effort as an apology to moviegoers. Armie...Lone Ranger sucked and you did yourself no favors with this one...might wanna consider hitting reset.</fullReview>

Napoleon Solo (to Kuryakin) The buddy adventure, so masterfully done in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, is not so successful in director Guy Ritchie's The Man from U.N.C.L.E. Although the director watched Butch for inspiration, he needed more than script?he needed the actors to carry off the witty sarcasm of Robert Vaughan and David McCallum from the original '60's TV series. The subtlety mentioned in the above quote is almost completely absent.The Man is the origin story for the TV program. Unfortunately Henry Cavill as Napoleon Solo is no Vaughan?he preens more like Superman on a fashion runway and labors to toss off lines like Sean Connery, or even Roger Moore, did in the Bond series. No better is Armie Hammer as Ilya Kuryakin, a boyishly handsome actor who seems to force out his Russian accent and acerbic comments. That Cavill comes from playing Superman and Hammer from The Lone Ranger may explain their wooden portrayals here. Besides, neither one was first choice for his role here, and it shows.The plot is familiar to anyone in our culture who has seen a fantasy thriller involving spies and megalomaniacs?in this case the boys need to capture a nuclear bomb from the hands of some bad international maniacs. Yet, the film relies not so much on an intricate plot as it does the give and take among the characters. While there are some solid exchanges, most of the time it all is lame.
