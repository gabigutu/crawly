		<shortDescription>An incredibly intense thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fede Alvarez just gave Green Room a run for its money with Don't Breathe, an incredibly intense film and glorious exercise in suspense. It's one of the best studio-produced thrillers I've seen in years. The premise is simple: A group of teens plans to break into a blind man's house to steal his money. Only thing, the old man is more adept than they realize. While the setup is a little too pedestrian, albeit economical, once the story gets rolling, the film doesn't let up, running at a lean 88 minutes. Other than that, Don't Breathe is best viewed going in knowing as little as possible.This is Alvarez's first film in three years since his violent and solid remake of Evil Dead, and it is with this sophomoric debut that solidifies the genre filmmaker as someone with obvious talent. Inspirations are drawn from the best - Hitchcock, Fincher, and Wait Until Dark are a few - but Alvarez provides his own unique vision that truly makes the film his own. Like the masters before him, Don't Breathe is purely cinematic, relying less on dialogue and more on visual storytelling and sound to drive the film. The cinematography is amazing as well as the creative sound design, so much so they are characters within the film themselves.The cast, while small, is great too, including Jane Levy, who can pretty much be titled this generation's scream queen after this and Evil Dead. Dylan Minnette is good in his role as well, providing enough sympathy for his character. Both young actors are put through hell, and their physical performances sell their tumultuous ordeal convincingly. However, it is Stephen Lang who is the film's shining beacon. As the antagonist, Lang is instantly memorable and frightening, an intimidating force that permeates throughout the film even in scenes without his presence.If there's one gripe about the film, there's a plot twist that doesn't quite work, but that itself is a minor complaint compared to the many things the film gets right and does so well. I won't say more. Don't Breathe is a technical achievement, the rare studio film that actually pushes what film can do as a medium. However, like with Green Room, try not to get caught up in the hype, even with my glowing review. Set your expectations appropriately, and remember to avoid watching the trailer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unstoppable tension</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After Evil Dead's well-made remake, a lot of us felt that Fede Alvarez was a director to watch. With Don't Breathe, he definitely became a director I'm very excited to see future projects from.I admire his knack to generate tension. After the film kicks off, there is really no stopping. It became almost unbearable at the end, nearly reaching the point of overkill. When you have a thriller filled with so much tension throughout its running time, there's only so much you can do before you start yelling "you gotta be kidding me" at the screen.The cinematography was beautiful and moody and the performances were fine, except maybe Jane Levy, who I felt was too wooden, making her character a little bit unlikable.Don't Breathe was a solid effort and a great addition to the home invasion genre with a little twist.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Many gripping moments,but a bit stretched. Classic nonetheless.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is a low budget movie but will surely have commercial success thanks to the direction and screenplay. The movie is mostly positive. There are several thrilling moments. The direction is awesome, the story line is brilliant, the script and the overall make is very good. Everyone has acted well. The setup is scary. The background score also adds to the tense moments. One of the scenes is inspired from the old classic 'Wait until Dark'. The story should have ended 15 minutes earlier, but it continues. Overall, a thumbs up. Watch this movie. Don't bring kids under 16 to the movie theater. There are some scenes that you don't want the kids to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Helmed by Fede Alvarez known for his work on Evil Dead. Don't Breathe is a pleasant surprise, As it doesn't rely on cheap thrills to keep you occupied, Instead the story arc slowly but firmly builds up the tension, enough so, That you become invested in the characters. Rocky decides to move to a new town in hope of a new start but she lacks the resources needed to stay at a new home. So short on time and money she agrees to a seemingly simple job, where they intend to pray on a helpless blind man. However there dream quickly escalates into a nightmare. What separates this from most horror films is; This movie doesn't have a moral compass, Our so called heroes could be seen as the villains just as well, however the punishment they receive is far more cruel then the one they deserve. If you are a fan of horror flicks, Then this is definitely up your alley. As the tension will keep you at the edge of your seat. As for the actors, Stephen Lang stands out as the villain. As his antagonistic nature proves to be a force to be reckoned with.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blind , strong, Life for Life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't Breathe. Excellent title for movie directed by Fede Alvarez. After watching preview, this movie was on my must see list. Extremely well directed. The blind man, played superbly by Stephen Lang, lives alone with his ferocious looking, big , black dog in a shabby neighborhood house in Michigan. 3 young people, Jane Levy as Rocky, her boyfriend Daniel Zovatto as Money and Dylan Minnette as Alex want to get rich the quick way - by robbing. The blind man , a war veteran, came into lot of money after his daughter's death in a car accident. The 3 potential robbers go to the blind man's house for the money and then come to know about his blindness. Expecting no fight, the three enter his house and from then on, starts the horrible night events. The blind man knows how to live his lonely life despite daughter's accident and knows how to have a happy future. The blind man believes in life for life. Terrific movie. Extremely well directed. Terrific acting by Stephen Lang and Jane Levy. I am not a dog lover and the dog in the movie did a good , ferocious, vicious animal role part very well. excellent cinematography. Good Editing. Overall , a very good scary movie. Do not underestimate a war vet. I enjoyed every scene in the movie. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intense, Thinking Person's Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is so much to be said about this movie, more than I can say within the confines of the word limit. I am a lifelong die-hard thriller and horror fan, and this one ranks in my top 5. This is a very intense, morally complex, thinking person's thriller/horror. It takes it's time in building up with looming suspense, and then once the terror begins, it is unrelenting until the very end. This is a unique scary movie, in that for the longest time, it's very hard to know who, if anybody, to root for. Both sides have their sympathetic qualities, and both have their deeply sinister sides. The movie takes place in poverty-ravaged Detroit. The plot centers around three friends who are career criminals trying to get out of dodge, robbing houses for a living. The girl comes from an abusive, dysfunctional home, and wants more than anything to rescue her little sister from this environment, and establish a better life for them in California. They get a tip that there is house nearby whose owner is sitting on $300K in cash. They stake out the place and discover that it looks to be the perfect isolated target, in a ghost town of a neighborhood. They discover that the occupant is a blind veteran, who got the money in a settlement after his only daughter was killed in a car crash. Really messed up to rob such a person, right? But as one of the robbers points out, his misfortunes don't necessarily make him a saint. Upon breaking into the house, things go horribly wrong for this trio, and they find themselves trapped in the house with a person they grossly underestimated as an easy target. The sheer terror written on their faces throughout the movie is incredibly realistic. Ultimately, both sides lose something and gain something from the horrific ordeal. The ending was surprising and very satisfying. I'm downgrading it one star due to the revolting and completely unnecessary turkey baster scene. The whole wanting to make a baby factor was truly not needed, and distracted from an otherwise great plot. That aside, this was a nearly perfect film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fede Alvarez puts on a masterclass on how to craft a suspenseful film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's break it down, shall we?What makes a thriller good? It's the suspense, the nail-biting, tense situations the film presents that have the audience at the edge of their seats at all times. And I can say, without a shadow of a doubt, that this film delivers just that. Whenever you feel like the scene is over, and that you have some breathing room, BOOM! Fede drops the characters in a much worse predicament, with the excellent and diverse score by Roque Ba?os pounding in the background. The score of the film elevates each scene and as the film progresses, the movie raises the bar and ups the ante with each passing moment. Once the characters enter the house, the film always has you in a vice grip and never lets go. It makes you feel what the characters are feeling; their dread, their helplessness; and that is a testament to how great a director, Fede is.Let's move on to the actors. So the main cast consists of Stephen Lang, Jane Levy and Dylan Minnette, and each of them nailed their role. Stephen Lang, sir, hats off to you. The man looks like a bad ass without even trying. That's just what Mr. Lang is, a bad ass. But his performance in this film was much more nuanced. You could see that he was a much more complex character. He showed vulnerability, sadness, anger, depression and hopelessness, all through facial expressions, as his role did not require extensive dialogue. He was the star of the film. But equally so was Jane Levy. Now if you're a huge fan of her, like me, you've probably seen Evil Dead and all three seasons of Suburgatory, and you already know that she's a very diverse actress. But in this film, she took her performance to another level. The dread in her eyes, the anguish, as well as the determination to do what she had to do in the film, all were portrayed so well through physical acting and body language, and the same could be said for Dylan Minette's performance. A+'s all around. Overall, I can confidently say, this is the best film I've experienced in the cinema, this year. Give this film all the money you can. These people deserve it. Thank you to everyone involved, for this experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>an excellent and fresh take on the home invasion sub genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>don't breathe is director Fede Alvarez's sophomore effort and I will say it is definitely a success. coming off of evil dead (2013) Fede needed a hit he could call his own. he delivers. don't breathe has some good camera work. nothing super fancy but it does the film justice and uses its setting to the fullest advantage. the setting being the old blind mans house, it is very claustrophobic and dimly lit. creating a very tension filled atmosphere in which the director is able to create some real suspense. the aspect of the "victim" (the old man) being blind also adds to the suspense. characters are holding their breathe and crouching and what not to avoid being captured and each time a scene like this occurs the tension is undeniable. the movie becomes a tension filled thrill ride of cat and mouse. it is no doubt entertaining to watch. the unique thing about this telling of a simple story though is that the tables turn. in terms of who we are rooting for and why. our main characters would normally be considered "bad people" for breaking into this old blind mans house in the first place. but at the same time the lead character played by Jane levy (who by the way gives us another excellent performance in this film) has a legitimate reason for doing what she is doing. her supporting character (his name escapes me) is also revealed to be heroic and noble. eventually we learn this old blind man isn't so innocent and the tables have suddenly turned. this terrible people who broke into a poor old blind mans house become our anti heroes and the "victim (the blind man) becomes our villain. Stephen Lang does an amazing job as the blind man giving us a truly memorable and terrifying performance. the sound design is another key component to what makes this film work so well. every creak in the floor boards add to the already overwhelming tension. as I have already mentioned the film is very, very suspenseful. I am sure it will be enjoyed by many for years to come.the verdict: 8.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Excellent Thriller With a Complex Plot Line and Morally Gray Characters. I Was Blown Away by Don't Breathe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't Breathe was one of those movies that I wasn't terribly interested in when I first heard about it. I then saw the trailer and the promotional material and I was a little more interested. It has a pretty cool setup and although the actors aren't big name stars (the only two I recognized were Stephen Lang and Jane Levy), the word-of-mouth around it was impressive. With it toppling Suicide Squad this weekend, I decided to check it out with a friend. I was so surprised with it, it's my favourite horror/thriller since Sinister, which is one of my all time favourites in that genre.*Minor Spoilers Ahead* Rocky (Jane Levy), Alex (Dylan Minnette) and Money (Daniel Zovatto) are 3 burglars who work and live in Detroit. They have a pretty good system, they stick to small ticket items, they don't take cash and they get in and out quickly. They have an inside connection, Alex's dad works at a home security company and Alex is able to steal information from his dad's office to get keys and extra info on their targets. They aren't happy though, Rocky is especially miserable, she lives in a dump with her mooch of a mom and her sister who deserves a better life. They're desperate to get out of Detroit and there's a little bit of tension between them because Rocky and Money are involved and Alex is clearly on the outside pining for Rocky.When Money is liquidating the stash from the most recent job, he gets a tip about another possible job. He's told that in one of the abandoned parts of Detroit, there's a lonely old man who is sitting on a about 300k from a settlement over his daughter being killed in a car accident. Rocky and Money are immediately in but Alex is reluctant. One of the reasons they go small ticket items and avoid cash is that any higher than 10 grand, it becomes more serious and the heat is worse. He backs out but shortly comes back after Rocky begs him to. They scout out the house, there's no one around and they plan to make their visit that very night.So this movie was made by the people who remade the Evil Dead series. I liked that movie but I wasn't familiar with the older series so I didn't end up being as attached to it as some people did. This movie was really impressive from so many angles. I'll start with how well shot and how visually impressive this movie was. Being filmed in a confined space, this movie really could have been procedural and just run of the mill. The camera is always taking in new and interesting angles and the action was pretty well shot. It helps ratchet up the tension and helps create the illusion that the house is a maze that there is no escape from and they're being stalked by someone who knows the layout better than they ever could. It's a pretty terrifying thought and because of how much extra effort that was put in, the plot sells completely.Another thing that this movie does so well that other movies fail at is that they play with the idea of who the hero and the villain is. You'll find yourself switching sides throughout the movie, I did a few times. Nobody is the hero here (Alex is the closest you get and even he's not completely good) and all the characters have twisted and selfish motivations. I prefer main characters who aren't saints, they're easier to identify with that way. It can be hard to do that but this movie strikes that balance and I enjoyed it that much more for it.Don't Breathe doesn't have too many actors/actresses in it, the story mainly centres around 4 people, the 3 burglars and the old man. They are all excellent. I haven't seen Jane Levy since the Evil Dead movie but she was great. It wasn't always easy to like her character but her performance was always good. Dylan Minnette worked well as the conscience of the group and despite the fact his character was a jerk Daniel Zovatto was still likable as Money. I think the real standout was Stephen Lang, there were a lot of layers to his character and he's given a really deep backstory. With that in mind and his committed performance, he steals the movie.I'd like to add a small note here, this movie gets pretty dark. The plot goes through some twists and turns and it gets more and more bleak. I don't want to spoil anything but there's a point in the movie where it gets kind of squeamish and while it didn't bother me because it just raised the stakes that much more, it could be hard to take for some people.I'm so happy that I went and saw this movie. It was really intense, it was pretty terrifying and it went through plenty twists and turns. It kept you guessing till the end which is also extraordinary because they give you a glimpse of the ending at the beginning. I wasn't expecting too much from Don't Breathe and I got so much more. As much as I liked Suicide Squad, I'm happy that a movie that was this good is going to knock it off the top. If you like tense horror/thrillers GO SEE THIS MOVIE.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw a review that said this is the best American Horror movie in twenty years. I can't agree with that. Obviously these people have not seen You're Next, but seriously, Don't Breathe was great! It was so scary. So so scary. Ninety minutes of Freight. It was so well crafted. Just when you think the story has to end here they kept it going and did it brilliantly.Set in Detroit, which lately with movies like It Follows and Lost River is being filmed to look like the perfect back drop for Horror, Three kids decide to rob this guy of his hard cash. They think it's an easy task because the dude is blind. How wrong they are.Stephen Lang is going to be that new Horror Icon we all need to talk about. He was amazing as the blind man. From the moment he starts his rampage he sets a good example for all blind people who wish to be psychopathic killers. It's like stinkmeaner from the Boondocks, but he's white.I like to point out how the filmmaker seemed to use a camera that made closed space look even bigger. It's important because it really made you jump when the Blind man, or his sidekick dog would just appear in the shot.Three people stuck in a house with a maniac who can't see you, but knows you are there and wants you out dead or alive.Absolutely perfect.http://cinemagardens.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't Breathe - Don't Miss</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't Breathe builds its tension the hard way. Instead of relying solely on jump scares and gore, the film consistently paints itself and its characters into a corner then creatively gets them out of a bad situation while being both unexpected and completely organic. It's a hard high-wire act and one that you'd think a genre director like Fede Alvarez would stumble on. Yet Don't Breathe not only continues the Hitchcockian chamber-piece Renaissance kicked off by Disturbia (2007), it runs away with it. It artfully repackages old- fashioned thrills and kills it with a third act that's ominous but earned.Don't Breathe concerns the exploits of three white-trash miscreants named Rocky (Levy), Alex (Minnette) and Money (Zovatto). They live in post-bankruptcy Detroit, because horror producers find the scene of boarded up houses, blighted streets and deserted neighborhoods far too spooky to pass up. Plus with the average time for emergency response being 41 minutes, the pesky instinct to call the cops is left completely off the table. The trio are banking on this, in addition to Alex's family ties to a security company to rob houses with impunity. With one more score under their belts, Rocky and Money hope to move to California and escape their life of rust-belt entropy. Their target, a blind shut-in (Lang) whose recent court settlement made him a crotchety late-life millionaire. What the would-be thieves don't expect however is for their target to be so resourceful and so deadly.Anyone familiar with Stephen Lang's filmography would know that the man has a long history of playing the grizzled tough guy and Don't Breathe's unnamed Blind Man is no exception. Despite having a little over ten lines and spending a large portion of the film wondering with arms out, he dominates the frame with muted bellicose. He's scary not only because he's a brutal close-range brawler but because his disability reminds us that he's still human. A human whose life has descended into a Nietzschean perversion - "Man can do anything, once he knows there is no God," he says in a moment of well-earned shock and disgust. When his humanity is questioned, in a second act reveal that steadily raises the stakes, our sympathies then ricochets back to our trio. Up until this point, were given the average wafer-thin backstories girdled with teenage neglect, alpha-male shows of dominance and unrequited love. Yet as the Blind Man's becomes more invested in their demise and their routes for escape become limited, we as the audience feel for our teenage lambs; if for no other reason than we're right there with them. I won't go as far as to say, the characters have become fully formed by the time the credits roll, but I do admire their resourcefulness throughout. They deal with the claustrophobia of their plight with sharper and sharper fight or flight instincts complimented with masterful cinematography by Pedro Luque. His camera-work allows the audience to truly immerse themselves in the space, keeping us glued to not only the characters but what their seeing...and more importantly what they're not seeing.If there's a spiritual grandfather to Don't Breathe it's almost certainly Alfred Hitchcock's Rope (1948). Not only is the cinematography eerily similar but so are the themes which parities feeling of superiority (in this case moral not intellectual) with the banality of evil. 10 Cloverfield Lane (2016) may have been this year's torchbearer for the old master's brand of suspense thus far this year but I'm going to go ahead and say its reign has been short-lived. Don't Breathe - don't miss.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The first 10/ 10 I've given this year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Three teenagers learn of a blind old man, in a nearly abandoned slum in Detroit, who has just recently been awarded $300.000 in a wrongful death of his daughter. He is said to keep this money in a safe in his house, which the trio see as an easy target. They stakeout the house, the creepiest house I"ve seen since The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and break into it that night. Brilliantly effective music score accompanies the terrifying Antebellum-looking house, mimicking the pounding heartbeat in one's ears during a frightening situation as that, and the situation quickly goes from bad to terrifying, as the blind old man fights back, quite viciously, even more ferociously than his guard dog. Every character, even the aforementioned dog, has moments of sympathy and compassion, as well as moments of contempt and disdain. We alternately feel empathy and scorn, as the lines between hero and villain, antihero and anti-villain become progressively blurred. Not an easy feat to achieve. Several times, we, the audience, and the characters themselves, hope to have found a way out, a potential escape, only to find we are now in an even worse situation than the previous scene.Interesting, exceptional cinematography, with some long, wide angle shot, and some interesting uses of focus, the film never sinks to using shaky cam, or high contrast/ colour saturation.The film does begin to go off the rails in the final scenes, and ultimately goes on one scene too long (film should have ended as Rocky is running from the house, and the police are finally arriving) but this is still a first class, top tier horror/ thriller, and it, along with this year's earlier Green Room, gives me renewed hope for the horror genre. I am genuinely thrilled by new horror films using an actual, physical villain, rather than more ghost stories and demonic possessions, which I am thoroughly, incredibly bored with.This is the 48th new release film I've seen in a cinema in 2016, and it is the first 10/ 10 I've given thus far in 2016.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't Breathe Is Not Only Extremely Intense, But It Also Sets An Example Of How Horror Movies Of Today Should Be Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not the hugest horror movie buff, but when it comes to horror films like The Shining or Cabin In The Woods just no it incredibly increases my liking of the horror genre. Now rarely today will I find a horror film that I will extremely like or even like at all. It's almost now a 1/3 ratio were I'll actually go into a horror movie and find it to be a decent film. Don't Breathe not only expands a new level of intensity in horror or thriller films, but if it makes enough money it could inspire new waves of actually really good horror movies. Don't Breathe blew me away I was so immersed into this film that I almost felt like I was in the horrible situation that the characters in the film were in. There was so many times were I was on the edge of my seat and even sometimes holding in my own breath when the actors were holding their breaths. The premise of this film isn't very new it's kind of borrowed off of films like Panic Room but I think with horror films like The Conjuring, it's okay to borrow off cliché premises if the film itself is done right. The two main characters played by Jane Levy and Dylan Minnette have great character development. When a horror movie gives characters good development and likability it just makes the film way better. Cause now that I have these two characters that I actually care about it'll make me care about what will possibly happen too them throughout the runtime of the film. Now Stephen Lang's character I thought was very menacing as this Blind man. He had a great back story and he was a threat to be reckoned with. Also the way the camera focuses or moves around from scene to scene or place to place is done so well that it brings the intensity level to a more even pace. There's even a lot of long shots in this film that kept me on the edge of my seat. Now I do have one complaint with this film and that is about, no spoilers of course, the ending. The ending I think went on for too long it could've cut off at least 15 minutes earlier and the film would've been better. The film just kept dragging on and it felt unnecessary. Also just a heads up if you haven't yet seen the trailer for this film, I recommend not seeing it cause it actually spoils part of the movie. Other than that I had such an amazing time with Don't Breathe and if your a fan of the horror genre, definitely go into it and if you are interested in having a exciting experience at the movies go and see this film. This is easily one of my favorite films this year and I'm going to give Don't Breathe a grade of an A and a IMDb score of a 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The dark of Don't Breathe helps make this a scary but fun thriller about blindness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2016's summer seems to be a swell year for horror and thriller genre. The Conjuring 2, Lights Out, The Witch, and The Shallows found audiences that seemed to push away from the many reboots and sequels that filled the blockbuster season. A lot of that has to do with how these stories felt original, even though these kinds of stories have been told before. With the summer dealing with sharks, haunted houses, evil spirits and magic, what else could the horror genre bring? How about home invasion in reverse?The film in question may contain some similarities to David Fincher's Panic Room, but Don't Breathe has some major differences. Rather then the main character being the homeowner fighting burglars, we now have the robbers in focus trying to get away from the homeowner. Oh, and the landlord happens to be blind as well. So this movie seems to have a bit of Wait Until Dark in it as well (If you haven't seen it before, I highly recommend it as a great thriller with Audrey Hepburn and Alan Arkin). What's funny is that with a lot of those film elements, Don't Breathe happens to be a thrilling adventure, all confined in this one house with the goal of getting out.In the slums of a ghost town looking Detroit, three twenty somethings, Rocky (played by Jane Levy), Alex (played by Dylan Minnette), and Money (played by Daniel Zovatto), are robbers who only take small cash and information, thanks to Alex's connection to his father's security who seems to handle most of the local houses alarm systems. Rocky has been looking to get her little sister out their broken home and make it to California to start a new life. She may finally get that chance with their latest tip about a resident who has hundreds of thousands stashed in his home. When they get a glance at the blind guy's house, they see that he lives in an abandoned neighborhood with a mean rottweiler has his seemingly only defense. On the night they attack, their break in seems to go well, putting to the dog to sleep and finding an entrance through the basement. Just as the burglars seem to find where the money is, the blind man (played by Stephen Lang) is awaken by the noise and fights back hard. While hiding, the blind guy blocks all exits, leaving the robbers in a battle to see who can get out alive.Don't Breathe is a very exciting thriller/horror that kept my theater quiet except for the occasional scream or gasp. Director Fede Alvarez (2013's Evil Dead) and producer Sam Rami have given us an interesting perspective of sympathies and earned scares. A lot of that is all on the performers, so let get into that. Stephen Lang was probably the perfect choice for a role like this, who must be the toughest blind character I've seen in recent years. I also enjoyed the chemistry of Rocky and Alex's characters as they do their best to stay alive in a true zone of darkness. While film cannot recreate blindness well, Don't Breathe pulls of a number of tactics to do so from night vision to the use of sounds that one would hear better when they keep their eyes shut. The story may have you confused over which character you want to feel for, the script does give you enough backstory for you to make the decision. I'm also glad that the movie kept it's length short. It may seem like a bummer for those that want to be in the theater longer, Don't Breathe knows when to keep giving you scares and when to stop. It all falls into sync.I'll give this nine white canes out of ten. Don't Breathe adds to 2016's list of original movies that people will come out too. Not that Hollywood needs to make more horror movies, but I hope their at least seeing that people want more original content. Close your eyes, and experience the dark and light of Don't Breathe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Dilemma/Who To Root For?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw "Don't Breathe", starring Stephen Lang-Avatar, Tombstone; Jane Levy-Evil Dead_2013, Suburgatory_tv; Dylan Minnette-Goosebumps, Let Me In and Daniel Zovatto-Fear The Walking Dead_tv, It Follows.This is not your typical thriller/horror movie. It has twists that might catch you off guard-it did me-and you are not really sure who you should be rooting for as the good guy or the bad guy. Stephen is a Gulf War vet that was blinded in battle. After coming home to the states, his daughter is killed by a drunk rich girl-who gets off with no jail time, since she is rich-but he does get a large settlement from the rich parents. Jane, Dylan and Daniel are a group of teens that spend their spare time burglarizing houses and taking whatever they want. You see, Dylan's father works for a home security company so Dylan has access to keys and codes. They hear about Stephen's little windfall and decide to hit him, thinking, what trouble can a blind man be? Plus, the house is in a bad, rundown neighborhood with few neighbors. Boy, are they wrong. It seems that old Stephen might just have a few tricks-as well as secrets-up his sleeve. Concerning what I mentioned earlier about who to root for, do you hope the kids rob a blind war vet or do you hope a physically fit war vet with Daredevil type senses defends his property? But then, what if the war vet takes things too far? Is it justified? It is a dilemma. It's rated "R" for violence, terror, disturbing content, language and sexual content-no nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour &amp; 28 minutes. I loved it and would buy it on Blu-Ray.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a film without strong follow-through on its premise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't Breathe is a grisly, unpleasant exploitation film about characters that you don't like going up against a man who is at first somewhat sympathetic and then turns out to be a ridiculous mess of a (human) monster, and it's directed with some skill. I almost wish it had been made with greater sleaze or a total abandon for logic and taste and become a complete Grindhouse exercise, but the problem for me with the film is that director Fede Alvarez - again collaborating with Evil Dead producers Sam Raimi and Robert Tapert - is he wants to have it both ways, to have characters that, as the audience, you don't really like or have sympathy for so you don't have to worry *too* much once the psycho ex-military Zatoichi man is getting his payback... until he wants you to like them.There's this sense in the movie that it's dancing with a grey area of having strong, morally ambiguous characterizations - you'll feel one way about the young woman Rocky and her compatriots Alex and "Money" (yeah, that's his name, like a thug on SVU or something), but maybe not everyone will feel that way until the peril and suspense and terror kicks in. That's fine, as well as it is with the antagonist (who, in the alternate movie that may exist of his story, he's the protagonist). But the problem is that the characters are set in a realistic horror-thriller situation and yet they carry that Dumb Movie Character logic that carries little logic at all.This isn't the case for all of the film, and for the first half I was with it... up to a point. It's certainly got some logic gaps that you got to suspend disbelief for, and things like 'why if this blind ex-military man has all this money is he on the only house on a dilapidated Detroit city block with no one else living there, like out of Stephen King's Roadwork or something. And the filmmaker and his DP carry a lot of heft when it comes to the direction and the look of the film: they know how to bring an audience in by moving the camera in creative ways, having staging that makes sense, and pacing (in these early scenes) that makes things intense for us just as much as the characters... again, up to a point.And then the movie decides to... well, here's where spoilers kick in: the guy (he doesn't have a name so Sgt Hartman-Zatoichi works well) is not simply some old dude living by his lonesome having lost a daughter to a fatal hit and run. No, he has his special set of I-can-kill-you-with-my-hands-or-my-guns, AND more than that is the reveal that in his basement there's a lair for the woman who hit his daughter who... he is also keeping locked up as she is knocked up with his child so that he can replace his dead daughter and... this comes into play even more terrifyingly in the last minutes when the girl Rocky gets in his grasp and... Jesus Christ movie! It's around here, or just before give or take around the moment when you think a character's been stabbed with a pair of gardening shears but it's revealed he is still alive(?!) (and this after seemingly to already be dead from a no-one-survives-that-s*** fall through a window), that the movie goes into Full Stupid and lazy territory. Again, I wish that if Don't Breathe leaped into completely crazy and bonkers terrain, but it doesn't have the courage for that; it's caught in this nexus of trying to be a legitimately creepy and fearful experience done with direction that tries to sometimes call back to things like Fincher's Panic Room (also a 'bottle' one-location scenario), and being a movie with full on exploitation (the title recalls for me Edgar Wright's DON'T trailer from the actual Grindhouse experience), featuring characters we don't care about that are basically drawn (though with some real emotion from the actress playing Rocky) and thrown into nightmarish, violent set pieces.I don't like when a filmmaker cheats me with information that's dealt out to me. I don't like having the rug pulled out from under me even if it's something that I should take for granted like a character survives something they shouldn't of or a character doesn't kill someone when they have ample opportunity to (you'll know the moment, or moments, when they come). I leave Don't Breathe feeling rather empty and angry instead of elated, which terrifying movies can do - see Green Room earlier this year, also about characters caught way in over their heads, for a much greater example of this - but its ugliness is in multiple ways: in how it treats rape and sexual assault (it ends up being a cheap out to having a stronger 2nd/3rd act), in how it treats bodily wounds (come on man), the logic of having a home security system at all if there's, you know, a RAPE DUNGEON in your basement, and how it treats sound design. Yes, for a movie like this the sound design gets weak after a while.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Suspense Is High</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow. Ever since I first heard of the concept for Don't Breathe, I immediately knew it had potential. I am personally not familiar with most of the cast for this film. The director, Fede Alvarez, had apparently worked on the Evil Dead remake which was released a few years ago. I had not seen this film or any other projects that this director has worked on. Additionally, I was not familiarized with most of the cast. Point being, I did not have much background on this film, except for perhaps the concept, and I was pleasantly surprised. The movie grips you from, literally, the very first scene, and keeps you in suspense until the very end. One thing I found interesting was how the film had various objects and symbols which were briefly shown near the beginning, and had a large impact in the movie later on. If you watch this movie, pay attention to the dog and hammer, for example.The acting as well, was top notch. I was a bit skeptical, seeing that most of the actors did not have an extensive background in the industry (except for maybe the blind man). However, these actors played their parts perfectly, only adding to the already extremely suspenseful atmosphere of the movie. In fact, I'm not sure whether to call this film a horror or a thriller. In fact, I think it takes the best of both worlds, as the camera angles and tone make it feel like a horror, yet the plot and characters make it feel like a thriller.The movie did have some notable goofs here and there. Since the atmosphere is so suspenseful, I seriously doubt that it will make a difference. But, they are there. Additionally, what bothered me the most about this movie was I felt that at one point, the movie became too violent and disturbing, in a way. You will definitely understand what part I am referring to when you come across it. In fact, I don't think this specific part was too physically violent or disturbing, I just believe that this violence, lets call it, was misplaced. This killed the suspenseful atmosphere of the film. Apart from this, the movie was excellent. Definitely worth a watch, one of the best of 2016.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie is not entirely a fresh novelty, the typical home invasion movie but what we don't know is that the inmate living in that house makes the concept different. The eccentric man and apparently blind pretty much turns the tables on three thieving teens in this thriller.The movie starts off pretty slow, but it gives much space for the characters to develop their respective story. What makes this movie even greater is that Fede Alvarez, the director of the Evil Dead remake, delivers only 4 major characters on the screen if you don't count the feral dog. Overall, it has a strong plot and unique vibe to it, as it relies more on visual storytelling and sounds to drive the film rather than plenty of dialogue.Once the three amateur thieves step inside the shadowy house, that's when it is fuelled by old-school suspense. It's very realistic from the moment they break into that blind man's house, asking from the perspective of how, why and what. The discreet environment can make someone's heart beating so fast. There are times where everything goes silent and it's incredible considering how the audience freezes and no one wants to make a single sound even when you're chewing popcorns. Not everything silent though, there are a few parts when the ominous music plays in the background, people just keep watching, waiting for something to be revealed. It's incredibly intense which literally leaves you breathless. The one thing I have in similar with this director is the cinematography. The way how the director angles the motion of every picture. It's very much like how I imagine it, the style of bringing the cameras with a very smooth touch especially 5 minutes after they break into the vicinity of the house.Every movie has its black area, the thing that I feel a little over- the-top is the predictable moments, FOR SOMEONE WHO WATCHES A LOT OF MOVIE. It comes out a little too strong, but somehow it manages to capture my heart.Stephen Lang once said throughout the filming process, he couldn't really see anything as he wore scleral contact lenses. How hard is it for someone to do that? You answer it for yourself.This must be in my top 5 list movies of 2016. It is intriguing and the kind of movie you would want to stay at the edge-of-your-seat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A old-fashioned and eerie thriller that is bound to leave you breathless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now this is what I'm talking about. "Don't Breathe" is a simple, but very energetic home-invasion horror thriller that has chills and thrills. Plus, no cheap jump scares found here, just pure horror done the good old-fashioned way. And it also provides a few twists that are so shocking, they will leave you speechless. This is Uruguayan director Fede Alvarez's follow-up to the ultra-gory, but stylish and thrilling "Evil Dead" remake. Here, he takes a more relaxed approach with less gore and more storytelling. Set in Detroit, the movie follows Rocky (Jane Levy), a young girl who is trying to get herself and her little sister out of here, along with her boyfriend Money (It Follows' Daniel Zovatto). Rocky's friend is Alex (Dylan Minnette from last year's "Goosebumps"), whose dad works at one of those security companies. Their plan to end all plans, of course, is to rob the house of a blind man who has a huge sum somewhere and they will be on their way. It turns out that this blind man known as "The Blind Man" (Stephen Lang) is a war veteran and is a lot more skilled than they think he is. He knows every corner, frame and room of this house and he is certainly not afraid to strike. But he also has a few things lurking in that house. Now, this is where I stop, because the rest I want you to see for yourself. The way how this movie was designed is through the old-fashioned techniques that most filmmakers haven't used in a while. Alvarez uses tracking shots, sound and a great deal of foreboding to keep us on our toes and to make our hairs stand on end. Credit must given to cinematographer Pedro Luque, production designer Naaman Marshall and three editors for knowing how to pull us in through style, substance and restraint. It also features one of the best scores I've heard since "Gone Girl" and that is the unsettling and eerie score courtesy of Roque Banos, who seem to have taken a few pages from the Reznor/Ross guidebook. I think one of the most memorable characters ever created in my opinion is "The Blind Man". Stephen Lang, who has played villains before, makes this character subtly effective and very terrifying. He doesn't say a lot (nor does he should), but with those piercing eyes, a magnetic presence and the way he walks with no mercy and no fear, Lang carries this challenging task on his shoulders and runs with it. There's no need to question his loyalties, because you can't tell if these characters are good or bad. Jane Levy, who worked with Alvarez on "Evil Dead" and gave such a fearless performance in that film is even more convincing this time. She and Dylan Minnette are great at conveying fears with their eyes and trying not to make any sounds while walking in the dark. I'm certainly not going to forget this movie. I haven't reacted to a film this stunning since David Fincher's "Panic Room". Both films do give a very claustrophobic feel of what's it like to be trapped in a house. But "Don't Breathe" gets the upper hand because someone knows how to take that fear and cranks it up to 11. You never know what you're going to expect and you don't know how it is going to turn out, but it takes a big dive and it's not afraid to go all out. Here's a very subtle response from me: It's bound to leave you breathless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably one of the best horror films this year - a horror film you'll truly ENJOY</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Honestly this film's so good.I actually thought it was going to be gruesome cause the team that brought this film was almost the same team that made EVIL DEAD 2016, but it was nowhere near that. It managed to be entertaining and a horror-classic without tapping into gore too much. It actually helped the film that they left a few things to the imagination. It makes the pain even more painful for the AUDIENCE, as their senses were put to work. You feel the pain because you don't see the pain. Your brain plays with your body, and it's so damn effective.3 THINGS I think were a bit NAH to me:1. Continuity - there was ONE SPECIFIC SCENE I'm pretty sure wasn't consistent. It was at the beginning part: JANE LEVY who played ROCKY was smoking at the car then offer it to her boyfriend (who later calls her, her bitch --- SPOILER --- so imagine the audience's pleasure when he died, altho it was already seen at the trailer. So ROCKY gave her stick to her boyfriend, and then at the next shot, we see her smoking a stick while looking outside.... How did she get that? If the scene wasn't connected then it would've escaped my eyes and it would've made sense but it wasn't a montage or a time lapse, it happened in between a conversation.2. THE CHARACTERS - Honestly this factor's a bit confusing since it CAN be a good thing, but MAY also disturb others. THE CHARACTERS are so confusing to root for, except for ALEX (Dylan Minnette). Alex is the character you'd definitely root for, but sort of know that he's gonna ---- SPOILER ---- NOT GONNA MAKE IT. BUT it was still a pleasure to see him fight, run, and try to survive the night. The other characters, however, had too messed up choices that you're pretty sure you'd want to see them go away. ROCKY's character was sooooooo confusing. You want her to survive but you don't. You wanna side with the BLIND MAN but you kind a don't. It's so irritating but kind a interesting at the same time.3. THE ENDING - The ending was a bit off for me. I wanted it to end somewhere else, but maybe that's just me.---- BEST THING: They managed to make such a simple plot really interesting by giving their 'killer' reasons to rage even more, thus, creating a more dangerous avenue for your 'rats'. They also give you reasons to root for both sides cause both are HUMANS (Aren't perfect: they have bad stuff at their backs, but also have good intentions/reasons for doing those bad things)--- BASICALLY, the formula of this film is that it's going to intensify an already intense scene or it's going to up it's game by making your 'wishes' for the film to get confused. You'll ask yourself by the end of the film: "Did ROCKY really deserve to survive? WTF did ALEX deserve to have been considered a burglar? Did the BLIND MAN really deserve to live? YOU JUST DON'T KNOW what to feel but yah, this film is just so smart.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An intense horror film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Horror movies continue to impress as Don't Breathe arrives to finish off late summer at the movies. This thriller follows three criminals who break into houses until they break into the wrong one. Rocky (Jane Levy) just wants to escape crumbling Detroit to a life in California, but she needs one more score to have enough cash to leave. Her boyfriend, Money (Daniel Zovatto) hears about a blind veteran who received a large sum of money from a settlement after his daughter died in a car accident. Alex (Dylan Minnette) uses his dad's security guard keys to gain access to houses though this particular location proves more difficult with a vicious dog and an inordinate amount of locks.Stephen Lang is ferocious as the blind man with dark secrets of his own. Lang stalks through the house creating a horrifying villain without any supernatural help.The acting was great from the three main actors. Dylan Minnette has graduated from the young Goosebumps film to a more adult horror and I hope he continues work in the genre. Jane Levy has shown promise with her appearance in Evil Dead and looks to have a bright future as a young actress. Fede Alvarez directs the film brilliantly with amazing cinematography to enhance the terror.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stephen Lane just made me understand how many of our main natural senses are good and bad for us. I loved the creativity of making a blind man have more enhanced senses than others because his blindness causes him to be more experienced in his other senses. And the fact that he had the training of a war veteran made the movie even more intense. This movie has been one for the ages with all the other movies that were considered suspenseful and just basically flat lined and ended up being a waste of money, but this movie truly made up for a lot and I would say Fede Alvarez needs to make more suspenseful movies, because that was creative and great planning and everything. I do wish the movie ended with the this psychology ill blind man ended up killing all the characters, but I can't wait to see the spin off if there will be one. Truthfully the only thing I did not like was the whole Atheist and religious thing with basically trying to generalize Atheists as sick evil people and that's not the case, but besides that I love the movie and just hope there is left mention of god and beliefs and just focuses on the suspense of the movie.</fullReview>

Which starts out has a perfect score will soon turns into a nightmare cause this 60 something year old blind guy is nobodies fool.A really good tension grabber, keeps you on the edge of your seat. The movie is quite a surprise, just when you think the ending is predictable, then it completely pulls it around. Stephan Lang is quite menacing, puts a chill down your spine, does not have much dialog, but more his actions speak louder. I didn't think I was gonna root for the three young crooks, but the more I got to know two of them, I was really starting to feel for them, and the young actors played there parts very well. The scenes in the house are pretty effective, giving a good haunted house like feel to it.If you are in the mood for a good tension grabber, then give Don't Breathe a look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suspenseful and Clever, Despite a Few Plot Holes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a year with a string of impressive horror films, Don't Breathe is yet another good entry. Directed by Fede Alvarez (Evil Dead, 2013), this film shows that he has a talent for horror, and may be a rising presence in the genre. Don't Breathe is hold-your-breath scary, and features a clever premise, despite a few small plot holes. It is worth mentioning that the title and posters seemed a little ambiguous as to the plot, but watching the film the title seems appropriate.The first thing to mention about this film is that it is full of twists and turns, but does take a relatively practical approach to it's plot. The film's story is very smartly constructed, as it is full of tension from the opening moments, right up to the end. The film's biggest strength is its simplicity, as it makes the most of a very straightforward premise. That being said, the film is constructed in a way that obstacles are consistently thrown at the main characters in creative ways.Simply put the fact that the writers and directors were able to tell a story with such a clever yet simple premise makes it easy to follow. The impressive thing about this film is within a short period of time, the characters are well established and the premise, which is quite clever, is introduced. With all of the clichéd horror films today, putting empty characters in clichéd situations, it's refreshing to see relatable characters put into a straightforward premise. However, as happens in all horror films, the characters find everything is not as they expected it, and quickly discover they're in over their heads.The only problem with the film, is that it does cater to a few too many horror clichés and has a few glaring plot holes. While the obstacles in this film are creatively thrown at the main characters, a few of them don't make sense, with a little thought. The story at times, neglects to explain how something happened, and relies on a few Deus ex Machinas. The irony is that many of the plot holes, end up helping the villain character, as he seems almost inhuman by the end of the film. In the end, Don't Breathe does a brilliant job keeping the audience on the edge of their seats, with a combination of ingenuity and simplicity. The film offers a refreshing entry in the horror genre, which has seen a nice revival this year, from the typically clichéd horror films we get. The film isn't great, as it has a few too many plot holes, and clichés, but is still very entertaining. Horror buffs looking for a good film to get them into the Fall/Halloween season will likely enjoy this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A heart-pounding heist-gone-horrifically-wrong thriller!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Don't' visit Detroit. "Don't Breathe" is a brilliant horror film that will keep your adrenaline pumping and keep you guessing from the beginning of Act II to the final cut to black. Crossing into different sub-genres of horror, this movie will capture your attention every moment and catch you off guard every chance it gets. Although there is no scientific evidence for the collective belief that when one sense is removed that the others take over, it does make for a fantastic plot device that will greatly heighten your own senses while watching this efficiently ruthless movie. This is definitely a horror film to experience on the big screen?don't wait for Prime, Play, RedBox, or HBONow. The most terrifying element of this movie is the feeling of being trapped in the dark. Just as the characters are experiencing the labyrinth that is the home of the intended robbery victim, you will also feel helpless as the terror unfolds in front of your eyes and you have nowhere to hide. Going into this film, you may think it simply a new twist on the home invasion sub-genre of horror, but you will soon find out that there is so much more to this movie than meets the eye. While some films? horror or not?are often guilty of wasting time, especially in the first acts respectively, Sony-Screen Gems' Don't Breath is a cinematic claustrophobic roller-coaster that includes one terrifying turn after another. In other news, if you're looking to buy a house, this film includes some great shots of your next neighborhood in Detroit.With all their friends gone, three young people are desperately trying to leave the city they once called home. Turning to petty theft and larceny, Money (Daniel Zovatto), Rocky (Jane Levy), and Alex (Dylan Minnette) receive a tip from a local crime boss that there is a house with enough money to get them all out the city. After learning that the home is inhabited by a blind old man (Stephen Lang), the small band of thieves conclude that this will be an easy gig. With the aid of security codes and keys from Alex's father's security business, who manages the few inhabited homes in Detroit, Alex, Money, and Rocky plan the heist. After the robbery goes 180 degrees in the opposite direction, this supposedly easy target now has them trapped. And a terrifying realization will have them holding their breath as to not get caught or worse. Two parts home invasion, one part heist, and three parts horror, this terrifying movie will have you on the edge of your seat.For the sake of not giving anything away in the movie, I am going to keep this review on the shorter side. Sometimes the best horror movies are those that have a very simple premise. And this is definitely one of those. The heist genre is one of the oldest in the cinematic handbook. After all The Great Train Robbery (1903) was the first American film to pioneer composite editing, on- location shooting, and dynamic camera movement. Although not the very first motion picture, it is among the first and considered by many to be the first commercially successful motion picture. Early on in the dawn of commercial cinema, horror was quite prominent, thanks to Carl Laemmle who founded Universal Pictures. Don't Breathe includes elements from many different films in the official sub-genres of horror; but to explore each of those would give away some terrifyingly morbid plot twists in the movie. The point is, this film borrows from both horror and non-horror films that helped to forge the foundation of commercially successful cinema. It's of no surprise, after watching it, that is will likely do very well this weekend. Given that it has an August release date, I was concerned that?as good as it looked in the trailers?that it would not play out very well because the best horror films, this time of year, are released in latter September and October to make way for Halloween! But, I was totally wrong; I thoroughly enjoyed the experience. Speaking of Halloween, this movie would make an absolutely perfect addition to Universal's Halloween Horror Nights next year if they can secure the rights from Sony Pictures.Regarding the location of the film, this is just the latest in horror films (as well as other genres) to use the motor city as the backdrop for a violent story. As a producer, myself, I realize that part of the draw to that location is the simple fact that it is incredibly cheap to shoot there. The other part is that it effortlessly sets up a feeling of uneasiness from an aerial shot of the city or suburbs. Not entirely sure that having horror films and other violent movies set in your city, now in ruins, will do much for inspiring entrepreneurs or other professionals to relocate; but it does showcase the city as a welcoming place for filmmakers who seek to pursue their respective dreams of success at visual storytelling. Ghost towns have often been used in westerns, horror, and treasure hunt movies; and without having to go to a foreign country, there really is a perfect modern ghost town right here in the US. Whether it needs to serve as a location that symbolizes greatness in ruins or to instantly prompt apprehension or unbalance, it is a diverse landscape upon which to build a story.Just when you think the film is over, it will throw you for a loop! Looking for a fantastic film to watch on a date or with your friends this weekend, then I highly recommend Don't Breathe. It's the perfect film to usher in this most macabre time of year. Not defaulting to gore and jump scares, this movie is a beautifully and meticulously crafted work of cinema that will genuinely cause your blood to race and keep your senses on edge.</fullReview>

There's a significant twist too but before this is revealed, director and co-writer Fede Alvarez wastes no time in unleashing a truckload of terror. A quick introduction tells us that petty thieves Rocky, her boyfriend Money and Alex are down on their luck until they receive a tipoff about an old man who received a cash settlement after his daughter was killed in a car accident. To their pleasant surprise, the old man is blind and he lives alone in an abandoned neighborhood. But once they break into his house, there awaits more surprises that are not so pleasant, and as it turns out, shockingly nasty for us too. Deeply rooted in the horror-thriller genre, Don't Breathe spans at just under 90 minutes, but don't underestimate its relatively short running time or its skimpy production budget. In just his second offering since the Evil Dead reboot, Alvarez delivers with almost Hitchcockian precision by using suspense and shock like a one-two punch combo. And although these are his principal tools to induce primal fear in the audience, there's plenty more at work to have viewers peeping through their fingers. Technical aspects like deft camera-work and sound mixing amplifies the fear factor to discomforting claustrophobia, owing to which the mounting peril on screen becomes directly proportional to increasing stress levels experienced by the viewer.While the actors playing the burglars are virtually unknown, Jane Levy as Rocky and Daniel Zovatto as Money aren't new to horror, having previously starred in Evil Dead and It Follows (2015) respectively. As the script dictates, they don't have to say much yet successfully depict the outright horror of facing a superior and deadly antagonist known simply as 'The Blind Man' (Stephen Lang). If you thought Lang was a menacing villain in Avatar, nothing but nerves of steel can prepare you for his terrifying delivery in this film; and that's before his character turns off the lights. Don't Breathe isn't the kind of gimmicky horror film made for cheap thrills. And if one cares to notice, there's even subtle social commentary on the failing economy in parallel to an unstable justice system. But that's just the film at its lightest. At its best, this is a horror film that is wickedly dark and for some viewers even nerve-wrecking to the point of suffocation. But then the title is already an apt warning ? watch with bated breath.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Three teens venture into an old man's to steal his money and find out that it isn't that easy after all. It sounds like a simple premise, but by the movie is over much has happened, and there are plenty of twists and turns along the way.What the two young man and the young lady find is way more dangerous and darker than anyone could expect. To begin, in spite of his blindness, their prey is not as defenseless as they hoped, and soon they become his preys, as he hunts each one of them throughout his home. Suddenly they discover there is one more person in the house, and this person sheds more light on the nature of the old man's motivations.Their battle is long, with the advantage changing through some lucky or unlucky move, and the intensity of their encounters grow as the story goes on, reaching a resolution we suspected but not quite turning out that way. "Don't Breathe" succeeds because it's thrilling from beginning to end, though we really never get to know much about the characters, there's enough to develop some sympathy for the two parties. Yes, everyone is a criminal to a point, both driven by different types of madness and the need to survive or outsmart each other. Stephen Lang's feature and great physical shape make his ability to deal with the younger people. There are very few lines in the movie, but the conversations are rich, without a wasted moment. Be prepared to stay glued to the screen, waiting, with much suspense threatening to take your breath away.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>DON'T BREATHE (2016) ***1/2 Stephen Lang, Jane Levy, Dylan Minnette, Daniel Zovatto, Emma Bercovici, Franciska Torocsik, Christian Zagia, Katia Bokor, Jane May Graves. Unnerving thriller about a trio of friends whose home invasion/robbing spree comes to a halt when they pick on the wrong dupe, a blind Gulf War veteran grieving for the recent loss of his daughter (Lang pitch perfect and creepy as hell) who proves to be a lethal force to be reckoned with. Suspenseful and taut as a trip-wire filmmaker Fred Alvarez - who co-scripted the equally nerve-jangling script by partner-in-crime Rodo Sayagues - pulls out all the stops employing a deftly edited sound effects score by Joshua Adeniji and gooseflesh cinematography by Pedro Luque. Levy and Minnette shine as the closer two of the three criminals by balancing the tricky beam of begin innocent and guilty in their actions. Hang on.</fullReview>

I'm not going to give out any details , although if you see the trailer you will get a fair picture of what you can expect. Go watch in theaters for an absolutely amazing experience.

		<fullReview>A wild ride from beginning to end. To start off, and nothing is revealed here, there are no good guys in this story. As witnessed in the trailers, we are watching three thieves and a man with a dark secret (via locked up girl in the basement seen in the trailer). As an audience, we get pulled in all kinds of directions to find a side to pick throughout the film and this was awesome for me... There are no brakes applied to the "thriller" concept of this film. This one is intense and violent from the get go and it presents frequent "wtf" moments over and over... Beyond the story and elements of the film, I have to give appreciation to the cinematography, score, and sound effects (or lack of). The film places the audience in a state of suspense with the way it goes completely silent and, at times, only allows the sound of light breathing come through the speakers. Creating an absolutely chilling experience.One of the best films of the year for me. Suspenseful and chilling from beginning to end. Highly recommended.--Oberrated--</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't Breathe; Although not supposedly the scariest film ever, is definitely one of the most tension filling horror films of 2016, and one that executes flawlessly, dragging the audience into a never- ending nightmare, and truly succeeds. We follow Rocky, Alex, and a dude named Money, they're a team that robs houses; Goal to move away. They come across news that a blind man has a large fortune, and all they have to do is break in. However, this break in isn't as easy as they'd hope for, now they must survive, and escape. First off, props to this films' atmosphere. The atmosphere throughout most of the film is eerily silent, due to the characters having to remain as silent as possible while trapped. With that silence, we're set to see multiple situations where tension is the only thing that comes to the audiences' mind. There are countless scenes where it gets intensely tension - filled, and it keeps us on the ends of our seats, and intrigued. The film also has a very eerie, dark - like setting as it progresses, only boosting to extreme heights on the tension level. Most of these occurrences are well played out by the actors, as well. The acting in this film, I'd say, in terms of what the characters were put through was perfect. They all genuinely put forth a believable, and well performance. Each character, as well had their own unique styles, and all of which were interesting enough for us to care in a sense, depending who they are. Another extremely enjoyable aspect of this film which overall was the unique, successful plot. The plot, and overall story-line of the entire film was extremely solid, and more than successful for audience tension, and thrill. It tied in unique twists, as well as guaranteed reaction elements. The pacing of this film, as well just boosts the unique plot, as this film went straight to the point, and wasted absolutely no time in getting the audiences' attention. In conclusion. Is the hype for this film real? Yes; It, by no means is the "Scariest film" out there, but is it unique? And does it set itself away from the typical horror movie scene? Absolutely. This, for sure is one of the best horror films of 2016. This, I'd say is worthy of the top three films, even. This film was unique, innovative - like, and it brought new, exciting elements to the horror film scene. It was well paced, well acted, and on an even more specific realm, extremely well shot with camera-work. It was thrilling, exciting, and heavily effective with it's silent, unpredictable atmosphere, and endless - like attitude. The countless, yet outstanding twists this film takes, as well was more than worth the watch. "Don't Breathe" was more than enjoyable, and was worth the wait, as well as the hype. I strongly recommend checking this one out in theaters. You won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went ahead and watched " Don't Breathe " with my friends today at the cinemas, we were all satisfied with the outcome. This movie really excels at being thrilling, I was gripped during the whole 1h and 30 mins. I felt like the length of the movie was on point, a little longer would have either killed the intensity or maybe would have been too tense for a long period of time. The acting was very good, the set pieces were well made. What I found to be really good is that some scenes and twists were really unexpected ( I don't want to spoil it ) but if you do see the movie, which I highly recommend, you would understand.The ending also offers space for a sequel, which I hope they do not ruin ( if it happens ). Go check out the movie, I personally found it to be very good and somewhat original. Final Verdict : 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow! This movie completely surpassed my expectations. Well done! Very intense throughout and kept my attention the whole time. I had to cover my mouth a few times either just for the intense scene I was viewing or for sheer shock at what was happening. If the director was going for the shock factor, he nailed it...several times. He even added a few surprises. I'm the type that tries to anticipate surprises and I didn't see any of them coming. I was very grossed-out by a scene in the beginning which I thought was completely unnecessary to the film. Other than that 3 second scene, the rest was dramatic, suspenseful, smart, and shocking. The plot was well thought-out with no holes. The story is detailed just enough so you feel sorry for the characters at times. For a movie with minimal characters, it rocked. I would see it again just to catch anything I might have missed the first time. The actors were superb and very convincing. Want to escape from your own daily drama and stresses? Go see this movie. Really let yourself feel like you are right there and you'll forget about your own drama for a while.</fullReview>

There are a few typical "don't be stupid" moments I found myself wanting to yell at the characters that you might find in even the finest horror films, but "Don't Breathe" proved repeatedly and undeniably that it has a new, terrifying story to tell. The friends who joined me at the movie and I all had spin off ideas we half-halfheartedly kicked around, but legitimately; this is a one-of-a-kind, stand-alone, shocking thrill ride. -A Roller coaster thrill-ride.

		<fullReview>'DON'T BREATHE': Five Stars (Out of Five)The new hit horror flick, from Uruguayan filmmaker Fede Alvarez (who also helmed the hit 2013 horror remake/reboot 'EVIL DEAD'). Alvarez directed, co-produced and co-wrote the movie (with Rodo Sayagues). Horror master Sam Raimi (who of course directed the original 'EVIL DEAD' franchise) also co-produced the flick; which stars Jane Levy, Stephen Lang, Dylan Minnette and Daniel Zovatto. Alvarez, Sayagues, Raimi and Levy all performed the same duties on the 2013 'EVIL DEAD' reboot. The film was made on a budget of just $9.9 million; and it's already made almost three times that, in it's opening weekend. It's gotten almost unanimously rave reviews from critics, and it was another entry in this year's 'Fantasia International Film Festival'. I think it's a masterpiece. Rocky (Levy), Alex (Minnette) and Money (Zovatto) are three young crooks; that rob wealthy customers of Alex's dad's security company. Rocky is trying to make enough money to move her, and her little sister (Emma Bercovici), away from their abusive mom (Katia Bokor). She wants to start a new (happy) life for them, in California. Alex has strong feelings for Rocky, but she's currently dating Money (who's of course an asshole). When the three friends learn of an old Army veteran (Lang), with a $300,000 cash settlement (or more) sitting in his home, the job seems too tempting to pass up. When Alex learns that the man is blind though, and that his young daughter was recently killed in a car accident, he doesn't want to go through with the heist. His feelings for Rocky (of course) motivate him into it. It's a crime that the three criminals desperately soon regret, when the blind vet starts hunting them down, and killing them, in his own (locked-up) home. The movie is about as good as horror films get; it's a soon to be classic (on a Hitchcock level standard)! I'm a big fan of the 2013 'EVIL DEAD' (and of course the original franchise), but this film is even better. The concept of a blind old Army vet, hunting down intruders in his home, is brilliant. Usually only heroes, in films, are handicapped; making it much more inspiring, when they overcome their weaknesses (through hard work and passion, of course). So to make the villain the handicapped one, who's still just as relentless (and terrifying) as any other movie 'bad guy', is really fun to watch. Especially when the protagonists are severely morally flawed, as well. I had so much fun watching this movie, and I can't wait to see it again! Lang is also amazing in it, and I think a sequel could be a lot of fun as well.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/lcZBQp0HBZg</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exactly what the trailer advertised</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Its rare nowadays it feels to see a movie trailer that does exactly what it should do and make you want to see a movie, but not only that.. the movie delivers on every single thing I feel this film represented itself as.Don't Breathe does an amazing job of getting right into the action and not letting up. We only spend a few minutes at most getting to know the main characters, but its more than enough to set the stage and to get the audience to invest in what is going to happen to these characters.As far as scares go, I would say there were maybe 2 or 3 big scares that made me jump in my seat so maybe if you're looking for something really scary then this may not be for you.Bottom line without saying anything remotely close to a spoiler, if you watch the theatrical trailer and said to yourself, "that looks like something I'd watch", then give it your time. You won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is absolutely relentless. It quickly sets up its characters and then jumps straight into the plot. What this film does best is it carefully crafts an atmosphere that feels paper thin. It continuously builds this tension, and you yourself begin to feel unnerved. I attribute a lot of this to the directing. Fede Alvarez does a masterful job of maneuvering his way through this movie, making a small environment such as a house feel like an entire world. I really enjoy contained movies, where the characters are locked in a house or a building and they have to make do with the things surrounding them. And that's what Don't Breathe does. Our characters have to think and act using only the things they can find in this house...</fullReview>

The trio discover a blind war veteran who won a wrongful death settlement as a result of his daughters death.

		<fullReview>A unique movie that actually had me feel tension and fear for once in a horror movie. Beautiful cinematography and a unique concept. My worry for the film was that the blind man would be almost superhuman in his other senses, but the movie portrays him very realistically and conveys a tense and fearful roller-coaster of a ride. It also does not rely on music as much as other horror films do to set up the emotion of a scene. It also was scary in a natural way and did not have to force the fear into you. It did not rely on cheap jump scares and gore fests. The only downside to the film were some common clichés. The girl with a troubled household has the worlds worst mother and the moms boyfriend is covered in Nazi tattoos so he is horrible too. Also they have the good hearted 3rd wheel who likes the girl,but she has a boyfriend and he is a complete a***hole. Those assure the movie was amazing. The acting was amazing on Jane Levy's part and is setting her self up to be the go to protagonist in horror films. The creators of the Evil Dead remake were behind this movie and I loved that movie as well. I can't wait to see what they will do next</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At the end of the day, this movie did its job for its genre as a thriller. It was entertaining, captivating, and there were no dull moments for this film. Most movies tend to start out really slow or have a slow burning effect, but Don't Breathe held an air of suspense for the majority of its screen time. The characters were great for this film; the movie did a good job of introducing the characters and giving you snippets of some of the motives and types of people they were. Stephen Lang was an amazing choice to play the old man. I couldn't help but feel a little bad for the blind man at the beginning, but the more you see him in action and learn about him, the more dangerous and scary he appears.As with most horror and thriller movies, the storyline was not extraordinary or totally unique, but, it's an intense movie that was very gripping and kept you on the edge of your seat.The only flaw of this movie were some obvious "smarter" choices the characters could of made, but for the most part, there were't many times where I was bothered by their decisions - considering the situation they're stuck in.In conclusion, the story was okay, the set-up was okay. Most of the elements were just decent, but it was how they used everything and executed them for this film, creating a thrilling and gripping movie. It's fun and entertaining, and if you enjoy suspenseful films, definitely give it a watch!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>EXCELLENT - But that ending... *SPOILER*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes there is spoilers in this review.First off, this isn't a horror movie it is more of a thriller. "Don't Breathe" lives up to its title. The camera work and sound is amazing, you actually feel the actors trying not to breathe throughout the film which makes you want to hold your breath. Jane Levy is amazing once again as a horror-lead, scream queen and Stephen Lang just BLEW MY MIND! You need to watch this movie just for him.OK, that ending. It's not terrible, definitely not what I expected, but definitely could have been better. Why the writers thought Rocky escaping happily with her daughter and the Blind Man's money was a good idea, I don't know. Obviously that's what the viewers want to happen, but in "movie world" it's just not supposed to end that way. Here are MY opinions on how the movie should have ended;1 - It is about a week later and she is at the airport with her daughter, ready to break free to California like she promised her kid at the beginning of the movie. She sees the news on TV while waiting at the airport about the robbery and how the Blind Man said no belongings were taken. She hears that her flight is boarding and turns around to her daughter but she is gone, implying that she was taken by the Blind Man because Rocky took something of his (money and unborn baby) and he wanted a child.2 - At the beginning of the movie we see the Blind Man dragging Rocky down the middle of the road, she is unconscious and he is obviously bringing her somewhere. This would have been amazing if at the end of the movie she had ended up giving him a child and as promised, he returned her to the world after 9 months, hence dragging her "home".Aside from the ending, it is a must see thriller!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>VIEWS ON FILM review of Don't Breathe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Don't Breathe, one of the main characters is a blind Army veteran. At the beginning of the film, he is seen walking with a standard, blind man's cane. Cut to the last act and it's as if the filmmakers forgot that the dude even lost his own vision. Also in "Breathe", every actor/actress gets severely tortured, beaten, or thrown up against a wall. They get up, dust themselves off, and forge on. Now could any human being survive this kind of carnage? Not a chance in my book. Anyway, these two factors are the only points I shaved off my rating for one of the best releases of 2016. Don't Breathe in essence, seems like a great title for the film I'm about to review. If you choose to check out a screening, you'll be so enthralled you'll forget to um, "breathe" and possibly chew off every fingernail on both hands."Breathe's" director is Fede Alvarez. He made the forgettable remake Evil Dead. Here, he goes from amateur status to almost genius status in a little over three years. Fede comes back with a vengeance giving us one of the most effective thrillers I've seen in a long time. He fits every plot point neatly in place, supplies efficacious close-pus, provides camera-work that feels Brian De Palma-lite, and throws lots of genuine twists and turns at you. And just when you think Don't Breathe is about to end, it just keeps going, relentless and interminable. Does that add to the flick's potency? Uh, you know it.Notice that I labeled "Breathe" a thriller. That's what I believe it to be. Most critics and IMDb enthusiasts have saddled it as a horror fest. I go more with the latter route and it's a nasty and unforgiving one at that. At 88 minutes, "Breathe" is bloodily violent and stomach-turning but not in a demon sort of way. Instead, it absorbs you as if you've been in the theater for 2-plus hours. It's a little movie made on a tiny budget (under $10 million) but it nestles in your brain and has a big chip on its shoulder. If you're a fan of suspense and like simple agog, genre pleasures, Don't Breathe is the ticket. "Don't" hesitate to get your butt to the multiplex to see it. Natch.Taking place in Detroit, Michigan (which is made to look like modern day Beirut), containing only a smidgen of actors, and produced by the legendary Sam Raimi, Don't Breathe is lean and mean with remnants of films like The Descent and Cujo to keep you floored. It has no real protagonist or hero. Everyone involved is a bad person in their own little way. The story is about three lawless thieves named Rocky (Reese Witherspoon lookalike Jane Levy), Money (Daniel Zovatto), and Alex (Dylan Minnette). They break into people's houses and are very successful at it until they meet their match trying to rob a guy simply known as "The Blind Man" (played nicely by Avatar's Stephen Lang). "The Blind Man" knows how to fire a gun, knows how to arm himself with fists, and obviously has darn good hearing. He senses these cocky kids are trying to steal a money settlement from him in his old, rundown house (the amount of the settlement is I guess, $300k). Bad move. "The Blind Man" kills one of the thieves (spoiler) and traps the other two in his abode until he is able to finish them off as well. "The Blind Man" with his snarly dog to aid him, also bolts everything up and turns his whole place into a fun house you'd find at an amusement park. Watch for a scene a la Silence of the Lambs in which he turns all the lights off so that his captors can experience what he experiences everyday. Also, check out the opening shot where a body is being dragged on a deserted street. You don't know what you're seeing until the camera eventually zooms in. Pretty unexpected.Bottom line: Despite its minimal shortcomings, Don't Breathe is grubby, dirty, and darkened with above average performances. It is by turns original, indigenous, and tension-filled. A new classic. Rating: 3 and a half stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Something About It</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Something about it was just really good. It was crudely scary, but for some reason it was interesting, like a documentary.I thought all the actors were older than me. They don't list the age of the 1st person who died, but the others were younger than me and I'm born in 1986. It makes me happy to see that younger actors are breaking into the business. They need to be seen more and make their mark. I personally was interested in acting, but it's so competitive, even if you aren't really that fat! It's like you have to be perfect these days,no double chin for most main dramatic roles.The old man was pretty condescending. He seemed rather cool as a person. I wonder why he is so annoyed by the intruders. I found the girl to be the most agitated, I guess, a very doll-like beauty about her, too. It was sad how the boy who wanted to get out ended up suffering so, as well, however the girl survived. It is strange how happy people seemed that the old man was able to kill his intruders.The side drama with the girl's family is interesting and how she survived and was with her sister again. They throw children into horror movies, which I enjoy because it reminds me of when I was a kid and my friends were into horror movies. I never saw them, and they were rated R, anyway, probably. I like them a lot now and see them when I go to the movies and they're out. I like the paranormal things a lot, which seems to be what most horror movies are.I really grew attached to all 3 main characters. It seemed to possess a competitive edge, to it, too. The boy was really sweet. He is actually born in 1996. The girl is born in 1989.There seems to be a hidden meaning about the man taking care of his own situations, too. Rather than have the government publicize it for him, he takes matters into his own hands, like he can't get enough revenge for what he hates and loathes. You know, rather than say posting your problems online, he just wants to fight. I do that, sometimes, try to justify and debate things with others telepathically or usually hopefully just thinking and justifying things to myself as they make themselves appear. Ultimately, I'm thinking the only way out is to post it online, for the world to see.So, great work of the cast and all working together and pulling off what they did. I was really interested in this one in how it worked out and didn't leave the theater!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't mess with the blind man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't Breathe is a tight, thriller that doesn't let up. There were several parts of the film where I was convinced we were nearing the end, only to be grabbed by the throat and dragged back in. Three young criminals are trying to get out of Detroit and onto bigger and better things. In order to do so they need cash, and lots of it. After receiving information on a potential big score, the group decides to go for it. The target is a blind, Iraq War veteran who is rumored to have $300,000 somewhere in his house. What looks like a cake walk turns into a nightmarish game of cat and mouse that will leave you truly holding your breath until the very end.Alvarez reunites with Jane Levy, his leading lady from Evil Dead. Levy really wowed me in that film and I was excited to see her in a new role with new scares. While some actors are remembered for their screams in horror films, it's Levy's eyes that stand out. They convey so much emotion, and given that a good amount of this film requires her character to remain silent, she pulls it off brilliantly. Accompanying Levy is veteran actor Stephen Lang as The Blind Man. Lang's screen and stage presence is well documented in productions like Gettysburg, Avatar, and as Col. Jessup in the original stage production of A Few Good Men. His intimidating physique makes him the perfect choice to play this role.Alvarez assembled a great team of actors, but his best selection might have been behind the camera with cinematographer Pedro Luque. He was the cinematographer for La Casa Muda, (The Silent House) a film that almost doesn't deserve the genius camera-work from Luque. He shot the film to appear like one continuous take and the result is truly unique. He didn't disappoint here either with some great tracking shots and an unforgettable chase scene in the basement.Luque's images are made even creepier thanks to brilliant sound design. Sound ups are common in horror films, and there are plenty to jump at in this film. While those work great they can be tiresome. I prefer the quiet moments. The shuffling of feet, creaking floor boards, and muffled breathing not only intensify the mood, they force the viewer to fill in the silence with their own imagination. It's like when you here something in your own home and you don't know what it is. You run through every possible scenario until you find the source.When the credits starting rolling I felt like I myself had spent the night in the house. With a run time of just under 90 minutes, they really jam packed every second of it. While the dialogue isn't anything to write home about (especially the first act), it doesn't detract from the story (I watch for scares, not for the conversations). A fine job all around and hopefully just the beginning of a long career for Alvarez. With two big films under his belt already, I can't wait to see what he has in store for us next!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Never ending suspense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't BreatheFede Alvarez will soon be a household name in the horror genre (he probably already is) bc of the ultra gory and fun Evil Dead remake and also this instant gem of 2016. The storyline is pretty simple it didn't try to reinvent the wheel or anything but they executed it very well. The characters are surprisingly likable (and resourceful) despite them being anti- heroes. Fede really wanted to make a different and less bloodier flick so this one is toned down but u can still expect disturbing and highly suspenseful scenes throughout the short runtime. And lemme tell you i just LOVE the fact that they toyed with my feelings by giving a lot of false endings and it made me root for the leads so much more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Who knew there was still an original exciting thriller to be made? There isn't anything deja vu about this very well paced and directed movie. The camera work is excellent showing just what you need to see to be scared but never leaving you confused. There is a skewered sympathy for the characters - the 3 protagonists are bad guys - burglar scums you can't really feel sorry for. The person who they rob is a victim of sorts blind Iraq veteran but flawed as you will find out. The story is good with unpredictable but still plausible twists. You never feel cheaply shocked or let down by an unbelievable twist. It's more exciting when you are kind of rooting for both sides at the same time.Steven Lang is well cast as the blind man. The other cast including Jane Levy and Dylan Minnette make bad characters kind of sympathetic. Best thriller in recent memory. A breathtaking roller coaster ride. Kudos to the director, screenwriter and actors.Deserves to top the box office.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Screen Gems' new horror film, #DontBreathe is terrifying and unpredictable. The suspense never lets go from start to finish. Well-crafted, with twists and turns around every corner, it's one of the scariest films you'll see this year.Starring Jane Levy, Dylan Minnette, Daniel Zovatto and Stephen Lang, scripted by Rodo Savagues and Fede Alvarez who also directed this film, the story is about three best friends who've been breaking and entering and robbing several houses, and they want to get to the biggest score so they can finally get away from their broken lives. That biggest score is a house belonging to a blind man, it's supposed to be an easy job, right? Well, the blind man's got some tricks up his sleeves, turns out, he is not somebody you'd want to mess with.Personally, I was surprised by how good this film is because I was not a fan of Fede Alvarez's "Evil Dead" remake a few years back which was more concerned about being gory than being scary. But DON'T BREATHE will have you tense the entire time just like the characters themselves because it's filled with moments of silence and surprises. It's basically a cat-and-mouse chase game inside a locked and barricaded house. The ones getting chased don't know their way around the house, obviously, and the one doing the chasing, even though he's blind, let's just say that because of his background, he comes with a particular set of skills. And on top of that, there's a deep dark secret that adds to the layers and makes the characters' survival mode go to the extreme level. This is a very well-staged, well-crafted film that successfully banks on the audiences' not knowing what's going to happen in every single scene.-- Rama's Screen --</fullReview>

The amount of mystery, thrill, irony; comprised with compelling sound design, camera-work, editing, pacing, acting (with almost perfect character development) &amp; a "90 min running time" (which can be very hit or miss in the genre) that feels more like 100, an awesome marketing campaign, and a 3rd act that does more than just balance out the first 2 acts, all stirs up into a well made, original masterpiece. By far one of his best films. Forget what you saw in the trailer, and go see it at your local theater playing it in the deluxe DOLBY ATMOS theater;GO SEE IT YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's no gratuitous violence, gore and disturbing behavior even though the plot demanded it because every violent, gory and disturbing action/reaction made complete sense according to what one would expect from a home invasion of a blind Iraq War veteran with possible PTSD who also lost a loved one.And that's the worm that constantly turned in my head figuring out who to sympathize with...the invaders? or the blind veteran? That, along with the slowly increasing disturbing behavior of the blind man and strategic cat &amp; mouse maneuvers in a small, old house, put me right in the middle of it to where I thought I was gonna' go mad.And just when I thought the good guys? bad guys? home invaders were going to get away scot-free, they're thrown right back in it with even more unexpected bizarrely life threatening results that make both antagonist? and victim? up their game and reveal what they're truly made of physically, emotionally and morally. I mean a video game inspired just from the cleverness of the escapes and captures would make for an exciting thrill ride.And finally this is a movie that sets up a believable plot twist at the end for a possible sequel that makes complete sense. A sequel I greatly look forward to.</fullReview>

I know girls like to wear strong perfume i am surprised they didn't bring that angle into it. Movie is sort of predictable but at least it looks nice and sounds great.

		<fullReview>The overall plot is pretty simple and the sub plot while only are review after one-third of the movie, is still predictable. However, this absolute masterpiece is based on masterful suspension with a dark theme. It will keep you tense through the whole movie. However, the director is skillful in controlling the paced, not falling into the chasm of movies such as BvS since the story is so simple you won't have to wonder why. Moreover, viewers never know what, when and where the villain may strike thanks to the way every shot is calculated and placed at near perfection. The only thing I felt out of tune is the ending scene, while somewhat satisfying, is far too bland for a movie this dark and messed up The intensity of the film is so overwhelming that while the soundtrack does not reach the desirable bar, nobody even notices it. Every character developed their personality mostly through action rather then words ( which is rare in this movie ) and yet still make the audience feel related and make the movie darker at the same time. A thriller, yet is probably one of those few classic that crosses over to the territory of Horror genre with this kind of fast-paced tension.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went in to this film not expecting to feel scared or frightened, but oh was I wrong. This film manages to frighten you with just the dead silence. Another thing that this film does well is conflict your allegiance with the three main characters. At first, all three of the main characters come off as inconsiderate punks who have no regard for the people they steal from, but as the story progresses when they rob the blind man, you sort of hope they make it out alive when you see how monstrous the blind man can be.Only drawbacks to this film are some basic logical fallacies. Additionally, I thought the film makers may have over-exaggerated the blind man's abilities. Other than that, I recommend watching this film. It is definitely better than the average horror movie these days.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Deadly Blind Man's Bluff</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anyone ever wonder how a blind person "views" a movie? I have been dating a blind guy for some years now. What you would do is get a device called "audio description" (ask for it at the box office.) It is required by ALL theaters to have it due to the Handicap Law. But sometimes--theaters do not and it doesn't always work. It is about the size of a Walkman and descriptions are given to the wearer about the scenes and action going on in the movie. If you are taking a blind person---They definitely WILL need this device.But anyhow...my "blind date" heard about the movie and wanted to "see" it. Don't Breathe is a movie that contains a lot of action and plot twists. The movie action and scenes move very quickly and to the point. Three punk teens are involved in a burglary ring. They make there vocation by breaking in homes, robbing and vandalizing them. For some reason, I don't know how but because of their lives--one girl named Rocky, a struggling abused single mother, one boy named Alex who lives in the shadow of his successful father (who owns a burglar alarm business--it's how Alex gets his info)and one common thief named Money that you tend to feel that they are somewhat justified for their crimes. But Alex gets some info about some blind war vet with a lot of money in his house. Perfect score, right?WRONG! the blind vet turns out to be a homicidal maniac who is driven mad about the death of his daughter. The blind guy is VERY skilled with a gun and he uses his other senses to survive this home invasion. It I definitely no cake walk robbing this guy.My blind date was amused somewhat about this blind vet turned into a "Super Blink" He knew just how to protect himself and he did no the basic skills they teach the blind for everyday life. (Blind people listen very accurately and count steps and doorways in homes.) The violence is there---by today's standards and the gore factor is slim but the action twists and turns are abundant. Maybe a lot of hokum --killing people and beating them and they STILL get up. I won't give away the ending--for some reason it give me a strange feeling--but I can see a sequel possibly.So I would recommend it--good summer suspense that is not boring.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't Breathe has one of the most interesting ideas for a movie I've seen in a long time, and it doesn't fail to provide a good movie to go along with it. The characters, story, and twists could have used some work in my opinion, especially nearing the half-way mark, but it didn't take away too much from the rest of the movie since scene structure and pacing were done so well. Despite being classified under the horror genre, I found it to be less scary and more suspenseful than anything else. If does a great job of setting the atmosphere, and making the audience feel connected to the characters. All in all, Don't Breathe is a very well made horror/thriller that I don't think people are going to forget about any time soon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't Breathe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't Breathe, is a film that I thought within the first little while of watching it was setting itself up for what could be a really interesting horror film, but also one that had something interesting to say as well. Take for example that the film is set in the present time and takes place in Detroit, Michigan. The film shows dilapidated and run down houses and shows an economy that is far from booming and that basically the people who live there are living in shabby conditions and don't have a lot of money, or the best resources to support themselves. This is interesting by itself for the simple and honest fact that just a handful of years ago, Detroit did end up going bankrupt and the city was in dire need of an economic and financial rescue. The film could have really gone somewhere with this and made an interesting social commentary about it such as the fact that the main characters in the film basically support themselves by breaking and entering into houses and selling the goods they receive on the black market. They do this because this is the only way of life and the only way to make cash that they know of and it is their dream to eventually move out of this impoverished community and eventually head to California, where despite droughts and potential earthquakes, the economy is always booming and there are jobs in abundance, or so it seems in the film industry and movies themselves. This could have been an interesting social comment, or just a thoughtful look at how many people in the world are suffering now with little to no money and having to resort to desperate acts in order to take care of themselves. Something else that could have given food for thought, or added some much needed depth to the film was the character of the blind man. While, I am not going to say too much as to not give away any spoilers, I will say that he is a man tormented by inner demons which have all seemed to have befallen him through no fault of his own and now has made him the bitter and twisted person that he is. Things such as loss of loved ones plus the horrors and traumas of war also come into play here. As said earlier, these could have all made for the ingredients of an interesting film and one that has something to say, but unfortunately the film never really does anything with these interesting plot build ups, but instead just lets the film fall into familiar territory and become like so many horror films that we see on the mainstream market nowadays. The sad thing here is that the film is technically well made with excellent direction, cinematography, editing and the acting is better than most horror films these days allow for. I will even credit the film and say that there is certainly a fair bit of tension at least for the first little while of the film and it does have a couple of moments where it leaves the audience in actual fear, or suspense which is a job that is not easily done for horror filmmakers recently. These are all strong points of the film and for the first while the film really captured my interest from the second it started, but the unfortunate thing here again is that the film is basically a game of cat and mouse and even though the film is relatively short in it's running time, the sad thing is it becomes tiresome and I began to lose interest way before the end credits started to roll. Things in the film just kept getting more and more preposterous and hard to believe and it seems like they were just using all the old tricks in the book to keep this film going and trying to be interesting, but by that point I had long stopped caring and I was more, or less just waiting for the film to end, so I could go home again. This is a film that certainly showed potential with items and agendas that could have been really eye opening, but would also make not only a thrilling, but engaging film and yet the filmmakers seemed to have run out of steam early on and not really knew how to conclude this film, or elevate it to any higher levels of quality. While it stands it is far from the worst film of the year and it does have enough merits to it, but there have been better horror films lately and sadly this is far from one of them which makes this film more of a rental, or a television watch than to actually go and sink money into the theatre to see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horror has a new name!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The power of a film's opening establishing shot cannot be under-estimated. If done well it will pull the viewer in and the storytelling becomes an easier job. One of my favourite opening shots hails from Highlander (1986). It has that curious gaze on a scene of mayhem that breathes with unusual counterpoints. It is hypnotising, beguiling, almost surreal, as you try to make sense of it. However I can't say the rest of the film did that clever opening scene any justice. Don't Breathe, on the other hand, has none of these issues. It opens with a scene that feels weirdly out of place but yet has a visceral and realistic quality about it. Questions whizzed through my mind as I silently prayed that the journey of discovery be a rewarding one. It is. Oh my... It fricking is. Uruguayan writer/director Fede Alvarez's debut is a remake of Evil Dead (1981) called.... ahem.... Evil Dead (2013). It is loud, deafening and pours a swimming pool of blood all over you because he thinks more is good. His sophomore effort Don't Breathe is quieter, superbly lo-fi and the scares hit a lot harder. Running at 88 minutes, this is one lean, mean, crackerjack of a movie. Nary a scene is wasted. It resembles Netflix's Hush a lot in the sense that it is a home invasion psychological horror film and the homeowner is physically impaired. In the excellent Hush, the female victim is a deaf mute, while in Don't Breathe we get a blind man. But mark this, the similarities end there. Hush is a straight up thriller and we can easily root for the victim and celebrate her clever one-ups against the psychopath. In Don't Breathe we don't get that luxury and our sympathies for each character will sway across the board. There is an air of unpredictability permeating throughout the movie and the tension slowly rams up to dizzying hair-pulling levels. There are some inventive scenes that press the "genre refresh" button and if you have been watching as many of these genre flicks as I have, that is something quite rare. The best character here is definitely The Blind Man played devilishly well by Stephen Lang. His dialogue is very spare but when it comes it will send a shiver down your spine. He is feral, doesn't listen to desperate cries of mercy and is a force of primal nature. Being blind means naught to him because he knows the lay of his house like the back of his massive hand. The battleground is his playground. You can go in but you can't get out. At a certain point we discover a sickening secret about him and it is such an uncomfortable eye-popping moment. But yet it is a powerful scene because I started to pity his heartbreaking desperation. Lang has brought his A game and it is a character that will haunt me for a long time. The cinematography is fluid and really brings out the claustrophobic feel of pure terror. Alvarez has delivered a thoroughly satisfying genre horror flick that is definitely not derivative. Evil Dead (2013) is forgotten. Don't Breathe is Alvarez's new first horror film. Horror has a new name. Remember his name.</fullReview>

It is a great movie but this one, unless you are into non-stop brutality, don't waste your time. This was a blind vet who had super strength and power, now the dog in the movie added some decent horror scenes but all in all, not a film my generation can relate to and enjoy. If this is what the younger generation gives an 8 out of 10 too, that is pretty scary in itself. Also hard to believe there was one really nice house in a neighborhood of falling down houses.

		<fullReview>Is this what passes for "horror" these days? At least the cheesy horror from the 80's never took itself seriously and was still scary! Don't Breathe has no right to call itself a horror even if it was created by the guys who made the Evil Dead.First of all it's another one of those movies that are billed the "scariest movie ever..." Blah blah blah, they've been saying that ever since the Blair witch project. This movie wasn't the worst thing I've seen, Stephen Lang does well playing a blind guy but the movie is mostly annoying people sneaking around the house, it gets old fast!That brings me to the rest of the cast, namely the 3 other leads, who seem to be the most cliché characters ever! The trio consist of the token hot girl, the asshole and the nerd! (Guess which one lives and which one gets killed) hmmm ... What's more these people are playing criminals growing up in a poor run down neighbourhood and looking at them you would think they are models in a Calvin Klein commercial! Very realistic Mr Director!!The other thing that annoyed me to tears was that horrible sound effect, you know the one, its in just about every movie you see these days, it sounds like a low pitched long metallic metal scraping sound! I think it was in every damn scene!This movie had potential but then they made the viewer feel sorry for the criminals and made the poor old blind guy the villain, that's where it lost me.. One thing I did appreciate however was the homage to Cujo at the end, I'm not sure if this was intentional or a rip off but I noticed it.. The dog attacking the woman inside the car (which was the same make and model in both films by the way)..In summing up, the movie started off okay but then got worse unfortunately.. It was actually boring, there was no gore surprisingly and the characters were cliché..</fullReview>

But this was a bit different from the above said track and definitely hit the right chord what an intense thriller has to deliver.Some of you might come back and argue it's a home invasion thriller but why I deny that point is here the invaders become the victims of the inmate of the house.Long story short three friends break into a house of a blind man thinking it would be a piece of cake to rob some dollars and run, but they didn't know that they are in for a crazy ride of survival. Well that's enough not to spoil further as this much was shown in the trailers.Stephan Lang as the blind man had nailed it to the core where he didn't have long dialogues but has brought out the fierceness and terrifying looks through his actions and body language. I would say he provided me more thrills than other creature feature movies so old uncle feature wins the creature feature. Jane the lady from Evil dead's recent remake has also emoted well and her desperation over the money even in the life or death situation was a shocking surprise. Very well managed budget movie inside a small house but can sure give you at least five six jumping up moments and stopping the heart beat moments for sure. Get in and you will enjoy the thrills by this crazy old man.I would definitely give a 7.5 on 10. Except for the logic holes here and there the movie delivers 100%. Thrills and chills guaranteed. Watch it in the theatre.-Sivakumar Balachandran</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Breathe and you die.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As someone who is extremely frustrated with horror movies these days, I can definitely say that 2016 has been a great year for Horror and R rated feature films, and Fede Alvarez's "Don't Breathe" is no exception, "Don't Breathe" is an intense, inventive, and well crafted offering from the people who brought you 2013's "Evil Dead" remake, the film is definitely not without its faults, it lacks character development, doesn't quite know how to end itself, features some questionable acting, and is plagued by stupidity like most Horror films, but thanks to Alvarez's great direction, Stephen Lang's haunting performance, and being a unique twist on the home invasion Horror/Thriller, it succeeds more than it fails.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Tidy Little Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I admired the pacing, the surprises and general flow of action, all tied up at the end with a pretty ribbon. But the movie somehow left me flat.Thinking back to classics like Vertigo and North by Northwest, I realized that character does matter even in a Boo movie. At first I liked the idea that we jumped right into the action without a lot of buildup, but then the characters started to feel 2-D.The girl Rocky wasn't convincing as an abused teen turned bad. She had Good Girl, not Bad Girl, makeup and hair. Alex was a Good Guy with no personality whatsoever. The blind guy was great, though.The other problem was basic lack of plot. Yes, we don't get Wuthering Heights at a screamfest, but the repetition, albeit with twists, as one critic pointed out, was like a dance. Wham! Wham! Scuttle scuttle scuttle. Wham! Wham! Scuttle scuttle scuttle. It reminded me of a Punch and Judy show.In spite of the adroit direction, there were odd lapses. SPOILER! In one scene the blind guy is standing over Alex with giant garden shears - then dives for his belly. In a scene not longer afterward, Alex hugs his belly briefly, then gets up and walks around as usual - no hole in gut.Rocky falls on her head down a steep ventilation shaft but has no broken bones. Not even a concussion. These are hardy teens! Don't Breathe is worth the admission but not worth all the hype.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice Little Thriller.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nice little thriller. For the first hour or so, at least.I went in knowing very little about it with low expectations and was pleased. Very tense. Believable acting. Flawed, but not completely unsympathetic characters kept me engaged. Good cinematography. Editing wasn't distracting. Neither was the music. Nice running time, too; they didn't stretch the movie out to two hours and overstay it's welcome.Third act had me cringing more from storytelling choices than from the story itself. (Particularly, *Spoiler?, the implication at one point that atheism necessarily leads to immorality. Ugh. My SJW blood pressure started pumping.)Enjoyable, original flick, though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good but the third act is kinda lame</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not trying to be too eloquent on this one. If you're expecting a gruesome anti-home invasion slasher that this is not. Kids try to rob a crazy war vet and pay a heavy price. The villain is well played but surprisingly run of the mill. He has an agenda but its not scary or anything. This is more of a thriller more along the lines of "People under the stairs" rather than something like bizarre like "The Collector". Nearly all the characters are sympathetic. I liked that. If you're going to watch characters breath and creep around its important that they be compelling. I have to give it an honest 8/10. Don't get me wrong I thoroughly enjoyed the vast majority of the film, but it has some problems.-1 Stephen Lang's dialog was surprisingly milquetoast. I felt like with the few lines he has it could have been a bit more interesting or poetic. -1 Third act has too many false endings and dragsAll that said I wanna give a special nod to them filming in that apparently abandoned neighborhood. I'm curious as to where that was exactly. It really helped the sense of loneliness and lack of escape. It was really creepy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The fact that I was holding my breath during three-fourths of the movie is saying something. This is by far the BEST horror movie since The Conjuring 2 (2016). It was scarier than Conjuring 2, more thrilling, and just amazing. Horror is a dying genre and Don't Breathe (2016) just woke it back up. Its also a big deal when the jump scares are real, not cheap, false scares.Every jump scare used scared me. Also i got that feeling in my stomach where i was so nervous about the next jump scare that i just wanted to run out and curl up into a bar saying, "NO NO NO NO" It was truly amazing. In fact, since i saw it opening night there was a woman who asked everyone what they thought of the movie and almost everyone said, "Really Good" or "Great" I, for one, said "AMAZING!" I honestly can not wait to go see it again, even thought I'm not a see-movies-again person. I'm really hoping for this movie to be at Halloween Horror Nights this year! Don't miss this movie! And also don't let anyone ruin it for it by telling you anything!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't Turn a Blind Eye to This UnScary Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The end of August is usually full of blunt films that are meant to fill spaces, but sometimes Hollywood knows how to close out the summer in style. The promise of this weekend is the latest horror film called Don't Breathe. Robbie K here, and I'm back to share my opinions and advice on the latest movies. Do we have a champion horror movie? Or are we fooled once again. As always?read on to find out. LIKES: ? Suspense ? Plot twists ? Good paceWhen a trailer promises suspense, my experience has been a few on the seat moments often deluded by cheesy plot lines and over exaggerated monsters. Fortunately, Don't Breathe decided to cast its die another way to deliver on what was promised. The movie is filled with suspense from the moment the "heroes" enter the house and begin their journey to rob a blind man. Using very simple, though well planned, tactics our main cast of three traverse the dark corridors in hopes of escaping with their lives. Many of the audience cringed with the creak of a rogue floor board, waiting for the military man to appear and hunt his prey. One doesn't realize how silent things are until that sudden sound effect pops out. Yes, the presentation certainly gives you the suspense you are craving, but that's not the only thing they did right. In terms of plot, horror movies often have quality components, but as a whole are mundane, unoriginal, and formulaic. This movie is very similar to many films, but stands out for the plot twists thrown into the mix. You can get some of these twists from the trailers, however our screenplay writers dropped a few bombs into the mix that take the story down a new road. These surprises keep things fresh and add more urgency to the moment to further bring the thrills you sought with the trailer. And even better its presented at a quick pace that adds more energy to the scenes and a since of adventure that you often miss in horrors. It all feels like a visual version of the most dangerous game and doesn't dawdle to deliver the good stuff. DISLIKES: ? Overly drawn out at times ? Not that scary ? Uber cheesyOkay?I know that horror movies are always a stretch of the imagination and there are a lot of overly done moments. Don't Breathe, while more on the realistic side, certainly drops into many moments that sometimes feel like it won't end. While some of these moments are focused on narrow misses in the basement, or dodging shots from a gun with seemingly infinite ammunition. My main issue has to be with some of more violent moments, watching the buff military guy beat down the trespassers in vicious fury. Yeah, it delivers some swift justice, but hearing the sounds of squishing blood and grunts of pain gets stupid after a while. I can't say most of it was pointless, but our director may need to get checked out for how much he seemed to enjoy the violent moments. In fact, it seems that the violence was the focus that the scares were left out. Speaking of which?.The scare factor of this movie was not really there for me. Oh sure, a whacked out marine sergeant with a wicked temper and skills is a scary thing to witness due to the realism factor. However, it is not the thing to keep me up at night, minus one of the scenes near the middle of the film. The Blind Man is not the creepy, nightmare inducing monsters/demons/spirits that the genre is famous for. In fact, you kind of feel sorry for him at times which dilutes the scary/creepy factor for most of the film. And the movie fails to use the creepy edge and replaces it with those jump scare moments you can see coming from a mile away. Maybe if they had added a serial killer edge, or a creeped out mental patient moment it would have sweetened the pot.Finally, the last dislike is the cheesy moments in the film. Before you rip me a new one and say this review is useless hear me out. Yes, horror movies are cheesy it's what allows for the monsters and situations to exist that fans want to dive into. Unfortunately for me that cheesiness took a turn down the wrong avenue for me. First of all, the whole situation wouldn't exist if the main characters weren't overzealous thieves trying to justify their action. The means for the movie made my eyes roll and I actually cheered against the kids in the beginning because of how much I disliked them. In addition, the convenient elements (e.g. guns with lots of shots, vents that are just the right size, and surprisingly resistant bodies) are just some of the other cheesy things they amplify in this movie. I'll give them props for resourcefulness though and managing to dilute the factors to fit into the suspense. The Verdict:When it comes to Don't Breathe, the word Thriller is the most appropriate way to describe this film. It provides the continuous suspense that your attention craves and throws enough surprises into the mix to make a decent tale. However, in terms of scary, I can't say it was the most system shocking of the mix. Still I have to recommend this one for the crowd who longs for a fast paced horror who like a bunch of close calls. Yet for the rest of the world, hold out for this one and catch it at Redbox in a few months. My scores:Horror/Thriller: 7.0 (Thriller alone a 7.5) Movie Overall: 6.5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Downright scary and inventive.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Almost 50 years ago I was thrilled by Wait Until Dark, a horror film in which a usually demure Audrey Hepburn, playing a recently divorced blind woman, turns the tables on three thugs who invade her home. Today in Don't Breathe the tables are turned a different way: a blind man (Stephen Lang) gives as good as he gets while three young thieves try to rob his home. As for home invasion, Straw Dogs, with no blind motif, left me hoping for more of it all.Set in decaying Detroit, the thieves, Rocky (Jane Levy); Alex (Dylan Minnette); and Money (Daniel Zovatto) are themselves rotten robbers, hitting homes for which Rocky's dad's security business unwittingly supplies the keys. In this blighted neighborhood the blind man is the last holdout, although he's well equipped for trouble with his Vietnam experience, a vicious Rottweiler, and $300,000 to protect.Although nothing scary is outside the purview of the standard horror film, director Fede Alvarez and DP Pedreo Luque take the steadicam to new heights of ingenuity by tracking through the claustrophobic corridors and air ducts along with wounded thieves and the rabid dog. The bird's eye shots outside the house, rather than giving hope for relief, serve well to isolate the proceedings with nary a hope for relief for anyone in the house. The jump scares are standard horror, but somehow they feel new or at least unexpected.Most everyone in Don't Breathe gets a comeuppance, some more deserving than others. A sense of justice pervades the proceedings just like the appropriateness of the decay motif. However I want to spin the themes, even ones that comment obliquely about the war in Vietnam and urban blight, what is most important for the horror genre are scares.You may not breathe during the many scary set pieces, and as you consider their allegorical implications, you'll be glad you had the bejesus scared out of you because that's why you're there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Highly over-hyped</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I came to watch this movie w great expectations after the raving reviews and high ratings. My enthusiasm quickly evaporated. The movie is about a botched home invasion. Rocky, her boyfriend Money and another friend Alex break into houses to make a living in collapsing Detroit. They want to make a last job before moving to California (chasing a warped version of the American dream?). The target looks too easy, a house on a deserted street owned by an old blind army vet who collected a six figure settlement for the death of his daughter. The break in does not go as smoothly as expected however. The story is relatively simple and as everything is happening in a confined space/time, the challenge is to keep it going for 88 minutes.I had several problems w the movie. - The story line feels too scripted, too artificial and sweaty All the backdrops are clichés, as if standard ingredients for a simple dish which the chef over-seasons, over-complicates and over-kills.- There are several holes/illogical events which try to hold the story together. These tricks are just too disruptive for the flow of the film.- The characters are too shallow and predictable stereotypes. The only exception is the blind army vet, but his senses and character get both messed up. Stephen Lang brings a powerful performance, nevertheless he cannot overcome the shortcomings of the movie.There are just way too many scenes/events/twists and action. It seems that writer/director Fede Alvarez wanted to impress too hard (I admit its not easy to keep up story, suspense and thrill for one and half hours for a simple home invasion). Less could have been definitely more and a slower pace would have helped (he just does not have that weight and depth I guess yet).my take: If you are into a scary, annoying and confusing 88 minute ride, then get in. Otherwise stay away.liked the most: vision of old-glory-long-gone dead streets in Detroit suburb and the voice of the dog like a growling classic V8</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If I would have known how weird this movie would be, I wouldn't have invited my mother along with me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie generated a lot of hype in it's early screenings, and the trailer seemed to promise a tense and violent romp. It definitely delivered lots of nerve-wrackingly tense moments that had the theater jumping without necessarily using the classic "jump scare" tactic. The acting was good, and all of the characters were well- written enough to have a lot of likable and unlikable moments, which was a nice break from usual horror stereotypes. I can see how people would be praising it as a horror masterpiece because it definitely was scary without being cliché. It was a lot of fun to watch in theaters.So if I have so much positive feedback, why give it a six instead of something higher? The reason is there were at least two very obvious plot holes to me while watching that were never resolved. The beginning of the movie made me somewhat dislike the main characters, who seemed to lack any real intelligence until they're actually trying to survive in the house. The ending was about three scenes too long, and the whole "evil guy never dies and is also able to be everywhere at once" mechanic begins to wear a little thin by the end of the movie.Also, there is THAT one scene. Get ready for it. Do not make the same mistake I did and think that the popularity of the movie meant there would not be one extremely weird and disturbing moment that would make you regret bringing your mother along with you. I personally love the weird and slightly obscene in horror movies, but this one does nothing to prepare you for what is to come. Maybe if I had walked into the theater with a different mindset, this movie would have been more successful for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Morally this film disturbed movie. The more ethical young man in the film goes through hell while trying to save the female lead and makes smart moves until her lack of judgment in a crisis inevitably costs him his life. The female lead is a complete narcissist, as if her childhood trauma justifies her behavior and she ends up making selfish choices, gets her friends killed, and seemingly gets away with robbery and attempted murder. The scene which probably is emblematic of this day and age is when he tries to artificially inseminate her and she completely freaks out... Her reaction to this was way worse than seeing her friends die. Oh no Ms. Narcissist, you won't be able to selfishly spend all that money you just stole if you're a young mother. If that director wants to accurately depict a rape of sorts than just have her walk around alone in France, Germany, or in dearborn Michigan. Anyway, there were no morals or positive message of the film. It's almost as if the criminals were glorified and despite the "killer" having a girl kidnapped in the basement, his only crime was wanting to have another child and to be left alone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a bad movie, but definitely overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, the concept was very original. Three thieves set out to rob a blind man of his money late one evening in a deserted neighborhood while he's sleeping. The film did a decent job of building up suspense, but not quite as good as I'd hoped for a movie like this. I never felt that feeling of dread like "something bad is on the horizon" I felt while watching 'Halloween" or the original 'Friday the 13th'. Once the main characters break into the house, they soon realize that their piece of cake robbery of a blind man will not be so easy. My biggest problem I had with the film was that the blind man pretty much anticipated the thieves' every move. While this worked the first couple of times, it started to become repetitive and really worked against the film. Yes, he was a very smart war veteran with heightened senses of hearing and smell (worked for the film). Yes, his military training gave him an advantage (worked for the film). But over and over, the characters would try to escape, and he would be there waiting for them at the precise time and location when they arrived. It's almost like I got the feeling the writers wanted to make this character absolutely perfect, with no flaws, weaknesses or mistakes. That to me, just didn't ring true in this situation. I won't spoil it, but this was especially true near the end when it really seemed like the blind man had superhuman powers to escape any situation.Overall, a decent movie bogged down by its unrealistic character.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't Breathe - Review: Refreshing but Lacking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fede Alvarez (director of the Evil Dead remake) is back with a new horror movie called Don't Breathe. I for one didn't like Fede Alvarez's remake of the Evil Dead. I thought the Evil Dead remake was fantastic from a technical aspect, however, the movies overall execution was seriously lacking.First off, Don't Breathe has an interesting premise, three kids attempt to rob a blind man, but the blind man is not as helpless as they think.I thought the premise of this movie was truly refreshing, I'm sick of seeing movies about ghost and demons, and so I was glad that this one strayed away from that and told something basic.The directing is pretty stylish, the camera moves swiftly, and it's filled with nice tracking shots.Jane Levy, Dylan Minnette, and Daniel Zovatto all deliver a believable performance. Stephen Lang plays the blind character, his performance is memorable and convincing because it requires more demand.Just like in the Evil Dead remake, all of the technical aspects are fine, but the movies overall execution is lacking.I didn't care about any of the characters well-being, except for the blind man. The characters presented here gave me absolutely no reason to care about them or their outcomes. I sympathized with the blind man because of his overall situations, but I didn't care about the kids because there was no reason to. The movie didn't explain what the three main characters overall situations were, it doesn't have to, but I thought it would've at least made sense to provide the audience with minor information.The suspense presented in the movie is top-notch. I was on the edge of my seat as the movie progressed. There's not much that happens here as far as death scenes are concerned, but what is present is a whole lot of suspense.Overall, I enjoyed this movie, for the most part, it's a suspenseful piece of work, but it lacks in character development. Don't Breathe is an extremely refreshing horror movie, it's properly executed, but it lacks in character substance.Final Grade: B</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stephen Lang plays a very captivating antagonist in this 2016 Thriller, Don't Breath. At first, Stephen makes us feel remorse for his situation only to later makes us feel repulsed with his vengeance. The movie grew with suspense for hours, like a piece of gum you're blowing in your mouth, only to, well, never really burst. As much as the audience jumped, which was very seldom, the movie wasn't very scary. I never felt my heart pumping fast and I certainly wasn't on the edge of my seat. I was waiting and waiting for the twist. When it finally presented itself, it was like New Years Eve, you kinda just knew that the ball was going to drop, what a big surprise right? I want to make this clear, I'm not a hatter, I'm just a realest who loves movies. My friends think I expect to much, I don't, I just want to leave the theater satisfied, I was not. Stephen Lang was great and the plot had a ton of potential. However, I once again leave another movie in the summer of 2016 disappointed of what could be. I give Don't Breath a 5/10. All 5 coming from Stephen Lang. He can't do everything, but he can sure carry half the movie on his performance alone.</fullReview>

This hatchet job depicts a part of Hungary where many adjacent city blocks rot virtually abandoned (a situation nonexistent in the English-speaking Real World, outside of a MAD MAX flick), and attempt to foist off this Hell Hole as our fifth largest U.S. Metropolis (according to the latest reference book in the Detroit branch library I patronized on my recent visit to Motown). I just toured America's Motor City during the "Woodward Dream Cruise," and enjoyed a steady stream of Detroit's GTO's, Corvettes, Mustangs, and Chargers roaring by. Sony shows the turkey-basted mother-to-be "Rocky" driving in something like a Hungarian Yugo, that cannot even keep the dogs out. These mendacious propagandists also slander our Undefeated U.S. Army heroes, depicting them as Ticking Time Bomb Serial Killers. It pictures a squalid Detroit beset with WHITE-ON-WHITE crime (which smacks of Hungary to me).

		<fullReview>This is not a horror movie, that it claims to be. This is more a suspense, thriller, kind of movie. Really, not scary at all, and if people are rating it for that, then they are nuts. It is more intense and suspenseful, than being a horror or scary movie.This is about 3 friends that are partners in robbing homes. Yes, I said friends because another review said Money was a boyfriend of Rocky, which is not at all true. They were just closer than Alex, that got a hold of his fathers keys.Money hears about a new job that makes a lot of money, but they made a pact, not to go for money, but this time it was different, and Alex was skeptical about it and then gave in. They found out this veteran and being blind man, would be an easy job.Turns out that it was not as easy as they thought and it turned out to be two of them killed and one escaping with the money at the end. Not going to say, but you will probably already figure it out, by me just saying that.Anyways, this is definitely not a horror movie at all. Not as much as The Purge was. This is just trying to get out of the house and not make a sound at all kind of movie. Nothing like The Collector either.I read another review that compared to Sinister, but nothing like that either. Horror is usually something supernatural or evil to be a horror movie. This is nothing like that. So don't go in thinking it is.I was not disappointed for not being like a horror movie, but loved it as what it was, and that is suspenseful, thriller movie. I recommend to go see it and enjoy it. I did, and I would watch it again if it went on television.This kind of movie that would be great on broadcast television. I went on Tuesday that is $5 and worth that too, and probably worth more if I went on another day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to a screening of this film last night, not expecting anything or having any prior knowledge about the film. I have to say, the overall experience was an enjoyable one, albeit, not one I would remember through the ages. In fact, the moment the film ended and the more I thought over it, the less likable it seemed to get. At first, I blamed it on the insanely high standard Hollywood has set for movies and TV in this day and age that it seemed to have stolen away the light this movie deserves. But then I realized something that would be a lot helpful for those wanting to see this movie: Do not take this movie too seriously. This home invasion genre film serves as a well shot, neatly written and decently acted addition to a lineup of predictable, boring movies. Don't Breathe manages to satisfy moviegoers by avoiding genre- traps that would've ultimately changed the entire narrative of this review, and for that it gets special recognition! Got some time on your hand? Give this movie a watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't Breath is a Conundrum</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't Breath starts out well with three morally challenged characters attempting to make their way through the world by burglarizing others homes. They decide to rob a blind war veteran (excellent character actor Stephen Lang) of his settlement from the wrongful death of his only daughter. It's not a bad movie, but at some point you wonder who to root for because the blind veteran (Lang) is concealing a despicable secret in his basement. The thrills are well filmed and fairly predictable. The scariest character in the film is Lang's rottweiler. Lang's blind character must have had sinus issues because he would walk next to unseen burglars and not smell them which I found unrealistic. Supposedly the other senses are heightened when one is missing. Maybe I'm off-base with this criticism. Sometimes I can't smell things due to allergies.I was hoping for more scares, but maybe I'm jaded from seeing so many horror movies over the years (I'm past middle age). If I had seen this in high school it would probably have been a totally different experience.The of ending of Don't Breath leaves room for a sequel, although maybe it would be hard for a blind man to track down a woman who robbed him.</fullReview>

Being a big fan of the horror movie genre, I always make new horror movies a must-see theatre event. Starring Jane Levy, Dylan Minnette, and Daniel Zovatto as three thieving teenagers who set their sights on robbing a blind man in a secluded neighborhood who supposedly sits on a massive sum from a settlement. Desperation leads people to some sinister places, and the desperation of each character was explored in Alvarez's Don't Breathe.Three teenagers in depression sacked Michigan have turned to robbery as a means of survival. For Rocky (Jane Levy) there is another agenda to her criminal deeds. She has clearly lived a rough life with her addiction ridden abusive mother and can't stand to see her sister live the same life she lived, Rocky just wants to steal enough to be able to afford to take them away and start a new life. Alex (Dylan Minnette) is the brains of the operation; his father's work as a security guard affords him access to the master keys that disarm those homes and grant the teens access to steal. Money (Daniel Zovatto) is the muscle, finding out what homes to rob and selling the goods they steal for cash after each break-in. When Money hears that there is a man in a secluded, run-down neighborhood sitting on hundreds of thousands of dollars he won in a settlement with a wealthy family whose young daughter killed his own daughter after striking her with a vehicle, the take is too good to refuse. Once they find out the man is blind, however, Alex has a change of heart and a resurgence of morals at the prospect of stealing from a handicapped person. Money and Rocky conversely start to think that the robbery will be all the easier and are invigorated thinking about the riches they are sure to achieve. Once they gain entry, however, things take a turn for the worse quickly, and the teens realize they are vastly in over their head and will be lucky to get out with their lives, let alone the money. Don't Breathe isn't without its good moments, unfortunately, those are just moments. Daniel Zovatto really chews the scenery, and his over-exaggerated facial expressions are extremely distracting. The score is one of pure laziness. I subscribe to the notion that a horror movie is dependent upon its score. What is a good horror movie without a blood pressure raising tone to it; certainly Jaws nor Halloween would be as revered to the genre if it weren't for their classic fear-inducing music. Don't Breathe just doesn't have it, I'm not sure what the composer was going for but it didn't work. All the elements were there but it didn't amount in the end. The third act was a sharp departure from the first two and was a complete mess that didn't fit in with the preceding elements in the least. What Don't Breathe did do well was create the downtrodden, desperate atmosphere that the American town hit hardest by the economic depression of 2008 has had to deal with ever since. The audience can really appreciate the lowly state of all the kids involved that has brought them to stealing as a means of survival. I was hoping for so much more from Don't Breathe, but it falls flat, like most modern-day horror movies leaving one to wonder, is there any hope for the genre in a post-slasher film horror world?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well-made but lacking emotional investment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On a technical level, the movie is well-done. The directing is superb, and most of the acting is good. I love how the movie shows the urban decay of Detroit, making it look like a mix of suburban dream and war zone reality. At its heart, the movie is in many ways about broken dreams.However, there is one huge flaw in the movie that, for me, completely knocked it down several pegs and undermined the entire thing, and that is that I disliked and felt no sympathy for no single character in it.In order for suspense to work well, the viewer has to be invested in a character. If you don't care about anyone, you're not going to feel suspense when they are in danger. The characters in this are wholly unlikable and unsympathetic, despite rather shallow, cursory attempts at giving them sympathetic motivations.I'm all for flawed, unlikable characters and anti-heroes. In fact, I prefer such characters. But there has to be something for the viewer to latch onto, something to invest in. Otherwise it's just watching people doing things on a screen.If the movie weren't so well made on a technical level, I'd have ranked it much lower. I will definitely look for work by the director in the future. But this movie was disappointing, considering the high marks it seems to be getting from critics.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Don't Breathe' is a film which cleverly shows that horror comes in many forms. Three young robbers mark a blind man's house to steal his funds, but 'underestimating' is something thieves do best. However, does a premise and film such as this deliver?1. The first noticeable thing about this film is the tone. The production designers did a terrific job in setting up the creepy atmosphere as well as finding the perfect house where all the alarming events take place. Of course, the attempted theft takes place at night, so the audience follows these characters through the dark maze of the blind man's house. The cinematography is especially fantastic as the camera smoothly navigates it's way through hallways, basements and tight crawl spaces.2. The three robbers are played by Jane Levy (Rocky), Dylan Minnette (Alex) &amp; Daniel Zovatto (Money) respectively. The real horror establishes itself when one of the three meets their untimely and gruesome death. We quickly learn just how dangerous the blind man is when things take a turn for the worst. Jane Levy has more screen- time as she is proved to be the most sympathetic character when we learn of her backstory. Dylan Minnette is more of the innocent one who just follows orders at the behest of his crush on Rocky (Jane Levy).3. Last but not least, the 'Blind Man' himself, who is terrifyingly portrayed by Stephen Lang. Normally in a situation like this, the audience should be on his side, but his tactics prove to be lethal and brutal to a degree where you end up hoping the robbers survive his entrapment. The movie nose dives when more is revealed about the blind man and things turn insanely creepy. For all the suspense accumulated during the first half, I lost all faith the moment my stomach began to churn from the disgusting ordeal presented.There are too many moments of false hope near the climax and the movie makes you feel like it just doesn't know where and how to properly end things. I do give a lot of credit to director Fede Alvarez, but things unfortunately fall out of place and sources by the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could Have Been Much Better Very Easily</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Huge Spoilers:The basic story of 'Don't Breathe' is great. 'Don't Breath' generates a lot of tension. There are a fair amount of twists. 'Don't Breathe' is well acted and directed. The ending, however, is terrible. The young women who is a driving force behind the robbery, a robbery in which everyone else is killed, plays on the infatuation of a basically decent young man to lure the young man to a situation where he is killed. Does the young woman have the moral sensibility to realize that her California dream came at a high price? No. From the viewpoint of the young woman the robbery was basically a total success even though her boyfriend and the young man who was infatuated with her were killed. She will be able to go to California with her little sister. She had an out all the time. A young man with some prospects was infatuated with her. The movie easily could have ended differently. The woman held captive could have ended up dragging the young man who handled the security systems out of the house after he was wounded trying to save her, true to his nature. The young robberess could have been shot and killed after abandoning everyone else, true to her nature.The young woman is basically an anti-heroine who, for family, holds she can violate all statutes. Individuals who kill for family without regard for law, however, don't assist families which is a point Hollywood misses. Anti-heroes like total villains go to jail.'Don't Breathe' is basically the Usual Show where an anti-hero holds that all moral codes, all statutes, can be broken for family. In a sense 'Don't Breath' has 'advanced' beyond the Charles Bronson movies as the Charles Bronson character killed individuals who hurt his family but in 'Don't Breath' the anti-heroine holds that she can take vengeance on anyone vis-?-vis helping her sister. The terrible ending was, of course, a demand given what Hollywood is today. 'Don't Breathe' could have been a much better movie very easily.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brilliant example of potential forsaken for the familiarity of conventional horror tropes.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The greatest, and most unfortunate, aspect of this film is that it held an immense amount of POTENTIAL to be something both refreshing and memorable. It did not, however, deliver upon that potential.Whilst the outset of the film succeeds in positing to the viewer the idea that the retribution delivered unto the thieving teenage protagonists is justified, it soon transforms its own grey area into yet another example of a black-and-white, "flawed-but-decent guys vs. abjectly-bad guys" scenario. We have experienced this countless times before in horror films, and to be faced with it once more after having had fostered hope for something more thought-provoking is, at the very least, disappointing. The plot itself, while perhaps more original than the majority of horror films to have been released within the past decade, is riddled with holes whose explication would require spoiling the film but whose presence is undeniable to those who have seen it. Each and every cinematic work features plot holes, as individual and collective oversight is a common human malady, and therefore most movies are to be forgiven for them; however, this particular film created plot holes of such depth and magnitude that the viewer is continually expulsed from suspension of disbelief and is made instead to laugh at the ridiculousness and sheer magnitude of the various instances of utter implausibility. The film overall is so dependent upon traditional horror tropes that each and every aspect within it is predictable and familiar; there are no scenes which are surprising nor unexpected, and the ending is likewise tired.There are not enough redeeming qualities within the film to warrant paying for a ticket; even to use a theatre-rewards-specific free pass would be a waste. You are better off watching other recent and acclaimed horror films, such as "It Follows," "The Witch," or "The Conjuring." This particular film earns at most a 2/10, and is worthy of nothing greater than perhaps a Redbox rental for a Halloween horror film marathon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't Breathe Doesn't Deliver</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't Breathe is a huge disappointment for those hoping for a refreshing take on the horror genre.The film centers on three teenagers Rocky (Jane Levy), Alex (Dylan Minnette) and Money (Daniel Zovatto) living in a destitute Detroit who burglarize homes in hopes of raising enough funds to one day leave Michigan for California. After receiving a tip about a veteran sitting on a large sum of settlement money from the death of his daughter the three decide to rob him to expedite their plans. They discover their target is blind while casing his home and think this will be to their advantage.The film boasts that it is a revolution of horror but it falls into the most basic tropes. Majority of the jump scares are fake/false and the ones that had the most potential to be impactful were shown in the trailer for the film. The cat-and-mouse chase through the house is aggravating with arbitrary obstacles, dead ends and plot holes.About thirty minutes in the film we find out that the Blind Man (Stephen Lang) has the woman that killed his daughter in his basement after she was found innocent of vehicular manslaughter. At first I thought this was supposed to be the big twist of the movie ? even though this was shown in the trailer too ? but after accidentally killing her the Blind Man revealed that she was pregnant with his child as a replacement for the one he lost.After more cat-and-mouse antics, the Blind Man captures Rocky and intends for her to be his new surrogate. Strapping her into a homemade contraption that suspends her midair he begins to prep. The film was at the height of its tension and climax when the Blind Man pulled from his arsenal? a turkey baster filled with his sperm. There was loud and raucous laughter from the audience I saw this with and I was one of them. It became even more ridiculous when Alex appears out of nowhere to rescue Rocky and during the scuffle Rocky shoves the semen-filled turkey baster into the Blind Man's mouth. The credibility of the entire film is undermined by this one scene and it made it difficult to take the rest of it seriously.The most this film will achieve is cult status in the spirit of the original Evil Dead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Doesn't even make any sense.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought this movie was going to be excellent but clearly it does not even make any sense.The idea with the blind man was interesting but then they vilified him. This was terrible and really rude. He was the good guy and they made the terrible burglars HEROES. I was cheering the blind man on to kill them all.What's sad is that it is not even scary. Just jump scares. James Wan made a mistake with this movie. I thought his job as director here would lead to great things but he clearly forgot all the things his previous movies set up.The plot - a complete mess. Annabelle did not appear at all.Overall, I did not like it. Did not enjoy it at all. Would not recommend.I suggest you go see something else.1/10. Did not enjoy.</fullReview>
