		<shortDescription>How Aoki got this platform I will never know..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Viewed it as I am interested in the way the so called "EDM" monitises dance culture and makes everything about music production in your face, as we have seen from We Are Your Friends and XOXO among others. Look, if you like Aoki, then you'll probably like this. But he kinda sucks, and if you think so too then go and watch a bunch of Between the Beats Resident Adviser docs..Not even remotely interesting, and he blags a lot considering he presses play on a CDJ and jumps into crowds, inflatables, you name it - not forgetting the cake, of course.. You'll probably call me a techno purist or that he's not for me (the latter is certainly true), but you can't help but feel their are more pioneering people to focus and make a documentary on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An incredibly personal and unbelievably detailed biography</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This documentary film tells the struggles of Steve Aoki to get to the world of fame in the DJ world. It details his super busy work schedule, his spectacular shows, his family and his professional life."I'll Sleep When I'm Dead" is incredibly personal and unbelievably detailed. Steve Aoki talks about his childhood, young adult years and his life after his success. It features numerous interviews with his mother, his siblings, his friends, his girlfriend and even footage of Steve Aoki with the governor of LA. That is really impressive. I have the feeling as if I know Steve way more, even at a personal level, despite not having met him. This documentary is not like other documentaries, which presents you with a public persona. It really shows Steve Aoki's life, it is like his detailed authorised biography. it is definitely worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great work from Netflix.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll Sleep When I'M Dead shows the almost unknown personal life of the intense and vibrating EDM master Steve Aoki. Going through his childhood and family roots to his relationship with his father and also showing how come he would get to set his influence as a music producer and how he got to carved his way into producing a bunch of new alternative popular bands in the DIY LA music scene.Even though most of the documentaries portraying people from entertainment industry and show business in a general way tends to be and to show people in a somewhat pretentious way of living and acting, this is not the case in this great piece of work by Netflix. Steve was quite well represented in a original and real way that made the documentary a must-see to people that want to learn and to comprehend how the EDM scene works on backstage and how did Steve personal life was directly affected from the friends he end up making in the EDM scene and turning him into a major influence in the electronic music.Definitely it is worth watching.</fullReview>
