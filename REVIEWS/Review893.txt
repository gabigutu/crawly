		<shortDescription>A movie ahead of its time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Third Man is a movie that looks and feels not like a movie of the 40s, but like a neo-noir of the late 60s/early 70s. This wonderful example of classic noir is one of the all time greatest films. It combines amazing visuals, sounds, dialogue, and acting to tell a thrilling story and comment about the atmosphere after WWII.Of all the movies durring the studio era (pre-1960ish), there are three movies with cinematography that always stick out in my mind: Gregg Toland's work in Citizen Kane, Russel Mety's work in Touch of Evil, and Robert Krasker's work in The Third Man (all starring Orson Welles funny enough). I just recently saw a restored 35mm version of The Third Man. The crisp black and white visuals of a bombed out Vienna are so breath-taking. Shadows are everywhere. The unique way Krasker tilts the camera in some shots adding to the disorientation of the plot. And who can forget the first close-up of Welles with the light from an apartment room above splashing onto his face; one of the great entrances in movie history (Lime gives his old friend a smile that only Welles could give).The cinematography is backed by strong performances by Welles, Cotten, and italian actress Vali. The writing of Greene is wonderful; you can see the plot twisting around Cotten tightly. But what makes The Third Man so great is its historical commentary (well not really historical since it was commenting on its own time, but to us it is historical). On one level The Third Man is a story of betrayal and corruption in a post-war, occupied Vienna. On the other hand, its giving the audience a glimpse of the mood of Europe after the great war. The uncertainty that the Cold War was bringing is evident through out the film; Cotten is constantly trying to figure out who to trust. Vienna is on the frontier of the new communist bloc (we even see the communists infiltrating Vienna trying to bring Vali back to her native Czechoslavakia). The zither music score combined with the stark images of bombed out Vienna are reminiscent of the frontier towns of American Westerns. So The Third Man is not only a wonderful film noir, but a unique look at the brief time between WWII and the height of the Cold War.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What IS it makes THE THIRD MAN the classic most everyone agrees it is? (And lets face it, voted no 35 in the top all-time films gives it MORE than just some passing credibility!) Is it Orson Welles' menace? The whiff of corruption in occupied post-war Vienna? the cuckoo-clock speech atop the big wheel? even Anton Karras' zither? Perhaps ALL these things? If however, you had to nominate just a single influence within the whole production that elevates it to greatness I suggest that would be Robert Krasker's cinematography. The finished product innovatively, was years ahead of its birthright. Time and time again the viewer is bailed up by stunning camera angles and back-lighting. The eerie shadows around the deserted streets and of course the unforgettable first glimpse of Harry Lime (Welles) himself as he skulks like the rat he is, in the corner of the building, lit in close-up suddenly from the light in an adjacent apartment. Offhand I cannot think of a character's more dramatic entrance to a film.Welles in fact has minimal screen time, though his dark presence and influence infiltrate proceedings like an insidious disease. Yet somehow his ultimate demise in the sewers brings into play an incredible sadness and compassion that has absolutely no right being there. It remains for me one of my top five film favorites. I have always given it a "10" personally but hey, to be voted an "8.6" universally is a pretty fair vindication of my words here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply Beautiful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know why this movie always hooks me the way it does; it's obviously a masterpiece and a revered piece of British/American cinema - but that alone is not the reason (there are other such masterpieces which fail to have that effect on me). Maybe it's the setting: the beautiful city of Vienna right after World War II, the scars of the most devastating conflict in human history still visible at every corner. Or it's the contrast between the eerily happy music tune - which plays throughout the entire film - and the dark, tragic story of murder and betrayal which I find so strangely captivating. Whatever it is, I just love this movie.'The Third Man' now has more than 60 years on its back, but its age hardly shows. Despite the story's dark themes, the general mood of the narrative is rather light, sometimes darkly funny, and the slightly cynical tone and morally ambiguous characters give the movie a very modern feel. What also stands out and makes the film memorable - in addition to the fantastic soundtrack - is the outstanding, Accademy Award winning cinematography. Black and white has rarely looked better. The way DOP Robert Krasker plays with unusual angles and virtually "paints" this city of Vienna with light and shadow, he adds an almost expressionistic quality to the film. I always felt that the city plays an essential part in the story, - a key character if you will - with its damaged buildings reflecting the damaged human characters. The recent war is a looming presence throughout the film, and to me this is as much a story about the desensitizing effect of war on people as it is a murder mystery. And there is yet another quality to the film which needs to be mentioned: it's very entertaining. 'The Third Man' has fantastic pacing and there is simply not a dull moment in it. To sum up my overall impressions, this is one of those rare occasions where everything just falls right into place and helps create a unique film experience: Carol Reed's masterful direction and the wonderful performances by the fantastic actors (Joseph Cotten, Trevor Howard, Alida Valli and Orson Welles); the beautiful soundtrack by Anton Karas; the gorgeous cinematography by Robert Krasker, and, perhaps most importantly, the story and screenplay by Graham Greene with its unexpected twists and turns (although the unusual, iconic ending wasn't Greene's idea). A true work of art and highly enjoyable entertainment: 10 stars out of 10.Favorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-Known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Flawless Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a rare film that is flawless in every respect. It combines great acting and memorable characters with a fascinating story, taking place in an interesting setting and adding a creative musical score. "The Third Man" is remembered for many things - for Orson Welles' wonderful performance in his appearances as Harry Lime, for its wonderfully appropriate musical score, and for its nicely conceived plot surprises. Adding to these is Joseph Cotten's fine portrayal of Holly Martins, which holds the rest of it together - it is his character who initiates most of the action, and also through whom we view everything and everyone else.The story starts, after a nicely done prologue, with Martins arriving in Vienna, and finding out that his friend Harry is not only dead but is accused of running a particularly destructive black market racket. Martins sets out at once to prove his friend's innocence, getting into an immediate scuffle with the police, and it seems at first to set up a conventional plot about clearing the name of a friend - but the actual story that follows is much deeper and much better. It is just right that Martins is an innocent who writes cheap novels for a living, and he gets a pretty memorable lesson in fiction vs. reality. There are some great scenes (the Ferris-wheel confrontation being as good a scene as there is in classic cinema) leading up to a memorable climactic sequence, and a good supporting cast, with Alida Valli as Anna being very good in complementing Lime and Martins. The setting in crumbling post-war Vienna and the distinctive zither score go very nicely with the story.This is a fine, flawless classic, and while obviously belonging to an earlier era, it deserves a look from anyone who appreciates good movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Joseph Cotten is Excellent in Revolutionary Film Noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I never knew the Old Vienna, before the war, with its Strauss Music," opens Carol Reed's The Third Man, and we catch a glimpse of the New Vienna, with its Black Market and its Shady Deals. Joseph Cotten plays cheap novelette author Holly Martins, just arrived in Vienna to meet with long-time friend Harry Lime, who offered him a job. He instead meets with the mysterious facts surrounding the death of Lime, learned bit-by-bit from Lime's friends, a woman named Anna Schmidt, who has problems of her own (played excellently by Valli), and two British officers, Calloway and Paine. Learning, that there is more to death of Lime than there seems to be, Martins begins his investigation for the truth. This film was shot with some of the greatest, most ahead-of-its-time cinematography ever, and it creates mystery and deceit. It is complimented by the excellent use of shadows. The soundtrack is essentially one long song, which plays throughout the film, changing and stopping as the emotion calls for. It is a zither composition by Anton Karas made for the film. This is all topped off by an engrossing storyline, and a great performance by Joseph Cotten, as the ordinary man mixed up in this web of mystery.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Atmospheric British thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>American author Holly Martins arrives in Vienna to meet old friend Harry Lime. On arrival he finds Harry was just killed in an accident and attends his funeral. The police are happy that his death was an accident and are also closing crimes by attributing them to him. Martins begins to investigate the accident and finds out things that lead him to a shocking discovery that will eventually challenge his values and friendship.This is a classic bit of British cinema that owes a lot to the source material (Graham Green) and the slanted, moody cinematography throughout. The story is quite straight forward and can be perceived more complicated than it is. The best bits of the story come early, with Martins investigating the accident against a backdrop of secrecy and cover-ups, and later when he confronts Lime briefly on a Ferris wheel. The story is mainly a story of friendship and morals packed into a mystery setting. The final shot of the film is really good and gives a realistic (if not happy) end to the story.Joseph Cotton was always good around this period and seemed to be on a roll when he teamed up with Wells. Here he is good as Martin, even if his character is not as interesting as Harry Lime is. Orson Wells is excellent, casting a huge shadow (literally!) over the film despite having a very short time onscreen compare to Cotton. The director and the writer fought the producer to cast Wells in order to make the film more sellable to the American audience (the producer wanted Noël Coward) and the film is much better for their choice. His character hugely lacks morals and, despite being a small hustler, is almost a demonic figure - most notably in his speech on the Ferris wheel where he defends his actions to Martin.The film is given a great mood of shadows throughout. The city itself is shown as both beautiful and in ruins and is constantly slanted and shadowy. The final confrontation in the sewers of Vienna is excellent. The score is also good - at first it doesn't seem to fit, as it seems out of step with the mood, but it does work well with the culture that exists in the city at the time - I can't really explain it better than that but it does work.Overall this is a classic. The story may not be enough to support repeat viewings but the moody, the cinematography and a towering performance by Wells all make this essentially viewing for film fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Time for Lime</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Who was Harry Lime (Orson Welles)? An evil man, devil in the flesh who was responsible for the unspeakable crimes, yet brilliant, cheerful and charismatic. His most famous words, a short speech written by Welles himself, say a lot about his character and motivations:"In Italy for 30 years under the Borgies they had warfare, terror, murder, and bloodshed, but they produced Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, and the Renaissance. In Switzerland they had brotherly love - they had 500 years of democracy and peace, and what did that produce? The cuckoo clock."No wonder, we like him, even though we know what he'd done?It has been said thousands of times about the greatest movie entrance ever ? but what about his 'exit' ? the fingers on the street? I think it is one of the greatest, too?A beautiful mysterious girl with tragic past was in love with him and the unforgettable ending, so anti?Hollywood, so true to the film - was about her love that goes beyond the grave. I read that both Selznick (the producer) and author Graham Greene had initially argued for something more upbeat (Holly and Anna walking off arm-in-arm), but Reed disagreed. I am so happy that Reed won (I am sure millions of fans are, too). That was the way to finish the movie and make it much more than just typical noir. Makes the viewer think about love, friendship, betrayal, loyalty, the price one pays for them.Amazing film - perfectly shot; almost flawless. It looks and feels like Welles himself could've made it. The influence of Citizen Kane is undeniable. The only problem I had ? the music. I like it but it was very strange to hear it in the film like The Third Man. Maybe that was a purpose ? instead of somber, moody, and ominous music that would be expected for the noir film, something completely different and out of place ? cheerful but melancholy in the same time? Criterion DVD is wonderful ? the restored version of the film shines. There are two openings of the film available ? British and American, and a lot of extras.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nobody thinks in terms of human beings. Governments don't. Why should we?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Third Man is directed by Carol Reed and written by Graham Greene. It stars Joseph Cotton, Alida Valli, Trevor Howard and Orson Welles. Music is by Anton Karas and cinematography by Robert Krasker.When writer Holly Martins (Cotton) travels to Vienna to hook up with his childhood friend Harry Lime (Welles), he is distressed to find that Harry has been killed in a road accident. After attending the funeral, Holly comes to believe that Harry's death was no accident and begins to try and clear his friend's name. But nothing is as it first seems.....It's well over 60 years since it was released and Carol Reed's film noir thriller continues to feel fresh and hold up under the closest of critical scrutiny. A haunting tale as it is anyway, the black market racketeers and penicillin tampering bastards leaving an unsavoury taste in the mouth, but the film is still further boosted by the director's ability to craft unnerving atmosphere by way of style and clinically paced passages of play. Performances are superlative across the board, with the film producing equal amounts of iconography and mischievous myth-making. It stuns with the narrative structure unfolding amongst a post war ravaged Vienna that dovetails with the fractured nature of the human characters.A maze of moist cobbled streets host chases involving man and long shadows, there's a fairground scene that is now steeped in folklore, which in turn is a witness to the banality of evil, and of course those cavernous sewers, home to such sullen tones. Reed brings the canted angles, with moral decay the order of the day and a side order of confusion to finally fill your noir hungry bellies. Krasker deals in expressionistic chiaroscuro as Karas plucks away at his Zither to land in your ears for eternity. A murder mystery, a pained romance and a suspense laden film noir, The Third Man is enduring in its qualities. Cuckoo clock and cat, shadowed doorway and the lone sombre walk of a female, it's still today entertaining the film purist masses and still being pored over by film makers home and abroad. The Third Man, it's a masterpiece by jove. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>That Terrific B&amp;W Cinematography</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a bombed-out Vienna just after WWII, novelist Holly Martins (Joseph Cotten) arrives from America to renew a friendship with his childhood buddy, Harry Lime (Orson Welles). Much to the dismay of Holly, a freak auto accident has recently killed his friend, according to those who knew Harry.But in searching for details of Lime's death, Holly gets contradictory stories that don't add up. One of the persons who knew Lime is an attractive woman named Anna Schmidt (Alida Valli) whose continued presence in the story invites suspicion. The film's plot has Holly searching for the truth about his friend, while trying to stave off a city detective, Major Calloway (Trevor Howard) who tries to persuade Holly to leave Vienna.The film's story is okay. But what makes "The Third Man" really interesting is the B&amp;W cinematography, by Robert Krasker. Unlike most films, camera movement here is restricted, so as to draw attention to each frame's geometry. Typically in this film, a frame is tilted at an angle so that both vertical and horizontal points of reference are off-kilter. Frame images thus become a series of diagonal straight lines and curves. Further, very high-contrast lighting, especially in outdoor scenes at night, creates a bizarre, almost nightmarish look and feel, and are suggestive of German Expressionism.All of which results in a visual disorientation for viewers that parallels Holly's disorientation both in the streets of Vienna and in his understanding of the circumstances surrounding Lime's absence. In most outdoor scenes there's a conspicuous lack of crowds, a lack of hubbub one would expect in a bustling city. Instead, only a few secondary characters appear in night scenes. This sparseness in characters on the streets conveys the impression that hidden eyes are watching Holly, ready to pounce at any moment from out of dark shadows."Everybody ought to (be) careful in a city like this", says one character to Holly, as an implied threat. Soon, a man who wants to give Holly some valuable information is murdered.The script's dialogue is quite impressive, with some interesting lines and points of view. Some of the dialogue is in German, which enhances authenticity.The film's acting and editing are very, very good. Adding a slightly romantic, and at times melancholy, tone to this dark film is the music of the "zither", an instrument similar to a guitar, but sounding quite different.My one complaint about this film is that it's hard to keep tabs on some of the background characters. Trying to connect names with faces can be difficult, resulting in some confusion."The Third Man" tells an interestingly bleak story, set in a bleak, desolate urban environment, rendered truly mesmerizing by the creatively surreal B&amp;W cinematography.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>fantastic film that takes place in postwar Vienna</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even today in Vienna, one can take the "Third Man Tour" (Der Dritte Man) except, of course, that Orson Welles wouldn't go into the Viennese sewers and those scenes were done in England. There were actual sewer scenes with a double. Never mind, it is still a magnificent black and white film 99% filmed in Vienna. Directed by Carol Reed, it stars Joseph Cotten, Orson Welles, and Alida Valli.Western novelist Holly Martins (Cotten) comes to Vienna at the behest of his old friend Harry Lime, but when he arrives, he learns that Lime is dead after being hit by a car. He investigates and finds the circumstances very strange indeed, especially when learning there was a third man that helped carry Harry's body to the sidewalk, a man who has since disappeared.He then meets Harry's girlfriend (Alida Valli). And he also meets a police officer in the British section of Vienna, Inspector Calloway (Trevor Howard), who tells him that Harry was a murderer and a racketeer, and it's better that he's dead. Holly is shocked and demands proof.One of the most atmospheric films ever made, with its zither music, cinematography, and Vienna at nighttime. Then there's some brilliant dialogue, particularly the "cuckoo clock" speech made by Orson Welles.The cinematography is particularly striking: odd angles, back lighting, and shadows on empty streets. And who can forget the man hidden in the doorway, when the light from an apartment goes on and shows his face - certainly one of the great appearances of a star in a film.One feels Lime's presence throughout the film, though he only has five minutes of screen time.Though none of these actors were the first choice to play their roles, they are all excellent.There was a Third Man TV series in 1959 that ran for six years and starred Michael Rennie as Lime. In the series, Lime is a hero. He's no hero in the movie, but it is a powerful story and film, never forgotten once seen.</fullReview>

Sure, The Third Man looks absolutely gorgeous and the ending is superb, but the rest is just passable. Beautiful to look at, but lacking any real drive or urgency.The stuff in the sewers is good and there's some nice discussions of morality, but the film drags terribly for the first hour, where the casting (and, in a modern age, VHS covers) clearly signpost that Welles is to be expected.Coming from the director of the superlative "Odd Man Out" and the writer of the equally superb "Brighton Rock" then I was expecting more. I don't consider myself a philistine, but, for me at least, the narrative and subtext of this one wasn't enough to sustain its attempts at brilliance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pulp western writer Holly Martins (Joseph Cotten) arrives in post-war Vienna to work for old friend Harry Lime (Orson Welles) but is told that Harry is dead. The city is divided under the control of the Allies. British Major Calloway (Trevor Howard) tells him that Harry was a criminal. He decides to investigate Harry's death. Anna Schmidt (Alida Valli) is Harry's girlfriend. Harry's friends Baron Kurtz and Popescu describe the accident but Holly is told by another that there was a third man.The best part of this movie is director Carol Reed. His camera work is amazing. The best scene for me is the balloon man. When he walks around the corner, it is the funniest and most shocking moment in the movie. Orson Welles is so tied into this movie but I don't find him threatening enough. He's more of a trickster. I would like Harry Lime to be scarier. Also Anna is an infuriating character. Overall, the story is fine. Joseph Cotten is great. The movie is a cinematic art work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought I had seen all of the famous old films in my lifetime, but somehow I missed The Third Man. Today I watched it, with complete disgust due to that horrible (and stupid) Spanish guitar throughout the film. The music, if you can call it that was horrible. The guitar sounded out of tune half the time and it never went with the scene that it was supposed to enhance. Sometimes, the guitar player sounded like he was free forming the music and often lost his way. Yes, I know a very famous song came from this soundtrack but even THAT didn't go along with any scene or the plot in general. The entire soundtrack should have been in an Italian Comedy film where some stud is trying to impress a beautiful woman on the beach.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For me, a stylish, complex, but ultimately overrated film noir.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start this off by saying that on the technical side, The Third Man is absolutely brilliant. The cinematography is beautiful, the visuals enhance the atmosphere, and that soundtrack is perfect. It's beautiful to look at and wonderful to watch.That aside, I don't know how far I can go without sounding like a pretentious idiot or an uninformed idiot. I don't particularly like either and I'd hate to become one too.The Third Man has a fantastic premise. Plenty of great twists and turns with fine performances from Orson Welles and Joseph Cotton, but in my opinion, I don't think that this noir story stands out or is all that great anyway.Maybe I'm wrong, but I'm not too keen on several plot holes and inconsistencies. First off, we don't know who the real "Third Man" is. Harry Lime? Or someone else? Maybe that's supposed to be the beauty of it and I'm not getting it, but I don't like it at all. Second, the shop owner was killed all of a sudden when he was about to give out information. Harry Lime? Or again, someone else? He's pulled to the side and forgotten about just as soon as he's gone.But my biggest problem with the film is with Anna Schmidt. First off, she claims she is no longer in love with Lime. Then she finds out the atrocities he's committed, and further cements her decision that she is better off living with someone like Holly instead of Lime. In fact, who can't help but dislike Lime for the things he had done? But in the end, she ends up hating everyone around her for setting him up for his death. She won't talk to Holly, she tries to defend him and show him the way out of his problem, she won't cooperate. What gives? And then the ending scene. That entire ending, in fact. The ten minute chase scene, while expertly shot, dragged and didn't need to be ten minutes long. It could've gotten to the point in about three minutes. And the final three minutes of the movie, in which Anna just walks and Holly stupidly waits for him.I don't know. Maybe I'm not looking at this the way I'm supposed to and not appreciating it for what it is, but I wasn't at all entertained by the things I saw.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Author Joseph Cotten (Holly) is invited to Vienna by his friend Orson Welles (Harry Lime). There is a major problem with this set-up from the outset as it is revealed that Welles has just been killed. Cotton attends the burial but sticks around in Vienna as there seems to be a great deal of suspicion surrounding the death of his buddy.The film has an interesting setting and idea for a story but I'm afraid that it just drags - it's drawn-out and never gets moving. Cotten is dreary in the lead role but Welles is the best thing in the film and delivers his amusing famous quote comparing Italy with Switzerland. The scene on the Ferris wheel is a standout scene as the audience experiences the only real moment of tension as the carriage door is opened at the top of the ride. Uh-oh ? is anybody going over the edge?A mention must be made of the music ? it's all zithery throughout. To further clarify, it sounds like a mixture between Greek music and French café accordion music. And it provides moments of over-exaggerated melodrama that just ends up comical. It is also just basically out-of-place belonging more in an art film or 1960s camp comedy horror.The story is not bad and the film could have been so much more interesting ? we are given about 30 minutes of plot stretched out to nearly 2 hours. Definitely not the classic that everyone blindly labels it as ? it is vastly over-rated right up to the final chase scene in the sewers ? a plot device that was done a year before in the better film "He Walked By Night" (1948) which provided far more tension and a better sewer chase.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clearly overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I read many wonders about this film, considering the very positive reviews it gets. It even is considered one of the greatest films ever. Judging by the general descriptions regarding this motion picture, it was even said to be a great story of suspense.I was expecting a noir film comparable to 'The Window' (1949), which is one of my favorite films. It turned out to be disappointing, nothing of what I expected.It isn't until the last 10 minutes that something begins to happen at all, but that's just so little, especially comparing to the rest of it where nothing special happens. It's just way too slow-paced, boring and dull, made me yawn of boredom. Suspense? Zero suspense!It was one of those films that left me indifferent. It's very far from being one of the best ever, being clearly far more praised than it really deserves. Not even the fact that it takes place in Vienna can save it. While Vienna is a beautiful place, the movie doesn't show that much of Vienna. On the other hand, the film has both English and German language.'The Fallen Idol' (which is from the same director) was better than this and had more suspense than this (even if still very little).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hapless Holly Martins (who apparently has never figured out anything in his entire life... let's call him slow-witted) is brought to post-WW2 Vienna to meet college buddy Harry Lime, and seemingly, to be used by people. But Lime has died... and the new situation becomes complicated. Sadly within 5 minutes, it's utterly obvious that Lime has not died, and the film finds uninteresting ways to dawdle for more than an hour until a "big twist" confirms it. I've never made it through 'The Third Man' without falling asleep. I've warmed up to outwardly dull, cerebral movies a lot. But to me, The Third Man is only the former... dull! It needs to offer more to consider over its running time. I don't know what developments are supposed to be engaging in this, because I can't find anything in it I'd describe as a 'development.' The concerns of a dope never become my own. Observing as a rube is misused quickly becomes irritating. I just don't care if Martins wins the gal, solves the crime, or finds Harry Lime (Welles). And the prospect of identifying with either Martins (a dope) or Lime (a degenerate) is not mined for much potential. In one scene Holly fails yet again as a lousy evening speaker; Martins is just stupid in the scene. Carol Reed doesn't know that there are wise ways to film someone being dumb (See the same scene in The 39 Steps). Eventually, waaaay into the movie we get to the movie's signature, provocative speech about the output of two nations, but it's way too late.'Third Man' fans will insist that the cinematography (a couple of tilted visuals?) is excellent, but frankly, both Welles, and Reed made movies with more compelling visuals prior to 1949. The score, now a hoary piece of film lore, is a tonal disaster, always undermining scenes with the wrong tone, and frequently at a volume too loud for a given moment. I acknowledge the movie is very influential (The Good German, Welles entire career after Ambersons) and even influenced some movies I enjoy very much (the Trial, Zentropa). But to find excellence in this is to willfully deny what your unengaged mind is telling you. Skip this and view Reed's Odd Man Out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Carol Reed's The Third Man is set in post-war Vienna- a hypnotic city, which is in consideration of the mountains of rubble and general sorrow of the are- and stars Joseph Cotten as Holly, a writer of hokey B-Western novels who's come to visit an old chum named Harry Lime. He finds out Lime is dead, but that there is more to his old friend than he knew since before the war, along with Lime's girl Anna (a sympathetic character?). Then when the revelation is shown of Lime's face on a darkened street, the film reaches an elegance rarely seen today in pictures. Orson Welles, who plays Harry Lime, has in fact a role much like a cameo, having a speech with Cotten on a Ferris Wheel. Even before his "cuckoo clock" finale, we get the sense this is one of these classic scenes of all time, leading up to an unforgettable chase in a sewer. Along with precise, Oscar Winning cinematography, and an ever-entrancing musical score, The Third Man is one of the essentials for movie buffs. A++</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't mind a slow movie. That is, as long as the story calls for it. But in the case of The Third Man, the tempo is nothing but dull.I imagine that the big reveal of Harry Lime, played by Orson Welles, still being alive might have been shocking when the movie was released in 1949. Kind of like Kevin Spacey being the killer in Seven, receiving no credit on posters or in the title sequence in order to preserve the mystery. Today, one would be hard pressed to find someone who doesn't know that Spacey's in Seven. This brings me back to The Third Man. Before seeing the movie I knew absolutely nothing about it, except it being voted one of the best British films ever, and that Orson Welles plays a character called Harry Lime (his face is on the cover for chrissake!), a fact which has been hard to avoid as it's regularly on lists of great performances. Consequently, I spent most of the film waiting for him to appear. No great mystery left, in other words.The acting is symptomatic of its time, so I can't really complain about it not being naturalistic. It's just something you have to accept when watching movies from this time period. Although I have to say I love the scene in the ferris wheel. Welles does a great job there.Although some people might love it, I'm just really annoyed that the movie refuses to decide which genre it's in. Is it a comedy? Is it a thriller? There are instances where combined genres work beautifully, but The Third Man is not one of those cases. The problem with The Third Man's genre schizophrenia is that the comedy parts aren't that funny, and the thriller parts aren't very thrilling, resulting in a bland mess.The thriller part is messed up even more by the ever annoying zither soundtrack. I can think of only one other case where the soundtrack almost singlehandedly messes up a movie, and that's Serpico. In the case of Serpico the director Sidney Lumet boasted that there was only about 10 minutes or so of music (I can't remember the exact number, but he says it in the special features on the DVD) in the entire 2+ hour film. All I could think about when watching it was that it was 10 minutes we could have done without that awful Mikis Theodorakis crap.Back to The Third Man, Anton Karas' plinky plunky zither bonanza plays almost nonstop throughout the entire picture. It sways between being vomit inducingly melodramatic and something out of a zany Tom &amp; Jerry cartoon comedy, effectively removing any tension that might have been left in the movie.The behind the scenes documentary on the DVD was far more interesting and engaging than the movie itself, and is the only reason for me not chucking the movie into the waste basket.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Murder, Mystery &amp; Harry Lime</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Post-war Vienna. A dangerous city, full of intrigue, crime &amp; sudden death. Notorious American racketeer Harry Lime starts to cross a street. There is an accident and he is killed instantly. Or is he? His body is carried to the sidewalk by two friends. Or does another man assist them? If so, who is THE THIRD MAN and what does he know about Lime's suspicious death?Such is the puzzle at the beginning of what many consider to be the greatest film ever made. Its glories are so obvious that it is almost futile to pick out any for observation: the marvelous sewer chase, the balloon man, the little boy with the ball, the giant wheel, the cuckoo clock speech &amp; the long closing walk across the cemetery. All of these linger in the mind, becoming permanent residents of our cinematic subconscious.The entire cast is excellent: Joseph Cotton as Lime's American friend trying to piece together what has happened; Trevor Howard as the stalwart British Major of Police; gorgeous Valli as Harry's faithful lover; Bernard Lee as the tragic Police Sergeant; Wilfrid Hyde-White as a dithering English cultural attaché. And then there's Orson Welles...The character of Harry Lime, alive or dead, on-screen or not, is one of cinema's most fascinating villains. Charming &amp; deadly as any cobra, he attracts &amp; repels at the same moment. It is interesting to note that BBC Radio resurrected the character for the series 'The Lives of Harry Lime' very shortly after the film's release. Harry was not allowed to stay in his grave for long...Three more items of note: (1) The cinematography is first-rate, making Vienna by night look almost lunar. (2) Orson Welles' first appearance on screen is a real dandy. (3) Above &amp; around &amp; through everything is the famous zither music of Anton Karas, which becomes like a Greek Chorus, commenting on the action. Its complete silence during the sewer chase only underscores the starkness of the sequence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Vienna once, a romantic thriller story and hunt for the dead man. A rough picture of what represents this great movie. The third man is the film which is set located in the city who did not recover from the Second World War and the Allied occupation forces have the main say. Extremely impressive are authentic locations of devastated city, great photos, scenery and noir style. The atmosphere skillfully shows us all the anxiety caused by the beginnings of the Cold War. All this in a movie about two friends, who do not seem to know much about each other. They love the same woman.The bottom line is finding. The novelty is the black market. The element that has stepped up the plot. The problem is in man, not in situations. The story boils down to the suspicious death of a good friend which remains unsolved case of the third man. From that moment all the skilled thriller game between tension and climax. Very good dialogue accompanies even better humor that pervades between light joke to the grisly interruption.It is simply amazing to see well-constructed script in the complex drama. Despite the fact that after all the acts is calculated and well designed, the voltage is present. Of course, there those hasty turnaround, but when all is summed up would be superfluous.The acting is pretty good.Joseph Cotten as Holly Martins is in a double error. Friendship and romance. Alida Valli as Anna Schmidt is a good girl who chooses between the living and the "dead" man. The fact is that she runs away or just passing. Trevor Howard as Major Calloway is a British police major who with a lot of experience leading the investigation. The protagonist who took advantage of misleading in that they hoped the main characters. Orson Welles as Harry Lime is a treacherous criminal, friend and lover, who in the darkness shows the shadow of the third man.I'm just thrilled. In the last sentence I will boast of great music. Rhythmic, creepy, sad, provocative ... different and excellent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Opportunistic racketeering thrives in a damaged and impoverished Allied- occupied Vienna, which is divided into four sectors each controlled by one of the occupying forces: American, British, French, and Soviet. These powers share the duties of law enforcement in the city. American pulp Western writer Holly Martins (Joseph Cotten) comes to the city seeking his childhood friend, Harry Lime (Orson Welles), who has offered him a job. Upon arrival he discovers that Lime was killed just hours earlier by a speeding truck while crossing the street. Martins attends Lime's funeral, where he meets two British Army Police: Sergeant Paine (Bernard Lee), a fan of Martins' pulp novels; and his superior, Major Calloway (Trevor Howard), who says Lime was a criminal and suggests Martins leave town.An official of the British occupying forces subsequently approaches Martins, requesting that he give a lecture and offering to pay for his lodging. Viewing this as an opportunity to clear his friend's name, Martins decides to remain in Vienna. He receives an invitation to meet from Lime's friend, "Baron" Kurtz (Ernst Deutsch), who tells Martins that he, along with another friend, Popescu (Siegfried Breuer), carried Lime to the side of the street after the accident. Before dying, according to Kurtz, Lime asked Kurtz and Popescu to take care of Martins and Anna Schmidt (Alida Valli), Lime's actress girlfriend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film-noir for the ages</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Third Man is an enthralling mystery thriller of the film-noir variety that is set in the beleaguered, post-war Vienna. When pulp novelist Holly Martins discovers his old friend Harry Lime has been murdered, he sets out on an investigation that will lead to one surprise after another amidst the shadowy and corrupt city. This movie has been praised by many due to its superb acting, mesmerizing musical score and the atmospheric use of its black-and-white cinematography.This film, at its time, was groundbreaking for its use of innovative camera angles and shadows that were originally criticized by some critics. Orson Welles also helped write the screenplay, which was nothing short of exceptional, packed with witty, fast-paced dialogue and always keeping the audience guessing when a piece of truth might be revealed. The fact that The Third Man was not even nominated for an Academy Award for Best Story and Screenplay is a classic example of a film that was simply not adequately appreciated at its time. There were so many amazingly unforgettable moments in this film. One in particular was the ending sewer sequence, which was one of the most cleverly crafted chase scenes I have ever witnessed on the big screen. The formidable musical score and shadowy presence kept me in a kind of suspense where I genuinely believed there was a chance Welles' Lime could get away. A moment like Lime's hands extending through the sewer gate didn't need to make the final cut - but it is ingenious little details like that, ones which manage to convey so much in its quietude, that cement it's superiority in film history. This film really exemplified how to create a good mystery film. Director Carol Reed's use of Dutch angle shots were executed to perfection, particularly with emphasizing Cottons' Martin's increasing alienation as the movie progresses. The atmospheric cinematography breathes life into an already engrossing story line, with memorable performances all tied into a web of classic mystery. And while Welle's screen time was limited, his ultra-creative presence is surely felt throughout. A fan of the cinema is a fan of The Third Man.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good vs evil in a devastated and confused world</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Third Man" is considered by many as the best British film ever (e.g. British Film Institute 1999 poll, Sight &amp; Sound polls). It is a landmark in worldwide cinema notably for its unique mix of genres: historical, thriller, comedy, tragedy. And it is a brilliant movie about ethics.The picture is not adapted from a pre-existing book: when Graham Greene was tasked to write the screenplay, he wrote a novel to have a fully consistent plot that he immediately adapted for the screen. As Greene modestly admitted in the preface he wrote afterwards: "The film in fact, is better than the story because it is in this case the finished state of the story." The book and the movie plots are very similar, although there are a few significant variances: for instance, the novel is narrated by the Major and ends differently (on the latter, more below).*** WARNING: CONTAINS SPOILERS ***"The Third Man" starts as a historical account of post-war Vienna. The opening speech portrays the chaos in Europe. The plot revolves around black market, some relatively harmless (clothes, watches, identity papers, etc.), some deadly: penicillin, which is historically accurate. Life is random like a roll of dice (as Anna does in Harry's apartment). Throughout the film, we see different parts of Vienna, once a splendour of culture and history, partly destroyed as many major cities were. We are lost like Holly is: many dialogues are in German without subtitles. Some scenes are tragic, notably the one in the children's hospital.Rapidly, the movie evolves into a thriller. Was Harry victim of an accident or a murder? Who was the third man? This mystery remains unsolved, although it could be Harry himself. Then the porter is also murdered and Holly closely escapes assassination. There are three chases (Holly and Anna, Holly, Harry).The comical elements are continuously present, except at the end. Holly is a small-time writer of ridiculous novels, getting drunk, attracting trouble and failing with women. The excellent score adds a sarcastic tone to the whole story. (However, in my opinion the music is sometimes too present and partly spoils scenes that would have been better off silent. Also this reduces the impact of music when needed.)The combination of these styles is easy but efficient. One example: when the military are tracking Harry? a balloon-seller barges in! Another: Holly is brutally driven by a taxi to an unknown destination and thinks he will be killed (thriller). But he is actually dropped at a conference? that is a disaster (comedy). However two killers show up so he has to run (thriller)? and gets bitten by a parrot (comedy).Above all these elements, the motif about good versus evil is dominant. We see a shattered world that has lost its ethical compass. Some cynically take advantage, some stick to their values: Holly and Harry, once friends, are antagonists. But is it so simple? Holly is on the good side, yet because of his blunders the porter and the Sergeant get killed. The Major blackmails Anna: information or deportation by the Soviets. Anna loves Harry regardless. She says: "He is part of me." In this chaotic environment, references are blurred: the porter points up to designate hell and down for paradise; Anna tells the Major "You have everything upside down"; she sometimes calls Holly "Harry"; a key scene happens in the Ferris wheel where the world turns around; the sewer with its foul smell ends up in the romantic "blue Danube" as the Sergeant point out.Also, the main villain is seducing. At first mysterious (he only progressively appears after an hour), he turns out to be extremely intelligent. His speech in the wheel is at the same time ignominious and rhetorically impressive. It is not easy to answer the question: why do we stay moral? Orson Welles is outstanding in this role: his performance is so powerful we think he appears on screen longer than an actual cumulated five minutes. On top of being a great director, he was a great actor.Visually, the historical and moral instability is expressed by frequent darkness, shadows and inclined shots, where we constantly feel buildings and characters are going to fall. (In my opinion, these shots are somewhat too systematic, even though they make their point.)Eventually, the movie rightfully ends in the sewer. Aesthetically stunning, this sequence is symbolic in different ways. The underground is where villains escape the law by crossing borders: it represents the evil, underlying part of this confused society. When everybody but Anna goes down there, they want to extirpate evil from its roots. Also, when Harry is looking for a way out, voices emerge from dark tunnels that look like funerary steles: it is as if he guiltily heard the people he murdered talking to him. Last, the sewer feels anthropomorphic: complex, dark, liquid, noisy, with different levels and small tubes. Hence symbolically characters dive inside their subconscious to be confronted to their evil part: Holly faces Harry for the last time. Their gazes are similarly intense. Harry nods to Holly, a sign of agreement and/or understanding.This famous climatic sequence is followed by one of the greatest closing shots of cinema history. After the funeral, Holly waits for Anna. The image is deep, in the axis of the road. Leaves are falling. Music plays softly. Anna is a small figure that progressively grows bigger. Slowly, she just walks past Holly without a look and moves out of the frame. He is left alone. (It constitutes an important difference with the novel, which ends happily: Holly and Anna walk together holding arms. But Carol Reed thankfully imposed his ending.)It is a dazzling shot, slow and melancholic, crowning an uneven yet compelling movie. Anna despises Holly for his law-abiding betrayal. It is one of the dramas about life: we sometimes prefer charismatic bastards to honest fools, and love is blind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One masterpiece per customer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Filmed as though the camera had one tripod leg shorter than the others, along with zithers, seductive shadows, echoing sewers, ferris wheels, cuckoo clocks and a magician's touch, this film is more of an experience than a movie. Impossible to remake, it also captures Vienna at a critical time just after WW2 when it was still occupied by the Allied powers.Even after 55 years, "The Third Man" has a compelling story, superb performances and enough style for ten films.And that story by Graham Greene stands up even when compared with all the brilliant mystery films over the intervening decades as well as literate crime series on TV such as "Lewis", "Wallander" and "Vera" etc. Holly Martins (Joseph Cotton), a rather nerdy, and slightly annoying writer of paperback westerns, arrives in post-war Vienna to discover that his good friend Harry Lime (Orson Welles) has supposedly been killed in an accident. He encounters suspicious British policemen (Trevor Howard and Bernard Lee), and also Harry's enigmatic and beautiful girlfriend Anna (Alida Valli). Eventually Holly learns things about Harry that trouble him deeply. It all leads to a confrontation in the cavernous sewers under Vienna. The film also features one of the most unexpected endings ever. I won't spoil it in case one of the five people who haven't seen the film happens to read this.Suffice to say that the original script had a more conventional ending and it was actually David O Selznick who came up with the one used in the film. It was always assumed that it was director Carol Reed's, but Charles Drazin in his fascinating book "In Search of the Third Man" pretty well pins it down to Selznick, who attempted to interfere with the whole production. Although ostensibly a British film, Selznick had money in it with Alexander Korda ? before the inevitable falling-out. There is so much to observe and enjoy including Orson Welles famous monologue, and the stunning Alida Valli. She was so beautiful, "head-swivelingly beautiful" as Martin Scorsese once said. Even the shapeless raincoat she wears for most of the film only makes those luminous features even more striking. She had already made a couple of Hollywood movies including Hitchcock's "The Paradine Case", another film where her mystique is caught if a little chillingly, and she wasn't even a Hitchcock blonde.Carol Reed went on to make other movies including "The Man Between", which tried to recapture the spirit of "The Third Man", this time set in Berlin. It even foreshadowed "The Spy Who Came in from the Cold", but it didn't have that self-contained, indefinable magic of "The Third Man". Maybe its only one true masterpiece per customer, although Reed's batting average was always strong.Whatever the case, "The Third Man" has lost none of its lustre and more than lives up to its reputation. I'd have to say it's a desert island disc for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Third Man is a film where the background score is given a lot (maybe too much) of space. It is a nice score. But it is played all the time. Even during the melancholic scenes. I guess it is used to emphasize the fact that the film is tragicomic.Some of the camera angles and imagery (especially the scene on the staircase, the scenes inside the Ferris wheel, the man with the balloons towards the end and the action scenes inside the underground sewer) are amazing.The film is quite critical of American enterprise. The Orson Welles character could be symbolic of American capitalism and attitude towards life. His attitude is characterized by this line:"Don't be so gloomy. After all it's not that awful. Like the fella says, in Italy for 30 years under the Borgias they had warfare, terror, murder, and bloodshed, but they produced Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, and the Renaissance. In Switzerland they had brotherly love - they had 500 years of democracy and peace, and what did that produce? The cuckoo clock. So long Holly." Joseph Cotton is a writer of pulpy American westerns. I wonder if he is supposed to represent impending American cultural hegemony after World War 2. The film was released in 1949, so if this is what the director intended, then it is very prophetic.The female character played by Alida Valli, who covets Orson Welles despite all his flaws is not portrayed in very good light. Women prefer the bad boys.Some of the characters (like the book enthusiast who invites Cotton to a book discussion) were inserted just to make the plot more complicated. That whole scene was quite unnecessary. The film gets really good towards the end. It has a very cynical tone throughout - emphasized by the music and the desolate visuals of Vienna, ruined and devastated by the war. The child spy was quite sinister.It is a reasonably enjoyable film. I guess it is a classic if you consider the cinematography and the year it was made in. But I was not enamored by it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Classic That Will Stand The Test of Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Carol Reed's The Third Man (1949) is a remarkable film noir that if you haven't seen, you most certainly should. Set in postwar Vienna, Holly Martins (Joseph Cotton) arrives to visit an old friend who had offered him a job. From there the twisty, fast paced ride begins with the first twist being thrown at you in under ten minutes. The film aged very well, and even if you don't usually watch black and white movies, this one should be made an exception. Although the movie deals with lots of dark themes such as murder, corruption, and the Black Market, it is portrayed in a comical way, especially due to the performances and unique score. The fast paced dialogue, perfectly timed music, and direction all add to the films wit and pace. There are lots of short shots, dutch angles, jump cuts to keep you engaged and you are never bored or unsatisfied. The cinematographer certainly earned his paycheck because the films cinematography is unbelievable. With each transition you are prepared for a little more of the truth and intrigue to be revealed so you can try to figure out the mystery before the ending. And may I add that the finale is one of the greatest you'll ever see. The classic sewer chase sequence will stick with you forever. In conclusion, The Third Man is a film that must be seen if you are a fan of mysteries, classics films, and interested in seeing truly one of the best films (One of Roger Ebert's top 4).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful cinematography, but contrived and incoherent plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As "The Third Man" is considered a cinema classic, anyone who gives it a less than glowing review risks being labeled a philistine or worse. However, I found it a bit disappointing, viewed sixty-six years after its release. I liked the locations. Costumes were fine. Cinematography was suitably moody, although a bit contrived. The askew camera angles seemed neither annoying nor fraught with allegorical significance; however, the balloon vendor's exaggerated shadow and the brightly lit sewers were distracting. The acting was better than average for the period, but largely consisted of posturing to deliver exposition. Dialogue was good, with a lot of subtext. I liked that the dialogue was delivered in the language of the character and appreciated the confusion it caused. I liked the ending ? cynical, dismaying and very un-Hollywood, but effective. What disappointed me was the plot, which made no sense at all. If one were to rearrange the events in chronological order, as I understood them, they would go something like this:Spoiler Alert!!In post-war Vienna, penicillin is scarce. Charles Lime hatches a scheme to steal it from a British military hospital with the help of orderly Joseph Harbin, dilute it and sell it on the black market to other hospitals. The diluted penicillin proves ineffectual or worse. Major Calloway launches an investigation. Lime conspires to cover his tracks by murdering Harbin and switching identities so the authorities believe he is dead. He will then defect to the Russian sector. But first he offers pulp fiction author Holly Martins a job and sends him a plane ticket. Although Martins is apparently a popular, successful author, he is broke and leaps at the opportunity to travel to Vienna, where he learns that Lime is dead and tries to unravel inconsistencies in the stories told by witnesses. The movie suggests that the penicillin somehow caused the patients distress and exacerbated their conditions. This might make sense if the penicillin were somehow contaminated in the dilution process. But absent an allergic reaction, a weak dose of penicillin shouldn't cause any immediate harm. When the dosage proved ineffective, one would expect the doctors to suspect it had been diluted and simply increase the dosage at considerably greater expense and/or renegotiate with Lime. Similarly, if it were contaminated, one would expect it to cause infections and for the doctors to suspend using it. One might just as easily blame the doctors for buying and administering suspect drugs on the black market. Everybody knows penicillin is scarce. It seems no different than drug dealers purchasing heroin. They need to conduct quality control inspections to be sure they get what they paid for. For all they know, Lime could have filled used vials with tap water. The murder/fake death plot doesn't make much sense either. Apparently Dr. Winkel, Popescu and Kurtz were involved in the penicillin scheme and assisted Lime in faking his death. Two walk with Harbin, one entices him to cross the street and the fourth runs him over with a truck. Or maybe they pushed him. This is done in broad daylight in front of witnesses who don't want to become involved, but are ready to chase Martins all over town when they suspect he was involved in the porter's murder. Calloway, who has a personal axe to grind with Lime and is heading the investigation, has time to attend funerals and escort visitors around town but doesn't find time to verify that the accident victim was Lime, even though some of the witnesses made inconsistent statements. Meanwhile, Lime, who has done all this so he can get away clean, doesn't go anywhere. He manages to slip into his apartment building, where everybody knows him, in broad daylight without being seen, and murders the porter then slips out again. Artistically, the film is superb. It has many excellent qualities. But the plot is flimsy, incoherent and relies upon numerous coincidences and contrivances.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm among those who were disappointed upon first seeing `the greatest British film of the 20th Century' (I don't think it's THAT; and anyway, what's with the `of the 20th century' clause? It's not as if there are any serious contenders from the previous century) - and I was still a trifle disappointed upon seeing it a second time, in a cinema. Not that I disliked it on either occasion.Part of the problem is that I knew too much about the story. I'm sure you will enjoy your first viewing of `The Third Man' at least twice as much if you know as little as possible about it beforehand. There are people out there who think that if a film is fifty years old it's okay to give away all the surprises, as if we know them all at birth anyway. And then there are those who think that if a film is any good to begin with it can stand having its secrets revealed. Well, yes: people will still take DIMINISHED pleasure in `The Third Man', as I did, if they know what's going to happen. They will also still get some pleasure out of it if forced to watch it from uncomfortable seats. That's no argument in favour of uncomfortable seats. Anyway: you should be VERY careful what you allow yourself to read about this film before you see it. Look over all the comments here with fitful, darting eyes. That applies to my comments, too. Anyone who hasn't seen the movie should stop reading now. Please take this warning seriously.I'm not too fond of the ending - that pursuit through the sewers. (Although the VERY end, the coda, that long shot of the tree-lined street, was just perfect - as good a closing shot as I have ever seen.) This is the kind of ending you get when no-one can think of an ending. Maybe it would work better if Harry Lime were a sympathetic character; but despite what so many people say, he's NOT a sympathetic character, and he isn't meant to be; or if he IS meant to be, then Graham Greene and Carol Reed and Orson Welles have misunderstood their own creation. Obviously, Lime is meant to have some charm. He's meant to have whatever it takes to win over Anna and Holly. But he's not there to win US over, not even in the slightest degree. `The Third Man' is the story of someone who is close friends with a man who, as WE recognise, is a monster. We're shown that he's a monster before we even meet him and sense that he's up to no good long before that. However laden with charm Welles's performance may be it comes too late to fool us. In any event, Harry Lime is clearly the kind of charmer who works on one victim at a time, and he never gets a spare moment to cast his spell over the audience. I think, though, that everyone assumed that this MUST be the story of a likeable rogue, including perhaps the writer, which is why the film's climax never really ignites.That's my only complaint about the film itself. In fact I agree with all the other favourable remarks people have made, about the story, characters, presentation and music - I only wish I had been allowed to watch the film in the correct frame of mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jaw-Dropping Style; An Exquisite Nightmare</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the final fade-out of this movie, I just, automatically, let out the word "Wow." I've seen a lot of movies and have never seen one quite like "The Third Man." It is the most stylish movie I've ever seen.Every scene is so exquisitely crafted that I was just in awe. I had to keep repeating scenes and repeating scenes. At one point, Trevor Howard is leaning against a cross-shaped tombstone. Howard is wearing a black leather trench coat, a fedora, a thin mustache, and a facial expression cooler than a gin and tonic.Howard is asked, "Can you tell me, uh, who's uh..." And Howard says, "Fella called Lime." And the zither score jumps in.It's a moment that in any other movie would just be a throw away, but in this movie it is so intensely well played, so cool, so stylish, I had to keep repeating it and repeating it to savor its brilliance.Okay, there is a plot here. Harry Lime (Orson Welles) has been doing naughty things in Vienna after World War Two, when the city is divided between American, French, British, and Russian powers.His friend Holly Martins (Joseph Cotton) shows up to work with Lime, and gets tangled up in shady doings, mysterious characters, and international intrigue, including British officer Calloway (Trevor Howard) and Lime's moll Anna (Alida Valli), who is Czech, but trying to pass as Austrian, to avoid being handed over to the Russians.But the plot and characters are secondary here. "The Third Man" is really all about style, and its style is awesome, untouchable.Yes, it does get a bit precious -- the lights, the shadows, in each scene are as carefully crafted as if each scene were a painting. And yet it still has power. "The Third Man" has the wide-open and yet claustrophobic, urban and yet utterly remote and isolated look of a nightmare. There are shots that, in and of themselves, just make your hair stand on end, make you want to scream.And yet there are moments of laugh out loud comic relief.And then there is the zither score. If you know nothing else about "The Third Man," you probably know about that score.The zither mocks scenes and audience. The music at a burial is jaunty; it's a dance tune. That brilliant creepiness, with the weirdness of an aural clown with a painted on smile -- but the clown is strangling a puppy -- just underlines the movie's themes of criminality, treachery, and betrayal.There are scenes here that no one who loves movies should miss. You have to see the very first appearance of the man in the shadows -- that man with the cat on his feet. The cuckoo clock speech on the ferris wheel. It is beyond brilliant, and genuinely deep and profound, if horrifying.I have long thought that the classic scene in "Lawrence of Arabia" where Omar Sharif takes forever to enter the shot is the best ever scene of a character entering a shot from a great distance, but in "The Third Man" there is a scene where Valli is far from the camera, and walks toward it, slowly, through an avenue of trees, as leaves fall on her -- stunning.Film students will tell you all about the impact of German expressionism and Dutch angles ... but I can mostly just say how much this film knocked my socks off.Why not give it a ten ... I wish that some of the characters had been more fully realized. Joseph Cotton never stopped being a cypher; I wished he had had a bit more substance.This is not the case with Harry Lime. His screen time is limited, and yet it is one of the most devastating depictions of human evil I've ever seen.Wow. You have to see this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw this Hitchcock wanna be last night for the first time and this is the first time I have ever been compelled to write a review of any film. The plot was awful. The zither music droned on and on and ruined the mood of most of the scenes, not to mention it was so loud, much of the dialogue was lost. Reed would have done well to pay attention to Hitchcock's master scorer, Bernard Hermann. Score should be used to enhance a mood. Great score is almost undetectable. In this case it became another character, an irritating one.Anyone who has ever studied Hitchcock knows that he only used acute angles to create tension and anxiety. Reed used this technique randomly as if he thought it would just look cool.And the characters...There is no one here to root for. Ambivalence is the kiss of death in film, and that's how I felt about both Cotton and Welles' character. Lime is a horrid child killer, Martins is an idiot and Valli loves a child killer, three characters I could care less about.It is astounding to me to see so many glowing reviews, and the fact that this is considered a "classic" is tragic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Timeless Toy of Fateful Accident</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Third Man is one of that smattering of pictures that have become the epitome, not just a movie that would continue to inspire countless other films but a paradigm that would embed itself deep within the id of a massive amount of viewers, counting people who've never even seen it. The first time you do, your encounter is sprinkled with little jolts of recognition, lines and scenes and moments whose resonance have already made their way to you intermediately.Although both Greene and director Carol Reed were British, the perspective of this pinball machine of a movie feels very American, a detail that's only partially clarified by the presence of Cotten and Welles. Post-war Vienna characterizes Europe's remains. It's thick, for sure, with actual remains, though the diversely twisting and regal structural design of its more practical edifices looks devastated by being rendered worthlessness. Similarly, most of the Europeans we see are remarkably played by an ensemble of Austrian and German character actors, who correspond superbly with the mixed doubts and disdain of the inexperienced American, Holly Martins, who lumbers through the alleys, down the holes, up the ladders, seemingly a toy of fate, but one who appears to usually break even. The American Martins is upfront, yet surrounded by Europeans, and their paths oscillate between confrontation and tiptoeing, like minor cultural traits represent an inherent bylaw.Welles is, sure enough, the mind-body dualism of the story. His character is mentioned in each scene, in addition to the title, and has the most hands-down unforgettable lines in the script. Moreover, his interactions with Cotten, a recurrent performer in his directorial work, take on Welles's distinguishing metrical hallmark: mood intersecting and colliding with figure of speech, lines treading on lines in a persistent roundabout of broken tides.Reed, a director far too obscure in the US, made outstanding films both preceding and following this one. Reed was amply accommodating to offer a noteworthy argument against the auteur theory. The Third Man is constant with his superlative form, wheedling a taut drama with penetratingly illustrated characters, in a locale so defined it may too be regarded among the cast.The Third Man is such a hysterically visual event that it's easy to overlook what a petite, intuitive film it basically is. Think about how Anton Karas, without whose score the picture wouldn't be remotely the same, was discovered on location, playing in a restaurant. That kind of fortuitous find, during production, of a deep-seated constituent of a movie would've been tough if not unimaginable in Hollywood even then. The Third Man is indeed a virtuoso progression of make-or-break gambles, a sort of contrarian recipe of contrasting essentials that somehow come together as if they had been fated to. It's an extraordinary item, an accident, a well-lubricated mechanism, a historic cache, an innovative sensation. There has never been another movie entirely like it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blithering Zithering!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love Orson Welles and Joseph Cotton, either together or singularly in movies. This one I saw for the first time a few years ago on TCM. They played it again this morning.If there was a way to play a movie on "Mute," and still get the gist of the acting, I would do it. What a horrific decision to make use of a Zither as the major music score. The repetitive pounding of the same score was maddening! In case you have any tympanic membrane left, be forewarned....A "Zither" is a musical instrument that sounds like a cross between a Mandolin and a Screeching Cat. The music goes loud, then low (during a funeral), fast then slow.... but rarely stops for more than 5 minutes at a time. It's the same tune too. Forget waterboarding: just play this music score to your enemy and they'll beg you to take their secret info.The movie is often shown in angles, as though they tilted the camera. Tall shadows of unknown persons in the city at night were supposed to add to the thriller aspect. Oh yeah, it seems that this city is always empty except for the movie crew and actors. Odd.I thought the movie was fine, but not worthy of most accolades. Just a modest post-war thriller of sorts. Orson Welles shows up in the last third of the movie. The thrill part comes mostly from his interaction with Joseph Cotton and others, and the plot point is finally revealed. Big Deal!! Geez....I don't think I've ever spent so much room of a review on the music alone. BUT It's the music that jangles every nerve in my body and ruins what otherwise would have been a good movie experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The motion picture concerns on an American writer of pulp Western named Holy Martin(Joseph Cotten), he arrives in a post-war devastating Vienna to see his old friend Harry Lime(Orson Welles), but he discovers he has been killed. In the funeral knows a gorgeous scene actress(haunting Alida Valli). Manipulative Harry is a known delinquent drug-dealer, smuggling adulterated penicillin in black-market and master-criminal at large in a Vienna of nightmare divided in four zones, the city is plenty of ruins, trash,devastation,rubbish and debris. Lime is allegedly dead , but is finally pursued throughout the sewers by authorities(Trevor Howard, Bernard Lee, Geoffrey Keen).Based on Grahame novel's , this classic movie noir thriller is an excellent story lavishly produced by the great American producer David O Selznick and Hungarian producer Alexander Korda. This is a deeply satisfying and intelligent picture for not be missed, using a considerable talent in acting as main cast as secondaries actors formed mostly by foreigners players of various countries and utilizing the cream of British experts in writing and technical departments. With a plethora of anthological images and dialogs such as the scenes about conversation in the fairs between Harry Lime and Martin and the underground-sewers pursuits. Magnificent Orson Welles and Joseph Cotten, great friends in real life; Welles reportedly intervened in direction principally on his scenes, though in an interview he explained that Carol Reed directed totally this outstanding movie.Extraordinary Anton Karas'musical score , though insistent and sometimes irritant zither which hooked itself into the people of the world.Robert Krasker's gorgeous cinematography , reflecting splendidly the shapes, lights, shadows with sophisticated, elegant use of camera angles and deservedly winning an Oscar and nomination for film-making and edition. The film is perfectly directed by Carol Reed in his second adaptation about Grahame Greene novel, the first was 'The fallen idol(1948)' and later 'Our man in Havana(1959)'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Trouble with Harry Lime</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I initially felt a fool for not having seen "The Third Man" earlier. However, in retrospect, having now read most of Graham Greene's major works, and having received some keen insight into the back-story of producer Alexander Korda through Kati Marton's book "The Great Escape", I feel I was able to enjoy "The Third Man" even more for the staggering masterpiece that it is.As a European/American co-production bankrolled by two legendary hands-on producers, David O. Selznick and Alexander Korda, "The Third Man" was masterfully crafted by director Carol Reed from a screenplay by British novelist Graham Greene. The film served as a pinnacle of the film noir movement and is a prime example of master filmmakers working with an iconic writer and utilizing an amazing cast and crew to create a masterwork representing professionals across the field operating at the top of their game.Fans of Greene's novels need not be disappointed as the screenplay crackles with all that signature cynicism and sharp witted dialogue. Carol Reed's crooked camera angles, moody use of shadowing and external locations (Vienna, partially bombed out, wet and Gothic, never looked more looming and haunting) and crisp editing are the perfect visual realizations of Greene's provocative wordplay and often saturnine view of the world. Reed's brief opening montage and voice-over introducing us to the black market in Vienna is also shockingly modern, as it is that energetic quick-cut editing that has influenced directors like Scorsese to film entire motion pictures in just such a style. Also making the film decidedly timeless is the zither music score of Anton Karas, a bizarre accompaniment to the dark story that serves as a brilliant contradiction to what is being seen on screen.The story of "The Third Man" slides along like smooth gin down the back of one's throat as characters, plot and mood meander and brood along cobblestone streets and slither down dark alleys in an intoxicated state. Heavy drinking hack writer Holly Martins (Joseph Cotten, doing an excellent Americanized riff on Graham Greene himself) arrives in post WWII occupied Vienna to meet up with his old pal Harry Lime (Orson Welles) only to find that Lime is reportedly dead, the police (headed by a perfectly cold Trevor Howard) don't seem to care, and Lime's charming broken-hearted mistress (Alida Valli, perfect as another Greene archetype) has been left behind. Of course, Martins can't leave well enough alone as conspiracy, murder, unrequited romance, and political intrigue ensue. Welles benefits greatly from being talked about for most of the film and appearing mostly in shadows spare for two scenes: the famous ferris wheel speech, and a climatic chase beneath the streets of Vienna through Gothic sewers. His top hap, dark suit, and crooked smile are the stuff of film legend. The side characters, however, are what make "The Third Man" such a rich, rewarding experience. We're treated to small glimpses into the mindsets of varying people ranging from a British officer obsessed with American Western dime-store novels (of which Martins claims his fame) to an Austrian landlady eternally wrapped in a quilt going on and on in her foreign tongue as international police constantly raid her building and harass her tenants. The brilliance is that one needs no subtitles to understand her frustration. These added layers of character and thoughtful detail, hallmarks of Greene, set "The Third Man" in a class above the rest of film noir from the late 1940's era.Make no mistake, "The Third Man" is arguably one of the most finely crafted films ever made. One's preference towards noir and Greene's world-view will shape how much one actually enjoys the film. For the sheer fact it has held up so well over the decades and has clearly influenced so many great films that came after it, its repeated rankings as one of the greatest motion pictures ever made can not be denied. With a good stiff drink in hand, and Graham Greene's collection dog-eared on my bookshelf, "The Third Man" is undoubtedly now one of my favorite films. Reed's closing shot of a tree-lined street along a cemetery and Joseph Cotten leaning against a car smoking a cigarette while Alida Valli walks right past him with that zither music score playing is one that has left an indelible mark on my memory and enriched my love of film as art.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another overrated "masterpiece"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've always thought "The Third Man" (**1/2 out of ****) one of the most overrated movies I've ever seen 4 or 5 times. Setting aside the admittedly dazzling photography and editing, we have a plot that's as difficult to follow and riddled with holes and loose ends as the one for "The Big Sleep." If we assume that Harry Lime is the "third man" who drove the truck that killed the medical orderly that was informing on him to the police (in fact, this is never made clear), wouldn't it have been a simple matter for the authorities (or anyone else) to identify the body and discover that it was not Harry Lime? Didn't the police interview the driver of the truck? How could Lime and his cohorts have possibly gotten away with the faking of his death when he was the most notorious and sought after racketeer in Vienna? The pretext for Holly Martins (Joseph Cotton) being in the city at all is awfully weak. (The narration mentions a vague "some sort of a job.") Why would Harry want a friend from America that he hasn't seen for 10 years to come to Vienna to write about his operations? The less publicity the better it would seem to me. It's also extremely ambiguous whether or not his mistress (Alida Valli) knew that Harry was dead. The first time that Martins sees Lime he's lingering outside her apartment house as if waiting to go in, and then she does everything she can to make sure that Harry eludes the authorities. In fact, her obtuse behavior throughout the film is baffling. (I'm inclined to believe that she was in on the whole deception.) Perhaps Carol Reed and co. needed audacious cinematic razzle-dazzle and oblique dialogue to cover up the fact that their story makes minimal sense. And that jangling zither music! Time and again it intrudes upon scenes that were meant to evoke tension and atmosphere and dissipates both. After the 4th or 5th repetition of the "Third Man Theme", I was ready to turn on the "mute" button! (These comments are based on the original 104 minute version.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Mysterious Third Man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Who is the third man? An accident has occurred, a man was hit by a car. Three men were on the scene, but only two have been identified and everyone refuses the existence of the third man.The Third Man is the story of American novelist Holly Martins going to post-WWII Vienna, Austria to visit his friend Harry Lime. Upon arrival Martins learns that Lime was recently hit by a car in an accident, but Martins soon begins to uncover a conspiracy about a penicillin racket and this mysterious third man that leads him to believe that his friend might have in fact been murdered.The Third Man is really a hit-and-miss film. The premise is ripe with potential for suspense, but there was never a moment in the film where the suspense really elevated to the level needed to really keep me on the edge of my seat. The mystery unfolds in a fashion in which is fairly predictable, the music to the film felt odd and out of place for a film noir, and the film's tone was constantly shifting. Just when the film seemed to be on the right track to hooking the viewer, it did a complete U-turn and went back the other way.Even for all my gripes, the film has many great things about it. The performances from Joseph Cotton and Orson Welles as Martins and Lime were superb, the cinematography was simply marvelous, and for the time the direction was very unique, directed in a way that many movies weren't done till at least the 60s (the infamous sewer chase is the true stand-out moment of the film).While the film has many things going for it, at the end of the day it doesn't stack up well against some of the finer mystery/thrillers in cinema history.I give The Third Man a 6 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>long shadows in the wet streets of Vienna</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For me it wasn't an advantage that I knew how well this movie is regarded by most people. My expectations were of course very high also because my favorite film critic from my own country (Denmark) simply regard "the third man" as the best movie he has ever seen. Since I also know Graham Greenes work well, as he is one of my favorite writers, I had expected more. That Holly Martins is mistaken for a serious and intellectual writer when he is only a writer of "cheap novelettes" can easily be identified as the fingerprint of Mr. Greene; it is a common theme in Greenes books that a person is mistaken for something grander than he really is which poses some very interesting dilemmas. This also leads to one of the humoristic scenes as Martens is invited to talk about "the contemporary novel" at the "cultural reeducation section" which actually is hilarious. He ends up being asked questions about James Joyce and "stream of consciousness" which he of course has no chance in hell to answer since he only writes lousy western novels (like "Bill &amp; Ben" I suppose). I didn't like the casting of Holly Martins - and I can see that others are critical of him too. His role wasn't interesting either; He wasn't interesting or mysterious ? he was just what he appeared to be: an American who wrote cheap books on a mission to find the truth as to why his friend died; all for the wrong and naive reasons. Anna Schmidt who was Limes mistress was tiresome in the long run. I didn't understand why she had fallen so desperately in love with Lime. Lime appears very charming but still?I can see from the other reviews, that a memorable part of the movie is the discussion on morality. It is as if Lime almost succeeds in persuading you of his alternative way of seeing the world. And this is scary. What I really really loved about the film was the photography? Oh my god. The wet and dark Vienna with the long shadows. The faces. Baron Kurtz. Orson Welles. I can only give this one 6/10 but I will certainly wonder why it didn't appeal more to me.Regards Simon</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Much like the entrance of Laura in the film LAURA, Harry Lime's entrance into the dark world of post-war Vienna is one of the most unforgettable of all times and effectively erased any memory that Joseph Cotten, the main hero (and alter-ego of Graham Greene) was even in THE THIRD MAN. Photographed under an opening window in a deserted Vienna street, Lime comes into focus as a fleeting face with a smug expression and suddenly we remember Orson Welles was included in the credits. It's a very powerful moment -- one which has us, the viewer, shift our consciousness into wanting to see more of him, wanting to get to know him even if he is a shady, corrupted character. It's the One Moment in the film when it seems that time (in a country that makes clocks, something that Lime makes a joking reference to later on) stops dead in its tracks.THE THIRD MAN is the one film-noir that doesn't have a treacherous femme fatale and the usual suspects but shady people and a growing sense of doom and despair. That in essence is the very nature of film-noir, where it began before demanding the appearance of a sexy blonde with evil intentions. A political theme and espionage reigns throughout without it ever being as much as hinted at, and betrayal is at every corner, something that Hitchcock would have loved had he directed this film. There is a distant echo of CASABLANCA reflected in the threesome at the center of this story with Anna being the reserved woman in the middle but this is not a lush romance. If anything, there is a strong anti-romantic sentiment here, not only because Anna has been irrevocably separated from Lime but she also will not be the one whom Cotten's Martins gets at the end. And in that sense, that pessimism is what film-noir is about.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE THIRD MAN is an effective piece of late '40s film noir, but in my opinion is a rather overrated one, accompanied as it is by a distracting zither score that some believe is the film's crowning achievement, aside from Robert Krasker's B&amp;W photography. Joseph Cotten gives his usual low-key performance as the pulp writer who wants to track down what really happened to his friend, Harry Limes (Orson Welles) whom he suspects has met with foul play and Valli is similarly low-key in her role as Limes' lonely sweetheart. Trevor Howard is excellent as Major Calloway who tries to help both Cotten and Valli, warning both of the dangers they face.The B&amp;W Oscar-winning photography of post-war Vienna is crisply detailed and shadowy in its display of virtually empty cobblestoned streets at night and the background score is unusual and sometimes even striking. But therein lies the trouble. Not all of the famous Anton Karas zither score seems appropriate for the on screen action, although whether this is intentional or not, I don't pretend to know. For me, much of the score works against the story instead of creating the proper amount of tension in the script, as atmospheric as the Austrian music is.If ever a story of post-war Vienna troubled by corrupt officials and black market thieves and murderers needed an orchestrated score by a Bernard Herrmann type of composer, this is it. Others have praised the zither score to the skies, but I'm of the firm opinion that "The Third Man Theme" itself is the high point of this particular score, effectively used every time the mysterious Orson Welles appears.His theme became enormously popular as "The Third Man Theme" and deserved its success as a single--but as others have observed, the rest of the zither score becomes a bit monotonous after awhile and plays against what is happening on screen instead of deepening the emotional impact of the story. In fact, there are times when it becomes distracting and even irritating.It's an interesting, almost semi-documentary kind of film from Carol Reed that has Welles appearing only toward the halfway point and then only briefly. He gives one of his better performances, more controlled, less florid than usual, although the film is carried chiefly by Cotten, Howard and Valli and some superb photography. The story is told in such a cold documentary manner that there is almost an air of detachment about connecting to any of the characters we are supposed to care about. In this respect, it is Trevor Howard's Major Calloway that comes across as the most likable and fully developed character in the story.Trivia note: The kitten seen in Valli's apartment and devoted to Harry Limes is not the same creature that rubs against him in the doorway scene, an obviously older cat. How did they think a sharp-eyed movie fan would not notice??</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watched it last night. I was not engrossed, which surprised me. The main character is a writer of some sort, but he completely lacks imagination. He's entirely straight-forward, utterly lacking in the nuanced sophistication that makes for a good investigator. The motivations of many of the characters are dubious at best, such as the appearance of the Third Man. Orson Welles did fine, but the role is not as legendary and epic as we are lead to believe. Not seeing this film will not make one any less of a film connoisseur. The camera-work, shadows, and atmosphere are to be commended. The actors other than Joseph Cotten are very good. Overall, it makes for a "so-so" film by today's standards. Some older films created tension quite well, but this film simply doesn't, which is probably a prerequisite for a thriller to succeed, no?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A let down - not bad, but not a classic in my book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sir Carol Reed's 1949 film The Third Man is one that consistently crops up "The Greatest Film Of Time" polls. The American Film Institute named it #57 in their top 100 and it reached an impressive #41 in Channel 4's recent poll. But as Warner finally release it on DVD, does this 53 year old film still cut the mustard? I'll get to that later, but first onto the important matter of the plot.(POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD)American third rate novelist Holly Martins (Joseph Cotten) moves to Vienna to take up a job, offered to him by his friend, Harry Lime (Orson Welles). On arrival Holly discovers that Lime has been killed in a road accident but something doesn't quite seem to add up. He proceeds to play private detective with the same ineptitute that characterises his writing, and events take a dramatic turn for worst. Lime it seems is not dead, rather a dangerous racketeer and a killer. Alongside this story runs a fairly typical love triangle, with Martins taking a shine to Lime's girl, Anna (Alida Valli), who is more interested in the memory of Harry than the presence of his friend.So this is all well and good - add a terrific finale, some irritating zither music, and a mixed quality of acting and you've got a good film, albeit it one which doesn't quite live up to its billing. Joseph Cotten's one dimensional character provides an unsatisfactory centrepiece to the story and Welles, who is only onscreen for around 20 minutes, steals the show. His monologue about the Swiss and their cuckoo clocks is the most memorable in the film and a fine example of the dry humour which crops up occasionally throughout.The Third Man was a film I was very excited about seeing. After watching it however, I couldn't help but feel slightly disappointed. Orson Welles delivers a great performance but the first hour of the film, notable for Welles' absence, is sluggish and slow-paced. Only in the final third does The Third Man live up to its acclaim, and while it includes some memorable lines and terrific scenes, this isn't quite sufficient to justify its classic status. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Haunting and Poetic; A True Masterpiece...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Carol Reed's "The Third Man" strikes all the right cords, establishing itself on so many different levels that it almost becomes untouchable. It has an underlying tone of darkness that not only thrills but chills. It grabs the viewer from the start and never lets go. It opens with Anton Karas' startling zither music and quickly propels the viewer into a world of evil and lies. The tale is familiar to any film lovers: A pulp Western writer named Holly Martin (Joseph Cotten) is invited to post-war Vienna by an old friend of his, Harry Lime (Orson Welles). The city has been divided into American, British, French and Russian zones. The city exists as a shattered remnant of the past - haunting and horrifying, dark and mysterious. Upon his arrival, Holly discovers to his horror that his old college pal is dead - hit by a car in the middle of a street. But for Holly, the circumstances don't add up - everyone involved in the accident was related in some way or another to Harry. So Holly searches for clues, much to the chagrin of the British officer Calloway (Trevor Howard), whose name is misused as Callohan by Holly many times throughout the film. ("It's 'Calloway,' Mr. Martin, I'm not Irish.") Holly Martin does begin to stumble upon some vital clues as to the real story behind Lime's death - and finds out more than he bargained for. Lime's old girlfriend is a stage actress. ("Always comedy.") She accompanies Holly throughout the film, and we expect an underlying romance to blossom, but yet in the end it does not - one of the many surprises of the film. I suppose it would be a sin for me to give away how Harry Lime reappears, or even give away the fact that he does, for that matter (though by now I am sure you realize Orson Welles is in this movie and therefore turns out to be alive). But for those who have seen the film, we all remember that terrific scene where the cat meows, and suddenly he appears, an evil smirk on his face like a child who has gotten away with the cookie from the jar. And then the ferris wheel scene, and the chase through the sewers that no doubt helped win the film an Oscar for cinematography. These are all some of the most memorable of film scenes. The director of "The Third Man," Carol Reed, stumbled upon the film's musician, Anton Karas, one night in a trashy bar in Vienna. It is no wonder that out of all his candidates he chose Karas - the film's tune is literally the most perfect example of matching harmony between a film and its music I have ever seen (although "JAWS" is up there with it). To go into the music is pointless - it must simply be heard in synchronism with the film for you to understand where I am coming from. When I think of film noir, "D.O.A." (1949) and "The Third Man" (1949) are the first two films that come to mind. Both accomplish what they set out to do, but "The Third Man" exceeds even farther than the former - it is haunting and almost poetically vibrant in the way it displays its story and the outcome of its characters. It is a film that will be around for years and years. "Citizen Kane" is often thought of as the greatest American motion picture of all time. But if I had to choose between the two, I would most likely choose "The Third Man." It's just my opinion, of course, and many may not agree, but as far as I see, "The Third Man" beats "Citizen Kane" - for me - on more levels than one. Welles' "Citizen Kane" (1941) was an artistic film that rarely used close-ups. It would almost stand back from the scenes and let the viewer focus on what he or she wanted to focus on. "The Third Man" has many close-ups. I do not take this as a director trying to give the audience what he wants them to see, but rather a director in touch with his feelings and ideas. Director Carol Reed knows just how to evoke characters' feelings from scenes and close-up shots. The camera tilts at awkward angles more often than not. The more and more paranoid and afraid our hero becomes the more and more intense the close-ups and angles. There is some haunting material in "The Third Man," some material the most novice of filmgoers might not expect. And the music and direction only makes it all the more terrifying and haunting. This is a film that you must witness to believe. 5/5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A great deal has been said about "The Third Man" by contributors to this forum. Having seen the restored copy that was shown at the Film Forum, recently, I could not resist watching this masterpiece once more when it was shown by TCM, the other night.This movie owes a debt of gratitude to Graham Greene, a writer who had the most developed sense of intrigue among his contemporaries and one of the best writers of the last century. It also helped that a great director, Carol Reed, brought it to the screen. Mr. Reed was a director who had an eye for detail, as he demonstrates here, as well as in the rest of the body of work he left for us to enjoy. The screen play is faithful to the original novel. If to all of the other elements we add the fabulous cinematography of Robert Krasker, the result has to be the masterpiece we see today. Never before has a city taken center stage in the development of the story that is presented here. Mr. Krasker's wonderful night vision of this city enhances the story as we are taken along for a fantastic trip of the post war Vienna of 1949.The casting of this film is amazing. Never had so many excellent actors been thrown together in a film, as it is the case as with this picture. Joseph Cotten, Alida Valli, Trevor Howard, Orson Welles, Bernard Lee, Ernst Deutsch, Paul Horbiger, Erich Ponto and Wilfred Hyde White are splendid in their roles. It is hard to imagine these characters played by other actors.Orson Welles has perhaps the best part, even though his time before the camera is short. This must have been one of the best roles in which Welles appeared. Of course, there are so many others, but his Harry Lime is an original and could have fitted perfectly in one of his own films.The music by Anton Karas is still haunting, with the exception of a few times at the beginning of a couple of scenes, when it startles the viewer and actually doesn't add anything to what we are about to see.This film will live forever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Third Man is a film noir with expressionist photography and shot in Austria. A British film with its main leads being American actors.Joseph Cotten and Orson Welles team up one again. Cotton plays boozy pulp fiction novelist Holly Martins, who comes to post war Vienna and he is broke. He was sent over by his old school friend Harry Lime (Welles) but finds out that Lime has just died and is funeral is being held. Vienna has been divided into different zones and the British military police tell Martins that Lime was a racketeer dealing in diluted penicillin which led many people to die.Martins in his disbelieve investigates Lime's death on his own, he encounters the possibility of a third man being present when Lime's body was being carried away from the accident scene. He enters the murky post war world of gangsters and corruption and then a light is switched on.The film starts off as a stark but routine thriller bathed in atmosphere of a bombed out Vienna. Cotton's character is a doofus, he is penniless, drunk and all at sea at first.The film shifts another gear altogether when Welles makes his belated appearance. This maybe is his most memorable role in a film which he did not direct but apparently provided the dialogue for the famous 'cuckoo clock' speech.Director Carol Reed fought to have Welles in this film and makes best use of his brief scenes including the climax chase scene in the underground sewers. It is a surprise that Welles was not Oscar nominated for this larger than life role. He displays so much just with his face, a flicker of a smile than just the dialogue.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Few Personal Notes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No need to recap the oft-repeated plot. So why bother commenting after 500+ reviews. I guess it's because I'm a movie lover and want to enter my little note of appreciation. What sticks in my mind from the movie's first release are the visuals. They're among the most memorable if not the most memorable in film annals. In sum, they're a nightmare world of emptiness?the streets, the walkways, the dead hulking edifices. It's a communal world emptied of community, leaving only ruins and shells. The metaphor for a post-war Europe is unmistakable, while only the morally destitute like Harry Lime have thrived. I can't imagine that filming in color was actually entertained (IMDB). Had that happened, the film would have passed into semi-obscurity unlike its now celebrated status. Note too, that no one ends up happy, in contrast to the narrative norms of the day. I think what brought many folks to the showings at the time was the unfamiliar zither music. As I recall, a commercial cut was heard regularly on the radio. Still, I expect a lot of folks left the theater put-off by the bleakly unhappy world they had just seen. Anyway, the movie remains a brilliant slice of cinematic imagination and should not be missed.</fullReview>

Accident that killed his friend. An accident? Holly Martins doesn't think so. So he end up investigating the case.A wonderful story written perfectly by Graham Greene where piece by piece changes our mind where the story and characters are going. This movie is a masterpiece of cinematography. Streets and magnificent views of post-war Vienna.Orson Welles had not much minutes on the screen, but he did a great performance. Anyway, the whole cast was great.Overall I liked The Third Man, but there are some better Film-Noir movies I've seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A writer travels to post war Vienna to meet an old friend but finds out he's too late.Starring Joseph Cotten, Orson Welles and Alida Valli.Written by Graham Greene. Directed by Carol Reed.It's about time I watched another old movie so I couldn't resist this when I saw it on the TV listings.I like it. It's a good twisty story that kept my interest all the way. The acting is good and the whole thing is pretty artistic and stylish. It's pretty dated but once I got into it it didn't really matter. It's was probably well ahead of it's time considering it came out in 1949 and I was pleasantly surprised that it didn't contain any melodramatic romantic mush. It was all about the story. The mystery.I'm sure I would have loved this if I had been around at the time and watching it for the first time I was transported back in time and I felt like I was there. Oh and I love the background music, pretty quirky stuff.Enjoyed.7.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Carol Reed and Orson Welles are pure genius</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Harry Lime: "Don't be so gloomy. After all it's not that awful. Like the fella says, in Italy for 30 years under the Borgias they had warfare, terror, murder, and bloodshed, but they produced Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, and the Renaissance. In Switzerland they had brotherly love - they had 500 years of democracy and peace, and what did that produce? The cuckoo clock. So long Holly".The Third Man is about Harry Lime who has died in a car accident. Previously he had invited one of his closest friends to join him. His friend now must find out if the story is true and the mystery behind it.The Third Man or best known has Orson Welles second best movie with Citizen Kane still at number 1. This time Carol Reed takes the directing chair and not Orson Welles but I got to be honest here I actually thought that Orson Welles directed this movie just by the way it was shot and acted it looked like his kind of film, because while watching the movie I didn't do any research on the film so I just watch the movie without nothing about the film and while watching the movie I was wounding if Orson Welles directed it's not until the end credits when I find out that Carol Reed directed it. Orson Welles and Carol Reed are both genius when it comes to movies and The Third Man isn't anything different as this is one of the best movies ever made.Carol Reed directing in this movie is absolutely magnificent and pure cinema gold. At times I felt like I was watching a Orson Welles movie just by the way it was shot and how it was acted and how it was executed made it feel like another great movies all together in one. Carol Reed was a fantastic director for this movie as he made a brilliant mystery thriller like The Third Man. Nice work Carol Reed. The movie has this gloomy but yet a wide cinematic feeling to it that made this movie truly special then it is. With every shot in this movie that's both stunning and dazzling to my eyes. The famous scene in the sewers with that ionic image of Orson Welles is cinematography at it's best. Excellent work Robert Krasker the Cinematography of the movie. Joseph Cotten and Orson Welles both did a outstanding performance in this movie and so did everyone else in the film. Everyone in the movie delivered so much to they characters and to be honest I didn't find anyone else in the movie that did a terrible job. You can tell while watching the movie that these actors put a lot into they characters and it paid off brilliantly.Now for the problems that I had with this movie: I honestly didn't find a single thing that was a problem to me or even a flaw in this movie. You could say that it might be perfect, do I think it's perfect? well yeah, I do.Overall The Third Man is a movie that's absolutely worth checking out. These some other things in the movie that I could have brought up but to be honest and I do bring this up a lot and for good reasons. I want you the viewer to watch this movie like I did by not knowing much about the movie but only knowing the praise the movie got, I'm telling you to do this so you can experience what I experience. The Third Man is a classic at it's best.</fullReview>

The Zither music is intrusive and bad. Was this suppose to be the spring board for a Zither "revival"?? That worked, right?Using the sewers as part of the story line was, well shall we say inspired? or was it because that was the only location available to the film makers?Harry, Harry won't you please come home!!!Anything Orson Wells is part of was/is ponderous ..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Adapted for screen by novelist Graham Greene from the novel of the same title and directed by Carol Reed. Critical acclaim and highly praised by cinephiles and critics as well. The story of these characters is especially engrossing with the way it distinctly embodies the attributes of American film noir. This film was filmed in the U.K and originally released there and then the following year was released in the U.S. Also, the plot moves a little slowly compared to American cinematic film noir but definitely is straightforward in it's execution. Martin and his journey to discovering the truth involving the murder of his friend Harry Lime. It's a story about moral injustice. The narrative is introspective. It attempts draws you into the story of corruption and each of the main character's journey for redemption. Stand out performance goes to Orson Wells who really does a fine job at personifying the character of Harry Lime. I don't know if I wish to provide an in-depth character analysis of Harry Lime because it would give away too much of the plot and my objective of this review focused on a general critique of the film. Our heroes are given just enough interesting qualities to drive the plot forward and keep us interested. Joseph Cotton's performance reminds me of John Wayne. In fact, I think John Wayne could probably been a better fit to play Holly Martins since the portrayal Cotton gives is very much a John Wayne imitation. Orson Wells is only on screen for about a quarter of the film but when he does make an appearance, it's quite memorable in regards to a few scenes. I will not give anything away but you will understand what I mean when that scene occurs. Most people are familiar with Orson Wells from his iconic performance as Charles Foster Kane in the film Citizen Kane which is still regarded as the greatest film ever made. The love interest for both leading men is Anna Schmidt ( Alida Valli). The police regard her as a person of interest and essentially Anna is just trying to make sense of the tragedy just like Martin. Alida's performance reminded me of another great American actress, Ingrid Bergman. She's docile, innocent, and inspires our sympathy. Despite the performances from the actors, the thing that makes this movie really excels is the director Carol Reed. She is able to depict the exact lighting and set up various scenes effective emphasis on certain aspects of story plot whilst also supporting the overall tone and mood. She really has an keen sense of detail. Unfortunately in that year of the Academy Awards of 1951, Carol was up against tough competition (All About Eve, The Asphalt Jungle, Born Yesterday and Sunset Blvd) that if not for that, she would have easily won the award for best director and the the film would have won best black and white cinematography.Ironically enough, the same year this movie was released in UK, most of Hollywood films were of the same genre: film noir, crime drama/mystery with a dash of romance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Exactly IMDb's Highest Rated Film (reality check)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, let's get a reality check of how movies are rated here. Just a few movies rated higher than "The Third Man" ranked according to IMDb's most votes, are:First: Shawshank Redemption..... Eighth: The Good, the Bad and the Ugly......29th: Once Upon a Time in the West...... Thirty Eighty: Mad MaxThe Third Man and most every other movie ever made including those that scooped multiple Academy Awards are rated less than these. Regardless, I still find the "Third Man" a rather boring movie. Flaws?? One obvious....The choice of MUSIC! How could anyone in their right mind try to fit this constantly into a post war so-called thriller? Then the screenplay which gets so damned bogged down with the whining of the wonderful Joseph Cotton over his pal and his lust for the equally whining female (who whines over the supposedly dead Welles character). The night scenes have no people in the area except for the stars. The only excitement is provided by Orson Welles, but you have to suffer through almost two-thirds of the movie before he shows up, then all hell breaks loose. Sorry, but that doesn't redeem the whining music and whining actors that come before.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Painfully boring and cheesy. This is supposed to be a classic suspense thriller, but sadly, I found neither credible suspense nor felt any thrill. I went by the high praise accorded to it by the rest of the IMDb community, and stand majorly disappointed. Yeah, yeah, "that" was a different era and people "then" had different ways, but all best-ever's ought to stand the test of shifting senses and sensibilities. This doesn't. Scenes are poorly directed and lack intensity. Horrible jazz guitar plays throughout the movie, and is particularly irritating during tense chase sequences. Joseph Cotten, in all his movies, has a perpetual smirk on his face; I wish he would've managed to somehow rid himself of it -- at least in an suspense/noir movie. He always looks like he's on the verge of a cackle any moment now.MY VERDICT: 5/10 for classic cinematography and great acting by Alida Valli, Trevor Howard, and Orson Welles.

		<shortDescription>The Third Man's the charm</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Third Man is an ideal example of Film Noir. With its impossible shadows and bleak plot elements, it embodies everything that makes the genre what it is. The protagonist of the film is Holly Martins, an American who goes to Vienna because his friend Harry Lime has offered him a job there. Upon reaching Vienna, Martins discovers that his friend has been run over by a car and killed. Or has he? Holly Martins is played by Joseph Cotten, a renowned actor of the period. Since Martins is the protagonist it is his journey throughout the film that is the most fleshed out, and it is he with whom we sympathise. Joseph Cotten does a good job of making his character seem believable and sympathetic, and portrays his journey from an innocent child-like author of westerns to a hardened man who has seen too much of the world with great skill.The leading lady is Alida Valli, who plays Anna Schmidt. Schmidt was Harry Lime's girlfriend before the 'accident', and the character is deeply upset by her loss. Alida Valli manages to portray her character with a haunting believability. There is something mysterious and sad about the character which is not seen in very many other films.But what really makes the film good is the performance of Orson Welles. Welles plays Harry Lime himself, and though the character really gets a minimal amount of screen time, Welles really steals the show. He doesn't just chew on the scenery, he swallows it whole! His character is the most complex of all, so pulling it off as well as Welles did is no walk in the park. Welles manages to show Lime's evil mixed with friendship for his wholesome friend Holly. His entrance to the film, as the light from an upstairs window beams down across his childish face, is by far the most memorable shot in the entire film. The look that he gives his old friend, half guilty half happy, still stays fixed in my eyes now.There is a reason that this film won the Academy Award for Best Cinematography. It is superb. As I have said before, the film has many impossible shadows, as well as tilted camera shots. I think we have all seen scenes in films where a huge shadow coming round a corner precedes its considerably smaller caster. This was the film that invented that device. Even with the impossible shadows and camera angles, the cinematography does not feel out of place. With the films tone of darkness, evil and falsity, the shadows fit right in, and the askew camera angles only enhance the askew plot points.The music of the film was written by Anton Karas. It is almost entirely zither music, and it brings a unique feel to the film. While the light-hearted music seems out of place at first, the viewer eventually gets used to it, and the music actually takes the film along a whole other road to where it would have gone wit darker music. While mostly light, the music is undoubtedly intense, and it emphasises certain themes very well, particularly in the scene just before the landlord gets murdered. As he turns around and notices his off-screen attacker, the music comes on very strong, and gives a feeling of fear to the film. As much as the music works in certain scenes, the lack of music works in others. During the showdown in the sewer, there is almost no music; just the sound of the falling water echoing through the tunnels. This gives a true sense of realism to the scene.The director, Sir Carol Reed did very well with this film. He (as opposed to she, no matter what the name suggests) managed to evoke the characters feelings from not only the actors, but from the lighting and scenery as well. There is something about The Third Man that is unique. While it feels dated, many of the themes the movie embodies are still relevant today, and it is still enjoyable to modern audiences. I would give this film nine stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A noir journey through postwar Europe.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Graham Greene is one of the most acclaimed authors of the 20th century, and, unlike many such literary talents, he recognized the merits of film, and took work as a screenwriter for the British film industry, including several collaborations with producer/director Carol Reed, of which "The Third Man" is the most famous. Greene's works tend to be divided into two main genres: his meditations on Catholicism in the modern world ("The Power and the Glory", for example) and his work in the spy and crime genres, the category to which "The Third Man" belongs. It is also the high-watermark for director/producer Reed, though he would only earn his Best Director Oscar some two decades later with the musical "Oliver!" "The Third Man" is one of the great achievements in film noir, and, perhaps, in film in general.Greene's path in researching the film is in many ways mirrored by the character he ended up creating, one Holly Martins (Joseph Cotten, a prolific actor of the era who never reached the level of recognition of Stewart, Grant, or Bogart); arriving in Vienna, Greene prowled the bombed-out streets and drank in the Casanova Club, talking with local officials. He was inspired by stories of postwar shortage, organized smuggling, and the interaction of the four great powers in the early days of the Cold War. Martins arrives, having been summoned by his prewar friend Harry Lime (Orson Welles, in what is, apart from Charles Foster Kane, his most famous role), only tot find on arrival that Lime has been mysteriously killed in a car accident. The local British security chief, Major Calloway (Trevor Howard) insinuates that Harry was a notorious racketeer involved in everything up to and including murder, and Martins, a writer of pulp novelettes about gunslingers, refuses to let that explanation stand. He delves deeper into Harry's world, from acquaintances such as Baron Kurtz (Ernst Deutch, who couldn't appear less trustworthy if he tried) and Dr. Winkle (Erich Ponto), who were both present at his death, and, most importantly, Anna Schmidt (Alida Valli), a Czech living in Austria on a forged passport provided by Lime to help her avoid repatriation to Soviet-held territory. Martins' first big lead? Witness reports that an unidentified third man was present at Lime's death."The Third Man"'s plot suffers from a case of what TV Tropes would call a 'Rosebud': the fact that the main plot twist is common knowledge because of the movie's notoriety (and, like the original Rosebud, Orson Welles is involved). We all know that Harry Lime isn't actually dead because he is due to appear and give him famous speech about cuckoo clocks (though Welles is listed in the opening credits, so perhaps it was never that big a secret). However, there is still plenty in the movie for the viewer to be surprised about, just as "Citizen Kane" retains its lustre.The movie has several great performances, starting with Cotten as the 'very American' (in the worlds of Peter Bogdanovich) lead man, Alida Valli as Anna, Trevor Howard as Calloway, and an enjoyable comic turn from Bernard Lee (later M to the Connery, Lazenby, and Moore incarnations of James Bond) as Calloway's batman, a sergeant who is quite a fan of Holly's writing. The performance that everyone always ends up talking about is Welles, however, in what amounts to an extended cameo (two scenes, the second with basically no dialogue).The other notable production components include the music, provided by Anton Karas on his zither string instrument, who was hired on the spur of the moment after impressing the director at a wartime party, and it was an inspired choice, though it may jar some people expecting more traditional noir stuff. The film is filmed in the actual postwar Vienna, still a place of ruined buildings, providing for a very high level of verisimilitude.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>They call it film noir. But to do so would imply that the film adheres closely to the stylistic and thematic rules of its predecessors, when, put simply, there's never been anything quite like 'The Third Man (1949).' Carol Reed's post-War masterpiece differs from traditional noir in that it is a distinctly British production, equipped with a wry, almost whimsical, sense of humour that places it alongside the Ealing films of the era, particularly 'Kind Hearts and Coronets (1949)' and 'The Lavender Hill Mob (1951).' Set in post-WWII Vienna, the film depicts a crumbling community of wretched thieves and black-market racketeers, effectively capturing the decadence and corruption of a city that has been brought to its knees. Instantly recognisable through Robert Krasker's harsh lighting and oblique, distorted cinematography, as well as Anton Karas' unique and unforgettable soundtrack ? performed on a peculiar musical instrument called a zither ? 'The Third Man' is one of the most invigorating cinema experiences to which one may be treated.Into the rubble-strewn ruins of Vienna comes an American pulp-novelist, Holly Martins (Joseph Cotten), who arrives without a dime in his pocket in search of an old friend named Harry Lime. However, upon his arrival, Martins is horrified to learn of Lime's tragic death in a traffic accident. Unsatisfied with the explanations he receives from the authorities and witnesses, he teams up with Lime's ex-girlfriend Anna Schmidt (Aldi Valli) to solve the mystery of his best friend's death. Was it an accident? Was it murder? Who was the "third man" who was seen carrying Lime to the roadside? Of course, as you and I both know, Martins' childhood friend, having faked his own death, is very much alive, and intent on keeping his continued existence quiet. The extraordinary moment, when Harry Lime's face is abruptly illuminated in a doorway, as a cat affectionately nuzzles his shoes, hardly comes as a surprise after fifty years, but the magic is very much still there.Orson Welles' amused boyish smirk, wryly taunting Martins across the roadway, signals the entrance of one of cinema's most charismatic supporting characters. Despite being absent for the first half, Lime's presence is felt throughout, his darkened shadow continually towering over Martins as he seeks to ascertain the circumstances of his friend's death. Lime is a perfect example of the anti-hero, a vibrant, likable and identifiable personality who commits atrocities that should immediately warrant our detestation. Graham Greene's brisk and intelligent screenplay gives Lime all the best lines, particularly on the Ferris Wheel ride when he muses on the value of those inconsequential "little dots" walking below, though Welles himself takes credit for penning the celebrated "cuckoo clock" monologue; a rapidly-delivered acknowledgment of the creativity born from "warfare, terror, murder, and bloodshed." Though Welles justifiably receives a lot of the praise, every other cast member delivers a wonderful performance, particularly Cotten as the bemused and morally-conflicted foreigner, Valli as Lime's steadfast lifelong disciple, and Trevor Howard as the Major who wishes that Lime had remained underground.Director Carol Reed famously clashed with producer David O. Selznick over various facets of the film's production, with Selznick insisting on pivotal casting decisions, and allegedly suggesting that the film be titled "Night Time in Vienna." However, in the case of the suitably downbeat ending, both producer and director saw eye-to-eye, and Greene's original optimistic conclusion (in which Holly and Anna reconcile) was shelved in favour of the wonderful static long-shot, in which Martins is completely ignored by the women whose trust he is perceived to have broken. 'The Third Man,' perhaps as a result of these contradictory artistic influences, has acquired, like no other film I've seen, a distinct personality of its own. Karas' zither soundtrack, as though consciously flouting traditional noir conventions, adds an element of whimsy to the proceedings, and somehow complements perfectly the larger-than-life distortion of Krasker's photography, in which ordinary human shadows tower three storeys in height, and even the most commonplace of interactions take on the warped dimensions of a drug-induced dream. In Vienna, the truth can be as elusive as a ghost.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Carol Reed's flawless masterpiece and essential viewing for film buffs.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like to consider myself as a somewhat cultured man in the world of cinema - I have engaged in many film delights for many different reasons; from the downright silly to the spiritually moving, non stop action to obscure art-house, gritty realism to total fantasy, sweeping epics to the blunt and insular.The Third Man is my personal favourite movie of all time for one overwhelming reason - it's wry charm - which this film has in spades.This is just a perfect film; every time I see those zither strings being plucked at the intro, I'm there in Vienna. The crooked camera angles of the streets, the brilliantly acted characters of Harry and Holly and their intertwining relationship, the dryness of Calloway, the absolute wit and grace of the script and of course, one of the most memorable scores in movie history all combine to create an incredible piece of film noir but with so much more humour, irony, tension and characterisation than others in its genre (not dismissing such other greats as Double Indemnity and Touch of Evil which are also superb).So at the risk of sounding like a rabid fan, yes, I do believe this to be the greatest film of all time - and the ferris wheel scene should be more than enough evidence to prove this!Perfect - 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It always helps if your film has the single best theme music ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Third Man" is a classic, but did you really expect me to say anything else? Few films have managed to have such a flow and feel to them. The film flawlessly juggles comedy, thriller, and film noir and manages to find the perfect balance between all those elements. For a genre such as film noir that was notorious for often not having a sense of humor, much of the action in "The Third Man" is very tongue-in-cheek. Few non auteur films have achieved such a consistent flow and seem to be from one mind. In addition to how well made it is, its a wonderfully entertaining film. Its often compared to "Citizen Kane", and while its not on the technical level of that film, its certainly more enjoyable. Anyone who is new to classic cinema, this is one of the first films you should check out.Every aspect is superb in the film. The direction by Carol Reed creates an unforgettable atmosphere to the proceedings. He fashions a unique look to the scenes, and the climax set in the sewers is cinema perfection. The screenplay by Graham Greene is a tad confusing initially (which is what keeps this from being a total classic) but is clever and full of many classic, quotable lines. The best aspect of this film is certainly Orson Welles though. As Harry Lime, Welles takes one of the most despicable villains ever caught on camera and makes him so charming and roguish you can't help but love him. You despise all his actions but the man's personality is so appealing and infectious. His "cuckoo clock" monologue is possibly the best ever in cinema. The supporting cast (Joseph Cotton, Valli, and especially Trevor Howard) are all great, but this is Welles' film completely. This is one of the few films that viewing for anyone with a slight interest in cinema is mandatory. Plus, it always helps if your film has the single best theme music ever (you'll be humming the "Third Man Theme" for the rest of your life). (9/10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'The Third Man' has every right to be described as the greatest British film ever made. It perfectly captures a country ravaged by war nd struggling to get to grips with defeat where the black market is rife. Director Carol Reed makes the black ands white images harsh and almost sharp to capture this feeling of despair. It is impossible to see that this film could ever have worked in colour. The cast is faultless with Orson Welles perfect as the mysterious Harry Lime. The character who may not been be seen for much of the picture but his is presence is strangely felt in every scene. Each piece of Harry's life in Austria is slowly unwrapped by his best friend Holly Martins played by Joseph Cotton. A pulp fiction writer who is invited to Vienna with a promise of work but only to discover that Lime as died. Suspected foul play Martins is torn between loyalty between is friend and the harsh realty that his friend is a crook and he has fallen in love with Harry's girl, Anna (alida Valli). The plot may seem a little dated but it still gives a new audience the opportunity to sit back and watch a well crafted film without graphic violence. In fact the most disturbing images are left instead o the audience's own imagination. A true classic movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From Casablanca to Vienna in 6 years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this last night on BBC4 and surprised myself by possibly enjoying it more than when I saw it at the cinema a few years back. I think this would be because, like Star Wars/Empire any faults show up much more clearly on a big screen to the viewer and (can) detract from the spectacle. I mean, Lucas's digital restoration couldn't prevent the flying machines sporting halos and wobble - time ruins special effects! But it gets by on TV. In The Third Man's case, what we see was pieced back together by Carol Reed after loss by fire of the first edit, leading to a few dodgy joins, mismatched ambiences and slight continuity leaps, all the more apparent after all this time on bigger screens. But it adds a realist feel to a movie already frothing with dark and brooding atmosphere.Having said that, I've now seen TTM about 10 times over the years and still find it a magical experience, with a subject that should sicken and depress but I end up drowned in admiration for a film that has certainly stood the test of time in most departments, with brilliant direction/photography/acting and music.I should imagine everything's been said about it by now, but I would like to comment on its status as Britain's Best Film. Reminder: it was made mainly with American money, mainly in Vienna, with an international cast, crew and even equipment. It's what we do best!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Broke American pulp writer Holly Martins (Cotton) comes to Vienna for a job his friend Harry Lime(Welles) has promised him, only to discover when he gets there that Lime is dead, run over by a car, and that the police accuse him of horrendous black market activities. Cotton tries to clear his friend's name, and begins to suspect something's up when a mysterious "third man" is mentioned at the crash site.Hard to say too much about this movie without giving a lot of it away, but this is a true classic. Cotton is very effective as Martin, a naive do-gooder who quickly gets in over his head. I spent a lot of the movie annoyed at Holly -- his character is amazingly obtuse (in fact, the story for the first 2/3 of the movie essentially happens *around* Holly, in conversations that happen behind Holly's back or murmured off in a corner, or in reactions to Holly that he either ignores or misinterprets). A lot of the movie is an ironic take on the traditional Hollywood hero -- it's no mistake that Holly writes Westerns, after all. Yet Cotton made me believe in Holly's essential decency: Holly's a superficial guy, but he doesn't really understand he's superficial. Welles only has a few scenes but steals them all. He dominates the two classic scenes in the movie, the famous "cuckoo clock" conversation with Cotton (essentially a charming piece of nihilism) and the final chase in the sewers (beautifully, moodily shot by Carol Reed and Robert Krasker), where he's portrayed alternately as a rat and a scared human being. Still, the movie is Cotton's: Graham Greene's literate script is essentially a skeptical, sad examination of loyalty -- Cotton is a pawn in a bigger game he doesn't understand, but his choices are ultimately what define the story. Who should we be loyal to? Greene asks, and offers no easy answers.Just a wonderful movie, with great settings and a memorable zither score from Anton Karas. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I recently saw this on the fantastic Criterion Collection DVD and like countless other was greatly impressed. I'm not sure I can add anything new but I must say that the the feeling of post war Vienna was captured so perfectly and that the cinematography of said setting was a star of the film as much as Cotten or Welles. What I like a lot is that there is no neat or even very poetic ending. Events transpire in a naturalistic fashion full of all the frustrations, disappointments, and unfulfilled expectations that make up life for so many people as they often fruitlessly struggle for some sort of contentment. My only quibble is that the soundtrack is somewhat overrated but that is only my individual opinion. Still a true classic, the film, and our first look at Lime, 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being in Vienna, you must of course see "The Third Man" if you have the chance, especially when it's shown with the original soundtrack. I did so.There aren't many pictures in film history having that splendid photo, in the sewers as well as out of them. But the charm of it is in the way people are behaving, like a glimpse from a lost paradise, although the plot is frightful.It is a beautiful story about friendship between men, one good and one evil, and of passionate love for a woman, which only grows into despair. The background is the bombed Vienna, which make things very special, like destiny looking over your shoulder. The film is probably more sensational now, then it was in 1949.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An atmospheric study in black and white</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not one to rave about "glorious black and white" cinematography. Generally speaking, if it was good in black and white, it would be even better in color (but NOT colorized). However, there are exceptions. Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove would not be improved in color, and Orson Welles' Citizen Kane would not even work as well in color, partially because of the "Movietone" and front page photography feel that Welles wanted, but also because color would add nothing to the sharp focus on an ultimately empty icon of an entirely black and white medium. And Sir Carol Reed's The Third Man is a strongly atmospheric film that clearly is better in black and white. It might be said that if there isn't enough light, it is false to pretend to color. Flowers that bloom at night are usually white.It's Vienna, in a winter month, just after WWII. The city is still in ruins and rubble, still occupied by Allied troops. There is a forlorn sense of loss and waste hanging in the air like a dark blanket of gloom, and the citizens still suffer from a shortage of consumer goods and basic medicines; a good part of the economy is still driven by the black market. Spring and a colorful rejuvenation seem remote. And so the sharp black and white Oscar-winning cinematography of Robert Krasker, imaginative and deeply evocative of a great city in darkness, was perfect. From the ornate facades of old buildings to the wet catacombs of the sewers to the suddenly illuminated face of a slyly smirking Orson Welles, the camera carries the story driven by the zither theme, played over and over again, sometimes loud and insistent, sometimes soft and yielding, commenting all the while like an ironic jester.But The Third Man is more than brilliant cinematography set to a haunting melody. The well-chosen cast, led by Joseph Cotton as an urban American who writes pulp Westerns, and Alida Valli (who followed this performance with a long career in the Italian cinema) as the misplaced Anna Schmidt, and Trevor Howard as British Major Calloway, and of course Orson Welles as the dark and mysterious Harry Lime, was excellent all around. The script by Graham Greene from his novel of the same name is intelligent and compelling. The editing and direction by Reed paced the story nicely, neither too sharply cut nor too drawn out because this is a film that demands both quick action sequences and moments of mirthless pause for mood and reflection.This is a great film because almost everything was done right. The result is a work of art that invades and sets up permanent residence in our psyches. I saw this for the first time as a boy many years ago and it remained in my memory as the most mysterious and eerie movie I had ever seen. Seeing it again in the twenty-first century only confirms the experience of that small boy.This is included in the film noir canon, and indeed it represents itself well there. But The Third Man is better understood as a film of stark realism as well as a mystery in the tradition of an older genre that accepts the common standards of human decency as right and correct (as Catholic Graham Greene believed them) and does not give way to amorality or the success of evil. Harry Lime is a man of charm and character, of intelligence and worldly wiles, but he is also a man with a sociopathic personality and a callous disregard for human life other than his own. It is giving away nothing to realize that such a man in Greene's world, in the world of the mystery story--like something from Agatha Christie, perhaps--will not succeed in the end. But what actually does transpire in the end, indelibly marked by the final shot of Anna walking directly in the middle of the road between two matching lines of cold, leafless trees, is from the school of realism, a realism born of nearly a century of intermittent war and recurrent human tragedy for Vienna, for Austria, for most of Europe. There is in this film no compromise with that truth.See this for Orson Welles, the 25-year-old wunderkind director and star of Citizen Kane (1941), here in his early thirties, enjoying the supreme compliment of starring in a film in which are employed, in frank imitation of his work in Citizen Kane, some of his original cinematic techniques.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book "Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"

		<shortDescription>A Movie That "thinks in terms of human beings"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The negatives of this movie must be blinding! "The Third Man" is as dark as it gets. It is a very interesting experiment in Modernism. Up is down and down is up. "You've got everything upside down," one character says to another and in those five words we have the motivating idea of the movie. And, closely related, is the breakdown of the hero concept. "The world doesn't make heroes," Orson Welles says. Nevertheless, with an arguable amount of success, Holly Martins tries to be one. This is part of what keeps "The Third Man" from being completely bleak. Holly Martins search for "the truth" looks forward to that of Frank Bigelow, the protagonist of the next year's Noir classic "D.O.A." Both men are sent hither and thither (amidst environments that range from the indifferent to the down-right unfriendly) to retrace the details of a crime whose trail of clue's is quickly growing cold.One of the most conspicuous aspects of the movie is the heavy use of canted camera angles. Usually, camera techniques are lost on the average viewer, but you can't miss it in this one. The average conversation bounces back between two characters, one with a thirty degree tilt to the left and the other with a thirty degree tilt to the right. Simple but effective. And you can't miss that ubiquitous zither music. Annoying: yes. To be sure. But, the fact that it doesn't really seem to ever fit the images gives "The Third Man" a surreal, exotic feel. Nevertheless, I still think they could've gotten the feel and spared us a few of those annoying, manic tunes. Finally, Orson Welles, of course, is great. His two most memorable scenes are the one with the kitten in the doorway and the ferris wheel scene. In his first shot, Orson's cherubic, mischievous visage lets us know immediately the plot is getting thicker than a Sequoia. On the ferris wheel, Orson perfectly embodies that villainous archetype: the Rotten Bad Guy with the Great Lines. Here he voices an idea that (while interesting, has been taken way too seriously): "Nobody thinks in terms of human beings. Governments don't. Why should we?" And Cotton's response (through the rest of the movie): "Well, I don't really know but I will anyway." This is the response (never actually verbalized) that motivates every anti-hero hero from Sam Marlowe to Detective William Somerset (Morgan Freeman's character in Se7en). Good answer! </fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Third Man is always regarded as on the greatest films to ever come out of the genre of noir. It is also regarded as one of the greatest British films of all time, but sadly I failed to find anything fascinating in this film.From a technical standpoint the film is well made. The outdoor locations of Vienna are picturesque and well shot and the cinematography is flawless. The use of lighting in the climax is also amazing. But that's about it as far as the positives go for me. The storyline is set at the backdrop of Vienna, a city tortured by the perils of the WWII and it also deals with the context of the inevitable rise of corruption in a broken economy and a suffering society where corrupt people employ devious means to earn big by making use of the common person's deficiencies and in doing so climb to the top of the food chain. But unfortunately the director didn't go deep into the aforementioned themes and the story itself felt so flat and none of the characters seemed interesting and deep. I sat through the the initial scenes with the hope that things will get better, but they never did. A noir film at the basic level has to keep you engrossed,but this film didn't keep me so and the big reveal wasn't shocking at all.Orson Welles is good in it, but the acting as a whole in the film is just acceptable with nothing in particular worth a special mention. So in a nutshell, The Third Man is a technically well made film with great cinematography, but every other aspect of the film is mediocre at best. Maybe it is the raised expectations due to its critical acclaim that let me down in the end.</fullReview>

His first quick shot is really stunningly surprising, and one of the unforgettable part of the film. In that revelation, he didn't say anything, that's the magic of it. You can only see gestures in his face, and it's a terrific acting, without a single word. The unforgettable zither score of Anton Karas did not win an Oscar nor even a nomination, but Robert Krasker's skill in photography did. Krasker's light and shadow technique is a masterpiece, you can feel the wetness of the ground, and it is perfect in a black-and-white motion picture.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't watched this for 30 years. It is the consummate example of using light and darkness to produce effect. It involves the death of one Harry Live (Orson Welles) and the attempt by a friend to juggle his loyalties with his moral duty to try to fathom the circumstances. This is a film about mood and face. It's a bit expressionistic and off kilter. The one most important thing is that it fires on all cylinders. Joseph Cotten is magnificent as the man who steps into more than he knows. He meets a woman who despite LIme's evildoing can't stop loving him. As soon as we expect something to happen, there is a twist. When we expect characters to change they don't. There is a whole series of vignettes that are priceless. One of my favorites is when Cotten, a hack writer of Westerns, is forced to lecture on his literary techniques to a crowd of intellectuals who are asking him questions about James Joyce and others. He is in fear for his life at the time and the whole thing becomes a surreal event. Post war Vienna, Austria, is also a character in this film because it is actually four cities, divided, each with its own idiosyncrasies. This is one of the best films in history and does not disappoint.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For those who think this is a great movie, could you please answer some of these questions:I know this is going to cause even more people to think I'm a Neanderthal or just to despise me for my lack of taste and refinement but I can't help it.So based on a posting by Andrew Stuttaford ? whose writings I greatly admire -- I rented 'The Third Man.'Yes, it's cinematic ally beautiful. And yes, it evokes the mysterious and intriguing atmosphere of post-war Vienna. And yes, I liked the zither music ? though it seemed more reminiscent of the Mediterranean than of Vienna.But at the end of the day (or the end of the movie): Shouldn't Graham Greene have been horse-whipped? The plot is about as coherent as a John Kerry position paper.For example, it makes no sense that Anna and Holly would have such affection for Harry Lime, and that it then turns out that yes, Major Calloway is right: Harry Lime is indeed a baby killer who steals penicillin and then waters it down so that it turns from medicine to poison.(Anna keeps saying to the Major: 'You've got it all upside down.' And I kept trying to see how to turn it right, how to solve the mystery. But there is no mystery. The surprise is there is no surprise.)What kind of scheme did Harry cook up? If you're going to sell bogus penicillin why bother stealing real penicillin? And how many kids have to get sick before the hospital staff figures it out?Also: Why would Harry have a job for Holly, a writer of Western fiction, in his penicillin-stealing-and-watering-down-and-selling-it-to-hospitals-to-give-to-kids scheme? What use could he have been to Harry? He didn't even speak German.And why would Harry bring him over to Vienna just when he was planning to fake his own death?And why would Harry think Holly would be so depraved as to help him kill kids for cash anyway?And since that scheme was finally blown, how is Harry making a buck now?Shouldn't Anna be at least a tad shocked when she finds out what her lover was doing? Shouldn't she have an opinion on it?And shouldn't she be upset that he staged his death, didn't tell her, and ditched her instead? Wouldn't that at least be something she'd discuss with Holly?When Holly first sees Harry in the doorway, why does Harry run? What was he doing in that doorway anyhow? Who was he waiting for if not Holly or Anna?The cat? Why does the cat love Harry? Seriously, in films animals love people because they sense those people have a good heart. Harry doesn't have a good heart. He's a heartless murderer who would sell a cat to an all-you-can-eat restaurant.If Harry doesn't want to see Holly ? he runs away after being spotted in the doorway --why does he change his mind the next day and meet with him?Whatever else Harry may be, he's a smart cookie. Surely he knows he hasn't sold Holly on the logic of killing kids for cash based on his soliloquy on the Ferris wheel, when he explains the Camus-lite view of the world that he's now adopted. Surely, he knows that Holly doesn't agree that children are just black dots lacking any meaning and value, so killing them is no biggie. So why does Harry go to meet with Holly again? What would be the upside? And how could he not see the downside risk?Was Harry the third man who helped carry the dead body ? which I suppose was really Harbin ? across the street?Did no one see the body before it was put into the coffin?At the start of the movie, we hear from a narrator ? a cynical Brit in some way involved in the black market. He seems like an interesting character. Who is he? Why do we never hear from him again?At the end of the film I had four words running through my mind: Honey, get me rewrite!But if someone can answer the questions above, I'll be very grateful. And I'll rent it a second ? even a third ? time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Greatest Film of All Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It took me several years and a lot of thought, but as someone who enjoys movies, I selected "The Third Man" as the greatest film ever made. I have a list of similar favorite films, and it is hard to rank them in order of preference (it often depends on my mood, so many are equally great).Here are a few reasons:1) "The Third Man" is the most outstanding reason for why I love to go to the movies. It welds images, sounds, dialogue and music into my memory, my personality, and my soul. When I think of why I love the cinema, I think of this film as an example.2) Joseph Cotten. The man has a screen presence wrought not from the elements which make other "Great" actors like Laurence Olivier, Humphrey Bogart or Jimmy Stewart, but from his own normalcy. He is Joseph Cotten, a nice guy, someone you'd like to have speak for you at a college admissions board or at a traffic court. He's the kind of guy you hope your new girlfriend's dad is like. He's not just "nice", either, in a Cary Grant way. We actually like the guy. And it is this niceness which hurts us most when we see what he must do.3) Alida Valli. She was in the 1977 hidden treasure "Suspiria", but otherwise dropped from view after this film, in which she blasted through a handicap (that accent) with the most affecting female performances of all time--we love her and hate her, because she's the unrequited love to end all unrequited loves.4) Orson Welles. He's such a convincing bad guy, but he's the coolest. In the pantheon of directors, he was sometimes overlooked as an actor, but here he tops them all. He almost has us taken by his scheme, and we doubt the movie (and Major Calloway) will be able to counter him. It does, nearly, and he becomes both the despicable rat villain and the glorious rebel martyr at the same time.5) The zither score.6) The final shot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Easily the best Euro-Noir...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>... and perhaps the best noir of all time.I am reviewing the criterion collection version of this classic film - which is available via Netflix. I strongly recommend avoiding other versions - the transfers do not do this beautiful film and its unique soundtrack justice.Carol Reed's the Third Man follows desperate pulp writer Holly Martins (Joseph Cotten) through the streets of post-war Vienna as he attempts to discern the truth about the death of his boyhood friend and would-be benefactor Harry Lime (Orson Welles). Lime was killed by a truck driven by his own driver on the very day that Martins arrived in Vienna to begin work with Lime on a prosperous business venture. The main witnesses were two shady Austrians and a mysterious third man who nobody seems able to identify.As Martins digs deeper, he begins to understand the deep corruption of his new-found home through an adversarial acquaintance with a British military policeman (Trevor Howard) and slowly falls for Harry's similarly mysterious former lover, Anna Schmidt (Valli).Cotten makes a rather unsympathetic character (Martins is a classic noir loser) sympathetic. In a role that is barely a cameo, Welles creates an unforgettable persona. Valli is remarkable. And Howard and the rest of the supporting cast are great. Despite the excellent cast, however, what makes The Third Man the great film that it is the combination of absolutely perfect noir cinematography, an entirely believable and compelling story set in exactly the right location, and tight, powerful, directing. And the unusual zither-dominated soundtrack helps to make the film unique even among noirs.Like many of Kurosawa's best efforts, every scene of The Third Man is wonderfully framed and painted in stark contrasts, making the camera as much of a performer as any member of the cast. It's BAFTA award (best British film), Cannes Palm d'Or(Grand Prize), and Oscar (cinematography) are minor achievements in comparison to the film's lasting impact on its genre and on cinematography in general.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen the Third Man more times than I care to remember, both on small and large screen and it still appears fresh - it is really hard to see how the film could have been very much better made. The casting is perfect, even the hype surrounding Wells, and the way he is kept in the background for half the movie, and the cinematography is amongst the best you will see. And look out for the strong supporting roles (Trevor Howard's cynical army officer through to Wilfred Hyde White's slightly dotty cultural liaison officer). In conjunction with the fortuitous use of Anton Karas' zither score, this is a movie you will want to come back to time and time again. Enjoy.PS there is a very good BBC documentary on the making of the film - well worth catching if you can!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Masterpiece in It's Own Right</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not going to rehash what has been said in other comments other than that Orson Welles and Joseph Cotten were at their best. Rather, an aside or two about the film. At the time Welles was trying to make his own films and took the Harry Lime role only for the money. Anton Karras, the zither player, was found in a dingy, cellar cafe in Vienna. Becoming well known for the background music and then his "Third Man Theme" record which was a tremendous hit worldwide, he was talked into opening a nightclub in London. Even though the nightclub was successful, Karas yearned for his former life and packed it in, going back underground to the cellar cafe in Vienna to play his zither. In one scene in the film Cotten has finished a talk on American writers. He runs up the hotel stairs pursued by two assassins and enters an empty hotel room. He exits a window, but not before being bitten on a finger by a parrot. I suspect that this "nip" was not in the script, but it resulted in the only amusing scene in the entire film. When asked by military policeman Trevor Howard why his finger was bandaged, Cotten replies "A parrot bit me", invoking an exasperated reply from Howard. I believe this to be the only funny scene in the film and it was over very quickly. Interestingly there was no novel or play that the film was based on. Graham Green was asked to do a screenplay for a film idea, which he did. Who knows? If this was done more often as opposed to films based on books or plays we might have a better variety of films for our viewing these days.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Old Switcheroo</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.Ostensibly a story about one body switched for another, this is also concerned with Reed switching places with Welles. Orson had already changed the world forever by introducing a new language of imagination. Some rushed to catch up. Here is a case in point. Where Welles introduced extreme narrative folding, Greene worked with a watered down notion: human (usually romantic) foibles against the metaphor of national trauma and in its context. Where Welles contrived architectural placements of the camera, Reed gives us a rather unsophisticated tilt. Where Welles gave us systemic decomposition, this project keeps all the decomposing in the set.But what a set! And of course the final homage is to cast Welles himself as the manipulator of the story. Its a simple grind overall, but built around an obsessive ennui of Anna. Doesn't work for me because there's no way for us to enter the world that she inhabits: we are just given some thin solipsisms on self-directed fate and left to our own devices. May have worked on a war-ravaged audience full of freshly manufactured media notions, but not now in an age of irony.Even in its era, this is no substitute for the real thing: Reed is no Welles, Alida no Ingrid, Krasker no Toland and Greene never was able to get his formula right for film.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 4: Has some interesting elements.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Photography? Check. Music? Check. Plot and character? Hold your horses.I'm quite surprised at the overwhelmingly thoroughly positive reviews, which led me to this film. In a way, I guess I should be thankful for having the opportunity to enjoy a work that clearly remains a masterful production. However, weaknesses in the writing seriously undermined my enjoyment of the experience. From the moment Holly Martins gave away the identity of a witness, leading very unsurprisingly to the murder of the porter, I knew the script would be either naive or just dumb. To name another flaw, the romance (or more accurately, romantic feelings) between the two leads were matter-of-factly and serves the plot rather than being realistic. Sure, the movie was from a very different era, but I've seen other classic films, and I don't think people were that dumb. Overall, the techniques were quite wonderful and yes, extraordinary, but the script was underwhelming, to say the very least.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really not that special</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After a promising start, "The Third Man" quickly degenerates into a slow, boring and predictable mood piece. While the photography of post-WW2 Vienna was absolutely beautiful and the atmosphere very well done, this movie really couldn't keep my attention past the first half.Which is a shame, since it looked like it could have been great. The begin of the plot is intriguing, with lots of unanswered questions and lots of characters that all have a hidden agenda. I was really expecting some kind of "Usual Suspects" or "L.A. Confidential" - story with lots of depth and twists etc. Unfortunately, the "mystery" gets solved about halfway through the movie, and it turns out that it wasn't much of a mystery at all. After that, it's just a long and boring search for the one responsible, and a romance that never gets of.Ultimately, this movie is interesting because of the camera work and the atmosphere, but in terms of story it's a huge disappointment. Oh, and the music is absolutely terrible.** out of **** stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Technical Points Make It A Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't help believing THE THIRD MAN is a film highly regarded because of its technical achievements rather than by its story . The plot itself is rather simplistic : American writer Holly Martins gets a message from his friend Harry Lime offering him a job in Vienna and when he arrives in the city he discovers Harry is dead . There's a mystery involved in how Harry died but because everyone is so familiar with the plot twists ( This film was made nearly 20 years before I was born ) there's no real surprises as to the story The film ( Can we describe it as " film noir " ? ) succeeds because of its breath taking technical achievements . from the opening shot we're shown a montage of shots of post war Vienna , some real life film footage , some specifically shot for the movie with a voice over that is breath takingly conversational . When ever a film opens with a voice over it's always done by some dour American but here it's said by some cheerful English chappie . This alone sticks out in the mind and clearly states that it's a !!!!! British !!!! film . I don't mean a " British made film " financed with American money , I mean a film that was made by a British studio . Of course Carol Reed has an eye for an American market hence his casting of Orson Welles as Harry Lime and it's Welles casting that helps make THE THIRD MAN the screen legend that it is . He has very few lines but Welles speech about the cuckoo clock was ad libbed by the actor and is one of the most memorable lines in cinema . But for me the stand out aspect of the movie is the Oscar winning cinematography by Robert Krasker , it's impossible to think of this movie without thinking of shadows against walls There are a couple of flaws though . Considering Austria is in such a bad state after losing the war a couple of years previously I couldn't help noticing that scotch is freely available ! I know the black market is booming ( That's part of the plot ) but even so th way people reach for a bottle and pour themselves a stiff drink seems very unlikely , I mean how many people do you know that drink that amount of booze ? and we're in a period of time where strong liqueur is very easy to acquire . Can I just repeat that because the over familiarity of the story the plot holds no surprises ? Perhaps I' , the first person to point this out by saying I don't like the score . Anton Karras plays the zither and after a few scenes I found myself being irritated by it</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Astounding Visuals Make It A Treasure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Story - pretty good.Cinematographry - amazing! If you want to enjoy the camera-work, please see this on the Criterion DVD. That's not a plug for the company. It's just that no one else has ever offered a cleaner version of this film. After suffering for years with lousy VHS transfers of this gem, it was nice to see it given justice.To me, the visuals here make this DVD worth owning because the story is okay, but nothing super. To an average first-time viewer, the first hour of this film can drag. I found that to be the case on my first viewing, but the more I watch this, the better the story seems to have gotten for some reason. Despite his billing, Orson Welles has a small role in here. He doesn't even appear until after 65 of the film's 104 minutes have elapsed. Meanwhile, Joseph Cotten dominates the story, along with Alida Valli, sort of a poor man's Ingrid Bergman. Those two are okay but the story picks up dramatically after Wells finally appears. In addition to the fabulous cinematography, an unique feature of this movie is the music, which is very strange for a film noir. It's lighthearted music from a zither, almost circus-like in its sound and melody....but I liked it. It helps make this movie different.The visuals involve a lot of nighttime photography, lots of shadows and cobblestone streets. The tilted camera angles and the closeups - all traits of Wells the director, are here to enjoy</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Zither Thou Goest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Third Man refers to another witness to a crime that no one seems to know anything about. The crime of course is the hit and run murder of Harry Lime played by Orson Welles. But is Welles dead.One of the things I like about The Third Man is that it makes a nominal hero out of one of the biggest bunglers ever put on screen. Let's just say that if Holly Martins played by Joseph Cotten were bumping into furniture on top of everything else, he'd be Inspector Clouseau.Holly arrives in occupied Vienna in the late Forties at the invitation of an old college classmate Harry Lime. Literally upon arriving in Vienna, Martins learns that his friend Lime was the victim of a hit and run accident and the funeral is going on at that moment. He goes to the funeral and is smitten by Lime's girlfriend, Alida Valli.Martins is a writer of western stories and it's bad when a writer starts believing he's one of his own heroes. Maybe Jessica Fletcher is capable of it, but not Holly Martins. Martins decides to start his own investigation into Lime's death much to the consternation of the British occupying force which doing its own inquiry. Trevor Howard plays Major Callaway of the British Army in charge of the investigation.Martins turns out to be right that there is something more afoot than a simple traffic accident. But he's so terribly wrong about everything and everyone else it is frightening. I really can't say more at this point.Someone reading the plot description I've given might think The Third Man is some kind of comedy, but it is not. It is in fact one of the most finely crafted dramas ever put on the screen. The location photography in Vienna is fabulous and contributes so much to the authenticity of the story and its characters. Joseph Cotten gives one of his best performances as the bull-in-the-china-shop amateur detective.As for Orson Welles, it's a virtual tie in my opinion with Compulsion for the distinction of his finest performer as an actor without working for director Orson Welles. Harry Lime turns out to be the harbinger of a cynical age we were entering.And if nothing else grabs you about The Third Man, that theme on the zither will stay with you forever. Definitely one of the ten best known movie scores ever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Third Man" may be the greatest film made in Britain since World War II?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Third Man" is a flawless film of intrigue and suspense, a summit of perfection within the genre? It is one of the most literate thrillers ever made? It is superb1y acted by an ensemble working in an understated, effortless style? Its cinematography includes some of the best black-and-white work ever done? Its score of haunting zither music is still remembered, instantly familiar to anyone who ever saw the film, and now thorough1y identified with most people's impressions of Vienna? Finally, the direction by Carol Reed is exemplary? Rarely has a motion picture represented the collaboration of so many exceptional talents... "The Third Man" may be the greatest film made in Britain since World War II? The night city terrain of "The Third Man" is unique: occupied postwar Vienna, baroque, bombed-out, decadent, patrolled by Jeeps containing representatives of the four occupying powers, an American, an Englishman, a Frenchman, and a Russian?Corrupt, world-weary people hang about its fringes: the overly suave Rumanian, Popescu; the frayed violinist, Baron Kurtz; the atheistic collector of Catholic antiquities, Dr. Winkel; Crabbit, the tired head of the Anglo Cultural Center; and Anna Schmidt, the Czechoslovakian girl friend of Harry Lime, an obscure actress with forged papers? Moving among them are three extraordinary principals, Holly Martins, a typical Greene creation; a hack American writer; a used- up second-rater; Colonel Calloway, a Scotland Yard type, chief of British Military Police; and Harry Lime (WeIles), the corrupt two-bit racketeer, a fully immoral, totally unreachable villain? These characters wander through rain-slick night streets, in and out of shabby cafés, over the rubble of bombed-out buildings, even into a terrain vague dominated by a huge Ferris wheel?The Vienna of "The Third Man" is a vast city that seems empty? Its streets are always damp, and water rushes through a system of sweet-smelling sewers underneath? It is a world of slinking cats and biting parrots, of people taking advantage of each other without pity? "The Third Man" meets the test of complexity? The characters interact, their stories conflict: A man who is supposed to be dead turns up alive, there is a question of whether two men or a "third man" carried off Lime's "body," there are conspiracies, deceits, and double crosses? Reed owes debts to Fritz Long for some of his ideas: the geometrical shots, the montage of evidence, Welles' whistling, etc., but Reed has his own original visual style, particularly his use of a slightly tilted camera to produce so-called "Chinese angles," employed to project danger, foreboding, a twisted universe? He is also capable of providing suspense in the tradition of Hitchcock? "The Third Man" is unique in the genre for its realism? Despite the complexities of plot, the characters are understandable, dimensional, emotionally genuine?a tribute to the fine ensemble playing and special, low-keyed acting style that is the cinematic equivalent of Graham Greene's writing?Carol Reed was knighted for his excellence as a British filmmaker, and for a body of work that is notable for its good taste? It is this taste, of course, that works so well in "The Third Man," but which has destroyed some of his other films, such as "Our Man in Havana," which require a certain amount of excess to make them work?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film starts off with a witty narrative -- set to the 'city sights' of Vienna -- that is smile inducing, and excellent at capturing the life of occupied citizenry within the separated city, but moves rather unhurriedly shortly thereafter. Such a slow pace can turn off viewers, but the film brings interest back near the end, culminating in a loopy sewer chase.I didn't like Joseph Cotten's character during the bulk of the film. I thought the acting was...stiff, especially for such a highly touted film, so much so I had wished for one of the officers to pull out his pistol and put a 9MM in his neck. Orson was great though. He plays a scumbag perfectly. His pallid skin and black eyes fits well within the seedy underworld of Vienna. The music is sh1t; it fits the start of the film, but drags down the overall feeling and diminishes the final score. The shots are great though. It's bleak ending saves the film. Women are fickle; they will leave you naked at a Best Western. Don't try to save them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderful film which explores friendship, love and betrayal against the backdrop of postwar Vienna</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Considered the best British film of the 20th Century by the British Film Institute, this is a wonderful film which explores friendship, love and betrayal against the backdrop of the impoverished and occupied postwar Vienna. It has a fantastic script by Graham Greene, who probably understood the world of the film better than most people due to his service in MI6 during the Second World War. Greene portrays the darker, seedier side of Vienna, which serves as a microcosm for the postwar world as a whole, by focusing on the cynicism, paranoia and intrigue that the war engendered and the Cold War would exacerbate. Carol Reed's direction is excellent and his continued use of distorted camera angles emphasises the perverted morality on display. The beautiful cinematography by Robert Krasker greatly contributes to the film's atmosphere, as does the unusual zither score by Anton Karas. There has been much speculation that Orson Welles directed some or even most of the film - there is no evidence to support this but he did write some of his dialogue - and it is easy to see why as its look was certainly influenced by his films in certain respects, particularly the cinematography. The fact that the film was shot in Vienna and featured German-speaking actors adds a great deal of authenticity.The film stars Welles' frequent collaborator and close friend Joseph Cotten in one of his best performances as Holly Martins, a not terribly successful author of Western pulp novels of dubious literary merit. He arrives in Vienna to stay with his childhood friend Harry Lime, whom he has not seen since September 1939 which gains more relevance as the film continues. Holly soon learns that Harry was killed in a traffic accident several days earlier and, on further investigation, suspects that he may have been murdered as there are numerous inconsistencies in the stories of the witnesses, all of whom were rather conveniently friends of Harry. The biggest inconsistency is the porter Karl's claim that Harry's body was carried from the scene by three men instead of two and Holly sets out to learn the identity of the third man. Although Holly is the protagonist, he is not the most interesting character in the film but he was not supposed to be. In comparison to the other characters, Holly is naive and trusting. He sees the world in purely black and white terms, something which is emphasised by his writing material in which the bad guys are always easily identifiable by their black hats. As he was not in Austria during the terrible days of the war, he does not understand the impact that it had and continues to have on the country. Holly represents the postwar idealism which is very effectively juxtaposed with the cynicism of the other characters, many of whom are as damaged as Vienna itself.Although Orson Welles receives second billing, the very much alive Harry Lime does not appear until more than an hour into the film and has approximately five minutes screen time. In spite of this, he manages to steal the show with his excellent performance. Harry's introduction is very effective as, aside from Welles, highly memorable cheeky expression, the film has already built up a mythos around him. He is not merely a walk-on bad guy but a fully fleshed character in spite of his limited screen time. One of the great screen villains, Harry is a fascinating, ruthless and downright despicable man who sold diluted penicillin on the black market, resulting in the deaths of many patients and the incapacitation of many others. In the film's best scene, on Vienna's famous giant Ferris wheel Wiener Riesenrad, Harry asks Holly if he or anyone else would truly care if one of the people, one of the dots, on the ground stopped moving. This is followed by the iconic cuckoo clock speech, delivered by Welles in a tone of wry amusement. Interestingly, in both this film and "Citizen Kane", Cotten's character is a decent man whose primary function is to serve as a contrast to Welles' far less decent character, though Charles Foster Kane is an angel compared to Harry Lime.The third major character in the film is Harry's lover Anna Schmidt, played wonderfully by Alida Valli. A Czechoslovakian who fears being deported to her Soviet-dominated country, she obtained a forged passport stating that she was an Austrian national from Harry. Anna is completely devoted to Harry and there is nothing that anyone can say or do to change that. The film does not explore her past in any great detail but it is heavily implied that Harry does not love her in return. As such, I imagine that she had to do certain things of which she is not particularly proud in order to obtain the passport. However, I can't and won't judge her for that as she was forced to do what she did to survive. Holly is infatuated with Anna but she seems at best tolerant of him, at least until towards the end of the film. Throughout the film, characters - Holly in particular - have a tendency to get names wrong and I think that this was designed to show that he never really knew either Harry (in spite of 20 years of friendship) or Anna. In addition to those three actors, the film has a very strong supporting strong cast with an appropriately international flavour such as Trevor Howard as Major Calloway, Bernard Lee as Sgt. Paine, Wilfrid Hyde-White as Crabbin, Ernst Deutsch as the eccentric "Baron" Kurtz, Erich Ponto as Dr. Winkel, Siegfried Breuer as Popescu and Paul Hörbiger as Karl.Overall, this is an absolutely brilliant film which nicely subverts the optimism of Hollywood films of the era by highlighting the painful reality of life in postwar Europe.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Third Man" is a masterpiece by British director Carol Reed filmed from a screenplay by famous writer Graham Greene. This is one of the best European film noir, with its distinctive atmosphere of postwar moral chaos and hopelessness, and an unhappy romantic love story that describes the crime and moral decay of the world in which the protagonists are trying to survive.After the end of the second world war-torn Vienna is divided into four zones, each governed by one of the military police of the winning countries - US, Soviet, British and French. Holly Martins (J. Cotten), American writer, comes to Vienna as he was invited by his friend Harry Lime (O. Welles), offering him some work. Holly came to the house where Harry lived in a rented apartment and finds out that Harry was killed the day before - run over by a car in front of the same house. Shocked, Holly finds himself at Harry's funeral and meets two British military officers, Major Calloway (T. Howard) and Sergeant Paine (B. Lee). Calloway is interested in late Harry Lime, and he examines Holly, advising him at the end to leave Vienna because of the danger. Holly meets two of Harry's friends, Baron Kurtz (E. Deutsch) and Popescu (S. Breuer), who allegedly witnessed Harry's death. Exploring the unfortunate circumstances of Harry's death, Holly is puzzled by many contradictions, Holly begins to suspect that something is wrong ... The character of criminal Harry Lime is one of the most charismatic in the history of film, and Orson Welles plays it with a lot of charm and humor. Particularly notable in the film music of Anton Karas zither on a theme Harry Lime is one of the most famous evergreens in history of film music. Reed's film won the 1949 Palme d'Or at Cannes, and the Oscar for best picture.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie starts REALLY slow. I mean you have to watch half of the movie before anything happens. It's worth the wait. Unfortunately I don't have much to add that hasn't been said before, the plot, the writing, the actors, the staging, the lighting, the cinematography, the music, everything is a work of art. Every detail is perfect too. Many are unrepeatable. We will never see bombed out Vienna again, and certainly not like Carol Reed showed it. Then there is Holly Martins, the pulp fiction writer in a pulp fiction noir movie written by Graham Greene. And it goes on and on, but I've reached my ten lines. They don't make the like they used to...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best British film of all time, a unique masterpiece.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I never knew the old Vienna before the war, with its Strauss music, its glamour and easy charm. I really got to know it in the classic period of the black market."And with that brilliant opening voice over narration we are introduced to this landmark film, which in my opinion outdoes the Germans in its Expressionism. I've fallen in love with Carol Reed's masterpiece, The Third Man, which takes elements from classic film noir and German expressionism creating a timeless classic. To say this is the best British film of all time is an understatement, because it deserves to be considered amongst the very best the world has offered. Everything about this film is perfection, from the opening setting of the plot, to the iconic zither score by Anton Karas that accompanies it (which not in a million years I would've consider to fit this thriller, but it does), to the memorable Ferris wheel scene where Orson Welles delivers his famous "cuckoo clock" speech, to Orson Welles's spectacular entrance scene (the best in film history), to the spectacular chase scene through the sewers of Vienna, to the uncountable amount of Dutch angle shots that help build the tense atmosphere accompanied by an unprecedented visual aesthetic from cinematographer Robert Krasker who turns the evocative shadows into a character in this film, to Graham Greene's fantastic screenplay delivering on every twist, to the final long shot that ends the film in a magnificent and memorable way only adding to the romantic fatalism theme of the story. Every single decision made during the production of this film, even those they came across by chance, seems to have worked to perfection. This is not a case where you can say it's style over substance or vice versa, it's one of those rare films where style and substance come together to deliver a perfect visual aesthetic and an intriguing theme with memorable character. The opening narration introduces us to postwar Vienna, a city of bombed buildings and piles of rubble that has been divided into four occupied zones by the victorious allies (British, American, Russian and French). It is a place where opportunists and racketeers have come to make a living in its widespread black market. This is where Holly Martins (Joseph Cotten), an American pulp novelist, enters the scene. He is broke, but has been invited by Harry Lime, a good old friend from his school days, to stay with him in Vienna. Upon his arrival, Holly discovers that Harry has been killed in a traffic accident. Being the mystery novelist that he is, Holly begins to talk to some of Harry's friends who witnessed his accident and discovers some inconsistencies in their stories. He reports these suspicions to Maj. Calloway (Trevor Howard), the man in charge of the investigation, but he quickly dismisses him and says he should return home. The Major believes it is best that Harry has died since he was a racketeer who caused many innocent deaths. Holly however becomes intrigued with the case after the porter of Harry's building (Paul Horbiger) tells him there was a third man involved in the scene, but who no one else accounts for. Holly also befriends and falls for Anna (Alida Valli), Harry's lover who had immigrated from Czechoslovakia, which gives him another reason to stay for a few more days to try to uncover the mystery of his friend's untimely death. The film is so visually stunning (it's only Oscar win was for best cinematography) that at times people forget to mention how great Graham Greene's script actually is. He understood this post-war European world and how the black market worked because he himself was a former British spy. That is what makes the story so believable and gives the film its substance. Of course the style is what turns this into a landmark film with its clever shots playing with Dutch angles, lights, smokes, and shadows, its wonderful editing, and its amazing score, but the film has a great plot to go along with it as well as some solid performances. Joseph Cotten delivers a solid role as the lead hero who comes into this world as a naive child believing everything is black and white. He is flawed, he is a drunk who falls in love way too easy. Harry's friends all have faces who at least look very suspicious (Siegfried Breuer as Popescu and Erich Ponto as Dr. Winkel). And then there is Orson Welles himself who with less than 15 minutes of screen time steals the movie. He could've done so with his iconic entrance alone (delivering a perfect smile), which was gorgeously lighted, but he also delivers one of the most memorable quotes of the film as well. Alida Valli also delivers as the femme in this film and it all leads to an exciting finale. For all these reasons and many more which I've failed to put into words, I can affirm that The Third Man is a masterpiece. Let me end this review by citing Orson Welles's memorable speech:"Don't be so gloomy. After all it's not that awful. Like the fella says, in Italy for 30 years under the Borgias they had warfare, terror, murder, and bloodshed, but they produced Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, and the Renaissance. In Switzerland they had brotherly love - they had 500 years of democracy and peace, and what did that produce? The cuckoo clock. So long Holly."http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Director Carol Reed's "The Third Man" is a perfect film with a great story and some fine performances by its cast.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By making 'The Third Man', director Carol Reed has created an intelligent film wherein suspense is maintained until the very end. It is for this reason that acclaimed writer Graham Greene gave full freedom to his creative imagination by creating a character who belonged to the world of literature. It is the writer who emerges as the ultimate hero of the film by sacrificing his friendship for the greater glory of humanity. British film 'The Third Man' revived the sordid atmosphere of wartime Vienna where the growth of black market gave rise to various criminal activities. It was a time which witnessed an absolute dearth of ethical practices in business as black marketers chose to earn huge sums of money by using unfair means. This resulted in the death of many innocent people especially young children. Most leading actors of the post war period have left their mark on the film namely Orson Welles, Alida Valli, Trevor Howard and Joseph Cotton.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With Graham Greene writing the original story and then the screenplay too, well, that's a really good start. Add in superb acting especially by the support cast and we know we are in for a really good film.Set in Vienna just after the war, Holly Martins comes to town to meet up with an old school buddy, Harry Limes, but finds there has been a traffic accident and Limes is dead. But... the witness accounts seem to suggest that something is amiss, so Martins starts investigating.Vienna is governed in sectors by different military forces. The British sector has Major Calloway, (Trevor Howard) who is just great. Realistic pauses, meaningful glances. A quite young Orson Welles is a bit pedestrian, but good enough. Of course there are twists and turns and a dramatic ending.Alida Valli as Limes's girlfriend is great too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are four names billed above the title: First comes Joseph Cotton and there's nothing wrong with that because as Holley Martens he is in virtually every scene. Next comes Alida Valli and again there is no quarrel because she equates to the 'love interest', being in love with the central character and herself the object of Martens' love. Fourth billing goes to Trevor Howard who, as Major Calloway, appears in almost as many scenes as Cotton and certainly as many as Valli. But it is the third billed name that gives us pause, for this is the name of Orson Welles, who has ten minutes tops screen time yet runs away with it. Since the day it was released right up to today more than half a century later whenever we think of or someone mentions 'The Third Man' the image that forms immediately in our minds is that of Welles, smiling inscrutably yet somehow mockingly as the light hits him in the doorway; making his amoral speech on the Ferris Wheel and then signing off with the 'cuckoo clock' speech (written by himself); and finally clawing at the sewer grating. Bernard Lee as Sergeant Paine has roughly three times the screen time, Paul Horbiger as the Porter, Ernst Deutsch as 'Baron' Kurtz (did Welles contribute the name? One of his most cherished projects was 'Heart Of Darkness'), and Siegfried Breur as Popescu all have roles more prominent than Harry Lime yet Welles/Lime and The Third Man are synonymous. Why should this be so. Is it the part or is it Welles. It has to be the latter. Graham Greene was no slouch as a writer but he wasn't that good. Try to imagine someone ELSE as Lime and it's impossible. Who else COULD have played it, or, to put it another way, what was the talent pool like in 1950. Certainly there were no English actors with the possible exception of James Mason who could be considered. There was Widmark at Fox, who did, in fact, star in the English-made 'Night And The City' but that's about it. Welles was, of course, a master filmmaker himself and he came to this, his 10th acting role in films, with Kane, Ambersons, The Stranger, Lady From Shanghai, lacing his multi-stringed directorial bow so it's just possible that Reed's Expressionistic angles and lighting owe more than a little to Welles who was by far the most EUROPEAN of all the Hollywood Directors. Whatever the film still holds up or, more accurately, it is still HELD up by Welles, who shoulders it like Atlas. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Orson Welles is excellent as Harry Lime, a man who invites his friend Holly Martins to visit him in Vienna from his home in the United States. When Holly arrives, he learns that Harry has been killed in a car accident. When he tries to find out more about the accident that killed his friend, Holly encounters surprisingly strong opposition. The Third Man is put together amazingly well and contains some truly amazing cinematography, including several scenes on the war-torn streets of Vienna. Maybe the most unusual quality of this film is the fact that it is pulled along mostly by the quality of the story, rather than star actors or special effects (which were, of course, much less common in 1949 than they are today). The story is so complex and well-told that it almost overshadows even such stars (in true "star roles") as Orson Welles and Joseph Cotten. The Third Man is a classic post-war film. It is amazingly well done, and should not be missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Any Friend of Harry's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Third Man", in its 50th Anniversary Restored Version, is the perfect antithesis to another masterpiece, "Casablanca". Both take place in wartime, but the Vienna of "The Third Man" is a cynical and no-nonsense world of post-war recovery. "Casablanca" gives us romantic hope, "The Third Man" gives earthly despair. But everything from the black and white frames to the blatantly melodious music to the brilliant cast (Joseph Cotten, Trevor Howard, Alida Valli, and Orson Welles) and direction suggest that portraying the hard knocks of reality may be comforting too. "The Third Man" is foremost a film about catching a scoundrel but the telling of this tale is far more interesting from the imaginative cinematography of shadows and slants and quick takes of ordinary people to the playfulness of this quirky story by novelist Graham Greene. How can you throw in odd pieces like a parrot, a finicky cat, and a little boy who just wants someone to play ball with him and make it an integral part of a film? How can mispronounced or misnamed characters bring out laughter at the most inappropriate times? How ever in the world can such lines like ?any friend of Harry's is a friend of mine', ?you ought to find a girl of your own', ?all the Swiss have to show for their 500 years of democracy is a cuckoo clock?', and ?be sensible Martins ? I haven't got a sensible name' have such powerful suggestions. In the hands of a master like Carol Reed, "The Third Man" is a film without redundancy and without unnecessary action nor dialogue. It is slim and it is trim. As an example, the mysterious Harry Lime doesn't show up until the last half of the film but his subsequent appearances are so anticipated and his character so dominating you feel you have experienced him much more. "Casablanca" gave us the famous last scene at the airport and "The Third Man" is equal to that with the haunting walk from the cemetery. It is a pleasure to see "The Third Man" and to see how far films have to go to match this film's superior cast and direction.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A Noir for the ages, featuring an icy-cold yet pulverizing woman, tons of atmospheric shadow, a desperate subterranean climax, some wonderfully cynical leads, and to top everything off, the most enjoyably unique score in the whole film history. In eight years, the newly formed genre reached its peak with this mystery concerning an American visitor to Vienna, in search of a criminally linked friend. "The Third Man" was one of the last English speaking pictures that were of any major significance abroad for some 20 years. European Cinema, revitalized after the war, would always be intellectually superior, breaking new artistic ground until America's awful Production Code was finally lifted in 1967. In this pivotal, adventurously photographed movie, traces of the future New Wave movement in France are clearly visible, and thus, the original source of our man Quentin, the great pulp filmmaker of the 90's and an admitted follower of Goddard and Melville, can be found here as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I heard a lot about the movie and I knew the movie is considered a classic. Now I finally got the chance to see it and I have to admit I'm a little bit disappointed. First I never got to like the main character Holly Martins played by Joseph Cotten. He was just too weak and naive. I mean already in the beginning every eyewitness of the accident said different things. Every man with common sense should have realized that someone is lying here and that it is necessary to be careful to find out the truth. But no, he just believes everybody and gets manipulated by all their lies. I wish I could have jumped into the screen and told him what is going on here. Then his relationship with Alida Valli, what was he thinking?. It was obvious that she is in love with Harry Lime, played by Orson Welles. After it was clear Lime was still alive, how could he think she could end up being with him? The real hero of the movie for me is Major Calloway, played by Trevor Howard, who succeeds to convince Holly Martins to betray his "friend". He succeeds in his job to catch Lime and stops the stealing of medication from the military hospitals. What I found was very enjoyable in this movie was the unique atmosphere of Vienna, directly after the war. The shots were very good, but this alone can't save the movie. 4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story evolved nice and steadily from a simple curiosity into a mystery case and then unravels into a crime investigation drama and ends up very well in a spy movie flavored finale. The title doesn't only explain the mystery but also elaborates on what's going on between Holly and Anna, or at least what Holly thinks is going on between them. Watching this movie now, it feels very predictable all the way. But as I see the movie being released more than fifty years ago, I think the twists will give great awe to the audience.

		<fullReview>If it weren't for the fact that the film is on the Top 250 on IMDb, I probably wouldn't have even heard of it at first, but being that it's Orson Welles, and I have since heard so many great things about this film-noir, I decided to give it a shot. Unfortunately, The Third Man doesn't live up to it's reputation for me. With a twist that is predictable from the very first scene, to the slow paced rest of the film, The Third Man is just an average film.I tend to love film-noir's. In fact I adore The Big Sleep and Double Indemnity to name a few, but this one failed to peak my interest. Granted there is a terrific performance by Alida Valli, and Orson Welles, being one of the great screen legends of all time, does make an appearance (Yeah he's really only in it for 30 minutes). So that's all great, but the score is distracting and feels like a 60's western, the pacing is abnormally slow, and nothing really happens until the final 15 minutes or so. Which I have to admit, was a great way to end the film. In fact the final chase/shootout is definitely worth re-watching. There is also a clichéd romance that develops between leads that doesn't feel genuine for nearly the entire film (but I did like where that eventually ended up).It's just hard to get over a film that has glaring weaknesses across the board. It also didn't help that the back cover of the copy of the film that I watched spoiled the twist for me, not that I didn't already know, but it would have helped to have at least some percentage of doubt. The bottom line is that there is a lot of about the film I didn't like and a lot I thought was done really well. So I'm pretty dead even on this film. But I'll give the film the benefit of the doubt until I watch it again someday.+Valli +Thrilling final sequence +Welles -Twist is predictable -Score-Slowly paced 6.0/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best classic noir films.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching this makes me miss the old days when sometimes disturbing subject matter could be treated in a deft, lighthearted, even comedic manner, and tastefully so. There's no melodrama, no sense of tragedy, it's as if the entire film is seen from the carefree eyes of Harry Lime himself. Certainly his presence overshadows the film; it's all about him and the clever game he makes of a dire situation, fooling the police and his best friend Holly Martins. For the few scenes he has Orson Welles is fantastic as usual, playing Lime with a snakelike charm. He has a knowing expression and smile that tells us he's right even when the moral instincts of us, Holly Martins and the police say otherwise. When approached on the wheel by Martins about his activities he brushes everything off with lines like "if one of those little dots stopped moving, would you feel any pity?" and "Switzerland had 500 years of peace and democracy and what did they invent? The cuckoo clock." Harry Lime doesn't believe in human morality and he may be right. As with many a noir icon he seems to have some kind of fatalistic drive, perhaps believing he's part of some big gamble. Joseph Cotten is great as always as Holly Martins, playing him comically as a hack writer who drinks too much and has a habit of throwing himself into situations with little awareness. It's easy to believe he was one-upped by Lime when he talks of a gambling scheme he took the fall for. Alida Valli is excellent as Anna Schmitt, so charmed by Lime she doesn't even care about his activities. The chemistry between her and Cotten is very believable. Trevor Howard is funny as the cynical police chief after Lime, who in some of the film's funniest moments tries to warn Martins away, telling him he's "destined to be murdered." The photography in this film is beautiful, making Vienna into some kind of fevered dream of alleyways, shadows and sewers. It seems like some kind of purgatory, the film is hypnotic from start to finish; Carol Reed is a great visual storyteller. Well deserved classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, please forgive my English, I'm a Spanish speaking person. I once went to Vienna. I asked for the locations where "The third man" was shot. To my surprise, I was told that there is a "Third Man's tour". The tour is quite interesting. It is a "walking" tour, and it includes many of the actual locations where the movie picture was shot. It includes a walk for some 300 meters or so by the Wienkanal, which carries non contaminated waters, so it is not smelly. Then you go to the street where Harry Lime was supposed to be hit by a car. There is also a visit to Fraülein Smith's apartment, and the door where Harry Lime hides and is recognized by the cat. Unfortunately there is no time to go to the to the cemetery, where the picture starts and ends, nor to the square (Platz) where Harry Lime vanishes, or to the "Riesenrad", where the most important dialog takes place: (Harry Lime speaks) "Don't be so gloomy. After all it's not that awful. Like the fella says, in Italy for 30 years under the Borgias they had warfare, terror, murder, and bloodshed, but they produced Michelangelo, Leonardo DA Vinci, and the Renaissance. In Switzerland they had brotherly love - they had 500 years of democracy and peace, and what did that produce? The cuckoo clock. So long Holly".

		<shortDescription>One of the great British films (spoilers throughout)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Near the beginning of Carol Reed's magnificent The Third Man, Anna, played by Alida Valli, says that she 'doesn't play tragedy'. Well, she may think that she doesn't, but as the film unfolds it becomes apparent that she does? The opening of the film, giving the background information behind post-war Vienna, gives a good indication of what to expect. It's lean, it's pithy and images of destruction, death and corruption are wonderfully photographed. It's a superb taster and it's an immediate hook. Right from the beginning you're absorbed in the murky post-war world with its skewed angles and looming shadows. Everything isn't quite how it looks.Like most film noir the protagonist is a man who hasn't got a clue what's going on around him. He's an American abroad and he has to struggle with the military police force and the unhelpful locals in order to find the truth. But as a writer of cheap novels he's perhaps better suited to fiction. The truth is harder to swallow.All kinds of contradictory stories are thrown Holly Martins' way and all kinds of cheap tales are sold back to him, but quite rightly he doesn't buy it. There's clearly something wrong. Nothing adds up? At the centre of The Third Man is quite a sad romance. Anna just loves Harry Lime too much. She's loves him so much that she can't see what a wicked individual he is and she loves him so much that she overlooks everything that Holly does. But then again, she's just as much in the dark as everyone else. She doesn't realise how little she means to Harry and she doesn't comprehend the extent of Harry's misdeeds ? there's a wonderful scene in a children's hospital when Holly finally realises why he must betray his friend. Therefore she sees Holly's final actions as a betrayal rather than justice. All she cares about is the fact that the man she loves is dead. Which means that the ending is rather bleak. It seems that she's destined to remain in the dark and that she's destined to keep walking past those who want to bring her into the light.And really Holly and Harry are two sides of the same people. Outwardly both are jovial and cynical, but inside Holly is really a romantic with a firm moral centre while Harry is unsentimental and exploitative. He exploits Anna's affections, he exploits the black market and he exploits everyone around him. In fact, people mean nothing to him, as he proves on the wheel. He sees them as meaningless dots. And he's even prepared to thrown his friend out of the wheel as he proves with quiet menace by opening the door. He's completely ruthless and devoid of feeling. It seems that war has completely destroyed his humanity.So with this final statement in mind, it should be easy to hate Harry Lime. Yet because of Orson Welles' dark charm, it's easy to see why Anna would be seduced. Holly may be the better man, but he's not the most interesting or the most exciting. He's just an ordinary guy. Harry, though, is something completely else. He's the bastard that women always seem to fall for? The final sequence in The Third Man is a tremendous piece of film-making. It's tense, exciting, beautifully filmed and rather downbeat. Of course the good guy kills the bad guy, but there's no triumph. Instead it's really rather sad. Harry, scurrying about the sewers like the rat that he is, and desperately reaching for freedom, is killed by Holly. But although death may be justice, it isn't really the fate that Harry most deserves. What Harry deserves is capture and for him to give up his collaborators. That would be the most just outcome. But as a final favour to Harry, and in a moment where Harry seems to finally realise that what he did was wrong, he silently pleads for execution and is killed. In the end it's something of a hollow victory. Like the war, no one really wins. There are only varying degrees of defeat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Long before Orson Welles makes his appearance as Harry Lime in "The Third Man," it's abundantly clear that this is a "Welles film."Not taking anything away from the fine director Carol Reed, who could easily stand on his own, this film has the "Welles touch" in every scene. How did he manage to turn every film in which he was associated into his own? In his documentary on famous charlatans, "F for Fake," Orson admits to being somewhat of a conjurer. And he wasn't a half bad magician, at that (note his levitation and disappearing tricks). Even the uneven cadence of his line delivery--with that built-in deep, resonant vocal instrument--is completely unique to him, a "signature" no other could duplicate.My thought is that he was such a powerful presence, with a superior intellect, that he managed to dwarf other colleagues and imbue every project with his own stylistic brand. Whether he was coaching a performance from child actor Natalie Wood ("Tomorrow Is Forever") or taking charge of the entire production of "Jane Eyre," Welles dominated everything with which he was associated.I call him the "Stowkowsi" of the cinema. One who could almost command simply by entering the stage (by the time he stepped onto the "podium," his vision was firmly entrenched). He brought the vision with him and its implementation was inescapable. Anton Karas' zither music certainly doesn't hurt this production, either.</fullReview>

It sounds like an East European version of a Hawaiin guitar: Mantovani on LSD meets the local busker. Cripes.In fact, this is no obscure component - almost all the film is shot with those slanting takes which suggest someone tripping out or about to keel over. Is this Graham Greene's world? We do get multiple flashbacks in the Fiennes/Moore End of the Affair as well as the unwelcome intrusion of the supernatural as a principal character. That and the top and tailing graveyard scenes remind me of the unfathomable coincidence that bookend The (original) Day of the Jackal.How the narrative and characterisations manage to keep a straight trajectory (or even a straight face) in amongst all this is quite remarkable. I thought Alida Valli a little overwrought, but the rest of the cast are excellent and Carol Reed joins David Lean as a director-I've-never-heard-of-for-any-other-reason-but-I-don't-care. 8/10</fullReview>

It's a great story with great characters. I'm really partial to the Joseph Cotton performance as Holly Martens. The character is set up for adventure from the start. The inviting voice-over describes Vienna during the "classic period of the black market" and proceeds to introduce us to Holly Martens. He arrives in Vienna with a certain sense of starry-eyed excitement to see and work with his friend.For me, this set a very inviting tone for the rest of the film. This is appropriate because, in a sense, we look forward to meeting Harry Lime just as much as he does. Soon, we learn of Harry's death and are on our way to the funeral. Here, we catch the first glimpse of the mysteriously beautiful Anna (Alida Valli) as well as Major Calloway (Trevor Howard).Throughout the rest of the film, we'll meet new characters and learn so many new things about the recently deceased (or so we think), Harry Lime. The final character we meet is the one we feel we've known all along. Harry Lime (Orson Welles) makes his dramatic entrance on a dark street when the light from a disturbed tenant in a second story apartment comes on. It is my opinion that the only entrance that comes close to the drama of this scene does so, but with thrill factor. That's the first time we see the shark in Jaws. Call me crazy, but that's what I think. To reveal any more about this film, in my mind, would defeat the purpose of telling someone to watch it. There are many key elements that make it a great film that I want people to experience for the first time as I did. But it's a great story of friendship, love, greed, trust, and murder. Sir Carol Reed directed many a fine film. I thoroughly enjoyed Odd Man Out, Fallen Idol, and Trapeze. His musical, Oliver!, is something that belongs up there with West Side Story, Singin' In The Rain, and even The Sound Of Music.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good ol' Orson</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERSFor a long time I've wanted to view this film. Ultimately though, it was sitting in a lecture on films a week ago when the lecturer said "this is my all time favourite movie" that I ended up being determined enough to have a viewing, my opinion now that it's finished? Good ol' Orson made it enjoyable.I know this film is in the top 50 films of all time according to IMDb, and compared to most films on that list, it's definitely true. The acting is first class, cinematography worthy of it's Oscar, and the story is a Graham Greene story, which also counts for something. The problem is that, I can't help but feel that this film has got a bit too dated. In 1949, the vision of Vienna in ruins on the cinema screen must have been majestic, moving and a beautiful tribute to the ultimate futility of war, but now in 2003, a lot of the time I feel the beauty is lost.As well as the dating of the film, one other thing bugs me, and that's that truthfully, Holly Martin (played by Joseph Cotten) and Anna Schmidt (played by Alida Valli) infuriate me almost constantly. The characters are often whiny and Anna especially is a source for constant aggravation. Therefore, with the two main characters bugging me, I was left with the short amount of screen time which featured Orson.I confess here and now that up until today, I'd never properly witnessed Orson Welles acting properly. I'd heard the name spoken with awe and amazement, but it wasn't until the scene on the Ferris Wheel that this awe suddenly made sense. Truthfully, I'm starting to wonder just how high De Niro and Pacino (2 and 1 respectively) would have got in the top 100 actors of all time on British TV had the voters witnessed Orson's performances. During this film, Orson seems to be able to portray a character who was described as that lecturer of mine as "Pure Evil" and yet to me he almost seemed to be sensitive and complex. Orson saves this film, just by the mention of his characters name, and by being able to show the character in a small scene. If it wasn't for him, would this film really be as highly rated?"The Third Man" is portrayed as being one of the best films of all time. For characterisation, cinematography and sound, it has to be in the top five, however for dating so easily, having an annoying main character and for being a bit slow at times, it suffers. Give me Orson, give me the concept, but I wish it hadn't lost part of it's relevance."In Italy for 30 years under the Borgias they had warfare, terror, murder, and bloodshed, but they produced Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, and the Renaissance. In Switzerland they had brotherly love - they had 500 years of democracy and peace, and what did that produce? The cuckoo clock." - Orson Welles as Harry Lime</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An absolute classic, practically faultless.A film to watch on a wet winter afternoon, just to add to the whole atmosphere of the thing. The end scene, in the context of the storyline,of lingering hopes finally dashed, the music adding to the whole total inevertibility of it all,is amongst the best , if not the best, final scene ever in my opinion. To ever consider remaking this film today, or at anytime in the future, not matter the size of the budget, would be a great mistake, and a total travesty.

Kane,Touch of Evil, The Stranger,The magnificant ambersons,chimes at midnight.It could have been so many more.

		<shortDescription>What's Going On Here Then?!?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A (dull) bloke called Holly! That bleeding zither! German expressionist/propaganda cinematography techniques! A pat and almost meaningless plot! Orson Welles being the biggest name and having the smallest part! What's going on here then?!? And how come it was all so deliciously excellent?Holly Martin (Joseph Cotten) is a down-on-his-luck writer of b-grade 'Western' novels drawn to post-war Vienna by the promise of paid employment from his old pal, Harry Lime (Orson Welles). But Harry Lime is a disgusting racketeer wanted by the police (so it transpires) and - what's more to the point - he's dead! So, to occupy his time and make the flight out worthwhile, Martin tries to discover more about the circumstances of his friend's fatality - and accidently falls in love with the melancholic actress he left behind (Alida Valli)! Dear, oh dear, oh dear... Things, however, are about to get a lot worse.The Third Man shouldn't really be a great movie. It should just be a solid murder mystery and be done with it. Unfortunately though, for fans of mediocrity, the producers of this film conspired to bring together some very fine talent and then (as if that wasn't enough) draw from them the stand-out work of their careers! It is a film bursting with excellence. The camera work is magnificent (borrowed yea - like Citizen Kane has never been near Eisenstein!) as it trawls through the pathetic ruins of the capital of what was once Europe's most architecturally staggering empire. The script brilliantly insidious in it's ammoral view of a post-war world in which the conquerers are symbolised in either the whisky-sodden, shambolic pseudo-literasist or the callous, manipulative entrepreneur. The characters a veritably suicidal mixture of insipid dullard (Cotten - ostensibly the romantic lead!); morose entertainer (Valli - ostensibly the female romantic lead [smiles twice]!); tunnel-visioned cop (Trevor Howard - shows not one emotion throughout); and gung-ho fascist (Welles - spends half his screen time running away) - which somehow comes off because it is all played so wondrously earnestly against a back-drop of such trying hardship and unprecedented circumstance that it makes total, total sense. Welles is particularly excellent and our initial encounter with him is surely STILL one of the joys of classic cinema. And it is all brought together by the disgustingly underrated Carol Reed who grasped the 'joke' right from the start - just as Graham Greene's screenplay must surely have intended. Namely, that this isn't a game murder mystery tied around a leakily, tenuous plot; but, conversely, that it is the study of austerity and what it can do to people: Whoever they are - and wherever they're from.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't deny that Carol Reed was an extraordinary director, so I was expecting The Third Man to be perfect, but it wasn't. Maybe I'm jaded, but This film didn't punch him. The story was disappointing, it seemed just too simple. Visually, the film is perfect, the ruins of Vienna are unforgettable. The photography is mindblowing. The acting is quality, you can always rely on Trevor Howard. Cotton is perfect as is the master, Orson Welles!!!The music is rather annoying, but surreal at the same time, it doesn't quite fit the images - Very deliberate in my opinion.The story didn't hit me, I don't understand why!!!

		<shortDescription>Classic Noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Third Man is the definitive film-noir, as it contains everything the genre requires: insane plot twists, a drunk loner, a female love interest, moody photography, and stylish direction. All these fit into the noir equation, and it works perfectly. The cast provides memorable roles, but none are more memorable than Orson Welles' character. He doesn't show up until 2/3 of the movie is finished, but he gives his second-best performance of all time(Kane being No. 1). The story gives suprising twists in it to keep the viewer interested, but it's the photography and direction that are the stars here. The tilted angles and the rush of the sewer chase climax stand out in the film, and the cinematography is constantly brooding and mysterious, even in the daytime. One drawback is the much ballyhooed zither score, which, for a while, is a brilliant touch, but the theme is repeated to death and the effect is lost, but it won't distract you from everything else going on in this spectacular movie. 1-10 Overall--8.5 Direction--8.5 Story--7.5 Photography--9 Acting--7 Music score--6</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Evocative</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Evocative: "Prompting vivid memories or images of things not present, especially things from the past."The word "evocative" describes "The Third Man," not only from the viewing perspective of the 21st century, but from the inner perspective of the movie itself. Carol Reed's combination of lighting, camera angles, shadows, immediate post-war Vienna locations, and carefully underplayed performances make you see and feel far more than what is conveyed by words and performances alone. While I haven't seen this movie in many years, I was reminded of it -- oddly, I'll admit -- when I recently saw "Sixth Sense." This recent horror/thriller movie was also beautifully crafted, with precisely orchestrated camera angles and movements, and deliberate uses of light and shadow. Also, the Bruce Willis character in Sixth Sense is very much like Joseph Cotton's character, Holly Martins: aloof, tortured, unable to alter events, and ultimately confronted with the unexpected realities of the world around him.Finally, the music will forever remind you of the movie. Perhaps only "The Godfather" could be said to have a score that better sustains and anchors its material. From the opening moments to that long, final, delicious scene where Anna walks down that tree-lined country boulevard towards Holly. Will she stop and go with him? Will she hit him? Will she turn around? I wish I no longer knew the answer, because the answer, the first time I saw it, was the perfect exclamation point to the perfect movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Underrated Gem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are some films which are very unique, that have an entirely different look and feel to them. The Third Man is one of these films. It is incredibly dark and filled with atmospheric shadows, it uses German expressionism to make Vienna look jagged and distorted, and it has a zither for its score. These combined tactics take the viewer into an entirely different world full of hostility and corruption to create a truly outstanding film noir.The zither alone makes The Third Man worth watching, but the film is filled with unforgettable moments, particularly the ones with Orson Welles portrayal of Harry Lime. His dramatic entrance is one of the most priceless moments in cinematic history as are the discussion on the giant ferris wheel and the final chase scene in the sewers. Pure cinematic perfection. Words cannot do this film justice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's hard to imagine that any movie with the talents of Sir Carol Reed, Orson Welles, Joseph Cotten, Trevor Howard, Robert Krasker, Graham Greene, and Alexander Korda could be just average.Definitely not here. This is a true classic in the genre of suspense and film noir.This film succeeds so brilliantly because the sum of its parts is an amalgamation of many different elements that throw the viewer for a complete loop.Reed cut his teeth on this genre in films such as Night Train to Munich, and he builds the suspense in such a manner that one becomes almost breathless trying to keep up. Krasker's work is textured, using light and angles to convey a shadowy, menacing environment. The first visual exposure we have to character Harry Lime is one of the more famous pinspot shots in film history. The sewer chase scene is definitely one for the books as well.However, no scene is as revealing as the first confrontation between Lime and friend/adversary Holly Martin. In this scene, the evil of Harry Lime is revealed in a bizarre setting - a ferris wheel ride in an amusement park. The sense of instability and inertia of the entire film is encapsulated in this set of moments.Along with Reed and Krasker, writers Greene and Korda add the same level ofshadow and instability to the characters, effectively smudging them with complications. There are really no heroes or heroines here. None of the characters provides a consistent, stable protagonist with whom we can identify. Holly has his pecadillos and his problems - the disarming scene with the literary club and the public drunkeness tend to loosen our association with him.The vaguely downbeat ending is preluded earlier in the film, but still a bit unexpected. The interesting thing about the movie is that there's a sense of more physicality than actually exists. It's an wild ride that may leave you a bit perplexed, but won't lag for attention.</fullReview>

There is a similar situation in Jumping Jack Flash, where the director relies largely on the personal appeal of Jonathan Price at the climax of the film to achieve his ends. Welles (the actor), of course, has all the charm of Price and more, but Welles the director is not content with this, and produces the scene culminating in a mere glimpse of his face that must rank with the greatest ever filmed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Truly Classic Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Third Man is a truly classic film. Filmed in Black and White it presents a text book example of the film-noire period. It shows the Black and White film as a true and distinct art form. It is a pity that so few films utilize this medium today.The story has Joseph Cotten (excellent as always) coming to post-war Vienna to take a job with his friend Harry Lime (Orson Welles). It seems though that Mr. Lime is not what his friend believed him to be. The rest of the film has Cotten, together with Vali, Trevor Howard and Bernard Lee trying to solve the mystery of Harry Lime.In terms of photography, The Third Man ranks right up there with Citizen Kane and Touch of Evil, both incidentally starring Orson Welles. The lighting and shadows are all there and the chase through the Vienna sewers is a sight to behold. That first shot of Welles standing in the shadows is a cinematic masterpiece. Director Carol Reed must have collaborated very closely with Welles in the directing of this film. It has Welles written all over it.A superb film, the kind of which nobody seems to make any more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As you watch The Third Man, you are slowly sucked into the word of past war Austria. You can almost taste the wet stones that line the streets and you feel just as alone as Holly Martins does. Holly has come to Austria at the request of his boyhood friend, Harry Lime. Upon arriving in Austria, Holly learns that Harry has been killed. As Holly digs deeper into Harry's life in Austria, things start to get weird. Turns out Harry wasn't all that Holly thought he was. That only drives Holly to find out what really happened to Harry, and who the mysterious Third Man is. The Third Man not only showcases great performances from Joseph Cotton and Orson Welles, but it also boasts great black and white cinematography. Shadows abound from every corner and the angles give you a feeling of being off balance, which is how Joseph Cotton feels through the first half of the film. Post war Austria lends itself well to the story. The bombed out buildings and dark streets highten the mystery and danger that lurk in the corners. A great film that can never be topped, and once you've finished the film, you'll be in a dither over the zither.</fullReview>

Of course, it is mentioned as one of the best films ever but I have not heard as much about it as about "Casablanca" or "Citizen Kane" or "Vertigo", to mention a few. I didn't know what it was about either and was surprised by the fact that it was set in Vienna.I really liked it, even if I don't think it's a masterpiece. It's incredibly well-acted and the story is fascinating to say the least. And there are some pretty brilliant scenes in the film. Like when we in the audience find out that Lime is not dead. In the scene before, Anna has told Martins that her cat is only friendly with Harry and then, in the next scene, we see the feet of someone and then how Anna's cat plays with the shoe laces. Brilliant! Of course, a minute later we see Lime's face and Orson Welles smiles a special smile.So, a really good film. Highly recommended. (8/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Paeon of praise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw it about 20 years ago. It has lived in my memory ever since for the power of its evocation of a battle-scarred, shadowy and frightening city whose decadence is expressed in the baroque magnificence of the stove in Anna's flat and in the incongruous polished pedestal of the column to the left in Calloway's office. A place where nothing and no-one can be trusted. A place of echoing and empty streets among ruins whose doorways and passages conceal incomprehensible menace.A recent second viewing confirmed, reinforced and enhanced my admiration. From the first strum of the zither to the final shot of Anna walking past Martins as she leaves the cemetery, the film exercises a total grip on the senses. The plot was as I remembered it, the detail this time threw up the themes of names/identity - Dr Winkel/Vinkel, Holly/Harry, Calloway/Callaghan - the theme of laughter: Anna's role as an actress in the play ("They only do comedy"), Harry's telling her she laughed too much, Holly's delight at her rare smile - and, above all, the pervasive air of pure and inescapable sadness, a quality rarely captured on film.I had forgotten how the appearance of the horrible child round the doorway in pursuit of his ball prefigures the first appearance of Harry Lime, preceded by the cat. Two apparently round, innocent faces - one presaging betrayal and the other evil. Death and destruction affecting thousands - the outcome both of war and of the criminal activities which follow in its wake - form the nervous backdrop, visual and narrative, to the film: yet there is only one on-screen killing. The tension of the scene in the sewers, the echoes, the shadows and the agonising confrontation of Harry and Holly provide the finest climax of any thriller I have seen. The credit has to be shared equally among Carol Reed, Robert Krasker and Graham Greene.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everything comes together perfectly. There's Robert Krasker's startling photography; Anton Karas' zither music; superbly paced direction from Carol Reed (who would have thought that final shot would come off so superbly?); Graham Greene's razor-sharp script; and the performances: Joseph Cotten, Allida Valli, and the much underrated Trevor Howard. Even in the minor roles, Bernard Lee and Wilfred Hyde-White provide some ofthe best comic relief I've seen. And, of course, Orson Welles, in surely the greatest cameo performance ever - full of irresistible charm while dripping with evil.And yet, the whole is actually GREATER than the considerable sum of its parts. This film is touched with rare magic - something you can't quite put your finger on, but is there all the same. Every single scene is magnificent; the timing and pacing are absolute perfection. And, just when you think you've seen it all, there's that final scene.....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not only do critics and viewers seem to love this movie, but other filmmakers seem to love it as well and incorporate elements of the Third Man into their own films. Some of these newer films are less than all-time greats (The James Bond film The Living Daylights borrows elements such as the old friendships, the fake death, the ferris wheel, a performing girlfriend with forged papers and even the "Ein Balloon mein Herr?"--although in normal fashion Bond gets the girl instead of having her walk away)--but some other films that nod in The Third Man's direction are much better such as the Coen Brothers' Miller's Crossing (the characters have been shifted around and the setting is very different, but the same themes echo throughout--I only wish the final scene was as amazing as in The Third Man.) I'm sure there are many other films that have been influenced but I can't think of any at the moment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Third Man is easily the best example of the noir genre, and may well be the best single movie ever made. The greatest reason for this: Orson Welles. Off screen for almost two-thirds of the movie, he's nevertheless the most intimidating villain in screen history; you know nothing of what to expect from him, because he is evil incarnate. Furthermore, Greene and Korda's script awes me. For an example of how to write suspense better than one could imagine, read the scene in the Ferris Wheel car.

		<fullReview>This beautifully crafted, literate, and surprising masterpiece is my pick for greatest film of all time. It would be in the top 10 in many different categories: direction, cinematography (some of the expressionistic compositions are breathtaking), editing, music (the solo zither was a masterstroke), best introduction of a character (Harry Lime), best climax (in the sewers), best closing shot (what a risk Reed took with that long take), best monologue (Welles on the ferris wheel). All this is at the service of a fascinating story: a large cast of great characters (all the way down to the babbling old landlady in Anna's building), lots of twists, good irony, witty dialogue. I don't agree with previous writers that the story is hard to follow. I think it develops quickly, logically, and clearly. Anna is a mysterious character, but she was meant to be that way. Joseph Cotton delivers a brilliant, underplayed performance that leads us into the story. All elements comes together in this movie to make it the incomparable masterpiece that it is.</fullReview>

At a restaurant in Chicago named the Golden Ox (now gone) the entertainment was a Zither player with many years of experience on the instrument. When he was interviewed by a local newspaper about his experiences at the restaurant, he estimated that from the requests he got to play something for patrons, that no one in Chicago knew a second song for the instrument after the theme from The Third Man!In combination with the unusual and expressive music of this film, the brutally surprising camera work was masterful, switching from scene to scene and face to face rapidly to strengthen a feeling of danger, urgency, or fear.The film shows a harsh existence for Berliners in a recovering period after the close of World War Two.

The tilted camera angles, the shadows that seem to be unconnected to the actors, the unmotivated lighting, etc.A great example of these elements is the sewer chase, the maze of tunnels,the lighting and the camera angles are reminiscent of the streets in The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari.The use of expressionism may be to remind the audience that Germany has produced wonderful things, not just war.

		<fullReview>There are some movies that simply are so captivating and well-crafted that you might, for a moment, doubt their very existence: This is such a movie.Based on a great novel, there were still lots that could have gone wrong when adapting the story for the screen. (1) Casting: I have practically no complaints. Even the animals (a cat and a parrot) were great. If there would have been one remark, it would consider the janitor at Lime's place and his shifting knowledge of the English language. (2) Directing: so solid that it has to be reckoned as one of the pillars of golden age cinematography. Welles apparently wanted to take credits from Carol Reed. That says quite a lot. (3) Setting: Brilliant! Wienna as a lugubrious and damp ghost town filled with odd people, mostly viewed in close-ups - silent, tormented faces. (4) Plot: Believable enough. Actually a bit of a MacGuffin; the emotional drama is the true story, but it wouldn't have worked without the detective hyperplot. The title itself could be given almost a double entendre with respect to the famous final scene: the female protagonist has lost the first man, ignored the second, and eventually walks towards the third. Well, a bit over analytical, but... 5) Soundtrack: Very unusual. A Hungarian zither player got international reputation merely out of this movie.

		<shortDescription>A classic thriller.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Third Man is a brilliant classic thriller that takes place in the political instability of post World War 2 Vienna, Austria. In this post war buffer zone setting our story sees Holly Martins (Joseph Cotten) a US novelist arriving to accept a job opportunity from his old friend Harry Lime (Orson Wells). However Holly arrives just in time for Lime's funeral as it turns out Lime was killed in a car accident. But as Holly keeps finding out more information that connects to Lime's death from differing testaments, he keeps running into different roadblocks. In addition to the facts that he can never hear the truth, he learns from Royal Army Major Calloway (Trevor Howard) that Lime was a black marketer. As the plot unravels it almost becomes a puzzle that escalates more and more. It's a great movie as it keeps you on your toes. The acting is great from everyone and Anton Karas's theme is so fitting and suspenseful. Go watch it for yourself. It's terrific.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One noir film that lives up to the hype</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've watched quite a few old noir/crime films by now, but The Third Man is the first one that really lives up to the genre's breathless descriptions given by its fans. It's sleek and sexy, well-shot, and lives in a morass of amorality. It's also tremendously fun to watch.The key that makes The Third Man work where so many other "classic" crime films fail is pacing. It starts out slowly enough to draw the viewer into the uncertain world of post-war Vienna, and then slowly increases the pace of the twists and turns, while never being hard to follow. Its protagonist, a befuddled Western author, is a lot more sympathetic than your average private dick, which makes his descent into the underworld genuinely affecting. And of course, there's Orson Welles as the title role, which is pretty hard to beat.Moreover, The Third Man doesn't disappoint on the idea front. It plays around with the ideas of truth, metafiction, and morality without ever coming to a definite conclusion. The rather sloppy climax is the only thing that keeps this from being a 10 out of 10, but even so it's thoroughly recommended, even for people who don't usually like old movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Essential Spy Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Third Man is a British film noir, directed by Carol Reed and starring Joseph Cotten, Alida Valli, Orson Welles and Trevor Howard. Some critics rank it as a masterpiece, particularly remembered for its atmospheric cinematography, performances, and unique musical score.The screenplay was written by novelist Graham Greene, who subsequently published the novella of the same name.Anton Karas wrote and performed the score.In this Cold War spy classic, Holly Martins, a third-rate American pulp novelist, arrives in postwar Vienna, where he has been promised a job by his old friend Harry Lime. Upon his arrival, Martins discovers that Lime has been killed in a traffic accident, and that his funeral is taking place immediately. At the graveside, Martins meets outwardly affable Major Calloway and actress Anna Schmidt, who is weeping copiously. When Calloway tells Martins that the late Harry Lime was a thief and murderer, the loyal Martins is at first outraged. Gradually, he discovers not only that Calloway was right but also that the man lying in the coffin in the film's early scenes was not Harry Lime at all--and that Lime is still very much alive (he was the mysterious "third man" at the scene of the fatal accident). Thus the stage is set for the movie's famous climactic confrontation in the sewers of Vienna--and the even more famous final shot, in which Martins pays emotionally for doing "the right thing." The Third Man is an essential classic.For lovers of film noir, it is unquestionably a must-see -- one of the masterpieces of a genre that has contained everything from milestone motion pictures to low-budget potboilers.Seen today, it can be appreciated as a prophetic statement on the eventual moral bankruptcy of the one-world euphoria that clouded men's minds immediately after the second 'war to end all wars.'Finally,this atmospheric thriller is one of the undisputed masterpieces of cinema, and boasts iconic performances from Joseph Cotten and Orson Welles.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mesmerizing Noir By Sir Carol Reed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know if Carol Reed set out to prove that film noir was not the exclusive province of Hollywood men like Billy Wilder, but THE THIRD MAN, made by a British director and filmed in and around postwar Vienna with an international cast, is one of the greatest films noirs ever made.The great, underrated Joseph Cotten stars as Holly Martins, a moderately successful writer of pulp fiction who comes to Vienna in search of his boyhood friend Harry Lime. He is, however, a day late and a dollar short: he is informed that Lime was run over in the street the day before and killed.Shocked at the news, Holly naturally asks many questions, but it quickly becomes clear that no one wants to give him any answers. Everyone he talks to acts like they are being followed, and all he learns is that two men were with Lime when the accident happened and carried his body to the side of the street. Only the porter's account differs from this official version: he insists that there was a "third man" there at the time, but try as he might, Holly can get nothing more out of him.Also mixed up in whatever is going on is Harry's mistress Anna Schmidt (Alida Valli, billed here only by her surname), a beautiful actress at a local theatre who, like everyone else Holly has encountered, seems reluctant to talk and gives a good many enigmatic answers.Torn between dissatisfaction at the lack of information he is getting yet at the same time drawn to Anna, Holly makes a few awkward attempts to court her, such as bringing her flowers. Unfortunately for both of them, he can't resist trying to find out what happened to Harry, and is shocked when Anna actually suggests that he is better dead.Meantime the local police want nothing more than for Holly to get on the next plane back to the States. Everybody in this film is either hiding something or afraid of something (or both), and Holly's attempts to find out the fate of his friend go nowhere for some time. Finally it is revealed that Harry Lime was involved in the black market distribution of diluted penicillin; the description of the effects of the watered-down medicine does not bear close scrutiny, but it does not matter. Holly is forced to come face-to-face with the truth that the boy he once knew became a man he did not know.Just when you think things can't get any more twisted, Harry (Orson Welles) turns up, very much alive and completely unrepentant with regard to his black market activities.This is a real roller-coaster-ride of a movie; it has the most unexpected twists and turns, including an unforgettable chase scene through the sewers of Vienna at night.One of the stunning things about this movie is how forcibly Welles's presence is felt despite the fact that he does not show up until the film has been running for a solid hour. In fact, probably the most remarkable thing about this movie is that it is about a man that we do not see until the movie is into its second hour and who is really neither the lead nor the title character although the story revolves around him (the "third man" of the title is not Harry but one of the men who carried him to the sidewalk after being run over in the street). and who dominates the film even though he appears in only a small handful of scenes. Welles is perfect here; he tones down his tendency to be hammy and underplays beautifully, probably so that he would not look a fool next to Joe Cotten, one of the greatest actors of his day, who delivers here one of his finest performances.And Valli makes three: stunning, enigmatic, with an undertone of bitterness, she makes Anna an unforgettable character.I've given enough away, I think. The greatest movies are those that defy simple categorization. Reed may have set out to make a noir, but the end product is much, much more than the sum of its parts. And Anton Karras's zither-based score is haunting and fits the mood of the piece to perfection.This film also has one of the most iconic and unforgettable final shots in cinematic history. I won't reveal it; it's just too good.A real stunner.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fabulously Unique Film. Timeless Masterpiece that ages like Fine Wine.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>DIDJA EVER SEE a film several times over the years,thinking that you were highly familiar with it; being sorta like a second nature to you now, like breathing out and breathing in..........., but, I digress.THIS WAS THE case at our house just yesterday. Our usual weekday routine was interrupted and yours truly wound up doing paperwork at the kitchen table. We had already watched O'REILLY, HANNITY and VAN SUSTEREN on FOX News and are still actively boycotting LETTERMAN. So we watched Turner Classic Movies; which had an unusually fine playbill that night. While writing checks and licking stamps, we had A FACE IN THE CROWD on the Telly. After that, while Mrs. Ryan (Deanna) turned in, yours truly thought he'd just watch a little of THE THIRD MAN, with a cup Tea (the only good thing the English did for us-Irish, that is.)WELL THIS MUST have been a truly 'restored' version; as the film hadn't neither a crackle in its soundtrack, nor a visible splice anywhere. And furthermore, Ladies and Gentlemen of the Jury, there too were several scenes that would appear to have been formerly deleted; either by act of the Censor (Public Morals), or by decision of Television Executive (The Public Commercial$).WHATEVER THE REASON, there were more scenes,lengthier scenes and more time allowed for the development and exposition of supporting characters. For example, we know who to expect to do what and whom to suspect as having already done whatever. We get a real idea of just who was what; from the slimy assassin-types to the pair of old poofs who are part of that Vienese Underworld's Black Market.THE INCLUSION OF a pair of homosexual men in the story is handled much in the same way that Joel Cairo (Peter Lorre) was dealt with in THE MALTESE FALCON (Warner Bros., 1941) or the Lindsay Marriott was portrayed in MURDER MY SWEET (RKO Radio Pictures, 1944) with 'crooner' Dick Powell and its remake FAREWELL MY LOVELY (EK Corp./ITC Pictures/AVCO Embassy,1975) with 'rugged' Robert Mitchum.* It was done in a very mature, sophisticated and matter of fact manner. The orientation of these characters was never so stated; but none the less, was quit explicit.AS FOR THE script and story, done by Mr. Graham Greene, it is said to have an uncredited contribution from Orson Welles; who's Harry Lime doesn't make his appearance on screen for well into the second half of its running time. The offbeat, clever and vibrant camera work surely must have had a more than just a few touches from the Citizen Kane kid himself.THE ON LOCATION shooting done in the Post War Vienna is beautiful in every respect is even more so because of the fine B&amp;W film used; which gives it a sort of archival and newsreel type look to it. Much like future films such as ON THE WATERFRONT (Horizon Pictures/Columbia Pictures, 1954)u and THE FRENCH CONNECTION (Schine-Moore/D'Antoni Prod./20th Century-Fox, 1971), this film does an excellent job of portraying late Winter to Early Spring, March type weather. One can almost feel the damp, penetrating cold right off the screen; especially if you live in such an area, such as Vienna, New York or (in our case) Chicago.LASTLY AND SURELY not leastly (if there is such an adverb), we have the enchanting, even intoxicating allure of the Zither music that magically first draws us into the story; keeping us 'hooked' for its entire 104 minutes and long after.WE GIVE IT at least 5 Stars (that's *****, just like Generals Eisenhauer &amp; MacArthur! No, Schultz, we can't give it the Heisman Trophy!) NOTE * MURDER MY SWEET was an adaptation of Raymond Chandler's Novel, FAREWELL MY LOVELY. The remake, which seemed to stick closer to the printed page, was given the regular title of FAREWELL MY LOVELY. What's even more peculiar-some is the title it carried in the U.K.; which was FAREWELL MY LOVELY. Confused? Well,there was even an earlier filming of the story; but it was sans Phillip Marlowe. George Sanders was the Private Eye, Gay Lawrence,in THE FALCON TAKES OVER (RKO Radio Pictures, 1942)! It is an adaptation of, you guessed it, FAREWELL MY LOVELY!POODLE SCHNITZ!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Third Man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An excellent, depressing look at Vienna soon, too soon, after World War II, "The Third Man" was shot largely in that city and starred Joseph Cotten, Orson Welles, and some other major actors who don't really matter. This movie makes Orson Welles look better than any other movie I've seen him in, especially in his first shot in the movie.The plot is that the occupation of Vienna by the major powers (Great Britain, US, France, and Soviet Union) leads to a black market. Our naive hero, Holly Martins (played by Cotten), comes to Vienna to see an old chum, only to find that his chum (Harry Lime) was killed in a traffic accident. Holly is just in time for the burial. Lime, it turns out, was selling fake penicillin, placing him on the most-wanted list of most of the police and MPs in town.Director Carol Reed does an excellent job, and Orson Welles is very good as Lime. The city of Vienna has a starring roll as well, which it plays with admirable degradation.* Martins finds out that Lime was involved in the black market in a way that resulted in many deaths, especially among children. There are puzzling aspects about Lime's death (who was the third man at the accident scene, for example), and Martins, who should have left well enough alone and gone home, is involved in the investigation into Lime's chicanery and death and becomes involved with Lime's distraught surviving girlfriend. It's an excellent film that has recently been released in Hi Def on Blu-Ray DVD, which brings all the glory of its black and white shades of gray back from the blotchy blacks of VHS and standard definition. Reed achieved an admirable number of great shots in the film, and using black and white was genius. Vienna has never looked so glamorously demolished."The Third Man" has a great ending that book ends the beginning, leaving us no better off than we were. No, we're worse off. Sometimes we don't need to know what we wanted to know. Superb closing scene.*If you liked "The Third Man," I recommend reading Hotel New Hampshire by John Irving, which has much of its action taking place in the same town at the same time and which is excellent. The novel is free at your public library. Also listen to Marelene Dietrich sing "Falling in Love Again" from "The Blue Angel." Although performed in the late Twenties, the refrain "I can't help it" sums up the theme of "The Third Man," and Dietrich vocalizes the dreary lostness of post-war Vienna.

		<shortDescription>The beauty of darkness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a reason that the only Academy Award won by "The Third Man" went to Robert Krasker for cinematography. Of all the film noir I've seen, this night-shrouded mystery is the most visually superb. Forget the crisp dialogue or the magnetizing performance of supporting actor Orson Welles -- the picture quality of Sir Carol Reed's masterpiece is its paramount attribute.Taking place in Vienna post WWII, "The Third Man" follows pulp novelist Holly Martins (Joseph Cotten) on a trip to meet his friend Harry Lime (Orson Welles) in Vienna, only Holly soon learns that Harry has died in an accident. Looking for answers, Holly discovers that there's more to it than he realized and that Harry might not have been the person he thought he was. Trevor Howard and Alida Valli co-star as Maj. Calloway, who leads the investigation into the truth of Lime's death and Anna, Harry's former lover whom Holly falls for.Darkness pervades nearly every scene as Holly inches closer to the truth. Coupled with Reed's keen eye for dramatic camera angles, the film maintains suspense throughout, often times leading us to believe danger lurks at every turn when nothing all that visually exciting is taking place on screen (until the infamous final sewer sequence, where the film makes its biggest visual statement.)For 1949, Reed and Krasker capture an indescribable beauty in the shadows of their film, one easily comparable to today's movies despite light years of technological advancements. Without color, film noir has to make a visual statement with vividness of light and it's really just tremendous how successful Krasker is at making that statement.Orson Welles is the perfect actor in the film's most mysterious role. His Cheshire cat smile and his drastically altered world view make him fit flawlessly into the film's dark universe. His presence sort of wakes you up in a film whose actors are talented but lack a clear signature, one that draws you to them characters. He brings a much needed thrill to the movie.When it comes to shots that stand out in your memory, "The Third Man" is loaded with them. Plain and simple, it's why this film is remembered and remembered fondly 60 years later.</fullReview>

As the story unfolds, the audience, and the main character are slowly given the pieces to a puzzle that ends with everyone knowing exactly what is going on.It is a film-noir mystery, professionally done, with exceptional performances from legends of cinema.Still worth watching, even today.

		<shortDescription>The word "great" is not enough for The Third Man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Third Man is definitely a successful experience for Carol Reed in the late 40's when most films made were boring and dull and full of cliché.But The Third Man is a movie that stands alone with it's unique union of different elements that brought together skillfully makes for an entertaining,unforgettable,suspenseful,Hitchcockian and yet influential movie. The story is fantastic (Both screenplay and especially Graham Greene's story).The story has one excellent turning point in the middle of the film,where we realize (or make sure) that Harry is in fact alive.From this moment,the story totally changes way from Holly Martins trying to find out about Harry's supposed death,to him trying to actually get Harry. The dialoges are smart,the relationship between Holly and Anna is really interesting.The movie has a very interesting and unusual sense of humor both hitting our minds using strangely and suspensefully funny dialoges,especially by Orson Welles playing Harry,and also the great music which was very suitable to the noir style. The few scenes of the ending were also fascinating,especially the repetition of the scene after the funeral,and also the fact that we,again aren't sure whether Harry is dead or alive. Actors are great in this:Joseph Cotten,Alida Valli and Trevor Howard all did great performances.But the real thing which made this movie more memorable,was of course Orson Welles,who although being on screen in almost a quarter of the film,was in fact the main actor remembered from this movie. The cinematography is extraordinary(which won an Oscar).The black and white that makes the sets(especially the wet,almost rainy streets) and actors more enjoyable to watch.Actually,I can't imagine this movie in color. Afterall,I think a 10 out of 10 is not enough for this movie!The Third Man is definitely one of top 10 movies of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When you watch a so-called classic film for the first time after years of it being 'out there', sometimes you can't really justify why the film became a classic in the first place. Some movies simply become 'of their time' and don't transcend the period all that well. CASABLANCA is a movie that has been regarded by some commentators as the greatest Hollywood film, but compared to films like SINGIN IN THE RAIN and STAR WARS, it has more relevance to the period in which it was shot (1942).Carol Reed's THE THIRD MAN, according to the DVD sleeve notes on the UK release 2-disc set, has been acclaimed as the 'greatest British film of all time'. I would regard it as a great British film up there with the likes of GET CARTER, THE FULL MONTY and LAWRENCE OF ARABIA, a contrasting film set on natural locations and scripted by one of the all-time great novelists (Graham Greene). Although my cynicism regarding it's acclaim on the sleeve was evident, I can justify at least some of that by how influential this film could have been on films that followed. One can't help wondering whether director Andrew Davis was influenced and inspired by this film when he conceived the FUGITIVE remake, since the sewer sequence in that film is very reminiscent of the climactic chase in this film.THE THIRD MAN is an early example of good structured storytelling, with sufficient teasing of the audience as Martins (Joseph Cotten) arrives in Vienna to seek out his friend Harry Lime. It is probably one of those films Alfred Hitchcock would have done alongside his other British offerings prior to his Hollywood success, but that does not take anything away from director Reed's skill with the camera and character. Bernard Lee provides an interesting supporting performance which seems to be a trailer to his iconic performances as M in the Bond films from 1962-79, another series that may well have been influenced by THE THIRD MAN in tone and style.The music score is another strength and factor in this film's power. I suppose a lot of people cannot think of Orson Welles in parody form without that classic theme reverberating in their heads. The late comedian Kenny Everett did such a homage to Welles during his 80's ITV show in England, as non-PC a comedian as you could get back then.Ultimately though, it is the cohesive whole of all elements that help make THE THIRD MAN one of the true all-time entertainments. Worthy of it's place in cinematic and DVD history.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Classic Film Noir at it's very best, a great story, great actors and a great mystery. That's all you really need, right? Ya, but this film has way more then that as well, the cinematography is amazing compared to now, let alone 1949, for then it is ground breaking and like nothing ever seen. I've heard complaints about the over bearing music but personally I loved it, it just seemed to add so much to every scene when that very distinctive music would start up again. I'm surprised certain elements of this movie hadn't been ruined for me before viewing, with all the recommendations I have read and heard and for nothing to have been given away is something I am truly grateful for. The Third Man feels like a film years before it's time and not just in a few ways but in every way. Plus who will forget that scene, ya you know which one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Notwithstanding 'Citizen Kane', this is the finest movie Orson Welles has ever made. Indeed, this is one of the finest movies anyone has ever made. The classic Welles touch permeates this fine film and anyone who wishes to know what the man was all about should start with this one. All of the actors, fine performers in their own right, seem to have peaked in this movie. I have not read the Graham Greene novel but I would have to believe that, contrary to the usual book/movie comparisons, this movie has surpassed the book. I say this partly because of the almost dreamlike scenes and camera angles , something of a signature of Welles' work, and partly because of the hauntingly lovely strains of Anton Karas' zither, tying one scene to another and delicately enveloping the whole work. A book cannot do that. I don't know how many times I have seen this movie but, like a fine painting, I see it again at each opportunity. If you have not seen this movie you are missing a major contribution to the world of cinematography.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece of atmospheric storytelling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An American Pulp Fiction Novelist (Cotten) arrives in post World War II Vienna to accept a job offer from his old friend Harry Lime (Welles) and discovers that he has been killed in a mysterious accident.....and thus begins this superb film-noir. Graham Greene's screenplay (based upon his earlier novella of the same name) is majestically given life on the big screen by Director Carol Reed. What ensues is a remarkable blend of witty dialogue, clever chase sequences and possibly the greatest character entrance in the history of film. The amazing cinematography blends consummately with the haunting Zither theme music of Anton Karas, to create an eerily authentic Viennese street atmosphere.The trio of actors; namely Valli, Welles and Howard turn in thoroughly convincing performances in their respective roles. However, the standout performance of the film is supplied by Joseph Cotten; one finds that he is so often underrated in the history of film. Nonetheless, he is wonderful as Holly Martins; a character that is thrust into a role as a drunken, and at times seemingly incompetent, amateur detective.This is a film that builds a strong case to be considered the greatest English language film of all time, especially when one considers the manner in which it is able to combine the elements of superb characterization, expressionist style and suspenseful drama.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Joy of Cinema: The Third Man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Third Man (1949) ****Carol Reed and Graham Greene's 'The Third Man' is regarded as one of the greatest and most entertaining films ever made, and I would not for a second disagree. The Third Man contains a quality that is uniquely rare in film: it embodies all that is magnificent about going to the movies. I was not born when this film was made and released. Nor were my parents for another 3 years. Yet the film transcends its age and retains such a great story, and for that it is nearly impossible for anyone to dislike. I love the film. I have since I first saw it, and I've only grown fonder of it as the years pass. I waited for a while to purchase a DVD, as I knew that it was going to be re-released on Criterion. And now, I'm proud to say that I finally own the new 2-disc edition, and very pleased to report that it is one of the best purchases I've ever made. The film follows the lost and lonely Holly Martins as he searches post-war Vienna for clues about the death of his friend and supposed-to-be business associate, Harry Lime. He arrives in Vienna on the day of Lime's funeral. There he meets Inspector Calloway who offers him a drive back to town, and then explains that Lime was involved in the underground diluted penicillin ring, which caused the deaths of many. Martins, an unemployed pulp novelist, dedicates himself to finding out the truth and clearing his friends name, only to find out perhaps that Calloway is right, and that perhaps Harry Lime may not be dead after all. His journey takes him through shadowy Vienna and introduces him to shadowy friends of Lime and his girlfriend. Martin's falls in love with her, but her love for Harry is eternal, and perhaps even fatalistic. The Third Man contains three key elements which makes it so perfect. First, is the razor sharp dialogue by Graham Greene; second, is Reed's brilliant direction and ingenious shot angles and shadows; third, is the extraordinary zither score. Many then, and even today, find the score perplexing and distracting. But to take it away and The Third Man would lose one of its most important aspects. It manages to be cheerful but not jokey or light. Its ironic tones bring a heavy sense of disillusionment that fits perfectly with the narrative of the film. Robert Krasker's cinematography also presents the film with a disillusioning effect. Many shots are filmed at a tilted angle which throws off the equilibrium of the shots and presents a window into the confusion and upheaval of Martins' world. The story is typical of a thriller, but not really typical at all. The entrance of the films biggest star and plot mechanism doesn't even make his entrance until over half way through the film, but his entrance is one of the greatest, and most infamous of all movie entrances. He also delivers the greatest adlib in the history of the movies, the famous 'cuckoo clock' speech. The eventual and inevitable doomed final act culminates in one of the great movie chases. It's not fast and furious like a car chase in Bullitt, but it is slow, meticulous and intelligent like the brilliant metro chase in Melville's 'Le Samourai.' The fatal game of hide and seek is beautifully shot in bleak and shadowy cinematography and rife with the hollow sounds of footsteps, no music. The Third Man is one of my all time favorite films. It's as entertaining as any movie, and totally re-watchable. I've seen it at least 10 times so far, and will see it certainly many more than ten times. The Third Man embodies all that is joyful about going to the movies.4/4</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh, the shadows.. who is this ubiquitous figure... I'd prefer not to tell. A film like this works best without any foreknowledge of its thread, and unfortunately most comments, reviews, and blurbs give away the greatest secret in film history. Even the DVD case holds the secret on its cover. The cat is out of the bag, but I wish it wasn't. They should have reversed the Janet Leigh / Psycho route, and left Orson Welles off the credits, off the poster, off the trailers, off the tag-lines. But then the film would not have been as successful and we all might not have even seen it. They needed his face to market it.. But his face gives us the greatest surprise! Oh, the tragic irony of film marketing. What you should do is find someone who hasn't seen it or heard anything about it, put it in the DVD player, don't let them see the case, and just let it play through, because the beautiful surprise of Welles's Harry Lime is one of the greatest entrances in film history, and works best if the viewer has no idea he is in it. But you already do. Drats.</fullReview>

To travel back in time and be reminded of the greatness of characters and architectural structures of older European cities during the war era brought a bittersweet joy to my heart!

		<shortDescription>The Third Man and the Logical Third</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film's title, The Third Man, announces that it's about triangulation. Shot in brilliant film noir black and white, and set on location in the ruined post-war city of Vienna, the film explores and unfolds mediated relations and on several levels. Most obviously are the interpersonal relations between the film's main characters a woman's (Alida Valli, played by Anna Schmidt) two incomplete paramours, specifically: one actual but absent Harry Lime (Orson Welles), the other a present but only potential lover, Rollo Martins (Joseph Cotten). But the film also explores the indirect and shady economic relations of the black market, and the equally gray morality that seems a necessary means of coping with relations steered from the straight and narrow. Any one of these three themes could make a movie. But the Third Man's brilliance is in its success at playing out its themes using each mode of cinematic expression (story, image, sound). Much of the film is shot with dutch angles (an angled camera, which puts the frame askew). Rollo Martins, a straight up American visiting old friend Harry LIme (whom we don't find till the end of the film), is framed straight up and down. But as he begins to encounter an underground economy (and the film's conclusion is indeed shot in the city's drainage system) of barter, favors, bribes and corruption, the frame tilts. Scenes shot in alley ways also tell of perilous and shadowy pastimes and night times. Scenes featuring our heroine frame her, literally, in windows and doors (though she's not the only one who's framed). The moral choices our hero faces can only bend if he is to find his friend or get the girl (it's not clear which it will be, but by convention he oughtn't get either until he makes the right choice, that is to say, morally right--the right kind of choice according to the film). While Valli refuses to compromise her principles, even at the risk of deportation to the Russian sector (she's Czech), Martins makes trades to keep her in Vienna. And Martins, rather than allow Valli contact with Lime (her lover presumed dead), keeps them apart in order to save her for himself. What Martins tells her, and Lime, is never clearly, nor completely true. The world of film noir is a world in which choices are hazy and relations, being alliances, are subject to change. But our lead actors survive temptations to uphold the genre conventions. It's not till the 50's that heroes, sheriffs, cops, and detectives become morally ambiguous (or ambivalent: Eastwood was not a Wayne). The shift takes interesting shape in gangster films with themes of betrayal. Gangster films began as cops-and-robbers films, in which the contrast of moral choices was portrayed in the high contrast of black and white. But the gang, and a mafia in particular, is a family. The crime of family betrayal (whether to the cops, or to another gang) replaces the black and white of moral distinctions to become the source of tension in films like the Godfather, Casino, and Donnie Brasco. The Third Man's theme of triangulation is where the psychology of indirect relations really comes into the limelight. Philosopher Gilles Deleuze observes that the logic of Alfred Hitchcock's suspense is not the whodunit of a crime, but its "for whom was it done." He reveals plot points to the camera (and thus the audience) that are concealed from the film's characters. In fact the audience sometimes knows who has committed the crime from the very beginning; what's not known is the characters' relations to the crime, or its perpetrators, and this unsettles their relations to one another. Their relations are then developed according to the film's logical puzzle (as opposed to their emotional or real relations to one another). In the Third Man the position of third is not fixed but circulates. All relations are not equal, and in the Third Man, Martins, Lime, and Valli must choose their relationships to one another on the basis of muddled events, a shadowy underworld's downward gravitational pull, obfuscating facts and the incomplete observations of witnesses--honest and dishonest alike. Direct relations have difficulty flourishing in a world of indirect and convenient allegiances. But the romantic story-line requires the directness of communication (affection expects honesty and sincerity). If Martins' courtship of Valli is to succeed, he must leave his triangulations and draw a straight and direct line to her. As the film nears its incredible showdown--a standout moment in film-making on its own--the audience knows Martins is facing an almost impossible choice as a friend (to LIme) and lover (not yet but hoping to become for Valli). He must reveal the truth about Lime to the police if he wants Valli to see him. But he must take his action without the supporting angles of a triangle (angled shots of a dutch camera = the geometry of triangles?). It's a decision he can only take alone. And this is how it plays out. He takes the gun in his own hands and without the cover of the police in the waterways with him, confronts Lime for his immorality. He pulls the trigger, his act resounding with an echo against concrete tunnel walls, and in the back lit white of a dark passage way, Martins, now looking much a Western hero, walks his straight line back to the world above. We do not know if he gets the girl. The film begins with Martins noticing Valli, who is walking a straight line directly down the center of a straight road. He meets her again on the same road, after the same burial (this time it is Lime's body in the ground, put to rest where he belongs), and she doesn't look his way. The audience, however, knows that he is now on the same path, and that his choices have made him a candidate, at least, for a position in a romantic partnership.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heaven for Graham Greene Fans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is there any greater entrance in cinema history than Orson Welles's in this movie? His character, Harry Lyme, supposedly dead, is hiding in a dark doorway. His American friend, Holly Martins (Joseph Cotten), who came to Vienna to see Lyme and instead has gotten wrapped up in trying to solve the mystery of his death, is looking toward the doorway at the figure in shadow. Suddenly, someone in an upstairs apartment across the way turns their light on, which shines directly on Harry's face, revealing him to his friend. The look Welles gives at that moment was singlehandedly deserving of an Academy Award. With just a faint smirk on his lips, a twinkle in his eye, and not one single word of dialogue, he manages to say "hello" to his friend, apologize for lying to him, and invite Holly in on what Harry seems to think is a great big joke. When people talk about those classic moments in films, they're talking about moments like this."The Third Man" is like a Graham Greene novel come to life, and not surprisingly, since Greene wrote the screenplay. But it catches the tone of a Greene novel in a way no adaptation of any of his stories has ever been able to do. Many people will call "The Third Man" a film noir, but it's not really. It's got noirish elements, but underneath the seriousness of the storyline, there's a tremendous sense of fun that is unique to Greene's style of storytelling. He's out primarily to entertain you, but if he makes you think a little bit along the way, that's o.k. too.The atmosphere of post-WWII Vienna is brought to vivid life with lots of location shooting amid bombed out buildings and rubble. This movie has some of the best black and white cinematography ever, shown to best advantage in the breathless race through the sewers at the film's climax. And of course, there's that glorious zither theme that recurs throughout the movie, which adds much to the funhouse tone of the film.The performances are flawless. Welles is great as mentioned. Cotten has almost never been better. Trevor Howard is urbane and witty and Wilfrid Hyde-White (you'll know him as Pickering in the film version of "My Fair Lady") is a hoot as a dotty Englishman (when he finds out that Holly came to Vienna to meet a friend who has shown up dead, his response is "I say, that's rather awkward.") Only Alida Valli disappoints. She's a vapid actress who delivers everything in a boring monotone, but in this case her acting style fits the character she's playing so well that it doesn't hurt the film.A fantastic film that I can watch again and again. Heartily recommended.Grade: A+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Third Man is the best film I've ever seen. All scenes memorable. So many lines will stay with me. A haunting film. The scene where Harry appears at the station is the start of an emotional journey. This is a timeless story of a search for a lost friend. The music of Anton Karras is essential to the mood.The words of Harry (Orson Welles): "In Italy for thirty years under the Borgias they had warfare, terror, murder, bloodshed - but they produced Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci and the Renaissance. In Switzerland they had brotherly love, five hundred years of democracy and what did that produce - the cuckoo clock!" are a great counterpoint to his earlier words in the ferris wheel and his disregard for human life: "You know, I never feel comfortable on these sort of things. Victims? Don't be melodramatic. Tell me. Would you really feel any pity if one of those dots stopped moving forever? If I offered you twenty thousand pounds for every dot that stopped, would you really, old man, tell me to keep my money, or would you calculate how many dots you could afford to spare? Free of income tax, old man. Free of income tax - the only way you can save money nowadays. The scene where Alida is about to depart on the train, leaving Holly, is a haunting reminder of betrayal: "They have a name for faces like that.."Watch the scene in the children's' hospital "They gave it some of Lime's penicillin...terrible shame..." without a twinge of compassion and you're not human!The closing scene where Anna walks past Holly Martins down the cemetery road is a signal of the betrayed and lost love.</fullReview>

Although Joseph Cotten, Orson Welles, Trevor Howard and Valli all acquit themselves well, this is definitely Carol Reed's movie and Graham Greene at his best.

I was expecting a great film. I wasn't disappointed.This is a classic piece of cinema. Brilliantly written by Graham Greene, the film presents the challenges of friendship and the weight brought to bear on people by the callousness and selfishness of others. Carol Reed's direction is outstanding and when his efforts are combined with those of Robert Krasker, the cinematographer, the films is produced with an exquisite look and feel. The moody lighting and breathtaking use of angles lend the film a superb brilliance in its look. Anton Karas compositions for the film and his use of the Zither are fantastic and give a wonderful second layer to the piece.The story, all though slightly slow to get into, is compellingly brilliant and its characters are brilliantly performed by the cast. Joseph Cotten is fantastic whilst his support from the wonderfully charming Orson Welles and the fantastically subtle Trevor Howard is delicious. Bernard Lee also shines in what is only a minor cameo.There isn't much more to say as the film is quite simply a sumptuous piece of cinema, brilliantly constructed.

The unique blend of creeping shadows and spectacular filming angles are one of the main standouts in the film.Rarely has a film had a better cast. Joseph Cotten is perfect in his role as Holly Martins. Orson Welles almost steals the whole show with his almost cameo like performance as the elusive Harry Lime.The story in the Third Man is intriguing and ultimately satisfying. It isn't the strongest point of the film, but is still admirable. The story is really just a basis for the excellent character interaction and dialogue on display.To conclude, the Third Man is an essential film, one that should be seen by everybody.

Recently i've been catching up on a lot of old films (Hitchcock, Boggart, Cagney, old musicals etc.) and due to their age even the great films date, thats in someways part of the charm a different style of dialogue and film making than todays films. But watching this film with the exception of the picture quality (i was watching and old VHS version) this film really could have been made yesterday. I just can't believe it was made back in the 40's it just seems so modern, i'm sure many of the techniques used are still being copied today.As has often been noted Welles is superb as Harry Lime and the cuckoo clock speech must go down as one of the greatest in cinema history. In some ways his performance as Lime even outdoes his role in Citizen Caine as he dominates the film with so little screen time. But the real star of the show is the depiction of a war ravaged Vienna all menace and shadow. The supporting cast are all superb and the musical score is one of the most memorable i've heard.One thing to note is how shocking this film must have been back only four years after world war II had ended. It's easy now to look back on this as a historical piece yet these characters were representative of real people at the time.I can't recommend this film enough, if you in anyway love film you should see this. It's not an ageing classic, its a truly timeless masterpiece.Rating 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the top films of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A beautiful coalescence of outstanding cinematography, career-defining acting prowess, and great scriptwriting. Every character actor turns in Oscar-caliber performances. Alida Valli is a match for Ingrid Bergman at her best. Joseph Cotton is a pleasure to watch. Neither actor reached this level before or again in their careers. Never has music so aptly suited a film's setting. The atmosphere is worth reveling in time after time, with several scenes that stick in the memory for a lifetime. A movie that most people will watch several times over. The Criterion collection DVD is very well restored, with interesting extras. Better than Citizen Kane on every front. Belongs in any film-buff's collection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cinematography alone makes this a must see</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all it's nice to see Orson Wells as something other than a bloated whale. He has a very small part in the movie but is fantastic as the morally bereft Harry Lime. Joseph Cotton has always been a favorite of mine and his naive optimism as the hack writer Holly Martins is perfect. The movie looks like a world class photography exhibit. There are so many brilliant moments with the cinematography that it's sometimes hard to notice anything else. The story is, of course, superb and I think this film lives up to it's "A Classic among Classics" stature. The final scene is shot with such artistic perfection that I had to keep rewinding the movie to see it over and over again. The score is amazing. A mandolin plays its strings throughout the movie and becomes the "fourth" man of the film. I want the soundtrack for my collection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Leave Death to the Professionals</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here, in one of the best movies ever made, is a story of three grown-up children, playing games of love, death and betrayal in the ruins of post-war Vienna. Holly, the naive and trusting American, a writer of pulp-fiction Westerns, who comes to Vienna to write publicity for his old friend's charitable work, only to discover that he has died under mysterious circumstances; Anna, a play-actress who can only bear to work in comedies, who loved Holly's friend, because he was full of life and fun; and then Harry, the cherubic, amoral, full-of-fun companion, who miraculously returns from the dead, chuckling softly at the suckers and the mugs and excusing the death and misery caused by his racket in black-market penicillin by murmuring, "the dead are better dead...they don't miss much here, poor devils..."Despite advice to "leave death to the professionals", Holly learns the truth of the mystery, the truth about Harry, about Anna, and ultimately, about himself. We share the journey with him and it is an unforgettable experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Judge33, I have attempted to answer your questions in the IMDb forum for this film:http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0041959/board/nest/12572575Suffice to say, it's my opinion that all the "problems" you've listed with the film's plot stem in fact from a misunderstanding of the plot on several key points (the penicillin racket, in particular).The Third Man is a beautiful film. It helped define the boundaries of film noir with its tilted camera angles, deliberate shadows, clever dialogue and unflinching observation of some of the worst parts of human nature.I recommend it thoroughly to anyone with an interest in old-school film noir.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must dismiss my bias, up front, by telling all of you that this is my all-time favorite movie. For me, it crystallizes the ultimate Hamletiam predicament, the tearing apart that occurs that when your best-loved best friend turns out to be a rotten scoundrel. An opportunistic person whose lust for wealth tramples on the medical needs of wounded soldiers, pregnant women and suffering children. This movie is filled with comic relief moments, but what makes it excel is the ultimate test of the moral dilemma. What do we choose, an amazingly and seductively appealing friend who happens to destroy lives with his greed, or an obnoxious bureaucracy that just happens to be morally right in this case?One comment on the moral cloudiness of the current generation. I would bet anything that more viewers side with Harry Lime, today, than against him...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A true classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the great classics and Graham Greene's best in this post WWII thriller. Too bad they don't make movies like this any more. I first saw it in 1949 and I am always glad to see it again. The music "The Third Man Theme" played on a zither is a classic in itself.The cast is superb although Alida Valli, an Italian actress who plays Anna in the movie was a virtual unknown outside of Europe. The filming of the movie is spectacular, especially in the sewers. Great directing.It is also a good movie for history buffs who get to see what it was like in occupied Vienna after the war, not only the views of the city but also of the relationships between the occupation forces.</fullReview>

He must be speaking to Lime, and when we see the men on the bridge in the distance, there are FOUR of them.The little boy and his moon face speak pure terror: and a child shall lead them to point out Martins as the suspected murderer.The henchmen chase Martins up the cylindrical staircase; he jumps into the first port in the storm, only to be bitten by a parrot. This is pure genius.The shadow of the man who approaches the cafe: "Balloon?" What he is doing there at that time of night, we cannot understand. Perhaps he is going home.Lime slyly opening the door to the Ferris wheel compartment, and those just-right Chocolate ladies in the Casanova Club. For another take on this film, read Philip Kerr's Berlin Requiem, where its making is a bit player in the hunt for Gestapo Muller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remarkable Film Noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WARNING: SPOILERS AHEADThere is no such thing as modern film noir movies? at best, there are homages - Chinatown, L.A. Confidential, De Palma's upcoming The Blue Dahlia, I should assume - that return to this era and pick up the classical elements - the femme fatale, the urban violence, the absence of the Law, the fatalism that goes through the characters' lives - and rework them with a modern edge. Then there are the neo-noirs, like Blood Simple or A Simple Plan, which modernise the setting and update the elements. Whether they're homages or neo-noirs, both types are conscious that they're producing something that resembles the classic film noirs. That's why there aren't true noirs anymore? over 40 years ago, Huston, Lang and Reed weren't a conscious, unified movement with their own manifesto explaining what film noir was? the similarities in elements can be attributed to a source of ideas produced during and post-WWII where each filmmaker went to find inspiration. It wasn't until this source dried up and the last noirs were produced, that scholars managed to isolate a time period and crystallise the limits of the genre.The Third Man is a noir that encapsulates pretty much everything that made the genre fascinating; it's both a mystery and a suspense movie, but it's also the character study of evil. The plot itself is pretty simple - like most noirs were - starting with a typical murder investigation? in this case, Harry Lime's, a high profile racketeer from the post-WWII Vienna's black markets? the police is only too happy to see him dead, so it's up to his friend, Holly Martins, to investigate what apparently was an accident but may be after a premeditated murder. Holly, like Sam Spade or Jake Gittes, is a man who doesn't know how he got himself mixed up in such strange affairs; he originally only came to Vienna after Harry offered him a job. His motivation is quite simple: Harry was a loyal friend, and Holly feels like he should return the loyalty by finding his killers. This is when the movie assumes tragic proportions. As he starts knowing Harry's friends, they all ask him to leave Vienna, as Harry wished it shortly before dying. The police want Holly out, too. If Holly had just taken this advice, many tragedies would have been avoided.However - and this is where the plot achieves genius - the mystery around Harry's death is only half of the movie. In one of the best uses of light and shadow in this movie, Holly sees a man under a darkened porch; he shouts out at this mysterious man, prompting a house light above him go on, lighting up the porch - and who we see is none other than Harry Lime (with an ultra-cool smile as only Orson Welles could pull off) who disappears before Holly can reach him. I think this was an intelligent idea, personally I'm not a ?whodunit' fan - I grew out of it some time ago - and it would have been a cheap trick to only show in the end that Harry faked his death? it would sound too much like all these modern thrillers that have no content and exist solely to provide a last-second twist to dazzle an audience in the hope they'll forget nothing happened for the past two hours. No, it was a good idea to reveal Harry halfway through the movie, for from there on the movie stops being a mystery to becoming a suspense movie, and suspense is usually more interesting, to me at least.The plot now concerns whether Harry will be caught or not by the authorities. Holly has been learning some things about Harry during his stay in Vienna - Harry is more than just a racketeer, he's responsible for the deaths of several people after adulterating penicillin which he then sold to hospitals. What can we ever really know about a person? Holly thought he knew Harry, but he was wrong. This new aspect of his persona leads Holly to work with the authorities to catch Harry. But how easy is it to catch a man who's faked his own death to remain free? A man like this has too much will to live, and it can only all end in a spectacular chase in the Vienna sewer channels, wherein Harry slowly becomes trapped until there's nowhere else to run to.The Third Man is a fascinating movie, exploring the delicacy of life, how little we know about people we think we know thoroughly, man's propensity to do both good and evil simultaneously, loyalty, and how the wish to do good can ultimately lead to a tragedy. This is a movie that explores life in all its complexity, and it gets a 10 from me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic Noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Carol Reed's `The Third Man' is a wonderful noir thriller from 1949 that tells the story of Holly Martins (Joseph Cotton) who arrives in Vienna to work for his old friend Harry Lime, but when he arrives at his apartment, finds out that he just died. He is about to head back to America when he is wrapped up in intrigue around his late friend, and discovers that everything that he knows about his friend isn't quite what it seemed. Not only does `The Third Man' feature two of my favorite classic film guys, Joseph Cotton and Orson Welles, but its story (by Graham Greene) is flawless and the cinematography/photography is first-rate. The night scenes are so incredibly lit and the use of shadows so brilliantly executed, that even upon repeat viewings, they are breathtaking. Additionally, I rarely comment on the score of a film, particularly in a review that is largely a brief summary, but the score by Anton Karas is absolutely phenomenal.There really isn't a whole lot that I can criticize about this film, because it is so well done. I highly recommend it to anyone who has not seen it yet.--Shelly</fullReview>

		<fullReview>do you guys think that anyone in the third man is truly innocent? and do the characters take advantage of the "innocent" people because innocence is a weakness? or is it because they are loyal and have morality etc, like martins? i am of the opinion that the porter is the character that is the most innocent, but then he did hide the truth from the police to protect himself... and then holly could be innocent, but going by one of the dictionary definitions of innocent, he is by no means foolishly trustful. and how do you feel about the ending, the anti-Hollywood factor, where anna walks straight past holly. that i feel was the only way to end the film. anything else would have been untrue to the story. also, i've seen 2 spellings of popescu- popescu and popesco. which is correct?? and one more thing... how good is the zither!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**SPOILERS HEREIN** You have been warned. At the beginning of The Third Man we are introduced to one of the main characters of the films, the city of Vienna. Vienna isn't the typical American, dark alley city. It isn't the understood labyrinth that shadows are gained and lost in, like in The Maltese Falcon. It is a different place, separated into four regions, and is so strange and beautiful that it almost seems like it's a person, viewing all of Holly Martins exploits but not being able to offer him any help. Holly Martins is a writer, not the Sam Spade type. Sam Spade would probably be the type of guy Martins would write about. He's a regular guy, with regular faults. You know his intentions from the very beginning. He doesn't even wear a hat. The mysterious woman isn't so mysterious. She tells us her thoughts, and she isn't lying. The twists of the movie aren't even twists. Martins investigation is so careful that he doesn't make too many assumptions and when he does, he is usually right. It hardly even matters what he is trying to investigate. The characters are so enjoyable, the cinematography is so ingenious, the music is so exciting, that the resurrection of Harry Lime just seems like an added treat. To Martins it hardly seems like such a surprise, he is relieved and disappointed at the same time, because his best friend is alive, but has been doing unthinkable crimes. Unlike Spade, Martins is actually somewhat connected to his investigation. And also unlike Spade, his love for the woman is never professed. Spade's connection to his desperate characters actually ends up being more than Martins. For Spade was forced upon the people's lives, and Martins intruded upon them. In The Third Man, Holly Martins walks into a hotel looking for his friend Harry Lime, and the porter tells him that he's `kapoosh.' That he's gone `to hell (as he points towards heaven), or maybe.. to heaven (as he points towards hell).' Harry Lime is also supposedly dead at the beginning of The Third Man. But he is discovered to be alive towards the middle of the movie. He has abandoned his lover, who was madly in love with him and completely crushed that he died (she called Holly, Harry). He led the world to believe that he has died, all to pull off a crime. He also is indeed dead by the end of the movie, but his character is a dead man before his body stops working. This raises the question: what does it mean to be dead? For Lime, embraced death so he could live better. He pulled off his own death and lived as a no one so as to pull off the perfect crime. It may not be until his beautiful attempt to escape true death in the labyrinth of the sewers that he realizes that, since he has embraced death prematurely, he may never be able to live again. Perhaps if while Lime desperately crawled to escape his best friend's `life' lesson, he realized that being dead is to ignore those who love you.  The Third Man is the most perfect film noir movies and one of the best movies period out there. With the compelling score of that exotic instrument, the angles, the shadows, the script, the characters, and the meaning, well... wow. The little boy with the ball accusing Holly Martins, the shadow of the balloon man on the wall, the unveiling of Lime when the cat cuddles against him, the meeting between Lime and Martins one the ferris wheel and the Cuckoo Clock speech, the chase through the sewers of Vienna, and the final scene in which the woman walks past Martins without even looking at him. Wow.My grade: 10/10</fullReview>

I can say that the final cemetery scenes stick in my mind as the most beautiful and effective rejection I have ever witnessed. A timeless classic of which I could never tire. How Orson Welles could so completely dominate a movie in which he occupied the screen for so few minutes, the superb sequencing on the giant ferris wheel, the haunting theme played on a zither and co-ordinated so beautifully with scenes of danger and tenderness, all combine in what I feel was Carol Reed's finest effort.

		<shortDescription>A Wellesian Influence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Third Man, directed by Carol Reed, is an excellent film set in post WW II Vienna that offers more than just a slight tip of the hat to Orson Welles style. High camera angles, dark shadows, great speeches by the characters all have a certain Wellesian feel to them. Make no mistake, this is a Carol Reed film, but comparing this to his other films (A Letter from Home, Odd Man Out and Trapeze to name a few) The Third Man has a distinctive style Reed had not used before or after.The story is one of an American pulp western writer, Holly Martins, wonderfully played by Joseph Cotton, coming to Vienna at the behest of his friend Harry Lime. Only problem is, when he arrives in Vienna Harry Lime is dead and Holly Martins has nowhere to go. Major Calloway (Trevor Howard) makes an attempt to befriend Martins and help him get back to the States. However, Martins has started asking questions about his friend's untimely demise and the answers don't seem to make sense. He launches his own investigation, questioning Harry Limes friends and work associates and the beautiful Valli, Harry's flame. Naturally, Martins can't help but fall for the sad beauty. He's like a schoolboy trying to prove his worth to her as he attempts to unfold the truth about Harry's death.There is a lot going on in this movie thanks to a tightly conceived story and screenplay by Graham Greene. It's not simply a story about Holly Martins bad luck and the search for the truth. Holly is also a stranger in a strange land, out of his league and in over his head. The military is involved because it appears Harry Lime was a black market racketeer. Another man has gone missing and one witness to the accident claims there was a third man at the scene when Harry died. As Major Calloway tells Holly Martins, `Death's at the bottom of everything, Martins. Leave death to the professionals.'Throughout the movie the tone is set for each scene by the camera. The camera towers over Holly Martins when he finds out Harry is dead, adding to his characters insignificance. Later hen we meet The Baron, one of Harry's friends we see him slightly off angle. The camera is used to enhance the tension or emotion of the scene, just as Welles would have used it. And when we finally see Welles, he steps from shadow, his face partially illuminated, the camera under him emphasizing his characters power.This is a beautiful film with fine acting by Joseph Cotton and Orson Welles. Lime's friends are all mysterious and vaguely dangerous, with the exception of Valli who is somewhat of an innocent. The Vienna location is perfect for this story as the city stands as a stoic participant in the film. And of course, there is the Zither music, adding ambience to each scene. There is humor, romance, tension and intrigue that are seldom blended in movies these days. It is a well-crafted film that leaves us thinking and remembering the characters long after it is over. I haven't seen a lot of Carol Reed's films, but what I have seen suggests that he crafted this movie carefully, with attention to detail and a slight nod to the style of Orson Welles.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the great black and white films of all time. The Story by Graham Green combines Romance, betrayal and detective together as people struggle into post war realities. Shot against the shattered remains of Vienna. One of moments in cinema when all the components add up to more than the sum. Daringly angled shots, against the ruins of grand houses add a wonderful and fitting backdrop as shattered humans play out their parts. The Zither of Anton Karas is perfect, one of those serendipitous moments that can not be repeated. Like Kubric's use of Straus for the first view of space in 2001, it is difficult to imagine any other music in its place. The final shot in the cemetery entrance is heroically long.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I bought this film after watching Citizen Kane for the first time, purely in order to see more of Orson Welles' acting (a fair enough reason, I think!) I hadn't really paid attention to anything else, so when Joseph Cotton appeared on screen, I was surprised but pleased, mainly because I recognised him from Citizen Kane as well. Over the next 100 mins or so he went on to prove himself one of the best screen actors I've ever seen, easily comparable with his co-stars: it's fair to say that Orson Welles dominates the film, but arguably Joseph Cotton dominates the screen. Add in to this Trevor Howard, an often overlooked but talented actor, and Valli, who is captivatingly melancholic, plus the absolutely brilliant final sequence, and you end up watching a great, great film. It's just a shame that the finest British film ever made dates back to 1949: couldn't we have gone on to even better things? To be honest, who cares: just sit down and watch this!</fullReview>

Is it important if a movie is the best or the 50th in any list ?The most relevant thing (in my opinion): a movie is a good one if I remain thinking on its story and its scenes for a long time after seeing it. It seems to be the case with "The Third Man".The highest points: a) in the final chase, the fingers on the street; b) in the child hospital, no child is seen. There's no need of it. It's good direction. c) the final scene, of course. If Anna had walked to Holly, we probably would not remember the end of the movie for a long time.No doubt: it's a very good movie.</fullReview>

I highly recommend this film to all film fans.I'd go as far as to say after one viewing its in my top ten favourite films its really that good. Peace.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow, outstanding film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first come by this film when my neighbor and I were discussing about film noirs. He asked me if I ever heard of The Third man and I say no. 4 months later, I saw it for first time.I was really blown away how Reed used the slant camera angle when Joseph Cotten is talking to the people. I love film noir genre and this one just blown me away. It show how ordinary guy can be sucked up in extraordinary situation and it has all essential for classic film noir. Dark, bleak lighting, story surrounded Cotten's character, femme fatale, many more.I plan to watch it over and over because it is just amazing film. Go check this out when you have a chance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE best movie ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently purchased the Criterion Edition DVD of this, by far my favorite film ever. The extra expense is well worth it. The movie looks and sounds better than I have ever seen it before. The plot can be quickly summarized: Holly Martins, a hack writer of westerns, comes to Vienna at the behest of his best friend, Harry Lime. He arrives just in time for Lime's funeral. After the funeral, Martins is liquored up by Major Calloway, a member of the four nation police force patrolling Vienna. According to Calloway, the late Harry Lime was involved in a black market penicillin racket. Holly decides to prove Harry's innocence, which leads him to Harry's girl, Harry's friends, and a shadowy "Third Man" who may or may not have been involved in Harry's death - and who, it turns out, may or may not be dead.But the plot is not what makes this movie so great - it is the plot of a very good thriller. The first thing that makes the movie so great is the way it toys with Holly. Holly enters the movie with romantic dreams about the world despite his low standing in it; ideals about honor, friendship, loyalty, love - and himself. Over the course of the movie, all of those romantic ideals will be cruelly and pitilessly ground into the dust before his eyes, culminating in a final scene that will resonate within you for years after. A friend of mine calls this movie the anti-Casablanca, and I think there's justice to that. While in Casablanca, nobility, friendship, loyalty to a cause, and love all win out in the end, here they are exposed as shams and comfort for suckers.The second thing that makes this movie so great is the visual look of the film, and how those visuals impact the story and our memory of it. Dozens of scenes and moments stay with me to this day; I can call up half the movie at will. Not just the ferris wheel scene and the crushing final scene, but:Dr. Winkle's ("V-inkle's") hand holding a carving knife and pausing over a roast fowl when Martins's name is announced.Anna slipping and calling Holly "Harry" - one of several times characters get someone's name wrong - most notably, of course, completely botching Joseph Harbin's name on the tombstone.A purring cat, a pair of shoes, an improbable shaft of light, and a knowing, caught red-handed smirk - the greatest entrance in the history of movies.A monstrous shadow evolving into a balloon salesman.A wild cab ride through the streets of Vienna, with Martins asking the driver if he has orders to kill him, only to find himself delivered up to a fate worse than death. ("Mr. James Joyce. Where would you place him?")A chase through the rubble of post war Vienna, being led by a boy who, God help me, looks exactly like the Sta-Puft Marshmallow man from Ghostbusters."A parrot... never mind."The whole chase through the gutter culminating in two hands reaching through a manhole screen and a last, barely perceptible nod from Orson Welles.Great dialog - mostly by Graham Greene, although Wells wrote his own, limited, dialog. Great acting, especially by Wells who is on screen for maybe five or ten minutes total, and has only a few lines and those mostly speeches, but dominates even the excellent performances by Joseph Cotton, Trevor Howard, and the impossibly luscious Alida Valli.Add to that the great directing, create cinematography (beautiful black and white! The invention of color photography is a mistake from which the movies have never adequately recovered) and the great zither music, there is nothing about this movie that is not completely memorable. Except the pronunciation of Calloway's name. Or is it Callahan....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Favorite moments (apart from the usual)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just a few notes on exceptional scenes, what's in them and what's not: 1) the ending, the framed shot that lingers for 50 seconds as Anna advances down the esplanade of the cemetery towards Holly and beyond; 2) the hospital scene: not a single shot of the children, but the tattered teddy bear was enough; 3) the wait for Harry to show in the cafe`: the close-ups of the faces of the military men waiting in ambush were straight out of Leni Riefenstahl's "Triumph of the Will" and with the same dramatic impact; 4) the total absence of sizzling sex scenes, profanity, &amp; gory violence (with one exception, none of the men killed is seen being killed, and in that one case there is no gore, only a quick hitting sadness); 5) and couldn't it have been just possible that Anna was wanted by the Soviets as a war criminal? Here's where Graham Greene's screenplay was strictly Cold War boilerplate: The Russians were necessarily the "bad guys," prepared to harbor a scumbag like Lime and persecute a sensitive soul like "Anna Schmidt" (maybe she'd been the lover of a high-ranking Nazi commander of a death camp and had shared in his sadistic delights). And, finally, the bozos in this column who disliked the music because it had an "Hawaiian sound" must have thought they were listening to Arthur Godfrey on the ukelele rather than Anton Karas' zither. Cold War boilerplate or not: 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

Easily ranks with Chinatown, The Maltese Falcon and Touch of Evil among the great film noirs of all time. Orson Welles leaves a lasting impression in his mere 3 scenes. Joseph Cotton is brilliantly restrained as the out of his depth American writer. Carol Reed's direction is magnificent.

		<fullReview>Dig that Zither music! The musical score makes this movie. The Third Man isn't as great as all the hype it gets, but it is an entertaining film. Alida Valli is a standout as Anna and Joseph Cotton is very good as Holly Martins. *****************Mild Spoilers Ahead*********************************The opening scene at the funeral near the beginning of The Third Man has something hauntingly memorable about it. There's also clever use of a cat involved in an eerie scene that reveals Harry Lime. The ferris wheel scene is absorbing. And of course there is the desperation of the ruthless and clever Harry Lime (Orson Wells) when he is chased in the sewer. And don't forget the ending with Anna (Alida Valli) walking along the road a second time just like an earlier scene. This film has many fine moments and it is well crafted. Carol Reed, the director, had a nice touch. I don't think the cinematography deserved a best Oscar, though. The film wasn't lit up enough in some scenes. Dark lighting is ok and realistic, but you can go so far that you miss much of the action.Then of course there is the zither music. It's wonderful.I rate this film a 9 out of 10. Very watchable, but I'm not sure it's a classic.</fullReview>

Who can forget Lime's words spoken from the top of Vienna's ferris wheel about being paid for stopping those "dots below" (people) from moving or his Italy &amp; Renaissance v Switzerland &amp; cuckoo clock comparison.

		<shortDescription>The Greatest British Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Third Man is a noir thriller set in postwar Vienna which tells the story of a couple of Americans trying to renew a childhood friendship in a foreign country after growing up to be very different people. Like all of Graham Greene's fiction, the film makes themes of betrayal, the loss of innocence, and the true difficulty of forming apparently simple moral judgements.Many people count this as their favourite movie, which is remarkable for a British film of the 1940s. It is just a very successful coming-together of many wonderful talents: Greene wrote a classic screenplay, Carol Reed's direction is inspired genius, and Orson Welles, Trevor Howard, Joseph Cotton and others contributed unforgettable performances. Anton Karas's theme music is legendary. The cinematography is stunning.You can become obsessed with this film, and if you do you will want to read Charles Drazin's excellent 1999 book "In Search of the Third Man". I also recommend the reviews by the eminent British critic Philip French, who has much of interest to say about the sources for Greene's screenplay.</fullReview>

It is a well made piece of work with beautiful photography, and some pretty darn good acting. To be honest, the movie got a little slow for until Orson Welles showed up, but I would get caught up in the more technical aspects of the film, and my interest was hooked again. Story wise it was good, but it just didn't grab me. I think that Welles' Lime is what stuck with me the most. In fact, the scene I remember best is when the light gets flicked on, and you see Welles in the alley for the first time. See it because it's a classic piece of film making.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can go on forever about how much I love this film. I saw the restored print of it in theaters a few years ago, and it was one of the great movie-going experiences of my life. Vienna looks beautiful in black and white. That scene on the ferris wheel is tremendous (As an aside, I've been on that very ferris wheel. Moreover, the same ferris wheel is used in a lovely scene in "Before Sunrise."). Trevor Howard is the ultimate in coolness. Valli is classically gorgeous. And after having seen the film, one would think Welles actually had more screen time. His character's name is said countless times before his late appearance. And Welles has such screen presence he usurps the film. Welles is my idol. Cotten has such a great voice. I love that Zither music. One can feel the cold dampness of the streets of Vienna. SPOILER!!!I particularly love that scene when Cotten discovers the porter is dead. And that little, devilish boy starts following him, along with everyone else.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everything and everyone around me seemed to beg me to see The Third Man. It is the all-time favorite movie of a couple film-buff friends of mine. It is the British Academy's #1 movie of all-time. It is praised to this day by every credible film professor and critic in the world. I finally got to see it on an old grainy tape on a small screen in my university's library media room.After the ending credits started rolling, I walked out of the library totally awestruck. The cinematography was perfect; it was as if Citizen Kane's revolutionary techniques were honed to an even more immaculate edge. The pacing of the plot was perfect; never once had there been either a boring moment or a break in the suspense. The characters are cleverly ambiguous and incredibly deep; no one is in the right or in the wrong completely. Harry Lime (Orson Welles) is one of the most haunting and vicious, yet at the same time one of the most charismatic characters I have ever seen on film. The dialogue is nothing short of intense wit and haunting wisdom (note Harry Lime's "cuckoo clock" speech).The Third Man is definitely a movie I plan to revisit again, and again, and again. I definitely can't claim to have caught everything this first time around, and there were many things that slipped over my head and wish to catch again. But when a film catches your complete admiration on first viewing and makes you want to revisit it over again, I'd say it is definitely a film worth catching if you can.10/10, and personally my 4th all-time at the moment (that could go up on subsequent viewings).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Modern World Is Melting Ours</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>&amp;#65279;The Third Man is one of the best movies of all time. It's a far cry from any other Noir film, ever. Alfred Hitchcock on his best day (North By Northwest) didn't even come within a million leagues of The Third Man. I read a review that had the nerve to compare The Third Man to The Usual Suspects! This would be a grand example of what movies today are doing to people. The reviewer who stated this said that they lost interest in The Third Man about half way through? What? Here is a film that puts it's audience in a trance the second Joseph Cotten enters the screen. In fact it's ONLY flaw was the seemingly pointless narration at the very start. The rest of the movie is perfect.The Third Man was perfectly shot, edited, directed, acted and told. The music stays familiar from the opening credits until the end. The score helps keep the movie from confusing itself, the score shows us that this movie had it's own personality and own flawless flaws. It lives and dies as it is. It doesn't try to put in songs of it's past, (the songs from the Billboard's Top Ten) that may make a feeling of nostalgia and confuse the viewer into believing they're watching a great movie, but are indeed being tricked with clever magic of the emotions. (i.e. Casino and the worst yet Forrest Gump). These movies aren't sure what they are, other than they are.Not mention, here is a movie that holds a climax of words and still finds the time to put one of the best chase scenes (if I can lower the standards of the film to say CHASE SCENE) at the end. A double climax? Yes, one for the high brows another for people who think Usual Suspects is a movie to compare other movies with. (If your wondering, I believe the "Coo-coo Clock Speech" is a definite climax).The Third Man is magic. Magic! MAGIC! There will never, in a million years be a better Noir movie than this. **** (out of ****)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is so good that I barely feel qualified to comment on it. I first saw it as a 7 year old in the early 50s and, although unable at the time to appreciate its full qualities, I remained strangely moved by it and have been haunted by it ever since. This is the only perfect movie ever made. I guess most of the great things about photography and charisma and zither theme and story have been said by people far more articulate than I. However, there are two points I would like to make. Firstly, the camera angles seem to be designed to preclude the viewer from ever being comfortable in involvement with what is not meant to be a comfortable story. Secondly, the ending is just perfect, but the scene just prior to the ending is even more so. Watch as Lime is trapped in the sewer and Calloway tells Martins to shoot him. Harry turns to Holly and gives an almost imperceptible nod, and Holly pulls the trigger. Now that has some impact!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Something special for this occasion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would like my 50th user comment to celebrate a rather special film, so what better than a thanksgiving for "The Third Man". It would go something like this...."'I never knew the old Vienna before the war with its - 'what?" "What city is next mentioned?" "'That's a nice girl that. But she ought to be careful in Vienna....' Who is speaking and what is the next line?" "'Mr Martins, what author has chiefly influenced you?' How does he reply and what is the response?"...And so it would go on. Time - circa 1950; place - a grammar school North-West of London; speakers - a group of 6th formers during a school break testing each other's knowledge about their latest cinematic discovery. If we had known the term "cult film" in those days "The Third Man" would have been ours. We were just a little too young to have been affected by "Casablanca", "The Maltese Falcon" or "The Big Sleep" and "Citizen Kane" did not really become known in this country until way after it was made. No, "The Third Man" was ours and I still think it as light-years away from the others I have mentioned in quality. We saw it on every available occasion and it was not long before I had chalked up ten viewings. Imagine my excitement when I was staying with my French exchange partner and he suggested we go to a cinema in Angers to see "Le Troisieme Homme". It was great sharing it with him and his mother and as I almost knew the dialogue by heart by then, I understood every word. in spite of my limited French. Just a few reflections many years on about a work that has been part of my experience for almost as long as I can remember. I could go on at great length about those tremendous set-pieces, Harry Lime's appearance in the doorway, Holly Martin's disastrous performance at the literary meeting, the ride on the Ferris wheel and the sewer chase, but it has all been said before. In any case visual and dramatic bravura alone do not make for greatness. "The Third Man" is a masterpiece because it states, or rather understates, some most perceptive things about the human condition. It is really a film about unrequited love. In a work where chases predominate it is the pursuit by Holly Martins for the affection of Anna Schmidt, Lime's lover, that is at the real heart of things. It is impossible to understand human chemistry, why Anna should be attracted to the amoral and ruthless Harry rather than kindly Holly who wants so much to give. But then there is an even greater irony inasmuch as Holly too is drawn to Harry; after all they have been friends since boyhood. When Harry is finally cornered it is Holly who pulls the trigger that puts him out of his misery, like an act of kindness to a wounded beast. Carol Reed was at the height of his powers when he made "The Third Man", but he still had something almost as great to give before his slow decline. Perhaps I shall save the wondrous "Outcast of the Islands" for my hundredth offering.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Movie--But Don't Watch it for the Wrong Reasons</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching the film, I looked over its reviews and I was not surprised by the vast divergence of opinion concerning it. It doesn't meet the expectations that many have for a movie. While I side with those that think the movie is great, I think many of the people who loved it praised it for the wrong reasons. This is not a movie with a "gripping" plot or characters you will remember for the rest of your life (and yes the zither music would seem out of place if you're seeking pathos). But to criticize the movie for those reasons (as many reviewers did) seems like criticizing "Ulysses" for being a little slow-going. Everything in the movie is DESIGNED to create the utmost emotional detachment for the viewer. Examples include the zither music, the dispassionate and unsympathetic characters, the lack of concern demonstrated by the protagonist concerning his danger (denying the viewer real suspense), the absence of "preaching" about the horrors of post-War Europe, the refusal to show the film's climax, and shots that make you want to look at the architecture rather than the people. Thus, despite the fact that film's story is depressing in the extreme, the persistent mood of the film is a satisfying mixture of melancholy, amusement, and cheerfulness. The effect, made possible by its detachment, provides a proper emotional seeting to contemplate the aesthetics of the movie's superb cinemeotraphy. In conclusion, if you're looking for thrills or even deep thoughts, don't watch this movie. But if you want a cheerfully detached work of art, this is the movie for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When the Criterion DVD came out I bought this movie. I think I remember seeing bits and pieces of it many years ago when I was a little kid. I watched the original trailer for this movie. At first I was a little worried. Anton Karas' rough sounding zither was not what I imagined a movie like the Third Man would have for its theme. It is funny how trailers have evolved just over the past 20 years. I had calmed myself down and prepared to watch this film with an open mind. I had read so many reviews of this movie and heard the praises. So many said that even though it was made in the late 40's it had a look and feel of a film of the late 50's to early 60's. They were right. This movie kept my attention and played with my imagination all the way to the end. It is also funny to look at the scene when Harry Lime is revealed for the first time and to remember standing in that same spot in Vienna at 16 so many years ago and not know why your crazy German Teacher is going nuts and taking pictures. Also at the end I had realized that my initial judgement of Karas' zither was incorrect. It helped define the movie and especially Orson Welles' Harry Lime. This movie is film-noir at its best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As we all know, Citizen Kane is often lauded "Greatest Film of All Time". Whilst I would never dispute this, keep in mind that "Best" doesn't mean the same as "Favourite". Kane is influential, important and is required viewing for anyone with even a cursory interest in film. However, it can be a difficult watch if your not in the right mood. The Third Man, on the other hand, is a joy from start to finish. From the (perfectly) cast to Robert Krasker's outstanding cinematography, the film persists in staggering me every time. Technically speaking, The Third Man is on a par with Citizen Kane and rarely gets the credit for it. The reason for this is simply because, whatever skill,craft and/or effort was displayed for the film, it is unobtrusive. All the composite elements (photography,design,editing etc) seem so perfectly suited to eachother, to the point where they're rendered almost "invisible". However, whilst watching Citizen Kane, you're always conscious of it being such a (staggeringly) well put together film. Which seems, to me, to run counter to the whole "Magic of Cinema" thing. The "Magic of Cinema" thing being where you can let go and enter the world you're being presented with. Which becomes increasingly more difficult, the more you're aware of the technicalities of filmaking, however impressive they may be. So, sit back and enjoy quite the finest example of "Romantic Thrillers"........ The Third Man. My favourite film, though not necessarily the best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The perfect film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What can I say? I guess it's summed up with the Zither music of Anton Karas, playing as the credits roll. The simple theme will stay in your head for days after you've left the theatre, one detail that's so light and fun you can't help but be charmed. So it is with every other detail of the film, actors with 5 lines seem like fully fleshed characters, and setpieces as simple as a sewer entrance are exotic little touches that make postwar Vienna seem almost like an alien world. Unlike the "classic" films of the last 20 years, The Third Man has no opinions on god, or death, it has no broad message, it's just a story. Just a single, luminous, story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was lucky enough to have picked it out in a video store years ago knowing nothing about it (I was going through a Welles phrase at the time). The film blew me away, and the recent restoration of the British version (not the David O. Selnick-cut American version) is better still. I just finished reading a fantastic book on the making of the film called "In Search of the Third Man" by Charles Drazin, and the collaborative story behind the film is just as fascinating.In short, this is a film for *adult* tastes, and especially for people who like morals that are gray, rather than black and white. A beautiful, perfect film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I cannot fault this film - it has an intriguing and exciting story, excellent acting, stunning photography and imaginative direction. See it on the big screen if you can - you will not be disappointed.However, this is one of those films that suffers from commentators who seem determined to spoil the plot for those that haven't seen it - just so that they can drone on about "classic cinema scenes" (yawn).Part of the special appeal of The Third Man is the mystery that it so deftly constructs &lt;I won't say anymore&gt;. Even so called "top critics" will think nothing of spoiling this for you - telling you things that the film makers intended only to be revealed to you at the right time.If you haven't had the film spoiled for you yet, don't read ANY more reviews - just watch the film - and fast.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why did I wait so long to watch this film? Only the Lord knows. But what I saw made me find peace: I now know what my favorite film is. I'm sure of it! Before, I toyed around with the ideas of "Breakfast at Tiffany's" (1961) or "Random Harvest" (1942), but now I know that I have been waiting to fall in love with "The Third Man" all my life. The cinematography, script, acting, editing, sound, production design--all superb. Need I go into why? It was like the gods decided to let all of those Hollywood elements fall into place perfectly so that the ultimate film could be made. As a big romantic film buff, my first question after the film was naturally, "So, do Martins and Schmidt get together?", but that was immediately drowned out by, "Oh my God, what a film!" thoughts filling my head. I really started loving it the moment the different establishing shots of Vienna started flashing. Some of the editing there reminded me of editing in films that were released within the past two years--surely, "The Third Man" was the originator! Joseph Cotten made a smashing heartthrob and a hero when I saw him in "Gaslight" (1944), and he continues in that status in this film. I thought that Valli was striking in "The Paradine Case" (1947), but she *really* shines here. And that first shot of Orson Welles, when the light in the upper bedroom window flashes on and he smiles that subtly diabolical smile--you just know that no one else could have played it the way that he did. Forget "Citizen Kane" (1941) for now. Really, do. He is my favorite here. The DVD from the Criterion Collection is a must-own. I will order it first thing tomorrow morning. The only gripe that I have is that there is no suitable soundtrack...I really want Anton Kara's zither music. It really is totally unique, and fits eerily AND romantically well in this film. Surely director Carol Reed's move to use only the zither music as the primary soundtrack was exemplary, leading to the similar use of one primary artist in such films as 2000's "Finding Forrester". There is a unity and special quality that such soundtracks lend to films, and Reed started it. The feel of this film is what films like 1999's "The Talented Mr. Ripley" aims to recreate. Will it ever happen? I highly doubt it. But until it does, "The Third Man" will fill a warm space in our hearts, and I am not one to complain.Now if you'll excuse me, I must go search for that soundtrack.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greene's strange, uneasy Catholicism (he was never quite sure whether he was Catholic, or atheist, or a sensualist cum socialist cum Catholic-fellow-traveller) is vividly evident in this movie. Without his rather pessimistic brand of Catholicism he could never have seen the shabby huckster Harry Lime as an almost-hero or the equally shabby faithless hack Holly [Rollo] Martins as an almost-angel-avenger. Harry believes in God, "in mercy and all that" while Holly is an agnostic alcoholic indifferentist; in the end it is Lime who gives Martins permission to kill him.This is a profoundly religious movie, and could only have been made, as it was made, on the bleak dark edge between faith and atheism.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ever since I was a boy I can remember my mother commenting on the end of the film with the words " ooh grandad hates the end with Orson Welles' hands poking throogh the drainhole". Sorry Mum and Grandad, I love this film despite the corny ending. Everything about it is masterly - the pace never lets up, the suspense likewise and there are some wonderful set pieces, even more so when you consider that the clever mr Welles wrote the "cuckoo clock" speech himself. The settings are drab and austere and into this world steps our hero Holly Martins played by my all time favourite actor, Joseph Cotton. Why doesn't he make more of a play for the girl in the same way as he doesn't give chasing the elusive Lime? This only becomes apparent after watching the film a few times because initially you realise she is besotted with the black marketeer Lime. All the supporting roles are superb - even down to the snotty little kid who puts the finger on Martins. There are darkly suspicious European characters drifting in and out of the scene and a very dodgy "little dawg", as Cotton refers to it. You really build an affinity with Lime even though he is a criminal mastermind and into very dodgy dealings and it is a shame that it has to end in tears, in a sewer of all places - well, where do you expect rats to end their days?? Perhaps the star of the show is Trevor Howard playing a laconic army official who seems rather weary of the whole nonsense. The punch on the nose from his sergeant is most probably what Howard ordered for the loud American nuisance! Don't miss this one - I put it on when there's nobody else around the place and escape into that monochrome world of postwar Vienna. Who needs pearl Harbour or Bridget Jones??</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inspiring Cinematic Purity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A classic tale of suspense and intrigue set in post WWll Vienna, `The Third Man,' directed by Carol Reed, stars Joseph Cotton and Orson Welles. Looking for work, American pulp fiction novelist Holly Martins (Cotton) arrives in Vienna to accept a job he has been offered by his old friend, Harry Lime (Welles), who he has not seen in many years. But Martins is greeted at his hotel-- not by Lime, as he had expected-- but with the news that Lime is dead, having been hit by a truck two days earlier. Arriving in time for the funeral, where he takes note of those in attendance, Martins afterwards makes the acquaintance of a select few who knew and were involved with his old friend, Harry, beginning with a representative of the authorities, a certain Major Calloway (Trevor Howard). Lime, it seems, was a wanted man, connected with some nefarious dealings on the black market. Initially, Martins is skeptical, but it's only the beginning of the mystery that is about to unfold about him. In talking with those who knew Lime best, especially those present at the time of the accident, Martins begins to notice some inconsistencies in their accounts of what happened that day. And the one discrepancy that bothers him the most is that in the official report, two men were said to have carried Lime-- just after he was hit-- from the street to the sidewalk, still alive at that point; but an eyewitness Martins uncovers claims that, not only was Lime killed instantly, but that another man-- a third man-- helped carry him. So the mystery begins; the report says two men were with him when he died, and heard his last words. A reliable witness, however, puts someone else at the scene. And Martins realizes that therein lies the key; that to find out what really happened to Harry, he must learn the identity of the third man. Working from the exceptionally well written screenplay by Graham Greene, Reed rivals the best of Hitchcock with this richly textured, stylistic offering. The mystery begins to mount with the opening narration (by Reed in the British version, by Cotton in the U.S.)-- delivered in a conversational tone that is in itself unique compared to the usual cinematic narrative form-- and the tension-filled suspense begins to build from the moment Martins arrives, and is maintained by Reed until the denouement. And-- in a sense--beyond, right up until the final frame of the film. Outstanding performances, combined with the stark black &amp; white photography (for which cinematographer Robert Krasker won an Oscar)-- enhanced by Reed's artistic handling of the camera and his use of light and shadows-- as well as the zither-driven score by Anton Karas, makes this one of the most memorable mysteries ever filmed. Cotton delivers a brilliantly understated performance as Martins, which provides a solid foundation upon and around which the mystery surrounding Lime develops. And though Lime is afforded little actual screen time as Martins assembles the bits and pieces he's uncovered through his investigation, his enigmatic presence is felt in every scene as if he were there. When he does appear, Welles embodies him in such a way that the mystique of this man that has been so cleverly and acutely developed is effectively maintained. Welles, in fact, with his naturally dominating countenance was the perfect choice to play Lime, and he certainly delivers. His few scenes with Cotton, especially one that takes place on a ferris wheel (which offers a telling perspective into Lime's character), are the most memorable of the entire film.  Cotton's performance, however, is the real thread that holds it all together, and as Martins, he demonstrates his generosity as an actor; for it's that `regular guy' persona with which he imbues his character, that insures the emergence of Welles' Lime as so larger-than-life. The same can be said, as well, for the effectiveness with which the mystery of the woman in Lime's life, Anna (Alida Valli), is established. Again, Martins becomes the sounding board through which Valli's character reverberates so convincingly. Her performance is strong, but her interaction with Cotton allows her Anna to shine all the more brightly. It's a perfect example of having all the elements that go into the making of a film working together to produce a true classic in every sense of the word. The supporting cast includes Paul Horbiger (Porter), Ernst Deutsch (Kurtz), Erich Ponto (Dr. Winkel), Siegfried Breuer (Popescu), Hedwig Bleibtreu (Old Woman), Bernard Lee (Sergeant Paine) and Wilfrid Hyde-White (Crabbin). Intelligently conceived and written, and imaginatively and creatively delivered, `The Third Man' is a masterpiece that works on every conceivable level. The purity of the film is inspiring; the integrity of the story is never compromised in any way by the sensationalism or cheap gimmicks that seem to plague even the best of today's offerings-- the fact of which many contemporary filmmakers would be well advised to take notice. In the final analysis, this is simply a truly exceptional film; one that belongs in the library of every serious collector. I rate this one 10/10. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great British Noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Beware: Spoilers Ahead!One of the four or five best British films - a tribute to the hard-boiled, cynical Hollywood films of the previous two decades from a thoroughly weary England reflecting ruefully on its reduced circumstances - and the swaggering brashness of its erstwhile ally.To start with, it's no thriller. The only thriller taking place is the one in Holly Martins's head. A shoddy piece of hack-work, full of improbabilities, loose ends, lack of motivation. (The average Hollywood product of today, in fact!)Everyone else is in the real world, half-listening to Martins's childish ramblings, until they get tired and shut him up.Go through the list of characters, and ask yourself who they really are - as opposed to Martins's paint-by-numbers interpretation.A 40 year old Major, several years after the War, stuck in a hell-hole like Vienna? A hefty Swiss bank account, one suspects, is the explanation.And Anna: her view of ?love' will no doubt have been conditioned by the innumerable times she had been raped (or had prostituted herself ) to stay alive, escape Czechoslovakia - or get Popescu to come across with the fake passport.Crabbin clearly knows as much about culture as Martins. He reeks of espionage. (In what language, I wonder, would his severe-looking female companion remonstrate with you if you pinched her behind?)And Lime himself - for whom exactly is he working? It would be essential for Western intelligence to have people in the Russian sector - black marketeer was a better cover than most - might even make the operation self-financing!The penicillin racket seems too much a crime ?du jour' - like identity theft, say, today. The ?evidence' montage (fingerprints and so forth) underlines that Martins wouldn't understand what he was being shown. Would want to believe his friend, if bad, was at least involved with something novelistic.And one doubts whether the identity of bodies could be quite as easily switched as the ostensible story would require, without some official help.(Incidentally, on the front of both of Anna's passports, ?Autriche' is misspelt....)The real story, such as it is, is Martins blundering, and everyone else trying to keep out of his way. Or get him out of the city altogether.The point of the film, though, is entertainingly to contrast the naive, boorish, ignorant - and boring - ?white hat' (by the time the light falls on Welles' face in that blind doorway, we are looking at our watches) - with the savvy, cool, witty and clubbable villain: much to the latter's advantage.(Of course, Martins is not only a bore: his crass stupidity gets those who help him killed: the porter, and the Sergeant. And his motormouth results in Anna not taking her train to freedom.)Lime, in the famous Prater wheel scene, is speaking for the Court, much in the same way as the Claude Rains character in ?Mr Smith Goes to Washington'.His mockery of the high tone of governments is precise - as is the context. In a city thoroughly bombed about, we are invited to consider the ?dots' on the ground from the bomb-aimer's viewpoint. At a time when the Nuremberg trials were fresh in the memory, he points up just how cheap life was held by ?our' politicians, for all their fine words.The technical means employed are delightful in themselves. The (deliberately) absurdly expressionistic photography of Krasker - more dutch angles than regular ones - expresses Martins's point of view as an uncomprehending stranger. There are what I take to be sarcastic references to the product of Nazi cinema - the low-angle shots of people out in the street, and the close-ups of the fat woman serenaded in the restaurant by Kurtz's violin, recall Jewish caricatures.And the music. I suspect that the Vienna Philharmonic and Stadtsoper were back in operation by the time in which the film is set. But a philistine like Martins would remember only the zither-music. Just like in ?Brief Encounter', the music is not background, but a star deserving equal top billing.It often defies convention, crashing mood, not enhancing it. (In the first cemetery scene, the cheery new variation which comes just after Calloway has told Martins that Lime is the deceased, for instance.) Or it goes completely over the top - as when, in Anna's dressing-room, Martins first realises that Lime's ?death' might not be an accident. The music is a constant reminder to the audience to avoid a superficial reading of the film.And it makes the truly delicious final scene possible. The look of utter, bone-tired disgust on Calloway's face as he starts up his jeep, leaving Martins to it. The steady, unyielding walk of Anna up to the camera and out of shot frame right, leaving Martins completely up the creek and looking as stupid as he really is.The moral: Anna may have been had by half the undesirables of Central Europe - but she has more dignity than to spend one more minute in the company of this contemptible specimen!More broadly, the film invites us to look at the particular quality of American naivety in political life, at home and abroad. Typified by periodic monomaniacal moral crusades - ?abolition this minute' versus ?slavery for ever', Prohibition, various Red Scares - which usually come with a hefty price tag.The making and release of the film covers the period of the ?loss' of China and the start of the Korean War (and hence the US post-War Asian adventure). One might reflect that a few more Limes on the case, and correspondingly fewer Martins, might have saved a whole load of grief!In short, the more you watch the film, the more you think about it, the more historical context you give it - the deeper and smarter it gets. Which qualifies it as truly a work of art.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like a lot of commentary posted here, I think Carol Reed has made a master work. The focus of most critics and scholars seems to be on Welles and Cotten as the main actors, but rarely has a movie had such a perfect supporting cast. Trevor Howard and Bernard Lee are beautiful to watch, as recognizable as cops anywhere on earth. Valli is coolly stunning, and very carefully shot by Krasker for maximum use of her eyes and mouth for conveying emotions that are subtly erotic and hungry at the same time. Only Louise Brooks was better at looking natural while smoldering. Even the little parts by obscure actors are excellent. A lot of the visual clues are nifty as well - the slicing of a juicy duck at a time of suffering for others, the hungry-looking whores at the bar where Holly is watching the the erotic dancer, (a very adult scene for that time!), and the cat who loved Harry Lime. I also noticed some people feel the book was better. It was a little different, still excellent, but this story was a screenplay from the beginning. I saw this back-to-back with "Lady From Shanghai" once, and I was unable to look at modern movies the same after that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>TIME OUT's Readers Top One Hundred place The Third Man 15th, and the filmmakers' Centenary poll only 49th, but for my money this must rank among the handful of truly great, perfect films of all time.A memorable script by Graham Greene, director Carol Reed at his best, inspired noir photography from Robert Krasker, and that famously irresistible zither music from Anton Karas added to what must be Orson Welles' most haunting role. Although he doesn't appear in person until fairly late in the film, his character, Harry Lime, pervades practically every scene. Joseph Cotten may appear an unusual choice to play the American Innocent Abroad, but he is ideal as the man from the New World who is completely out of place in the Old. And Alida Valli is also perfectly cast as the world weary refugee, stateless, obsessed and vulnerable. The film grips from the start, but builds up to an exciting and frenetic climax with the justly famous chase through Vienna's sewers. And that ending... Apparently Graham Green had proposed a happier ending, however the famous final long shot, with Cotton waiting at the side of the road, and Anna walking towards him down the cemetery road through its litter of fallen leaves... is an image that has kept with me ever since I first saw this, perhaps most favoured of favourite, film. A footnote: if you enjoyed this film, try to catch the film Reed made immediately prior to it, "The Fallen Idol".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>NOTES ON THE THIRD MANThe Third Man -- it's Freud! it's Kafka! it's Hitchcock! It's Conrad! It's Fellini! It's Nietzche! It's Machiavelli! It's all the above and more: it's Orson Welles... and the Notes on the GREATNESS of THE THIRD MAN.Two's company, three's a crowd. The title hints of a character who has surpassed the ordinary; who has defied conventional restraints; an outsider; a modern Kurtz [Heart of Darkness]. No coincidence that a sinister, cynical Kurtz actually exists in the film.Of what is Lime guilty anyway? How guilty is he? What has he done? Does it even matter? For a long time, he is nowhere in sight. We don't know where he is, if he even exists, or if the terrible rumors about him are true. So why do we so desperately want to meet him and hear his side of the story? We begin to identify with this mystery man, we want to side with him.Only one thing is certain as the story unrolls: Harry Lime has gone too far and he must pay the price. Joseph Cotten plays an artistically-compromised American writer, who is too naive -- in his charming American way -- to realize it. Can he even begin to offer the insight and integrity needed to evaluate Lime's guilt or innocence, the evidence we long to disavow? Then there is Harry's American girlfriend. She is depressed by Harry but is mentally loyal to his "memory." TouchPointsThe transcendently evil character to whom a genuine, yet inexperienced character is inexplicably and irrevocably drawn through a long, convoluted journey toward absolute darkness. (Conrad)Vienna, the city of intellect, intrigue, and ambition with its dark streets, gothic shadows and subterranean sewers providing the ultimate metaphor for the mind (Freud) Life as a dizzying carnival of dizzying perceptions of good and evil, sin and salvation, and the relentless need to make choices. (Fellini)The investigation of murder, and the subsequent surprises, secrets and thrills that unveil character and motive. The use of creative sound, light and cinematography to embroil the viewer in the hunt. Tall buildings and dizzying heights. The propensity to fall from grace. (Hitchcock)The presumption of guilt as a foundational assumption of modern life. The chaos, frustration, loneliness and deep fears occasioned by endless and inescapable and endless bureaucratic and architectural webs, mazes, and tangles. (Kafka)This is certainly one of the top ten films of all time -- if not, in fact, number one. It's complexity continues to fascinate, amaze, entertain, awe. It is perfect. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Forget Citizen Kane, This is the best movie ever made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whilst Citizen Kane impresses with it's audacity, it has no heart or soul. The Third Man quietly shows Orson's ego trip how it should be done ( and so for that matter does A Touch Of Evil ). Robert Krasker's sublime camera work is still to be marvelled at, including,as it does, some of cinema's most unforgettable images.The lighting on this film is just sheer poetry;shapes,shadows and style. The opening titles with Anton Karas' zither music sets the scene for the masterpiece that follows,from the opening line of " I never knew the old Vienna..." to the heartbreaking final two minute scene when the beautiful Alida Valli silently walks past Joseph Cotten in the cemetery while the zither music winds up the tension like a clock spring. There is just no excuse not to reach for the kleenex and have a good weep. There is nothing in this film that can be improved. The script is packed with great lines, the cast ( of mostly obscure international bit-part actors )aren't allowed to detract from the power of the film. The direction is so tight that in places it seems as though the scenes are being ad-libbed. Orson Welles has been justifiably credited for his mesmeric performance as Harry Lime, his first appearance as the window light crosses his face as he stands in the shadow of a doorway still makes the hair stand on my neck. There is no comparable scene in all of cinema. It is a brilliant moment that has been imitated but never bettered. If you have never seen this film you are missing out on what is an object lesson in perfection, every child should watch this film instead of Star Wars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is great. This film is great because it had to be - simple. Everything that you can know about this film leads it to be more intriguing, but even watching it without knowing anything of its history it still fascinates and judging from all these comments that people keep on seeming to write it continues to cause the greatests divides since the invention of long division. Basically it is a film about a racketeering spy, whose faked death rouses an old friend into searching for the true answers. There are many different ways to interpret it further as discussed in other comments here, however I see it as a discussion of duality - between loyalty and betrayal, between the disgust for what Harry does and the need for him to continue, the public minded reporter of Cotten and the secret reports of the spies... all carried on across the divided war-torn city of Vienna, halfway between the polar opposite philosophies of her conquerors at the crossroads of Europe and at a time when the future still hung in the balance.The contributions from all sides too, are to the utmost imaginable. Sir Korda, from his own Eastern European stock (and presumably not without pressure from his adopted countryland's government) and acquaintance of such characters in this region and period, as well as Greene (whose personal family history is full of British spies, not to mention his own dubious double-treble -whatever- actions) were able to draw upon their own knowledge to bring together a tale that can only be as close to the truth as the cinematography would allow us to believe. Welles and Cotten reunite the Mercury Theatre in classic roles subtly played with lines such as the famous "cuckoo-clock Borgia" text - penned by Welles himself? (and not to be improved upom until paraphrased in The Long Good Friday, substitute Cuckoo-clock for Hamburger and Swiss for American - see!). As well as, whether loved or hated, as both are, the cinematography of Krasker and score of Karas (in the days before soundtrack albums directed at specific market segments - so please have patience!) gelling fitting or not, they are undeniably memorable.So what exactly did this leave us to credit Reed with, except the task of bringing this all together in his image and the overlapping contributions to be controlled, so that it would be a picture that lasts (as it has) and remains in the mind as those images of the non-touristic Vienna and Harry and the sound of the Zither do.This was a film that could only have been made at this time and should be remembered as such, since even as the producton was coming to an end the city (and world in which this Vienna was formed) was changing around them, as the piles of rubble diminished.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not wholly perfect...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just finished watching the "Criterion Collection" DVD of The Third Man, which is a glorious remastered print containing a multitude of extras. This was the first time I had ever seen the Third Man and I can honestly say that I have many conflicting feelings about it. For its cinematic accomplishments, I have to give it an 8/10. Its beautifully haunting scenes of post-war Vienna still remain clear in my mind. It truly does not seem like a film from 1949 in this aspect. However, it is considered to be the greatest "suspense thriller" of its kind, and it is this aspect that I highly disagree with. I never felt a sense of suspense or impending danger throughout the movie, and as far as suspense is concerned, it is no match for any of the great Hitchcock gems, or say the Manchurian Candidate. If you are expecting a suspensful thriller, I doubt you will find it here. In my humble opinion, a major reason for the lack of suspense, is the use of the ever present sounds of that damned zither. While it is an interesting choice of instruments to use, I don't feel that it is appropriate or effective. I found it to be hugely annoying and if there was a way to mute it I would have. It did not supplement the mood or action of the story in any way and constantly seemed to be out of place. A major disappointment here. Thank God they chose to leave it out during the final sewer chase, as it would have destroyed this wonderful scene. There are movies that I give 8-10/10 that I absolutely loved and fully enjoyed, and then there are others that I have to give high marks because they are great films, but I did not wholly enjoy. This is the case with The Third Man. Cinematically, it is perfect. However, I don't feel that the whole package was so. I would welcome any or all comments regarding this movie and would love to hear others feelings regarding the zither!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Orson Welles's performance as the charming but sinister Harry Lime is the best feature of this intelligent, atmospheric drama. His entrance is an unforgettable scene - the "late" Harry Lime is caught in a spotlight on a dark Viennese street. As we watch, his expression changes from jaunty arrogance to quivering fear. Later, as he rationalizes his crimes for Martens (Joseph Cotten) during a Ferris wheel ride, he is the epitome of post-war cynicism. The relationship between Welles's and Cotten's characters in this film reminded me of their roles in "Citizen Kane", where Cotten has to state the truth or remain loyal to a friend. Other images remain with me after viewing - the loud-mouthed little boy accusing Martens of murder, the old balloon seller appearing out of the night, and the eerie, hypnotic zither music forever in the background. Finally, the climactic chase scene through the sewers of Vienna is one of the most striking black-and-white sequences this side of "Potemkin."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What is it about this magnificent little film? The great director? Its brilliant writer? The haunting music? Those amazing lines?I don't think so. None of these elements can fully explain the love that film goers have for The Third Man. Like the best meals, or your greatest love, disseminating its parts only erects a superstructure of appreciation, after that you're on your own. Perhaps greatness really is in the eye of the beholder and that despite rather than because of its parts, an ordinary man can still see a magic in bleak, post-war Vienna. With a gun to my head I'd say the film's power, like many other great films, lies in its atmosphere. From the opening lines to the final leaf fall, you are immersed in a dark world of subterfuge and betrayal. Each scene copied by awestruck directors over the years until every flashing face or angled lens seems like an homage to The Third Man. Never has a fair ride held so much menace, never has a walk through the trees hidden so much emotion. The first time I heard Valli say `There's not enough for two laughs.' I realised I had discovered the best film ever made. Twenty five years later, I still feel the same.</fullReview>

Orson Welles is amazingly the star of the movie, even though he is hardly ever seen--his off-screen presence as mysterious Harry Lime is that great. The plot has twists and turns, and the public is generally kept in the dark. I do not know who Anton Karas was, but he created one of the best music scores to any movie I have ever seen--and what instrument is he using anyway?Watch that movie, enjoy it, and read more books by Graham Greene ...

		<shortDescription>Menacing Presence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This evening I have finally watched a film that I have always wanted to see- The Third Man. To me it lived up to my expectations. The first thing I loved about this film was the composition of shadow/light and the actors. They dared to show things not in their most pretty way, but in their most desperate form. It allows us to really feel the tension of "the pre-coldwar" in Vienna. I think Joseph Cotton is such a natural actor; he never forces his lines or attempts to overact. All of his lines are said with clarity and conviction of character. He is as likable an actor as Jimmy Stewart. By far however, my favorite part of the film is the ferris wheel ride. Orson Welles could provide such a menacing presence. Here the subtlety of his acting (as in The Stranger) added to the tension. Was he going to throw his friend out of the ride? His eyes revealed his character so delicately. The subtle glances and narrowed eyes conveyed his potential for evil. It is amazing to me too, with cameras having been so bulky, that they were able to shoot the subterranian world of the sewer. Film also tended to be slow back then as well, and the use of light there is amazing. I agree with AFI, this is one of our treasures.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A genuine noir classic - irresistible thrills of the highest order.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A truly stunning, richly atmospheric and endlessly entertaining post-war noir, The Third Man is a film that often crops up on 'all-time great' lists, and deservedly so. Stuffed to the brim with terrific dialogue, memorable set pieces, gripping tension and mystery, and brilliantly disorientating camera angles, the film is a genuine tour-de-force of film-making which stakes a genuine claim as the best film ever made by celebrated British auteur Carol Reed.In post-war Vienna ? a city divided up into sectors by British, French, American and Russian forces ? pulp writer Holly Martins (Joseph Cotton) arrives to reunite with his old childhood pal Harry Lime (Orson Welles). He is distressed to learn that Lime was recently killed by a car whilst crossing the street, but soon he realises there is more to the story than meets the eye when various eye-witness accounts of the accident throw up discrepancies and inconsistencies. British Army police superior Major Calloway (Trevor Howard) reveals that Lime was leading a racket to sell stolen penicillin, and urges Martins to help him catch the others involved. Initially Martins is reluctant but later learns Lime isn't dead at all; that his death and subsequent funeral were a sham designed to throw his pursuers off the scent. After visiting a hospital and seeing the horrific results of Lime's penicillin racket, Martins decides to help in the quest to bring his old friend to justice.The character of Harry Lime ? though barely in the film at all ? looms large over everything that is happening; as a result he becomes one of filmdom's great villains, an enigmatic bogeyman shrouded in mystery and danger. It takes a singularly great actor to do justice to such a character with such limited screen time, and Welles is incredible in the role. Our first glimpse of him, caught unexpectedly in a shaft of light, grinning fiendishly as he observes his bewildered friend Cotton, is one of the iconic shots in the cinema of the 1940s. The film is sensationally photographed by Robert Krasker, manipulating lighting, shadows and camera angles to create a city of murky corners, omnipresent danger and uncertain paranoia. Few sequences in the whole of cinema can rival the thrilling storm drain climax, which simply oozes such excitement and visual bravura that it would look right at home alongside any great Hitchcock sequence. And no discussion of the film would be complete without mention of Anton Karas's zither score ? one of the most celebrated and perfect pieces of movie music ever composed. There's really no faulting The Third Man ? it is, quite simply, among the most truly flawless thrillers ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Greatest Films of All Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some purists would claim that film noir is a uniquely American genre, but there were a number of British and European examples. The great British director Carol Reed made three of these, although none are actually set in mainland Britain. "The Third Man" is set in Vienna, "The Man Between" in Berlin and "Odd Man Out" in Northern Ireland. Of the four main characters in "The Third Man" only one, Major Calloway, is actually British. In Graham Greene's original screenplay&nbsp;Harry Lime and Holly (named Rollo) Martins were also British, but their nationality was changed in order to provide roles for two big-name American&nbsp;stars. It is noteworthy that all of Reed's noirs contain the word "man" in the title, because film noir tended to be a male-dominated genre. The main theme of "The Third Man" is male friendships, in particular the friendship between Lime and Martins (a man, despite his feminine- sounding Christian name). Martins, an unsuccessful of&nbsp; writer pulp&nbsp;Westerns, arrives in Vienna looking for his childhood friend Lime, who has offered him a job, only to learn that Lime has recently been killed in a traffic accident. His investigations, however, lead him to believe that there is something suspicious going on, that Lime's death may not have been an accident, and that his friend may have been involved in a corrupt black-market racket. (The title refers to a discrepancy in different accounts of Lime's death; were there three witnesses to the accident, or only two?) The film is noted for its atmospheric cinematography. Vienna is often portrayed in the British and American cinema as a city of music, gaiety and romance, but in 1949 it was no longer the city of the Hapsburgs and Johann Strauss. It was a city battered and impoverished by war and, like Berlin, divided into zones controlled by the four occupying powers, the sort of place where rackets like Lime's could easily flourish. The film captures this atmosphere of decadence, seediness and corruption perfectly. The look of the film, characterised by harsh&nbsp;lighting, expressionist&nbsp;black-and-white&nbsp;cinematography&nbsp;and oblique camera angles, is certainly influenced by American noir, but Reed showed that these techniques could also be applied to European subjects. One film that appears to have been an influence on him was "The Lady from Shanghai", directed by Orson Welles who of course appears here as an actor. There are four striking acting performances. One comes from Alida Valli (here billed simply by her surname) as Lime's actress girlfriend Anna Schmidt, who also befriends Martins. Despite her German-sounding name (possibly assumed), Anna is actually a Czech national living in Vienna on a&nbsp;forged&nbsp;passport&nbsp;and is wanted by the Soviet occupation authorities who are seeking to deport her to Czechoslovakia. Another comes from Trevor Howard as Calloway, a major in the British occupation forces. As an officer in the Royal Military Police he is responsible for investigating Lime's offences. Martins originally sees him simply as a pedantic bureaucrat with an obsession about enforcing the law to the letter, but as the film progresses we come to realise that he is in reality a deeply humane man who despises Lime because he can see the suffering that Lime's rackets are causing. The third comes from Joseph Cotten as Martins, a typically noir hero who despite a certain disregard for the law has his own sense of honour and&nbsp;decency, and finds himself torn between loyalty to his old friend and his growing sense of distaste for that friend's activities. The film's most memorable performance, however, comes from Welles as Lime himself. The two scenes everyone remembers him for are the one on the Wiener Riesenrad, or giant Ferris wheel, where he gives the famous "cuckoo clock" speech, and the final shootout in the sewers. (Since the film came out everyone has associated cuckoo clocks with Switzerland, but the Swiss would point out that they were actually invented in Germany). Lime is one of the great screen villains, a monster of cynical self-interest who has no regard for the sufferings of others, yet who in Welles's interpretation achieves a certain monstrous grandeur, becoming like Milton's Satan a figure of heroic evil. Welles has comparatively little screen time, yet whenever he is on screen he dominates proceedings completely. Discussion of this film would not be complete without mention of the musical score, written and performed by Anton Karas on the zither, which is particularly haunting and suited to the overall mood of the film. "The Third Man" is often considered one of the greatest films of all time, an opinion from which I would not dissent. It is probably the greatest of all British films noirs, its main challengers in that respect being Robert Hamer's "The Long Memory" and (if one regards it as noir) Roy Boulting's "Brighton Rock", also based on a story by Greene. It is one of those rare films where script, acting, direction, photography and music all combine to produce something of rare quality. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Mystery is in the Cinematography ... the Key is in the Story ... the Spirit is in the Music ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Third Man", released in 1949, has been voted #1 in the British Film Institute's Top 100 movies. Why this and not any of David Lean's war Best Picture Oscar-winners? How about a 'typically' British film, set in Britain, with British actors and all that stuff? Well, if you still have any doubt, just watch it again, and I sincerely challenge you to find another one as iconic, or to use a less hackneyed word, as immediately recognizable in every single cinematic department. First, there's the setting: post-war Vienna occupied by four different victorious countries: Britain, USA, France and Russia, Vienna as a not-so but no-less exotic place whose shadowy walls and haunting streets are transcended by Robert Krasker's Oscar-winning cinematography and Carol Reed's masterful direction. "The Third Man" is constantly punctuated with some incongruous shots, oblique views, spiral staircases and dizzying perspectives like a self- reflexive invitation to take one hell of a chess-game like story really into perspective. A chess-game indeed, everything is either linear or manage to capture a shadow and surround it with blinding lights and hostile dark borders. The cinematography creates both a feeling of claustrophobia and isolation in an oppressive world, illustrating the condition of the lead character: Holly Martins (Joseph Cotten), Martins came to Vienna after having invited by his closest friend Harry Lime, a mysterious black market dealer, finding himself alone surrounded by a gallery of characters, a strange concierge, a sneaky baron, a crooked Romanian gangster, so many secondary characters, and so colorfully black-and-white while the film plays with lights and shadows as to recreate the black market ambiance inherited from World War II, with its menacing and paranoid atmosphere.Then, there's the story that combines through a very subtle and cleverly written script, two investigations around the accidental death of Harry Lime, run over by ?emphasize the 'his'- his truck driver, declared death by his own doctor, and carried by his two close friends ? and a mysterious, unidentified third man. Major Calloway, Chief of British Police (Trevor Howard) investigating on Harry's smuggling activities was about to close the case when Holly, finding the circumstances of Harry's death too 'convenient', tried to solve the mystery of the third man. What a charismatic dead man this Harry Lime, outshining all the other characters, even his best friend, Holly, supposedly the lead of the film, lives in his shadow. There's also a beautiful woman named Anna Schmidt (Alida Valli) who's less an excuse for a romantic subplot than a reason for Holly to stay in Vienna, to learn more about his friend, his death, and maybe a way to get off his shadow. Beyond the one-sided love triangle, there's the feeling of an incredible aura that makes the worst criminal more admired than an ordinary writer who's got nothing else to be proud of, but not to be ashamed either. There's an interesting character study, marked by the sign of cynicism, which leads me to probably the most important aspect of the film: the music.Like "High Noon", "Jaws" or "Midnight Express" "The Third Man" is defined by its music, with such an incredible intimacy that it's impossible to imagine it without the iconic zither sound played by Anton Karas. Whatever I mentioned before would have brought a totally different feeling without the music. While it could have used a sort of dramatic grandiose film-noir score to emphasize the moral dilemma of a man pushed to betray his best friend, the tone of "The Third Man" conveys the cynical aspect of the whole situation. A fake death, where anyone could have felt something fishy, a man who's dead but so obstinately present in his girlfriend's heart and friend's mind, a man who killed many children and innocent people via his penicillin smuggling, but is still referred as "poor Harry" while Holly is mocked for his name and his weakness, he who tries to act according to his principles. The music highlights the irony of a world that lost all its boundaries, where even the dead can come back to life. In an apotheosis, Harry Lime, played by a wonderful Orson Welles, makes his entrance after more than thirty minutes with an unforgettable smile that almost flirts with the viewers. This brief shot remains one of the most iconic and black-and-white cinema defining moments.Harry's smile is a sarcastic take on Holly's view on world; the playfulness of the music underlines the idea of a man so detached he plays with innocent lives for money. The long discussion in the Ferris wheel confirms that he's less charismatic than confident in his villainous level of cynicism, symbolized by the famous "cuckoo clock" line. The music is omnipresent, always thrilling and tricking, before preparing us for a great finale. If Harry doesn't care if he killed some 'invisible dots from the Ferris wheel's altitude', it's only when Holly sees the victims of Harry's penicillin smuggling in the hospital that he fully realizes his friend's evilness and decides to help the Police. At this point, the movie takes a dramatic turn for an unforgettable climax set in the underground sewers of Vienna, the cat-and-mouse chase with Harry as the target is sublimated by the extraordinary use of lights and shadows, a captivating sequence ending with a powerful conclusion when Harry make a last friendly nod to Holly, accepting his fate, while we hear the music again.The last scene, despite its dramatic undertones, is subtly ironic since it ends exactly like it all started and while Anna is walking in Holly's direction in a beautiful shot where the road crosses to the horizon, we wonder, what would happen to Holly and Anna ? but somewhat, we're already transported by the melody of Anton Karas, then all these considerations don't really matter. As would say Harry Lime: "let's not get too melodramatic".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Superb British thriller, a heady mix of post-war suspense, intrigue and danger, mixing stellar Hollywood acting talent (Cotten and of course, Welles) with journeyman but no less important British support, personified by Trevor Howard and a little European inscrutable glamour in Allida Valli, all corralled masterfully into place by Carol Reed.I'm a great fan of Graham Greene's writing and his imprint is all over this far from straightforward thriller. Present and correct are questions of loyalty, duty and the thin line between right and wrong in the pursuit of self-preservation. Cotten is the unsuspecting innocent abroad, seeking out old friend Harry Lime in war-torn Vienna, itself riven by differing occupation forces, making it a highly unsafe place from one area to the next. This edginess is reinforced in many ways by director Reed, for instance, there is a lot of dialogue spoken in the native Austrian, unenlightened by subtitles, throwing the viewer, like Cotten himself, off-guard and raising suspicions and confusion in equal doses. Then there's the bravura camera-work, the camera at many points tilted off-centre, at others mixing up extreme close-ups with high-angle viewpoints, with a fair degree of murky chiaroscuro also thrown in for good measure, emphasising further the out-of-kilter situation in which Cotten's Holly finds himself.There's also Greene's superb dialogue, embellished, if we're to believe the old charlatan Welles, with caustic additional dialogue of his own invention, particularly the "cuckoo clock" speech denigrating Switzerland so deftly that its tourist board must still be looking for a suitable riposte to this day. The dramatic set-pieces too, like Lime's belated first appearance out of the shadows, the conversation on the Big Wheel and of course the breathtaking chase finale played out in the Vienna sewers where cornered rat Lime finally runs out of bolt-holes, are all spot on, but the sub-plots too are equally gripping, not least the fate of Valli as Harry's girl with that wonderfully enigmatic conclusion as she breezes unblinking straight past the waiting and hoping Cotten at Harry's second and final funeral.Throw in Anton Karas' justly famous soundtrack and really you have a film to stand with the very best ever to grace a picture-house.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A rueful view of the sorrows, contradictions, and tragedy of human struggles and obligations.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many reviewers of "The Third Man" have noted the themes of truth and justice versus love,friendship, and loyalty, and there are those, but the work of the source novelist and screenwriter Graham Greene, is never far from the slippery interfaces of good and evil, and director Carol Reed doubles down on that theme by packaging Harry Lime's moral depravity in the magnetic figure of Orson Welles. We have no trouble spotting the seamy evil of the unctuous Baron Kurtz, the weaselly Dr. Winkel, or the brutal Mr. Popescu. But, in the scene in which Joseph Cotten's Holly Martins first sees Lime, when Welles is revealed in the doorway beneath Anna's apartment, in what Martin Scorcese has called one of the most thrilling moments in film, we are dazzled by Welles's urbane smile, and are no more prepared to believe that Lime is responsible for the crimes Major Callaway has described than were Martins and Anna. With only about 15 minutes of screen time, Welles steals the show because of the dissonance between what we have been told of Lime and what we see: Welles, with all his sparkling charisma, charm, wit, and polished elegance. Welles's Lime retains his pull on us even as the worst is revealed. It takes Callaway's "magic lantern show" to convince Martins, and us, that this irresistible character is a moral monster. Lime is a "charmer" in both senses of the word -- both a charismatic wit and a seducer, a deceiver -- he seduced Martins figuratively, and Anna literally, but he seduces both of them, and the audience, emotionally. Yet, like Anna's cat, which she says "only liked Harry," Lime is an amoral creature, he has no real connection with anyone. On the Ferris wheel, those moving below are "dots" whose only value to Lime are twenty thousand pounds each if they "stopped moving forever." Martins tells Callaway he met Lime "back in school. I was never so lonesome in my life until he showed up." At one point, Martins makes a Freudian slip, saying to Callaway, "I guess nobody really knew Harry like he did ... like I did." Lime radiates bonhomie and captures others by warming them with his counterfeit intimacy and enthusiasm. Martins says to Callaway "We never did much. He just made things . . . fun." During the Ferris wheel ride, Lime attempts to manipulate Martins, offering one then another of a repertoire of gambits -- appeals to friendship and "old times," appeals for sympathy, thinly veiled threats, joviality -- attempting to bring Martins around. At the end of the meeting, Lime even has ready a facile historical comparison with which to further confuse Martins -- the famous Borgias-cuckoo clock speech. It's a rhetorical pirouette and leap off the stage so beguiling that it almost allows us to avoid the recognition that Lime is sociopath of the type to which the weak, the lonely, the naive,the self-pitying, and the poorly grounded give their souls, just as had been shown yet again in the then all-too-recent war. Lime's comparison of himself with the Borgias is transparent nonsense -- it's Lime's own delusion -- but it is the type of contextual sleight-of-hand that, in combination with his indefatigable good spirits and boyish enthusiasm, has always carried all before it for Harry, and by which he has always been able to keep the loyalty of those he needed.By the end of the film, it is clear that the war, in which good triumphed over evil, has, nonetheless, inured everyone to evil, especially in so attractive a form as Lime. Martins and Anna remain as deluded as they were at the beginning. As Martins says in the first line of the opening voice-over, "I never knew the Vienna of the Strauss waltzes." Yes, it is indeed gone.The long, achingly sad, final shot, after Lime's burial -- when Martins gets out of Callaway's jeep and waits for Anna, who walks from the cemetery down the cold, bleak road lined with pollarded trees and passes him (and the camera) without a glance -- reinforces the thematic tensions of the film: Having been compromised in loyally defending Lime, Martins is no less compromised in having betrayed him, even despite having ultimately accepted the responsibility of eliminating Lime himself in a kind of coup de grace. Moreover, Martins's acquired "virtue" in betraying Lime does not win him Anna. How could it? Martins's inadequacies are unchanged for her, and whatever Lime was, her life is empty without him. Friendship and loyalty may require the ballast of a shared morality. Love need not be so bound. Anna passes, the zither trembles, Martins flings his match, the end. "The Third Man" is not a great film because it's everyone's cup of tea. There is no anchoring character to channel our understanding and reactions. There is no "hero" to pull for. As Lime tells Martins, "Oh, Holly, you and I aren't heroes. The world doesn't make any heroes outside of your stories." The film's protagonist is feckless and maudlin, the leading lady is desolate and inconsolable. The most fascinating and dynamic character is a heartless scoundrel. There is no hope for any of them. All their struggles have led to greater sorrow. In drawing upon the film, one is left to one's own orientation in a moral spacewalk. It is a great film because, from the concerns of a handful of obscure people in a ruined city in the wake of war, it presents a rueful view of the sorrows, contradictions, and tragedy of human struggles and obligations. As Calloway tells Martins, "Death's at the bottom of everything, Martins. Leave death to the professionals."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still one of the biggest mystery movies ever made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's hard to compare an '40's thriller to the modern movies of the same genre of this present day. The movies are very different in style and todays audience demands more action, pace and sex. Yet "The Third Man" seems like one of those movies that are timeless, due to its well written mystery story, a good cast and a nice overall visual style. The movie has most often been praised for its visual style. A true accomplishment from director Carol Reed, who has never really broken through though. He directed many more great- but lesser known movies throughout his career, that do deserve some more recognition. Perhaps it's due to the fact that he mostly stayed in England and didn't decided on going for a big Hollywood career, like many great British directors from the same era did, that he isn't that well known and his movies didn't received the appreciation they deserved. But to me the foremost reason this movie being timeless is its great story. It's a real typical mystery/thriller story, that has a couple of twists and turns to it. It's unlike for instance the film-noir movies from the same era, that were somewhat more or less being the 'normal' mystery/thriller movies of those days. You could perhaps say that "The Third Man" is in that regard already being a more modern movie. The movie often puts its emphasis on its style and then mostly its cinematography. I don't think I have ever seen so many Dutch tilts in one movie but it really works out well for the movie its atmosphere, that tries to be a bit of an uneasy one, for its main character to feel himself alienated in the for him unknown big town, filled with many different nationalities and languages that he doesn't speak or understand at all. The Vienna after the second world war serves as a great backdrop for this movie its story. After WW II the town got divided into different sectors, all ruled by different nations. It was before the cold war, so here we have British, Americans, Russians and French authorities all cooperating in the international zone to solve the movie its mystery. It at times has a surreal and odd feeling to it but even at the time of the production of this movie was still being a fact. The movie also really has some great acting in it. The movie does at times seems a bit dodgy with its accents, I mean it's obvious that some of the cast members weren't some native German speakers. Joseph Cotten plays a good main character but to me it was really Orson Welles who played the greatest role. He was such a fine actor, in basically every movie he ever appeared in. His acting-style in a way seemed to be decades ahead of its time. Perhaps a bit too much for its town, or otherwise he would had most likely been nominated more often for any awards for it. A great mystery movie, with an early thriller atmosphere. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>eerie tale of post-war Vienna...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is based on the acclaimed novel by Graham Green. It has all the elements of psychological suspense, odd characters and various politics of the black market and what it was like in the French, German, Russian and Austrian section right after World War II.Welles is superb as villain Harry Lime. An opportunist, he sells penicillin on the black market of Vienna, which he is able to rationalize. Joseph Cotten, an old friend from the U.S. visits Harry Lime, but is informed of his untimely death.There are many twists and turns and Trevor Howard is very good in the role of Inspector Holloway ..."English, not Irish"... he tells Cotten, as the ways of post-war Eurpe are made evident, many regional distinctions, and daily uncertainties.The cinematography of Vienna and the crumbling buildings, most notably the conditions in which Fraulein Schmidt (well-portrayed by Alida Valli) reflects the harsh reality of the war. The wood furnace in her ruined flat is almost symbolic of the starkness and hardship which existed in post-war Europe. Highly recommended. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly brilliant English Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First up. This is not an American movie. Second up. Welles has a minor part in it. Having said that it's brilliant. The zither music is unusual yet compelling. The zither player gets a higher billing than the director and producer. I found the characters to be quite repulsive. The hero is gormless and gauche. Although, by the end he has matured somewhat. The heroine is mad. How could anybody love a man (Welles) who's put dozens of children in hospital? She's awful. Cinematography is exceptional. Tilted shots and the use of shadow and reflection is truly staggeringly well done. Not a single shot was overdone. Perhaps that's what made this film so amazing. The awful characters and the beautiful filming. A few subtle touches rounded off this classic. For example, the four-nations soldiers escorting the heroine, with the French soldier making sure "Mademoiselle has her lipstick", Brilliant.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You'll make me lose my Viennese charm yet!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is obviously a timeless classic and one of the best movies ever. A full sixty years after its filming it still manages to keep you on the edge of your seat. Brilliant script, brilliant acting, brilliant direction, brilliant cinematography, brilliant music. And all this was shot to the bizarre backdrop of a still rubbled post-war Vienna, one of the first feature movies to be shot in Europe at that time. You can't say fairer than that, can you? I first watched this as a child when I didn't understand much about Penicillin and black-marketeering, but I easily grasped that this charming fellow Harry Lime was one of the evilest lowlives ever to have crept across this earth.What really marks this movie is its authenticity. I doubt whether many inhabitants of Casablanca would have recognised their city in Bogie's eponymous classic, but The Third Man could easily double as a socio-documentary of the city. In scenes such as the one where the little blond boy runs after protagonist Holly Martins (Joseph Cotton) gleefully exulting "Murderer, murderer!", Director Carol Reed readily grasped the Viennese soul and spirit, which very frequently borders on the macabre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Classic Postwar Atmosphere Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have just seen this again for perhaps the fifth time. Over the years, one's perceptions of the film alter, one seems to grow with it, or it grows with you. This time I realized more forcibly than I had done before just how much Robert Krasker's spectacularly inspired and atmospheric cinematography made this film what it is. Krasker appropriately got an Oscar for it. He had previously done 'Brief Encounter' (1945), and later did 'Billy Budd' (1962) with Peter Ustinov directing, both highlights of his career also. Of course, this film was ultimately a triumph because of Carol Reed's superb direction. No matter that Joseph Cotten, Valli, and Orson Welles gave unforgettable performances which rank in the annals, those performances could easily have been swallowed up and lost in a bad film. To Reed goes the credit of this masterpiece. This time I noticed that he overdid the angular shots: there were just too many of them (unlike the sparing and more effective use of them by Stanley Kramer in 'On the Beach' for instance). I knew Carol well towards the end of his life. He lived at 123 Kings Road in Chelsea, where he had taken the ceiling out of his drawing room so that it was two stories high with a balcony. How well I remember the little loo at the back, with all the walls covered in framed cartoons, caricatures, and newspaper clippings about 'The Third Man'! One used his loo a lot, because of the great quantities of gin and tonic which were always on offer, and hence one was constantly re-entering the world of this film as one answered various calls of nature inspired by the gin. Carol was a very tall and imposing man, of infinitely gentle, kindly and generous nature, but in old age was greatly afflicted by a terrible deafness. I used to get so exhausted shouting at him at the top of my voice. It really does put a damper on conversational ease. He liked to reminisce about 'The Third Man'. He enjoyed a good triumph, and that was probably his greatest. What a sweet fellow, so deeply missed by all his friends, of whom I must have been the youngest. It is not so often realised how sentimental Carol was about children, especially little boys. This was proved by his astounding film 'The Fallen Idol'. But in 'The Third Man' he makes remarkable use of a fascinating little boy with huge eyes who chases Holly Martins down the street as the murderer of his father: this was a hallmark touch of Carol's, to use a child like that to create high drama. I often thought that Carol himself, though a giant, was really a 'little boy who never grew up'. Certainly he understood the world of innocence, which may be one reason why the worm of corruption in the soul of Harry Lime reeks with such overpowering stench in this film, as the antithesis of what Reed himself approved of. In this viewing, Valli appeared harder, more deeply in love with Lime that I had noticed before, more impervious to any other reality than that of his spell. Orson Welles's 'spell' seems to grow with each viewing of this film, as if each time one sees it, more phosphorescent light is emitted by that eerie face so suddenly illuminated in the doorway. And oh, the haunting atmosphere of that deserted postwar city at night! The alleys! And the subterranean river with its sewer drains, of which Carol included so many extra brooding shots, to such great effect. How many 78 rpm records of Anton Karas's theme song were sold? It must have been more than a million. This film has never ceased to live in our imaginations, nor should it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Third Man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Third Man is set in post-war Vienna, a shattered city, divided between the allies and ruled by shady bureaucrats. Joseph Cotton stars here as our eyes and ears as American Pulp novelist and alcoholic, Holly Martins who is supposed to arrive in the city to take a job for his friend Harry Lime ( Orson Welles) However, once he gets to Vienna, Martins soons discovers that Harry is dead. Or is he? Being broke, and with little else to do with himself, Martins resolves to clear up one partiuclar inconsistency in the witness accounts of his best friend's death that were given by those who witnessed it. Were there two men who came to Harry's aid when he was killed or were there three? This is the question that becomes Holly's one reason for remaining in Vienna. Who is this Third Man? And what was his connection to Harry? One of my favorite things about how the movie unfolds is Holly's investigation and how it basically leads to Harry's circle of acquaintances and how almost everyone he talks to tells him to forget everything and leave. His broken-hearted Czech pretending to be Austrian girlfriend Anna Schmidt (Alida Valli), and the creepy threesome of 'Baron' Kurtz (Ernst Deutsch), Popescu (Siegfried Breuer), and Dr. Winkel (Vinkel as he claims) (Erich Ponto).Welles is of course, the ghost in the machine here. He is only in the film in about 10% of its scenes and yet his character and his deeds are alluded to in almost every scene, as well as in the title. He is smooth and lethal, and charming and repellent. One of the most interesting scene for me: is the famous sequence on the Ferris wheel. The scene where Holly asks Harry if he's " Ever seen any of your victims?" Harry points, at the people moving below like little dots and says, " Would you really feel any pity of one of those dots stopped moving forever?" This scene refers to the fact of can we really judge Harry and his crimes in the wake of a world war that has left countless of these same "dots' dead.One of the film's main strengths is Vienna itself: a lopsided place, full of unnatural angles. Every setting is completely in keeping with the action and the intrigue: the rubble, ruins and craters-being just a damn perfect backdrop to the intrigue of the films plotters, politicans and black marketeers. One cannot give a descrption of this film without also mentioning the score, played on a zither by Anton Karas. Strangely it manages to have a mixed tone of joyless and upbeatness. Clearly such an important presence to the mood of the film. The shadows. How about that scene in the sewers? That slight nod of recognition on Harry's face when he "asks" Holly to shoot him.All in all, I think my favorite scene from the entire film is the ending. When Anna walks alone past Cotton, not uttering a single word. Ignoring the fact that he even exists. Has to be one of my favorite endings ever.In fact, I think Alida Valli is perhaps really the star of this film. I find her performance to be just simply breathtaking and hypnotic. She seems to be the only one in the entire film who understands everything too well. She is one of those dots waiting to stop moving ( The Russians). In fact, she ends up being used by the man who she loved, Harry. ( It is insinuated that it was he, who tiped her status off to the Russians) She's realistic enough not to expect any better from anyone else.The result, a genuinely bloodly brilliant film that is a timeless classic of love, deception, and murder-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Harry Lime</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The 3rd Man" is a rather odd movie from pretty much any perspective. Its most dynamic and magnetic character ? Harry Lime (Orson Welles) ? begins the film "dead" and doesn't' actually appear until most of the movie is over. The heroine (Valli) is a cold and remote actress whose only roles are comedy, and who tends to inflict more harm with her disregard than her anger. And our hero, Holly Martins (Joseph Cotten) is a self-proclaimed hack writer of pulp westerns who arrives penniless in post-war Vienna to find his best friend and potential employer has just died in an auto accident ? but who possesses seemingly endless loyalty and dedication to the truth.That loyalty is put to a severe test by the revelation that Lime was involved in a horrific penicillin black market that's left hundreds of children paralyzed for life. One of the things that interests me the most is the way that the audience, by way of our identification with Martins, shares in this process of trust and betrayal, particularly in the moments during the infamous Ferris Wheel scene. Every member of the audience with any intellect or imagination will be tempted by Harry Lime's peculiar and cynical views on history and morality. In fact Lime is a complete nihilist and narcissist, but his reasoning is not simply empty justifications of the types most "villains" spout in crime movies. They have the ring of dark truth, which makes Lime even more terrifying and at the same time appealing. As they say in another U.K. masterpiece ("Night of the Demon"), the devil is most dangerous when he's being pleasant. Harry Lime is Welles' sexiest characterization; we can easily sympathize with Anna's (Valli) obsession with him and are never unduly surprised that she rejects the pathetic, needy overtures of Martins and remains true to her one and only love to the end, even after his actual death in the film's unforgettable climax in the sewers. There's a really tragic feeling to Martins' betrayal of Lime and even though the audience has seen, along with Martins, the physical devastation of Lime's crimes, I think most will feel his character has been diminished somehow by the loss of his friend. Martins himself notes, "Life was just more fun with him around," or words to that effect.The entire movie is suffused with this transgressive aura of excitement around lime, never more perfectly expressed than in the odd, compelling, sometimes inappropriately humorous zither soundtrack. It's not really so much Harry Lime's theme as it is a theme for Vienna itself, which through Robert Krasker's fantastic photography becomes a character in the film itself. Specifically, the Vienna of the period just after the Axis defeat. It's fitting that Lime and Martins rise far above eye level on the Wheel because it creates the impression that they are as one with the city itself, above it and seeing everything in its complexity. Any one of the "dots" could disappear and no one would notice. Harry Lime himself almost disappears as well, but he's not the type that can fade from notice so easily. It's equally fitting that the climax and Lime's death occur underneath the city, in a kind of generic "anyplace", each twist and turn revealing another passageway and escape hatch just like the last one, and likewise offering just as little chance for escape. One can sense the existential fears rippling beneath the surface of this movie ? and our "hero" will end up a lesser man than he was when we first met him, a troubling fact considering that no sensible or civilized person could really fault him for anything he does.The film makes us seriously question just how much the environment and situations in the context of which our actions take place determine whether our decisions are appropriate or "moral." After all, when this film was adapted into a radio series just after the film's successful release, it was not Martins but Lime who was the series' protagonist. That bears some contemplation in and of itself ? like the lady of the story and even her cat, in the end we'd rather spend time with Harry Lime than just about any other human being in the world ? certainly he's no "dot" on the face of the Earth. The reasons for this, along with a generally compelling suspense story by Graham Greene, great photography, tightly paced direction and fascinating performances from all the leads, make this a still powerful cinematic experience. It's remarkable how everything in the film fits, there's absolutely no "fat" at all, and yet the film never feels forced or contrived. Ultimately the credit for this should go to director Carol Reed, a man of great taste and style as is evident in this film classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great classic movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my opinion, this is a great classic movie, one of the best. I have watched this movie many times and never tire of it. The filming is beautiful when it should be, stark when it should be, and always fitting. The acting is perfect, not too much or too little. You can easily place yourself here. The music, while not to everyone's taste, is also fitting- somewhat upbeat, but somewhat melancholy- which matches much of what you see. The plot unfolds brilliantly, and it keeps you guessing. I love how understated many plot turns are, and that they suddenly will just occur to you as you're watching, without the movie having to hit you over the head with it. I think the pace fits perfectly for this movie. It is slower than many movies, but that's also the time and place they were in- bureaucracy was in rule, and everyone was just biding their time, waiting for things to get better. A word of warning- I've tried to watch this with several people, and some have loved it, and some have hated it. What I've found is that if they do not approach the movie with an open mind or if they are impatient in general, they do not like the movie. So if you don't like artsy movies, classic movies, or aren't open to different cultures, or don't like movies that aren't happy or full of action, don't watch this movie. I just enjoy the art of the film, and to me, this is a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You could probably compare this film to "Casablanca". A lot of the themes are quite similar, such as love triangle, post-WWII setting etc. But in my opinion, this film is superior to "Casablanca". It doesn't take itself too seriously, has a slightly ironical fell to it and just feels right.What new can i say about this film, that hasn't been said before at least a hundred times? Probably nothing. So, i guess i'll just bring up everything we all know and love. I guess the first thing that really caught my attention was the dialog. It is amazingly written, easily quotable, mostly grabs your ears when it is being said by Orson Wells, hence the cuckoo clock talk. Another thing that is definitely worth mentioning would be the cinematography. It was pretty slick, very original for that time. It's kind of distorted, some lack of light on the actors faces. Well, and then there are other things that make this movie a classic - the acting, the zither music, the story itself, portrayal of the post - WWII Vienna.See this movie, if you still haven't. If possible, see it more than once. Much more.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Tragedy of The Third Man: An Aristotelian Perspective.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this story, a successful writer of Western fiction, Holly Martins, arrives in post-World War II Vienna at the behest of an old friend, Harry Lime, with the promise of a job, only to find that Harry is officially dead ? killed in a car accident ? but, as a result of his enquires into the accident, Holly eventually finds Harry alive and is forced to kill him, when he discovers that Harry is a criminal of the worst type: trading on the misery of the defenceless. Of such stuff is tragedy made...The screenwriter, Graham Greene, and the director, Carol Reed, present the tragedy with a complex sequence of events ? the Plot -- that gradually lead to the triumph of Good over Evil, with a stark contrast between the two friends: Harry Lime representing Evil ? or perhaps, in biblical terms, a lost soul -- and Holly Martins who epitomizes all that is Good ? or nearly Good -- in humanity. As the story unfolds, and Holly is drawn ever closer to the truth about Harry, Aristotle's dictum that tragedy must be "serious, complete and possessing magnitude" is shown against the brooding, bombed-out city of Vienna ? the Aristotelian Spectacle.Action is the sine qua non for the presentation of any story and, from almost the first few frames, it is largely Holly's actions and reactions that carry the story to its denouement. Holly is curious: as a concerned friend, he pesters authority and others about the different versions of Harry's accident until he finally discovers that Harry is indeed alive.But Holly's puzzled happiness is dampened with the revelation ? the Recognition and Reversal that Aristotle emphasizes as being necessary for effective tragedy -- that Harry's duplicity has come at a cost: another man had been buried in Harry's grave, one that Harry himself had murdered.For Holly, the moral dilemma is clear: the police, in the form of Major Calloway of British Army Intelligence, press Holly to help them entrap Harry, but Holly balks, unhappy to betray an old friend ? or, at least, one whom he thinks is still a friend. Holly needs proof...To his dismay once again, he finds it in two different places. First, his meeting with Harry at the giant Ferris wheel demonstrates Harry's disregard for Anna ? a former girl friend -- as simply a means to an end, like all the ant-like people Harry dismissively indicates far below the wheel; Holly hangs on to the cabin window, distrust and uncertainty fully evident on his face. And second, in a hospital ward, Major Calloway shows Holly the suffering of the innocent victims of Harry's trade in illicit penicillin; and the camera again searches Holly's face as the realization sinks in.Such revelations tip the scales of justice for Holly: now he reverses his position and agrees to set up a trap and betray his friend. Dimly, he rationalizes his decision as being in Anna's best interests -- and his also, hoping to be a replacement for Harry in Anna's affections, an exquisite example of another reversal.In the end, nobody wins and thus the tragedy is complete. In a parody of the Western genre, Holly chases Harry through the Vienna sewers until he guns him down, thus losing his old friend. Later at the real funeral ? an ironic representation of Harry's bogus funeral ? once again he passes Anna who is walking away, now twice saddened ? Aristotelian Suffering, now doubled -- so Holly stops to wait for her, hoping as only a man can hope. Alas, she walks by, and Holly perhaps realizes that she has discovered in him the mirror image of Harry: a flawed character no better and, from her perspective, a bitter confirmation ? if not revelation -- about all men.</fullReview>

Very well acted and amazing cinematography led to a very enjoyable experience. The plot, in my opinion, was simple but well written. The twists and turns were easy to follow, but not at all dull. Although it did help to know German when the "native Austrians" were talking, but English speakers don't stay away. The only thing I didn't like was how the female lead turned out, I couldn't believe her reactions in the end. Still, it is worth a look! Both my dad (64) and I (22) both got a lot of laughs out of this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Brilliant b/w cinematography. No wonder it won the Oscar for 1951 and several other industry awards. There is still a place for b/w if it can reach the standards set by this film. Orson Welles proves he is a very good actor as well as his other contributions to the film industry. Trevor Howard's portrayal of the cool determined British officer is superb. Joseph Cotten underplays the difficult role of the western thriller writer caught in a situation way out of his depth. The mysterious Valli leaves us somewhat frustrated by her refusal to escape the clutches of the Russian authorities for the sake of a man who thinks nothing of making money from the misery of helpless children and adults with his contaminated penicillin. It begs the eternal question: "Why do beautiful women fall for evil men?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb Noir Thriller from Carol Reed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Holly Martin, a western writer (Joseph Cotton), travels to Vienna to meet his old friend Harry Lime (Orson Welles), he is met with a big shock: Harry is dead; killed in a road accident. When a shocked, bewildered Holly asks the witnesses about the accident, their answers don't match up, and Holly believes there might be a third man involved?The Third Man (1949) is an amazing film-noir thriller directed by Carol Reed. I have only just started to get into noirs and this has most certainly confirmed my love for them. I think this film was particularly unusual and innovative because of the constant use of slightly slanted camera angles ? almost like a comic book. There were also lots of shots of a character talking to another character that has their back to the camera, this also made it very comic book like but added to the intensity which is needed in a film noir.And for those of you who like films that keep you on your toes, this is certainly one of them! There are a lot of plot turns and it keeps you guessing? but it is still believable.Harry Martin is constantly torn and Cotton captures his nonchalant hero quality exceedingly well. Welles is also amazing as Harry, and Valli who plays Anna (Harry's lover) is also very dark, brooding but also warm. The acting is brilliant, no qualms there.I have heard people ? in particular, my Mother ? complain about the plot holes in this movie. I can understand what she is saying but these so-called plot holes can be easily 'filled up' with a bit of common sense (I suggest the IMDb boards).All in all, a purely magnificent film like so many other films of this genre. The story is witty, intelligent, dramatic but also slightly comedic at times, the acting realistic ? great performances from all? but what truly sets this film apart is the cinematic experience that you get when you watch it, as it is completely fresh and nothing like I've seen before. Ten out of ten for this superb thriller noir.</fullReview>

It even has one of the greatest quotes ever written (it was supposedly written by Orson Welles himself): "Don't be so gloomy. After all it's not that awful. Like the fella says, in Italy for 30 years under the Borgias they had warfare, terror, murder, and bloodshed, but they produced Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, and the Renaissance. In Switzerland they had brotherly love - they had 500 years of democracy and peace, and what did that produce? The cuckoo clock. So long Holly." With a quote like that how can it be bad?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cheers For The Great Joseph Cotten</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like most people who post reviews on this site, I love movies. I'm not a professional reviewer, but I've seen lots of movies in my day. And from that vast list, most of which has long since faded into my mind's oblivion, a very few stand out. Casablanca. Chinatown. The Godfathers. Bridge On The River Kwai. Annie Hall. The Third Man stands in that company, and maybe at the front. This site contains so many excellent reviews of this movie and its cinematography, its music, its Graham Greene-inspired plot and dialogue. I won't try to re-do what so many reviews have already done. No, I'm writing this comment to honor Joseph Cotten. This movie will always be associated in the first instance with Orson Welles, who, as most readers will know by now, is on screen for but a few minutes. And while those minutes may represent the most memorable small role in the history of cinema, it's Joseph Cotten who carries this movie. His performance as the bumbling, naive, yet ultimately heroic Holly Martins, is perfect. It's an incredibly demanding role, because in order for the movie to work, we have to see Holly as childlike in his adoration of the evil Harry Lime (played by Welles), adolescent in his pursuit of Lime's bereaved girlfriend, slippery enough to have been Lime's one-time running mate, yet clever enough to unravel a mystery that's fooled the cynical British army cop, Major Calloway, played brilliantly by Trevor Howard. And all that and more, we have to like him. Cotten, who is in virtually every frame of the movie, pulls it off. Nowadays, little is written about Joseph Cotten. Maybe it was his man-on-the-street looks. More likely, he'll always be seen as a lesser satellite in Welles' galaxy. Pity, because he was great, and his performance as Holly Martins in The Third Man, is fantastic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A perfect, succinct film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Third Man is a classic that just seems to get better and better with each viewing. A classic film-noire, incorporating elements of noir, Graham Greene's jaded spy thrillers, and excellent acting performances.It's a succinct film that masters how to tell a basic story, while adding a richness and depth through characterization and atmosphere. The unique zither that strums along matches it perfectly.While some may find it dated, I find it a forward thinking masterpiece and you can see the shots that Scorsese and Spielberg have copied for their black and white work. After watching overblown and obvious films such as Crash (this won an award?), it was a gem to see this again. It's my third time, and it just seems to improve with age.It's the little moments that count. Cotten's innocent writer (or is he- since he has some hints of a past with the villain), the great sewer chase, and of course, Orson Welles entrance. The film glides perfectly, with nothing out of place of not making sense.Excellent</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Third Man- the greatest film-noir, and the greatest British film.Alcoholic pulp fiction author Holly Martins travels to Vienna looking for a job from college chum Harry Lime... only to learn that he is dead.According to one witness, three men carried off his body after it was hit by a truck- but Martins can only find two of them, and goes off searching for the third man for the first two thirds.You've probably already guessed who the third man is- if not, then I won't spoil it for you. However, it is not the story that makes The Third Man the classic it is (although it helps): it is the moody atmosphere, the use of shadows and the pure fun that can be found in this, greatest of English films.Oh, and don't worry about it being "boring"- it moves a the cracking pace of an Indianna Jones movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Third Man is a fine movie, with great acting and a genuinely interesting storyline. An American heads to Austria searching for his old friend, but upon arrival, discovers that his friend is dead. As the film progresses, our American begins to have doubts that the friend is dead after all, as a series of outrageously suspicious characters try and put him off the scent. Along the way, he falls for his friend's ex, who helps him in his search for the truth. Was his friend murdered? If so, why were three men seen taking the body away, when only two can be accounted for? These are his questions. Late in the film, this third man is revealed: Orson Welles. His friend is not dead after all. Major Calloway, a brilliantly portrayed English army officer, informs the Americano of Welles' chicanery and crime. Will he help catch him? Going against the wishes of the girl he loves, he agrees. The film builds to a scintillating conclusion in a sewer of all places, Welles trying desperately to evade capture. The movie is very entertaining, although the music grates a little. The way it's filmed is very slick, whilst Calloway's flippant remarks and easy-going mannerisms are a particular treat. Go and see this now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The 30 Greatest Films Ever Made, Continued</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(part of 30 essays on what I think are the 30 greatest films of all time. They are written in no particular order) (yes, I know one of the facts supplied in this review is deliberately wrong, I put it there to preserve a great twist.) God, I love watching "The Third Man." I love getting excited whenever Holly Martins is getting chased down ruined post war Vienna streets, set to a ironic, mockingly cheerful Caribbean style zither music. And I love our first shot of Orson Welles, one of the greatest movie moments of all times. I love watching the chase down the sewer every time I see it, the voices echoing down a hellishly wet dungeon. I love pretending I don't know the twist that comes later on in the movie, like it was the first time I saw it. I love the moment when the camera tracks a cat down the streets onto the feet of someone in the shadows. Is it the Third Man? This is a perfect mystery, not to complicated that you wonder you missed an important detail when you decided to take a leak halfway through, or too simple that you guess immediately the twist that is coming later.It's a British production set in post war Vienna, which is in ruins, about a poor, simple writer of cheap novelettes like "Showdown at San Antonio Flats" named Holly Martins. (More than once he is told that he's "quite popular here in Europe.") Martins is looking for an old friend named Harry Lime who had offered him a job from Vienna. As Martins arrives, he is informed by a neighbor that he is 10 minutes too late - Harry Lime is dead. At the funeral he meets a British police officer named Calloway (not Callahan!) who tells him that Lime was mixed up in a crime racket. Martins spends much of the movie trying to clear Lime's name, which is difficult because the witnesses have jarringly different accounts of the accident in which Lime died. I won't tell you any more of the film - in fact, don't read any other reviews of this before you see it in case you find out something - this is a great film to just let play out in front of you.The Third Man stars Joseph Cotten as Holly Martins, Alida Valli as Lime's girlfriend (who Holly inevitably falls for), Trevor Howard as Calloway, and, in a show stealing role Orson Welles, as Harry Lime, who appears entirely in flashbacks. It was directed by Carol Reed, who won his Oscar (probably undeservedly) for "Oliver!". The only Oscar this film won was for cinematography (that is definitely this films award).Just try and see The Third Man and not love it like I did. I dare you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautifully Restored With That Magical Zither Pervading a Suspenseful, Post-WWII Look at Duplicity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rarely has background music made such a transcendent impact on a film-going experience, but such is the case of Anton Karas's haunting zither in Carol Reed's 1949 dark thriller, a genuine classic of post-WWII deception and desperation. The sparkling, sylphlike strumming makes an ironic, dramatically effective counterpoint to the foreboding atmosphere of a bombed-out Vienna barely recovering from the war. There are many ironies embedded In the story, no surprise given that the screenplay is penned by novelist Graham Greene, whose best work reflects the pervasive moral ambiguities surrounding modern man and the moral ambivalence that complicates otherwise comfortable lives.The intricate story focuses on Holly Martins, a semi-renowned pulp fiction writer of westerns, who comes to Vienna at the request of his old friend Harry Lime. Unexpectedly, Lime turns out to be dead, and Martins begins to discover that his friend was not what he claimed to be but an immoral racketeer dealing with tainted penicillin on the black market. The rest of the story depends on plot twists too rich to divulge here, but suffice it to say that things are not what they appear. Problems for Martins are compounded by the political divisions of the city (Vienna was in four quadrants like Berlin); the limited disclosures of Major Calloway, a likable British policeman on the Lime case and the allure of Lime's beautiful, mysterious lover Anna.Graham masters the treacherous turns of the script with his trademark humanism and spirited wit, and Reed brings a cinematic style that recalls not coincidentally Orson Welles's masterpiece, "Citizen Kane". Both films involve the precarious nature of male friendships and feature two of the same leading actors, Joseph Cotten and Welles himself. Working to represent the perspective of the curious viewer, Cotten is terrific in his career-best role as Martins. Welles shows up late and elliptically in the film as the central figure in the plot, but he makes every moment count, especially the suspenseful chase scene through the Vienna sewer system at the end. Eschewing the romantic yearning he displayed three years earlier in David Lean's "Brief Encounter", Trevor Howard plays Calloway sardonically but with a palpable sense of humanity. As Anna, Alida Valli provides a Dietrich-like sultriness that works, even though her thick accent gets in the way of some of Graham's deft dialogue.Another nod to Welles can be found in Robert Krasker's expressionistic cinematography full of deep shadows and off-kilter angles. It's masterful mood-setting work. The lengthy, melancholic last shot summarizes the story perfectly. Celebrating the film's fiftieth anniversary, the 1999 Criterion Collection DVD package provides a crisp print of the black-and-white film, equally impressive audio, an alternate opening which includes more of Holly's first-person narration, a couple of related radio shows with Cotten and Welles. This is a genuine film noir classic well worth your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I never knew the old Vienna</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film would be on my top ten list of the greatest movies I have ever seen. It established British director Carol Reed as a director of international repute. He already had a long string of excellent movies to his credit. "Stars Look Down," "Odd Man Out," and "Fallen Idol" are among the best British films of the 1940's. Unfortunately, though he made other good films after "The Third Man," none matched the skill and daring innovations of his masterpiece. Based on a story by Graham Greene, Alexander Korda, Welles, and Reed with the screenplay by Greene, "The Third Man" gets its energy and style mainly from two sources, Carol Reed's masterful direction and Orson Welles' stunning portrayal of the central character Harry Lime. Unfortunately, the gifted actor Joseph Cotten must play second fiddle to Welles and is not allowed to shine the way he was in Hitchcock's "Shadow of a Doubt." Actually the second best performance in the film is by Alida Valli who plays the vivacious Anna who continues to love Lime even after discovering that he is a despicable character responsible for hundreds of deaths and abnormalities. She never sees beyond the good times she had with him. The cat is used not only to identify Lime but also to point out that the animal loved him and he loved the animal, whereas Holly Martins (Cotten) almost kicks a dog and is bitten by a parrot, indicating that Holly is not all good and Lime is not all bad. Also, note what Holly does to his erstwhile friend Lime at the end of the movie. Maybe Lime was good earlier but the war turned him into a murderous cynic. The famous meeting between Holly and Lime at the amusement park shows Lime to be a sociopath who loves no one but himself. He uses false analogies and fallacious reasoning to justify his nefarious activities. With the use of his eyes and facial expressions, Welles makes Lime into an incarnation of the devil himself. Yet during the chase in the sewer Welles facial expressions show a kinder, gentler side to the alleged monster. Many times international criminals such as drug dealers close their eyes to the end results of their heinous trade just as Lime does in an attempt to justify their vicious crimes. Sometimes the media makes heroes out of the likes of Harry Lime. When Harry Lime is trapped he tries to escape through a gutter. His fingers are shown feeling the freedom above that is not to be his, another indication that perhaps Lime was once a different person in character and morals but now he belongs to the sewers that flow into the blue Danube.One striking feature of "The Third Man" is the shadowy forlorn photography of the streets of post-war Vienna, now an occupied closed city. Robert Krasker's photography abetted by Carol Reed's direction reminds the viewer of the magnificent photography by Gregg Toland in John Ford's "The Grapes of Wrath." Toland under Ford's guiding hand shows dust blowing over the shadows of the Oklahoma dispossessed, no longer the men and women they once were. So in "The Third Man" leaves are falling from the trees and are shown blowing in the wind, a reminder that post-war Europe is in shambles and history has moved westward. The lives of the people who reside in Vienna are also like the leaves blowing in the desolate deserted streets of the city that was once the cultural center of the universe where artists such as Mozart performed masterpieces.Another striking feature of "The Third Man" is the unforgettable zither music played and written by Anton Karas. This haunting piece became a best selling record and would be recorded over and over for a decade. Even with the advent of rock 'n' roll and hip hop, "The Third Man Theme" has lost none of its relevancy. It fits in so well with the photography and story of "The Third Man."The final scene will remain in one's mind long after the projector stops running. It is not the ending most viewers would like but it is the only ending possible.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Really awesome shots. All the tilting lets you know something strange is going on, but I still fell asleep for 10 minutes. Not a superlative film, as has been said the soundtrack is annoying and the plot is stretched 10 minutes too long. Also I wouldn't really call it film noir, as Netflix does, nearly 75% of the film happens in well-lit interiors or daytime streets of Vienna and although we're ostensibly seeing the Viennese "underworld" in action, it's all a little too civilized (and British) to count as American film noir. All in all, worth a look if you like classics.One minor note, I recently watched Porter's "Laura" for a film class and this movie, which came out 4 or 5 years after "The Third Man" is clearly inspired somewhat by this one. A great B-movie that should have been A-list, check out "Laura" if you like "The Third Man" or vice versa.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just after World War II, Holly Martins is invited to Vienna by an old friend, Harry Lime, but when he gets there Harry has died in a car accident. However, the international police force are investigating Harry for racketeering and are not convinced he is dead ?I find it hard to identify with many of Graham Greene's characters, probably because I was forced to read The Power And The Glory when I was at school. He wrote the story directly for the screen but I find him a very uncinematic writer - the setup is good but it doesn't go anywhere. Instead, Holly and Anna spend the whole film talking about Harry and feeling sorry for themselves. They're both besotted with him, and his character is built up so much that when Welles finally appears it's a blessed relief - except he's only on-screen for about ten minutes and turns out to be a slimeball. What does this mean and whom are we supposed to root for ? Despite this, the movie is beautiful to watch and highly original. Robert Krasker's Dutch angle photography is outstanding throughout, and the shots of bombed out Vienna alone make it a fascinating piece of modern history. Reed's direction is tight and poignant, emphasising Holly's foreigner status and resigned acceptance of Harry's criminal exploits, and Anton Karas' justly famous zither music is a unique and dynamic accompaniment to the action. Many critics hail it as one of the best movies of all time (it won the 1949 Grand Prix at Cannes), but, like many other so-called all-time greats (Lawrence Of Arabia, Some Like It Hot, Cabaret), I struggle to see why. It's well worth seeing, but then so is Russ Meyer's Mudhoney. Produced by heavyweights Alexander Korda and David O. Selznick. Trivia - Alida Valli, a great Italian actress who subsequently starred in horror classics Les Yeux Sans Visage and Suspiria, is billed using only her surname.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the finest pieces of cinema ever produced. I won't go into the plot. Other reviews have covered that already. If you haven't seen the film, you should have. If you have seen it, look again. I first saw this at a young age when it was just "an old film on the telly" filling in a vacant slot and it gripped me from beginning to end. Intelligent film making at its very best with great story telling, atmospheric photography and music perfectly capturing the immediate post war chaos of a shattered city with masterly direction from Carol Reed to top off Graham Greene's screenplay. All the performances are excellent, but my particular favourite is Trevor Howard as the world weary Major Calloway who steals the film even from Orson Welles. Joseph Cotten is underrated and does a tremendous job as the central glue to the plot, which is not an easy part to play. Ignore the Philistines who demand everything goes at 100mph.

		<fullReview>I just saw this film. It was absolutely beautiful. The story was fantastic, the acting was superb (Orson Wells' monologue on the Ferris Wheel = ausgezeichnet), and the scenery was unbelievable.Now my view of the film may be a bit skewed; seeing as how I'm currently studying abroad in Vienna and I just watched the movie for the first time in Vienna. Seeing old Stephansdom and Ruprechtskirche in 1949 was a moving experience. Witnessing a city in ruin really made the destruction of Europe after the second world war come alive and it added infinitesimally to the undertones and tensions of the story. Orson Wells was astounding. He wasn't on the screen for long, but when he was he was fantastic.The one thing I felt could have been improved was the music. But overall it was an incredible experience. See it in WIEN! and then go on a walk and visit all the sights from the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another gap finally filled in my viewing catalog! The mood and setting is almost everything in this classic of American writer Cotten tracing his childhood friend Welles in post-WW2 Vienna, with a wrap-up no one could've dreamed of. Starts slowly but builds surely into an enthralling and entertaining mystery thriller in the best Hitchcock tradition, with fine characters and striking noir photography. The climax in the sewers is impressive, but my favourite bit is the fantastic scene in the ferris wheel between Welles &amp; Cotten!Now for my complaint: the music theme. I know it's famous because it stands out- but I seriously find it SO out of place in its la-di-da strut, that it wrecks the thriller mood, and I'm convinced this would have fared even better with a different score. Nonetheless- an essential cinematic staple, indeed.7 out of 10 from Ozjeppe</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The perfect film is not yet with us but this is movie making at its zenith. It's hard to imagine how this film could be improved upon. It's both gripping AND original. Each image on the screen is indelible. I'll give one example. Joseph Cotton waiting for Orson Welles at the gigantic ferris wheel, his coat flapping in the wintry breeze. The scene that follows references all the themes we have been introduced to previously -- crime, friendship, love, betrayal -- and it's very funny too. I mean, five hundred years of democracy and peace producing nothing more than the cuckoo clock. That scene could be played again and again without extinguishing the viewer's interest in it.Not that the movie depends entirely on set pieces. The continuity is provided not just by Holly Martins' (Joseph Cotton) investigative perambulations but by incidents that link with one another or that restate the themes. By "restating the theme", I'm referring to things that reveal Holly's failed attempts to replace Harry Lime (Orson Welles) in Anna's (Valli) life. Holly tries, for instance, to feed her some lines she has to learn for a play. "Harry used to do that." The lines are in German and Holly flubs it until she gives up. And Anna's cat. Holly tries to play with it but it blows him off. "He only liked Harry." The cat next appears in the street below, playing with the shoelaces of Harry, who is hiding in a dark doorway. "Such is her love that she treats as flesh the stuff of shadows," to rip off Dante baldly and badly.By "incidents that link with one another," I mean pieces of dialog or action that reflect one another and add to the sense of cohesion. Example: When Anna finds out that Holly is a police informant, she scolds him and says sarcastically, "Holly -- what a silly name!" After the climactic chase, much later, Holly asks Calloway (Trevor Howard) to leave him at the gate so he can talk to Anna. Calloway tells him, "Be sensible, Martins." And the reply is: "Haven't got a sensible name." The lines resonate. Another example: twice Calloway and Martins drive past Anna while she is walking down the same road, leaving Harry's funeral -- one at the beginning and again at the very end. It's an adult movie with wit and elisions that are aimed at people who are not seeking black and white cartoon characters. It even manages to make us feel some sympathy for the villainous Harry when he's chased through the sewers, the cloaca maxima of post-war Vienna. The story has to do with three people: a British officer who will not change his mind about a criminal, a friend of the criminal who does change his mind, and the criminal's lover who does not. Expect an up-beat ending? Watch Valli walk past Holly Martins on her way out of the cemetery while the leaves fall. In all the films I've seen there are few more moving scenes, and its completely wordless.Everything seems to fit together here -- the direction, the performances, the score, the photography, and the writing. It's nearly a Gesamtkunstwerk and could have been shot in Wagner's Bayreuth instead of Vienna. Anton Karas's musical instrument wasn't chosen at random. It a traditional instrument in Austria and Germany. The word "zither", by the way, is from an old Indo-European root that also gave us "sitar" and "guitar". No need to go on about its virtues. If you miss this, you miss a milestone in cinematic history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE THIRD MAN: A Film for the Ages</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a devotee of post-World War II black-and-white realism, whether it be the films of Vittorio De Sica or American movies like ON THE WATERFRONT and 12 ANGRY MEN. THE THIRD MAN, Carol Reed's classic from 1949, can be considered one of the first "Method movies"; certainly Orson Welles' acting in the great Ferris Wheel scene is more naturalistic than your typical 1940's acting, and the slanting camera angles and evocative shadows lend this film an artistic, poetic quality lacking in many potboilers of the era. Graham Greene's script for THE THIRD MAN too has literary quality and depth; in classic film noir fashion, it presents a cynical, pessimistic view of life in which humanity is caught in a web of deceit, upright moral actions do not yield a story-book ending, and a woman would rather be true to a dead lover and his corrupt values than wake up to a better love that awaits her. The powerful, expressive images?a fleeing shadow down an alleyway, a long tree-lined road past a cemetery, a puff of silver smoke from a train, the dying Harry Lime's hands grasping at life through a sewer grate, as well as that magnificent underground network itself?will haunt you, and you will feel enriched by this superb film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rackets &amp; Intrigue In 40s Vienna</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The turmoil of post-war Vienna provides the backdrop for the story of "The Third Man" and some exquisite expressionistic cinematography is used to convey the sense of menace and pessimism which prevailed in the city at that time. The plot centres on two men and the way in which their longstanding friendship gradually unravels and finally comes to a fatal conclusion.Holly Martins (Joseph Cotton) is an American author who travels to Vienna to take up the offer of a job working with his old friend Harry Lime (Orson Welles). Soon after his arrival he learns that Lime has been killed in an accident and after attending his funeral, intends to return home as soon as possible. He changes his mind, however, when he is invited to speak to the members of a local book club. After a few people provide Martins with information about Lime's accident, he becomes intrigued by some apparent contradictions in their stories and seeks out Lime's girlfriend Anna (Alida Valli). A British military policeman, Major Calloway (Trevor Howard) encourages Martins to leave Vienna and provides him with convincing evidence of the odious nature of the racket in which Lime was involved. Shortly after this, Martins discovers that Lime is actually still alive and meets with him at a local amusement park. Lime invites Martins to join his racket but Martins refuses and later goes on to assist Calloway in capturing his old friend. As a result of this act of betrayal, Anna puts a permanent end to their friendship."The Third Man" is an extremely stylish movie in which the sombre, claustrophobic atmosphere of its location is evoked perfectly by use of top class cinematography and a theme tune which fits its purpose far more effectively than any orchestral score could possibly have done. Add to this the great "I never knew the old Vienna" narration, Harry Lime's famous cuckoo clock speech and the drama of Martins' tale of optimism, disillusion, betrayal and loss and you end up with a real classic which continues to have an enduring appeal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic film noir set in postwar Vienna.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Currently this movie is rated #2 all-time for Film Noir by IMDb voters. I found on DVD, the recently restored version, at my public library. The restoration is quite good, but the sound balance is off at times, with zither background music annoyingly loud at times. Other than that, it is about perfect for an older film.While the story is good, it in fact is rather simple. The story is not what makes it a treasured classic. The two things that do are the characters, particularly Orson Welles as the mysterious Harry Lime playing off the naive Holly Martins played by Joseph Cotton. Plus, the superb black and white film noir cinematography set among some of the bombed-over ruins of post-war Vienna. Even though Welles was merely an actor here, "Citizen Kane" movie-making is visible all through "The Third Man." The remaining comments contain SPOILERS so anyone who has not yet seen the movie should read no further. Pulp fiction writer Martins is invited to Vienna by his old friend Lime, with a promise of work. But Martins shows up just in time for Lime's funeral. In disbelief Martins tries to find witnesses and one describes "a third man" at the scene, one not included in police reports. In fact the third man we find out half-way through the film was Lime, and he took this opportunity to fake his own death and go into hiding because the police wanted him for crimes, namely watering down penicillin and getting rich while adults and children suffered. A cat-n-mouse game is played where Martins agrees to do what is right and help capture his old friend, until Lime is hunted down in the sewers below the city. Lime does not escape, he dies with his fingers reaching up through a street-level grate. Martins has fallen in love with Anna, Lime's old flame, but she walks right past him as the film ends.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's absolutely nothing unique about this movie. It's interesting but quickly becomes annoying and boring. I'm shocked by the "Masterpiece," and "flawless," comments and the high ratings.The music is terrible, and redundant. We hear the theme song over and over again throughout the movie. The setting is also redundant and much better movies have been made before and after this in the same area. The bad-boy faking his own death has been done hundreds of times before this. The woman loves bad-boy and ignores the loving friend....geez...where do I start? The dialog is stilted and the acting likewise. Like, no one EVER filmed a movie with unique angles? How about Fritz Lang, Billy Wilder, Orson Welles and so many others. What better movies are out there? How about "Double Indemnity," "Ministry of Fear," "Sunset Boulevard," "M","Citizen Kane," "The Cabinet of Dr Caligari.....well you get the picture.This is just a plain thriller that gets less thrilling with every wail of zither music, every smirk of the stupid female, and every whine of the wonderful Joseph Cotton. On yeah, and Orson Welles mumbles, but has the best scenes. The wonderful Trevor Howard is there for comedy relief and realistic lines.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest film-noir movies ever made..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A young American novelist, Holly Martins (Joseph Cotton), arrives in Vienna looking for his friend Harry Lime (Orson Welles). Once in the city, however, he learns that Harry Lime has passed away. Shocked, Holly Martins starts asking questions, a lot of them. He is told a number of different stories that eventually lead him to believe that Harry Lime was killed.Determined to find out who is responsible for Harry Lime's murder, the American embarks on a treacherous journey amidst the unfriendly streets of Vienna. Soon, he is entangled in a web of deceit and dangerous machinations. Along the way, the American also encounters the beautiful Anna Schmidt (Alida Valli), a Czech national with forged Austrian papers, who agrees to help him.Written by the legendary Graham Greene, Carol Reed's The Third Man is a terrific hybrid of a film where noir, neo-realism and Hollywood bravado are mixed to perfection. Set in post-war Vienna, the film is very much a dark caricature of sorts where the finesse, elegance and tradition of Old Europe are seen through the eyes of a naive but ambitious American looking for his missing friend.Contrary to what many critics have claimed, the actual story is rather complicated. A giant mystery surrounding Oscar Welles' character, Harry Lime, is slowly peeled off, piece by piece. As a result, The Third Man quickly evolves into a guessing game where every little detail is worth analyzing. As expected for a noir-film, there is also a dangerous femme fatale who becomes a prominent player as soon as the main protagonist reaches Austrian soil.In addition to strong dark overtones, The Third Man also boasts a great deal of nihilism. Betrayal and impossible love for example are depicted by Carol Reed with a sense of realism that feels uncannily contemporary. Not surprisingly, The Third Man works incredibly well not only as a non-stop adventure film, but also as a realistic depiction of a world struggling to recuperate after an enormous tragedy.Furthermore, even though The Third Man is a British film, its view on Old Europe is distinctively American. The clash of cultural ideologies, as witnessed through the interactions between Alida Valli and Joseph Cotton, is particularly impressive. There are entire scenes where Carol Reed focuses on the American whose alarming naivety produces some of the most hilarious yet, disturbing sequences that compliment the mystery.Finally, Anton Karas' soundtrack is beautiful. The mellow sounds produced by his zitner grant The Third Man with an entirely new flavor, one that blends with the dark vistas from Vienna's sewers exceptionally well. Not surprisingly, the atmosphere The Third Man sustains is often cited as its greatest strength.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>That Part About The Cuckoo Clock!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has been noted as one of the best films ever in the history of the American cinema!!! While this website ranks it 48th best movie out of the top 250, and AFI (American Film Institue) has ranked it as high as the 14th best picture out of the top 100 American films ever made, something even more significant looms on the horizon!! Many intellectual spawns of the American film academy have ranked this film in the top five films ever produced!! One prominent critic from Boston ranked "Third Man" the number one movie of all time!! So!!! What justifies such critically acclaimed praise anyway? Start with the fact that the intellectual complexities to the plot in "Third Man" are intensely riveting!! The esoteric demeanor with which this film carries, has a deliberately convoluted line of logic!! The derivative responses from so many of the characters in this film spark a necessary ambiguity with regards to the prevailing circumstances for whom the third man must relinquish his mystique to!! The conversations pertinent to any kind of plausible resolution to the core issues in this movie were always philosophical!! Joseph Cotten and Orson Welles are a highly classic and highly talented duo of actors (As demonstrated in "Citizen Kane") who immediately necessitate a lofty aura of academic concepts. This detailed and contemplative cerebral quandary invites the movie audience to a very noteworthy ideological rumination of the story line in this film. Whether it be "Citizen Kane", "The Third Man", or any other film, the indisputable mark of the majority of intelligent actors ( Including Orson Welles and Joseph Cotten) is one where they convey the understanding of a situation, and instantly establish whether this situation is really complicated or very simple!! This is about the seventh time I have seen this movie "The Third Man" and, I believe, that finally!! I have a grass roots recognition of what this movie is about!! The visceral components to this film induce a correlation to an adamant political passion, as well as, yes, what else? love!! The trials and tribulations of espionage became a form of mutual vindication, thus establishing a kindred spirit for emotional devotion!! Set in Vienna, this film was very identifiable to me, as I have been to Vienna, and I recognize a lot of aspects of splendor to this city. All of it ignited an auspicious recognition; the Gosser Beer signs, the Sacher Cafe', the Mozart concertos with the players wearing wigs, ( I saw a production of this nature while in Vienna!!), and, of course, the cobblestone streets where a cross section of dubious walks of life perennially congregate!! Vienna is a city which is proverbially known to be a hotbed of political malcontents!! Just by virtue of the copious number of summits and dignitary gatherings it has hosted suggests that Vienna is a city which vicariously straddles the political fence!! With the intransigent aftermath of WWII, and the world almost ready to go to war again over the conquest of Berlin in 1948, central Europe had become totally dissected!! By 1949, when "The Third Man" was made, the overall infrastructure, which was ruined in Vienna, from confrontational combat during WWII, was ubiquitous!! The city was divided in four sections, belonging to four nations, the American, the British, the Russian, and the French. The center of the city was international, and for Joseph Cotten's character, Vienna presented itself as a mecca for diplomatic intrigue!! I loved this movie!! Based on the screenplay by Graham Greene, this film erupts with talent. Carol Reed ( Known for "Oliver" and a remake of "Mutiny on the Bounty") does a remarkable job as director with his efforts in the making of "The Third Man"!! The acting in "The Third Man" was utterly superb, basically second to none !! Orson Welles and Joseph Cotten are an unbeatable combination, and Alida Valli, who plays Anna, is flawlessly disconcerting with this role!! The speech Orson Welles made was one which he wrote... the gist of it being (I am paraphrasing)" War, terror and bloodshed are adversities which brought on greats such as Michaelangelo, Leonardo DaVinci, and the Renaissance, Switzerland has had 500 years of peace and democracy, and all you have gotten out of them is the cuckoo clock". I thought this little doggerel of Welles' was very impressive!! Orson Welles is a lone rebel cynic who raised the bar on directing and acting excellence, not only in Hollywood, but also, in New York and London Theatre!! Orson Welles has the same birthday as I do, I guess this day was earmarked for brilliant byproducts of unprecedented genius!! (My personal vanity in this case is totally in kidding of course!!) The Hawaiin music in this film served as an aside for anachronistic flippancy with this picture!! The cinematography and lighting in this film were spectacular!! Accomplished actors, directors and producers prefer a movie to be filmed in black and white, as it exudes the absence of distraction!! The film "Third Man" is a must see for virtually every movie aficionado on the face of the earth!! I agree with the discerning movie critics, THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES EVER MADE!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Third Man is all sizzle and flimsy plot. The sizzle is impressive. The music, locations,dialog. The plot is little short of ridiculous. Characters are introduced and never heard from again("Baron" Kurtz, Popescu, Dr. Winkel). They are mostly red herrings. Hired thugs, out to kill, half-heartedly chase Holly Martins (Joseph Cotton)briefly and vanish from the plot. Who hired them? Why do they give up so easily? Certainly Holly is not hard to find. He keeps coming back to his hotel. A little boy, wandering alone at night, identifies Holly Martins as a murderer and there's a brief chase. It has next to nothing to do with the plot. Harry Lime (Orson Welles), after presumably trying to kill Holly,tells him he'll come whenever his friend calls. Master criminal, con man deluxe, cool cat that he is, Harry walks straight into the most obvious of traps. Anna Schmidt (Alida Valli)loves Harry Lime to the point where she can never love another man yet there's nothing lovable about Harry Lime. And so it goes a comic book story and characters with stunning illustrations within glossy book covers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After more than a dozen attempts, I finally sat through this thing without becoming utterly confused and falling asleep (Still haven't managed that same feat for "Touch of Evil" or "The Lady From Shanghai"). I love classic films, but much about this one doesn't appeal to my personal tastes. For example, I have a hard time warming up to Joseph Cotten as a leading man. For me, he spoils Hitchcock's brilliant "Shadow of a Doubt" and I could do without him in "Citizen Kane." Alida Valli is a fine actress, but her close resemblance to Karen Black prevents me from finding her attractive. The incessant zither music quickly wears out its welcome, as do the overused tilted camera angles of people running through empty streets and sewers. With that said, I was finally able to focus and understand what was going on. The mystery, for all its sound and fury, signifies not much. Even Orson Welles's fifteen minutes of screen time is redundant. I do admire the craftsmanship of this film and can see why some people love it, but I feel the whole experience is rather dissatisfying. Watching it feels more like a highly demanding chore rather than a pleasure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>worst music score in film history</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are interested in film production and want to know how important the score is ? watch this film.The sole instrument in the score is a zither. The music sounds clownish and one expects clowns to show up at any moment. Quite inappropriate in a tense, dark drama. The awkward music draws the passion and darkness out of every scene it appears in, ruining some fairly good performances. Thankfully, the score is fairly minimal. Lesson: Low budget? If you must have only one instrument, pick a piano, not a zither, to orchestrate your film. Or spend a little more money on the score....There is also some emotional confusion in this film. Harry Lime, we are lead to believe, is a sleezeball worthy of death. However, he managed to win the love, and loyalty, of a beautiful woman of character and the lifelong friendship, and loyalty (he tried to find out who murdered Lime) of another fairly good guy.Sleezeballs worthy of death don't earn the loyalty of people like that. They earn the 'loyalty' of other sleezeballs.So, you wonder, is he really a sleezeball or a hero up to something important just masquerading as a sleezeball? You don't really know until the end of the movie. This leads to confusion, not suspense.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was not extremely impressed, finding this movie slightly overrated, but that is not to say that it wasn't a good movie. The storyline was interesting enough to keep you engaged (even with its plot holes and shaky justifications). The shadowy scenery of the dark cityscape (especially the shots in the sewers) was wonderful almost like a work of art as much of the film was. Even the opening credits were mesmerizing as strings on the zither vibrated to produce a catchy little tune. The main complaint I had was it seemed to lack intensity and engagement. The story was not dull, but the characters (or actors) were somewhat cold and lifeless which didn't create a very good emotional connection.</fullReview>

Also the direction of Carol Reed was equally good. I have to admit that I did not expect to like this movie at first but after the first ten minutes of the movie I was surprised.

		<fullReview>. . . THE THIRD MAN teaches us. Sometimes the psychopath doesn't even need to please the eye, as Adolf Hitler's frequent wreath of cute Frauleins proved. THE THIRD MAN takes place in the Fuhrer's old stomping grounds--Vienna, Austria--only a few years after he stomped. A Pre-blimp version of Orson Welles plays Harry Slime, who specializes in turning ailing kids into helpless vegetables. Harry has a penchant for Russians and sewers (which go together like "love and marriage"). His mistress Anna is head over heels for him, and her passion waxes even stronger when she learns that he has been maiming children behind her back. (It might be unfair to state that female intelligence is inversely proportional to feminine beauty, despite what a close study of Film illustrates.) American serial killer Ted Bundy was kind of cute, and had dozens of victims among the "fair sex," who in turn left hundreds of chagrined and rejected homelier, less cocky, non-Romeos in their wakes. Though THE THIRD MAN doesn't actually show Harry man-handling Anna, Mr. Slime makes it clear to his ordinary-looking friend "Holly Martins" that he views mistress Anna as being on par with an insect. Harry and Anna's relationship rings so true to Real Life that Harry could be right.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Carol Reed's The Third Man is a movie shot with suspenseful dialogue. The movie stars Joseph Cotten as pulp novelist Holly Martins a man who just arrived in Vienna because his friend Harry Lime (played by Orson Welles) offered him a job, and when Martins arrives he wonders where Harry can be, and then he finds out that he was murdered and he wanted to help find out how he got murdered along with the help of Lime's lover Anna (played by Alida Valli. While watching this movie it made me think of a Paul Newman movie that I reviewed this past April called Absence of Malice (1981) because they both had sort of similar stories but with different plots.The scene that I think a lot of people including myself find most surprising is the scene where Anna's cat exits the house through a window and is by somebody's feet, and Martins says "Come out, Come out whoever you are." and he finds out is is Harry with an excited expression on his face for getting away with foul play, and with thinking that this whole case is a joke.This movie is on a par with some of the best film-noir movies ever made for example Sunset Blvd.(1950), Touch of Evil (1958), The Maltese Falcon (1941) etc. And one brilliant performance in this movie that I forgot to mention and that was Trevor Howard's as the commanding police officer in that case.

		<fullReview>Pulp novelist Holly Martins, played by Joseph Cotton, travels to shadowy, postwar Vienna, only to find himself investigating the mysterious death of an old friend, black-market opportunist Harry Lime, played by Orson Welles. An out of work pulp fiction novelist, Holly Martins, arrives in a post war Vienna divided into sectors by the victorious allies, and where a shortage of supplies has led to a flourishing black market. He arrives at the invitation of an ex- school friend, Harry Lime, who has offered him a job, only to discover that Lime has recently died in a peculiar traffic accident. From talking to Lime's friends and associates Martins soon notices that some of the stories are inconsistent, and determines to discover what really happened to Harry Lime. Roger Ebert said that: "Of all the movies that I have seen, this one most completely embodies the romance of going to the movies." In my opinion it really is the greatest film noir that I have seen, everything about it is just perfect from the performances, the storyline, to the excellent and iconic theme music in The Third Man. The ending to The Third Man is just so magical in its execution as Anna walks away alone, that scene is forever in my memory.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A terrific film that intensifies the suspense superbly and holds it till the end.This is widely known as one of the greatest noir films. I would submit to that opinion too. Orson Welles comes late in the film and from then on, takes the film on its head. I can say that Orson Welles is flawless as an actor. It's a classic film that has all the ingredients to be contemporary as well. The soundtrack that uses only zither, the cinematography that seems grand and great, the production design that is immaculate are all superb. Especially the climax that takes place in the tunnel is one of finest moments in the history of cinema. Above all, the plot, the taking, the direction and the presence of a terrific Orson Welles make this a sublime thriller that we know, yet there are so many questions that are answered bit by bit. I will not say this is an edge of the seat thriller or that the suspense is so intense that it will make a viewer fall of his seat. But, I would say that is one of a thriller where we know many things, yet we are curious about the reason behind their happenings. Even now as I watched it, I felt it made now. The thriller element and the color that is black and white might be a thing of the past. But the dialogs, the execution, the emotions, and even the fear which Orson Welles as Harry Lime depicts make the film as it was it made in our times.Carol Reed the director must be credited for directing another director of the caliber of Orson Welles with such finesse. I have never seen Orson more vivid than I saw him in this film (I am not talking about films which are directed and written and acted by himself) in a film directed by someone else.Kudos to all the makers and actors and also for those who have kept this film highly rated in the noir film. It's the rating that has generated the curiosity and made me watch this. I am going with 5/5 and for sure, this one of the greatest films ever made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not partial to the practice of categorizing films in genres because it seems to be, in essence, a practice of subjectivity masquerading as objectivity that dictates to the viewer what kind film one is seeing, or how one should react to it. This, I believe, is because each "genre" then associates with a myriad of preconceived genre-specific types, clichés, memes and expectations that guide our perception of the film.But film noir I see altogether differently. Not necessarily a film genre but more akin to a philosophy of film, it's a superbly entertaining framework and subject to think of. Not a unified, unilateral type at all, the films still bear some resemblance in their visual look (chiaroscuro, low angle/Dutch angle, etc.) and narrative devices (a well-intentioned, unknowing character is thrown in the middle of an impossible scheme in a hostile universe). The audience rarely know any better, and we are there, stumbling, obliging, led on by clues, trying to find our way just as the main character is. The best noir, then, is not about things happening to the main character but to us.The best parts of the film are the exterior chases, and of course the grand finale. The film unfolds slowly, but the last third is fireworks. The Ferris Wheel is a brilliant example of real characters conversing with each other ? interrupting each other, fighting for their space in their conversation. Welles is the master of this kind of dialogue. Here he's at the top of his game. And his expressions, just marvellous! "Mr. Arkadin" (1955) is similar. There, too, we have a man behind the curtain (Welles) whose real identity is investigated and seemingly revealed, yet Welles ups the ante there, and although it comes down to us in butchered form, it's still an utterly accomplished work. These two films really compliment each other, even if I prefer Welles'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The greatest possible juxtaposition of classic film noir and mystery lies in the "Third Man."The opportunity to view this film in the theater was afforded to me just recently and, after viewing it twice on VHS, I couldn't pass up the chance. Considering that Cotten gave one of his more uninspired performances(paled in comparison to his performance as Eugene Morgan in the "Magnificent Ambersons"), I still think that this film stands alone as the greatest post-war film ever made. The zither score is one of the most uniquely mesmerizing and surprisingly fitting music scores I have ever heard, and it set the tone for the villainous and conniving atmosphere of post-war Vienna. I love the odd angled shots.....the terribly dark shadows...the realistic sets that exposed the hard-nosed reality of post-war Europe. The plot itself was laced with suspense(Harry's entrance), drama(harry's final "nod" to Holly on the sewer staircase), and comedy(the name mixups..Holly-Harry...Winkle-Vinkle...Calloway-Callahan). Allida Valli gives an admirable performance as Harry's longtime girlfriend who is willing to put his death to rest even under the suspicious circumstances with which he died. EVERY last character that Holly meets in Vienna has an aura of evil...down to the little boy chasing his ball. But the truth behind the whole twisted plot and demonic characters is that they all lead to the "meat" of the movie....the greatest entrance ever...harry Lime's. The dark shadow keeps the viewer uneasy, even if it is more than obvious that it is Harry. Welles brief role elevates the "Third Man" into the upper echelon of films.....HIS ferris wheel sequence is the most well written scene EVER....the "cuckoo-clock" monologue was devastating filmwriting...Welles encapsulates EVIL as Harry Lime. A character is at his best when he can make EVIL look so appealing as Welles displayed ever so brilliantly. The closing sequence could not have been better, with the lovestruck Holly awaiting his "still in love" Anna....but getting the "shaft". A must see for all serious film-goers.... A REQUIREMENT for all Orson Welles fans. Only 9 years later we would see Welles maybe 80-100 lbs heavier in "Touch of Evil", so this is a sort of farewell to the leaner Welles(even though his progressive weight gain from "Kane" is apparent). See this in the theater if possible; either way you will be witnessing a film that rewrote the genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best British film of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>British cinema is overall strong, and while certain American films are the best of all time, Britain at least has more skill in the art of subtlety. Nothing made in Britain has ever quite matched The Third Man, a film where liking it is a cliché but one which is genuinely a masterpiece of cinema. A pulp writer played by Joseph Cotton investigates the death of an old friend, Harry Lime. This tale takes place in the shadowy world of post war Vienna. There is no such thing as a flawless film; TTM takes a little while to get going and has initial dips but once it gets going all those flaws are forgotten. Drawing together shadows, mystery, thrills, twists, history and technical wizardry, TTM is a nail biting, rattling roller coaster ride of a movie flying which more often than not threatens to dive off the rails. Thanks to the exciting thrills and interesting story this is one of the most enjoyable old movies out there, and definitely the best movie to come out of Britain.Joseph Cotton is great, and everyone else delivers but Orson Welles steals the show. He only appears 3 times and speaks in just one of these scenes but he dominates the film. It's difficult to pick a highlight as there are too many great moments to choose from: The revelation Harry Lime is alive, the ferris wheel speech, the sewer chase, the final shot. The script is one of the cleverest detective scripts ever written and it navigates the endless twists and turns with ease. The direction by Carol Reed is utterly extraordinary; the beyond brilliant dark cinematography and canted angles elevate the film to masterpiece status. A lot of modern audiences will be able to appreciate TTM since it's a very thrilling and compelling movie which doesn't suffer from a slow pace like many old movies do. This is an extraordinary collection of masterful elements with everyone involved at the top of their game. Even the composer, with the zither score, knocks it out of the park.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many people have recommended this movie very highly to me, and maybe I went in expecting too much. Don't get me wrong, this movie is the very definition of a noir, but that's also where it fails. I've tried to watch The Third Man from start to finish twice, and both times I ended up falling asleep and having to finish after my unexpected nap. For a crime movie, it isn't very exciting, and if you miss one or two bits of conversation the whole rest of the film will be confusing. Maybe noir just really isn't my thing, because I appreciated the lighting style and general cinematography, but I just couldn't seem to stay interested in the plot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some of the best cinematography...ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently watch The Third Man after meaning to for a few years. It popped up on Netflix so I gave it a whirl. The Third Man has to be one of the greatest films of the 1940's, the decade definitely went out with a bang. After amazing films such as Casablanca, the 40's were really on of the best decades when it comes to cinema.Enough rambling and on the The Third Man.This film grabbed my attention from the very first frame. I was deeply into the story and found myself being more and more absorbed by it. The story is fairly simple; a man goes to Vienna to find that his friend is dead and he suspects some foul-play. Easy enough. Obviously, being in the Film-Noir genre, there are many twists and turns and you guessed it, a Third Man. If the story itself doesn't grab you from the get- go, the cinematography will draw you in. This film looks absolutely amazing. This film should be used in film classes until the end of time. I swear. The ending of the film is shot so beautifully in the underbelly of Vienna that I was seriously on the edge of my seat (couch). Do yourself a BIG favour and watch this movie right now, if for no other reason than the cinematography. Recommend to EVERYONE. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Third Man.......Watch It</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Third Man is a great movie. The four principle actors...Orson Welles, Trevor Howard, Joseph Cotten, and Auda Valli are fantastic. The story and screen-play by Graham Green is superb. The music by Anton Karas is perfect. The photography by Robert Krascer is brilliant. The direction by Carol Reed is innovative and faultless. This is the original noir classic. Its Vienna after WW2 and racketeering is rife. The naive Holly Martins (a small time novelist from the U.S.A.) stumbles into town. He has to get smart quickly as he discovers that fact can be stranger than fiction....and much more deadly. Made in 1949 it remains an exemplary film in all ways. To-days "special effects" and CGI are what movie goers now want....which is a real shame. It means that the writers can get away with murder----by coming up with poor scripts, again and again. This is an INTELLIGENT movie....it requires full attention. They really cant make em like this anymore. This is a movie which is rightly celebrated by anyone who loves high class motion pictures.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A morally complex film-noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A pulp fiction writer travels to post-WWII Vienna to catch up with an old friend called Harry Lime. He immediately is told that his friend is dead but things are not quite what they seem?The Vienna of The Third Man is a place in uproar. It's a divided city in turmoil, ripe for exploitation. In other words, despite its European setting, it's a perfect location for a film-noir. The sense of discomfort in this place is emphasized by the camera-work which is consistently off-kilter. The strange and unusual angles create the atmosphere of a city that is far from serene. The story itself reflects this by the actions of the enigmatic Harry Lime. For despite being a charismatic lead character he is basically a highly immoral man, who has caused a great deal of harm. This complexity is reflected in the famous ending which does not end in a typical Hollywood way. The woman simply walks past the 'hero', her attachment to her dead immoral lover cannot be so easily overcome, although her contempt for the weak man who betrayed him is perfectly evident. Love is shown to be less idealistic and more real. Good doesn't really win out in the end, in The Third Man there really are no winners.Excellently directed by Carol Reed, with terrific photography, this is a very good looking film. Then there's the famous music that just shouldn't work but for some reason it does. Perhaps it's its incongruous nature that's the key. It seems slightly out of place just like everything else. Orson Welles is of course the actor everyone remembers, and he is perfect as Lime, but Joseph Cotton and Alida Valli are also very good in their respective roles. All in all this is a superior film-noir and well worth your time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While I have difficulty watching some "older" films because of their dated acting styles, The Third Man was a treat. It was mature and surprisingly dark for a film of the forties. In fact, I can't think of another film from this era that is as downbeat. I'm no expert, mind you, but The Third Man easily sets itself apart from the crowd.Lots of people have commented on the performances of Welles and Joseph Cotton, but the noirish photography was the thing that has remained with me. The great chase through the sewers: all those tilted angles and dark shadows.And what can I say about the ending? I kept expecting them to tie up the romantic subplot with a silly reunion. Instead, we get a sad and completely unexpected ending that leaves Cotton hanging. Bravo!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a true classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The more I see this film - and I've seen it many times - the more I find to admire in it. As far as I'm concerned, that means it's a classic. A real one.Beyond the usual, well-deserved praise for script, photography, editing, direction, music and every single performance, something more personal has developed in my regard, my affection, for The Third Man. Having been born into and brought up in the Cold War atmosphere symbolised by the divided Vienna documented so memorably by Carol Reed and his team, the portrayal by Alida Valli of a woman caught in its web has become increasingly significant with each successive viewing. Over the years, the set-piece final shot has become so poignant for me that it's become impossible to watch without tears welling up in my eyes. I mention this only because I know there are those who find the camera angles and the lighting - the visual art of the film, if you like - self-conscious. I think the opposite: they are as they are because Reed and his cameraman Robert Krasker are capturing emotions in picture form, emotions that one could have wished would have gone away, concerning the desolation of war, and the moral blurring that the ruin of war encourages. In every gesture, every look that Valli gives, that desolation is evident. It is a great, great performance in a great, great film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was thinking about this film on my way in to work this morning and I realized I couldn't remember if it was made in the 40's or 50's. It's unusual that I can pinpoint these things, but I realized that Orson Welles' cool portrayal of Harry Lime is the reason why. Not cool as in hip, mind you, cool as in unperturbed. Selling placebo medicines on the black market to desperate people in post ww2 Vienna, Harry fakes his own death so that he may operate under the radar. He feels almost total indifference towards his victims, which is the surprise of this story. Most war stories of the day tell you very heavy-handedly who the bad guy is, but Harry Lime is a likable looking guy, who, despite his indifference, bears no malice towards anyone. Do we despise his callousness or succumb to his innate charm &amp; moxie? It's unusual that a movie from this era will let you decide that for yourself, much less make it so that you must.Beautifully played, fantastically composed &amp; lit, and an amazing score. This film is one of my all-time favorites.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Once you get past the deep, entrancing shadows, the canted framing, the unique music, and the brief and wonderful performance by Welles, there isn't much else to this film. It seems like Carol Reed couldn't decide whether this film should be plot-driven or character-driven. An ideal film would have strong characters and a strong plot, but one normally takes presidence over the other. The acting was very good, but the cast (save Welles and "Porter") generally gave incredibly dry, detached, understated performances, and thus, the characters are not interesting enough to compensate for the inefficacy of the narrative.*SPOILERS* I would've liked to see, for example, Holly Martins show actual grief over the initial (supposed) death of Lime, to show fear and paranoia in the face of conspiracy, to show compassion and tenderness toward his female interest, to show horror and disbelief at the ineptitude and impotency of the police, and to show some hint of moral conflict when killing his former best friend. That would have been much more interesting than the dimensionless, whiskey-drowsed, hardheaded nuisance portrayed by Cotten.Harsh, but Fair.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Death of the Author? Kill me again - one for that desert island.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The life of the avid film-goer can actually be a depressing, disillusioning thing. After the initial gleeful devouring of the canon (about 300 movies), and the joyous stumbling over the odd undiscovered gem, the cineaste must be content with an endless trail of largely diminishing returns. The only counter against this is brilliant films which never disappoint on the 18th viewing, such as Vertigo, The Wizard Of Oz, The Wild Bunch... ...and The Third Man, a film containing such multitudes that it makes you forget that the majority of British cinema is parochial, unambitious, self-satisfied rubbish. A great film is by definition a labyrinth: whatever your mood, be it emotional or intellectual, you pick up a new thread of interpretation, and find yourself in places you've never been before, yet by the end, everything still doesn't quite fit, and you have to begin again. And you know that there is nothing in the world you want to do more.This time around, I noted the theme of authority and authoriality. Authors write books, and have total control over their characters and narrative. Authorities (less obviously) have the same power over the people they govern. These two concepts make up the film's two quests, which in reality is only one. Our hero, Holly Martins, is a novelist, who continually claims that he will write the story he is actually participating in. Calloway is the authority (as morally detached as any modern writer) with the similar quest to find Harry Lime. And yet it is Harry who is the real author of the plot: everything happens to his plan, his power is otherworldly - he is truly godlike, without body (being dead). When we finally do see him, he is lit like a devil, or surveying Vienna like a deity. The opening credits show us a zither playing a tune, but we don't see who's playing it. And who is the jovial black marketeer, who narrates the opening montage, and then vanishes from the film? When Harry dies, the story ends, reaches the deadlock of the astonishingly, bravely bleak closing scene.The Third Man is that rare film - perfect in every way, a popular narrative entertainment capable of holding great moral, artistic, philosophical, but most importantly, emotional weight. Joseph Cotten gives the greatest male lead performance in all cinema, yet it is Orson Welles, as the story's author, whose boyish charm, and weary, nihilistic evil must drive the film, even in his absence.The movie is incredibly bleak - about people, about art, but it doesn't seem that way. The whole thing plays like a Nabokovian black comedy (Harry Lime IS Humbert Humbert) - genuine terror frequently slips into farce, and vice versa. The smooth, coherent narrative is always disrupted by non-sequiters and wild goose chases. Karas' score prefigures those of Morricone's spaghetti westerns, in his use of music not as a subliminal dramatic accompaniment, but as an ironic Brechtian commentator on the action, yet also sympathetic and yearning. Vienna is filmed as a sunken ship. Like Lolita, the film is obsessed by doubles (Holly and Harry, Holly and Calloway etc.), but, also like Lolita, this doubling is parodied, and there is no hope in resolution. The closure of the 'male' detective story is confounded by the hero's lack of progress in the romantic plot. Despite the film's cynicism, I was in tears when it ended, my ethics torn to shreds. I love The Third Man, and have so much to say about it (I love the demonisation of children - South Park is spiritually indebted to Greene)I could write a book. Do yourself one favour in your life and watch it; you'll never have to fall in love again. Incidentally, is Harry gay?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sinister thriller set in atmospheric Vienna</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Third Man starts and ends with a funeral, and unfolds through the rubble and gloom of hivernal post-war Vienna, where the military police of the occupying powers have a full time job keeping tabs on shifty characters and black marketeers. Scripted by Grahame Greene, the film starts notably wordy. Concentration is required as the plot twists and turns, cleverly casting the viewer as the slightly desperate but determined Holly Martins as he tries to make sense of what has happened to his friend, Harry Lime. We are craftily led to a number of moral dilemmas as we weigh the value of friendship against the unseen impact of the racketeers.On the way we meet a whole string of shady, cynical and world-weary characters, each struggling to maintain a precarious existence amongst penury and shortage. The slow pace picks up noticeably with the justly celebrated appearance of Orson Welles as Lime, all heavy overcoat and louche charm.As one might expect from a Grahame Greene story, the subject matter is deadly serious yet laced with mordant humour and penetrating observation. The photography and lighting is pure, unalloyed pleasure, the Viennese Gothic architecture a crenellated marvel of contrasting greys and deep blacks, and shadows receding with to the sound of running footsteps on the wet cobblestones. And the zither music; yes, you will like that.The film mostly belongs to Welles and Cotton in the lead roles, though Trevor Howard presents a marvellous study of restrained distaste as Calloway, and Bernard Lee (the future 'M' in the James Bond series) gives an excellent comic turn as his straightforward sergeant. The beautiful but remote Alida Valli is good too as the haunted girlfriend of Lime.Expect to be rewarded in direct proportion to length of your attention span, and to remember the ending shot for a very long time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Look at how many perfect scores this community has given "The Third Man" (TTM). I am very glad I read the ideas from Cosmoeticadotcom ("Great", Cosmoeticadotcom, 1 September 2010). Cosmeticadotcom argues that many of the memorable visuals were actually composed by Orson Welles. As many times as I have seen TTM (somewhere between 25 and 30 times), it never occurred to me that of course, this must have happened. It is entirely possible that Carol Reed repeatedly asked Welles for help with the direction, and Welles maintained a proud silence over his contributions in the years that followed.TTM is one of the rarest cinematic experiences where every separate piece works. The story telling is so exquisite that the thrills that are produced are greatly fulfilling. Two scenes particularly stand out, the magnificent entrance of Harry Lime (Orson Welles) and the Ferris Wheel scene. These few minutes are sublime, as great as anything else in cinema.TTM uses foreshadowing a great deal. This is most obvious with the eerie child who annoys Holly Martins (Joseph Cotton) when he is near Anna (Alida Valli). No need to clarify who the child represents. Major Calloway (Trevor Howard) and Paine (Bernard Lee) both repeatedly refer to the western fiction of Martins. The final image from the sewer sequence matches and contrasts nicely with what we know of Martins's novel, "the Lone Rider of Santa Fe". Only the lone rider doesn't exactly enjoy his transformation. There is a lot of life in this film.The corruption that Holly Martins uncovers is nearly absolute, yet he insists on finding out for himself what everyone else seems to know. When Calloway unsuccessfully implores Martins to "be sensible" at the conclusion we know that much of the world-weary cynicism on display establishes a man's view of love; the last image reminds us that it is a bitter-sweet cocktail even when it arrives.TTM treats the audience as it is just as savvy and cunning as the characters, making Holly Martins the only boob in the theater. This helps us to favorably consider Harry Lime's morality, particularly as he is first betrayed, then hunted like a sewer rat."The Third Man" is a cinematic treasure that demands repeated viewing. It has superior atmosphere, suspense, thrills, superlative acting, a perfectly minimalist zither score, a very corrupt set of characters and wonderful direction. It is greater than the sum of its parts; it is exceptional.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So a re-watch, and i was very interested in seeing this one again, because this is considered to be a masterpiece, and i actually found it overrated the first time i saw it, but i remember being very tired and not in a good mood when i first saw this, so that probably affected the way i saw the movie, and that was why i felt like i needed to re-watch this, after i had long seen this movie.The Third Man is directed by Carol Reed and it stars Orson Welles, Joseph Cotten, Alida Valli, Wilfrid Hyde-White, Bernard Lee and Trevor Howard. And i got to say that unsurprisingly my opinion has changed, the thing is that it changed much more than i though it would, because this is quite something.An out of work pulp fiction novelist, Holly Martins, arrives in a post war Vienna divided into sectors by the victorious allies, and where a shortage of supplies has lead to a flourishing black market. He arrives at the invitation of an ex-school friend, Harry Lime, who has offered him a job, only to discover that Lime has recently died in a peculiar traffic accident.From talking to Lime's friends and associates Martins soon notices that some of the stories are inconsistent, and determines to discover what really happened to Harry Lime. The Third Man is almost a perfect Noir, although not the column one, a man trying to find the truth, he sees himself dealing with criminals, he sees himself in love, he is completely confused and Joseph Cotten shows that perfectly on screen. And its funny to think that this 64 year old movie, actually had me in the edge of my seat, not knowing what was going to happen, quite a few times.The movie's power is enlarged by some AMAZING cinematography, The Third Man, might have the best cinematography i have seen from a movie that was made in the first half of the century. Most of the movie is shot in some peculiar angles, the shadows are amazingly beautiful, the cinematography adds A LOT to the movie, we feel this gloomy feeling on the air, it truly captures the devastated Europe after WW2. Quite weird to see that Robert Krasker only got this Academy Award win and nomination, because he shows here some very impressive work. Another two great technical things that the movies has, is its score by Anton Karas and its editing by Oswald Hafenrichter, both very impressive worthy of AT least a nomination.Then we get to the performances, and Joseph Cotten is the star of the movie, to say that Orson Wells is the star, would be very unfair to Cotten who does here some of the best work of his career, quite sad to see that such a good and charming actor never got any recognition. Alida Valli, is probably more known for some foreign language movies, but this one is by far the best English movie she did, she great in the movie, she does not play the usual girl that was in almost every movie made at this time. She proves that in the end of the movie, and what an ending. Orson Wells is undeniably great, as the charming manipulative villain, but the thing is that, i felt like he was not enough on the movie, i mean the plot is about this character, but just has 15 minutes of screen time, but he is great in every single minute.Carol Reed does here some fantastic job, he truly made a masterpiece here, an almost flawless movie that manages to survive time, a great story, with a big moral issue ( should you support your friends even when they are doing bad things, or should you try to stop him no matter what consequences) does rat on your friend make you a bad person, we know what Anna Schmidt thinks.The Third Man also has some great charming performances, good writing, amazing cinematography,score, editing and direction, it is one of the best movies of the 40's, and i would not raise an eyebrow if someone told me that this was some of the best work he had ever seen.

		<shortDescription>A classic thriller set in post war Vienna</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the years after the war Vienna wasn't a safe place to make a living; but it could be a profitable one. Holly Martins heads there because his friend Harry Lime has told him he can get him a job; there is only one problem; when Holly arrives at his friend's apartment he learns that he was run over and killed ten minutes earlier! The authorities don't seem very sympathetic either; claiming that Harry was a black marketer. Holly doesn't believe this so sets about finding out what happens on Harry's last day; he hears from a friend who was there that Harry had been injured then he and another friend carried him off the road before he died. Another witness however claims that Harry was clearly dead immediately after the accident and there were in fact three people carrying him out of the street? who was the third man? As Holly continues to try to find out what happened he befriends Harry's girlfriend Anna although she has problems of her own as the authorities discover that she is using a forged passport. Things get more dangerous when the witness is killed and Holly is suspected and Holly makes a startling discovery about his old friend that I won't spoil here.This film may be over sixty years old but it is still a gripping thriller and shows that a good story doesn't need non-stop action and CGI explosions to be thrilling; in fact quite the opposite; it is the brooding atmosphere and the brilliant use of light and dark that makes this work. Being in black and white gives the ever present shadows that extra darkness. Stars Joseph Cotten and Alida Valli but in fine performances as Holly and Anna and Orson Welles is great in his small role as Harry Lime. The story is interesting and when we learn just what crime Harry was involved in it comes as quite a surprise as it becomes clear that he wasn't just profiteering and his business had a cost in lives. If you want a gripping thriller and don't feel the need for car chases and explosions every few minutes then I heartily recommend this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not to miss : the enigma Anna Schmidt - Alida Valli</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After having read lots of reviews about The Third Man, I can't help but notice that hardly anybody seems to consider Alida Valli's absolutely stunning performance as Anna Schmidt's character.Cotten, Wells &amp; Trevor Howard are marvelous in their own way, not only in their general rendition of the character's behavior, but in that all of them seem to see growing a huge crush about her, in the unusual way that for each of them it is contended by... the invincible surge of a respect for her feelings that restrains and even conceals any waves of exhibition of this underground passion. All that, because Anna Schmidt herself has a trend, a story of her own, that makes here not being just Harry Lime's girlfriend, Holly Martin's dulcinea, or Callahan's protected spot.One of the subtle sub-part of the plot is that harry may have done all what he did to be able to offer Anna the best affordable living in this post-war depressed Vienna, and tries to keep her safe from the trouble caused by his links with her by showing himself seemingly indifferent or even cynical attitude when he's in front of his American pal Cotten. But in the ferris wheel, Lime can't help but write her name with his finger on the window. That's almost all we get about his feelings about her. Almost ? Not really. His so famous hideout in the street door went after he was quite openly going to Anna's apartment and stopped on his way seeing that she wasn't alone. And he stays here, stuck both by the necessity to stay hidden and to wait for Holly's departure. He may have spent all the night here. In another way, Lime's open walk towards Anna's apartment indicate that she might as well be aware that Lime was undead, not only because the others (Baron Kurtz, Popesco and the doctor) where part of his 'death'. And the way she deals softly with this in front of Holly/Cotten says enough about her being so far from uni-dimensional.In a way very rarely shown in any movies, Alida Valli wonderfully carries Anna's multi-layered personality,by acting on a low-key mode, almost docile with authorities, almost sincere, but showing a subtile sensitiveness to everything that's going on around her. You can't help but being astonished by the way she deals with situations instantly, with all these flashes of reactivity that are needed in crisis situations, to avoid things getting worse. She fast realizes that Cotten is more a burden than a help, even if he is supposed to be Harry's friend.So, what about her own feelings about Harry Lime ? Is/was she in love with him ? She doesn't say so. The most we can imagine is that she feels enough gratitude and affection for what he did to help her that she won't deliberately get him into trouble, even if she learns his misdeeds. But it has nothing to do with blindness. She is not happy with that. That is just the terrible tribute to pay to war.A shift seems to have been delivered in the whole storyline when Orson Welles wrote this speech about the free-of-taxes, the Borgias and the cuckoo clock. Indeed, that had NOTHING to do with the original story, where Harry Lime had to deal with the tragic consequences of traffic with penicillin. Are we supposed to believe the man had nothing to grief about with the children's fate ? I don't think so. A penicillin black market has nothing to do with a drug market, because such a product was supposed to provide help to people, not harm.Graham Greene's Harry Lime certainly never considered children's lives as if they were only 'dots' seen from the stratospheres of greed and evil. Orson Welles input about that point was just some kind of recall to recent events where 'spots' on the ground killing people was known by everybody in Europe. But even if it is an undeed shift, it fits perfectly with the fate of the story, because Cotten and the audience HAD to hear something like that to see Lime as some incarnation of pure evil, without pointing other fellows like Limes roaming around and well. We don't have to forget that three direct murders went along the story : a false victim, a was-to-be witness, then a policeman : there must be some kind of explanation to all this.So lets return to a last look on Anna/Alida Valli's fate. It's very important to remember that Alida Valli's real life had payed the price of a double terrible tragedy during the war : she lost her childhood boyfriend AND her mother, executed by communists. AFTER she had been a highly acclaimed actress during the fascist era in Italy, having to deal with a critical and courageous shift in her political stance at a crucial moment of Italian history, keeping her honor safe.When Anna Schmidt, says she only plays in comedies, there are two ways to understand it : on stage on the surface, but also off stage, to stay alive and free AND respected, in a world where it was so difficult. But playing comedies was exactly what Alida Valli, an immense actress, NEVER did in her real life, glued by her destiny and war to play only in tragedies, showing all the rainbow's colors of her desperate loneliness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Truly Perfect Artifact</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Third Man is the most beautifully photographed film of all time. This achievement is director Carol Reed's, and his alone. The dominating force behind the film is Harry Lime, a name heard countless times before we are given a face to go along with it, this achievement is belongs to Graham Greene and Orson Welles. The trust between celluloid and the audience comes from the film's hero, Holly Martins. This achievement belongs to Joseph Cotten. But its the atmosphere that is the most endearing aspect of this classic 1949 treasure of a movie. This is film presents an engrossing experience from start to finish, and absolutely everything about it is pitch perfect. From Vienna at midnight to Trevor Howard's often dismissed, but completely wonderful performance as Major Colloway (Not Callahan, He's British, Not Irish). Orson Welles delivers one of the best performances of all time, due partly to the scene atop a Ferris Wheel, and mostly to his absence, and the care taken by writer Graham Greene in creating a perfect character without ever actually seeing him. Joseph Cotten is superb, hasn't been this good since his lead role in Shadow Of A Doubt or his strong support in Citizen Kane. He makes Holly Martins down to earth, brave, headstrong, and truly American. Alida Valli is breathtaking, and because of her, Anna Schmidt is a character we take joy in watching, making Anna Schmidt one of the greater love interest in the Film Noir genre. The photography is incredible, the city enormous and isolating, the characters are canon, the story is timeless, and the film is perfect. The only hands down and flat out perfect film of the 1940s. A true treasure. A real gift.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic rendition of a tale of murder and mystery seething with deceit in post war Austria,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What makes this movie remarkable and unique apart from its great screenplay and cinematic effects is the musical background performed on an unusual stringed instrument, played by Anton Karas, the zither, which adds a repetitive haunting theme of suspense and intrigue to this well made production.In post WW11 Vienna, American writer Holly Martins (played by Joseph Cotten) arrives there to seek out work with an old friend Harry Lime only to discover that he has been killed in a motor vehicle traffic accident. Martins investigates.The plot thickens when he finds inconsistencies in the stories of witnesses to the incident with a hushed up look of fear and non cooperation on the part of those who knew Lime. It appears from the two men who picked him up from the roadway that there was a third man involved.Martins becomes all the more suspicious after meeting his loyal girlfriend Anna (Alida Valli) already under surveillance by the Allied military powers of the city and eventually the murky world of Lime emerges in the dimly lit streets of Vienna, with his reputation as a racketeer and black market dealer being exposed.Lime is also pursued by Major Calloway, (played by Trevor Howard), of the British Occupational Forces, who does not at first believe that Lime is still alive after attending his funeral, but then after that was his sighting by Martins in a doorway one dark night.Eventually, Lime, (now revealed truly, for what he is and acted superbly by Orson Welles), comes into focus with a conclusion well played out in the underground sewers of Vienna where he tries to make a dash for freedom from the authorities and his flight from justice.Interesting drama, shot perfectly in black and white filmography, backed by good performances from Welles and Cotten.But who was the third man?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Third Man made in 1949 is one of the most perfect movies ever made. It had great acting,directing,music,lighting and every single thing is done to perfection. The score is so beautiful and fantastic that it acquires a life of its own and becomes a character in the movie. The acting is outstanding and every one of the interaction seem very real as if they are really taking place.What I love most about the movie is its attention detail in terms of acting. There is a scene where the Romanian looks back at the waiter and chides him for no ice as he shakes his head in pooh ? poohing manner. Another at the end where the priest puts down the spoon in a huff. These scenes make everything more natural.The lighting like in most Film Noirs is brilliant. However it is a little bright or too well light by film noir standards. The scene on the wheel where Harry is in shadows while being sinister while he steps out when saying something good is brilliantly done. The first shot of Harry grinning and then at the end when shots of his wretched face are shown are really great.The movie has some great quotes that are mostly delivered by the girl character and of course there is the cuckoo clock quote which Welles himself has written. I would like to add that the cuckoo clock however didn't come from Switzerland.The Third Man is an entertaining film. It is quite light and never does it become overtly dark or sinister. Like most other genre movies in those days it doesn't restrict itself to being just a Film Noir but it transcends that and becomes something more.It talks about making choices. Whether betraying a friend who is evil is wrong or right. Who is the good person the one who betrays or the one who protects such a friend. The Third Man was made in 1949. I saw it 61 years later but it hasn't aged a day . It is a timeless masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All of the technical aspects of The Third Man are superb, including the cinematography by Robert Krasker, and the memorable scoring by Anton Karas, whose zither music became a mid-century craze. It's truly amazing how much emotion was wrung out of one very particular instrument. The Criterion Collection DVD package has the British version of the film, which is longer (104 to 93 minutes) than the American version, and superior. The British version opens with a voice-over narration by Reed, while the American version's voice-over is by Cotton, as Martins. Aside from a slightly better framing of the film, Reed's voice acts as an anonymous omniscient, whereas Cotton's voice-over sets up the film as possibly being too intimate a viewpoint of Martins. It is a two disk package, and one of the best the company has produced since it went 'lite' in its features, after adopting the semi-circle large C logo. The transfer is shown in a 1.33: aspect ratio, and it's a good print- not perfect, but good. The second disk has many good features, such as a 90 minute long making of documentary called Shadowing The Third Man; an hour long 1968 episode of the British television series Omnibus, featuring an audio interview with Graham Greene- one quite daring in its presentation, called Graham Greene: The Hunted Man; an episode of the radio series The Lives Of Harry Lime; a 30 minute Austrian documentary called Who Was the Third Man?; a Lux Radio Theatre adaptation of the film; Joseph Cotton's American version voice-over for the film; and a few other minor things, including the film's American trailer. There is also a booklet with a few minor essays on the film, from Luc Sante, Charles Drazin, and Philip Kerr. Even better features await on the first disk which, aside from housing the film, has a video introduction by the world's most famous ex-filmmaker, and 'personal' pal of Orson Welles, Peter Bogdanovich, and two audio commentaries on the film. The first is with filmmaker Steven Soderbergh and screenwriter Tony Gilroy. They make an odd pair, as neither had any even indirect association with the film. It's enjoyable, as the two banter on in filmese, but compared to Soderbergh's commentary with Lem Dobbs on The Limey, it simply does not compare- probably due to the fact that Gilroy is a hack screenwriter of Hollywood junk, whereas Dobbs is not. Much better is the commentary track by film scholar Dana Polan. As with his review of Angels With Dirty Faces, Polan is thorough, detailed, scene specific, and enthused to the point of never letting any dead spots break through his audio. He has, in the two commentaries I've listened to, proved to be a rival to both film critic Roger Ebert and film director Francis Ford Coppola as the best commentarian going, although he does err in claiming that the blank slate Anna is as important a character in the film as Martins. Overall, it's an excellent package.The Third Man won the Grand Prix at the 1949 Cannes Film Festival, the British Academy Award for Best Film, and the Academy Award for Best Black and White Cinematography in 1950. It deserved those honors and more, for, despite the claims of would be glad-handers of the film, it was well above standard Hitchcockian thrillers. It is also, along with Casablanca, often pointed to as an exception to the auteur theory of filmmaking, in terms of making great cinema. Of course, since that theory is cracked, it matters little, and since Casablanca is not a great film, to begin with, it's not an apt connection. But it is certainly a film noir, as Harry Lime is probably the best, if not most perfect, antihero that genre's ever come up with. He is both unscrupulous in general, but with a definite set of principles regarding those around him. He is capable of cruelty and betrayal, but also decency. And finally, to return to the obvious, that this film far more easily falls into the canon of Welles than Reed, let me state again that I, in no way, doubt, that Reed directed many, if not most, of the scenes of the film. But the best scenes, the ones that are remembered; those with arresting visuals and splendid speeches (including the overlapping of dialogue)- those are the Welles touch, and Welles clearly had an enormous impact on the film's direction and overall flow: in short, he was the main force, if not the primogenitor, of the project. He said so, and implied so, on more than one occasion, and even in the extra features of the DVD, in an interview where Welles dutifully honors his commitment to denial, one can almost see the sour turn of his face and the hesitance in his voice to disown his baby. By contrast, Reed went on to direct many more mediocre to solid films in his otherwise forgettable career. And for those who have tried to, in a latter day fashion, claim that Reed was a far better director than that he really was, all I can say is, why was the man only touched with greatness during the lone project that involved Welles, and no others? Simply put: greatness in art does not spike out of nowhere; it is part of an arc that is discernible. And if one still disbelieves that, just watch the rest of the films in the two men's respective canons, and it's clear that The Third Man is more Welles than Reed, for the creative impulse simply does not work as the current mythology of the film would have one believe, no matter what any commission might tell you!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Practically Perfect in Every Way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Holly Martins goes to Vienna to meet up with old buddy Harry Lime (Orson Welles), only to find that Lime has been accidentally run over. But things don't add up right, and Holly suspects murder... and the contradictory answers Lime's friends are giving him don't make this suspicion any less clear.To get prepared for this film, I read the book first. Some of the details have been removed from Graham Greene's novella, not surprisingly -- sadly, they very played down the Dexter mix-up, and the Zane Grey incident. Whereas in the book he is mistaken for an author of some fame, in the film he is simply assumed to be knowledgeable on novels as he is an author. It's a much lesser problem, and also much less humorous because of this.There are also some name changes: Rollo becomes Holly (and never Buck Dexter), Cooler becomes Pepescu, and Winkler becomes Winkle. There's really no clear indication of why these changes have been made, with the possible exception of making the American a Hungarian. That fits the plot slightly better.There is some dispute over whether Carol Reed or Orson Welles directed, what with the weird camera angles that Welles is known for and Reed not. I do not know any more than anyone else on this matter. I can see the stylistic cinematography, and I understand that Welles was blacklisted. But, yet, they denied it to their deaths... and I would assume the truth would leak out over the decades. But, who knows? Much has been made of the cuckoo speech, which is factually empty. I won't touch on that. What I will touch on is the zither... the zither makes this soundtrack probably one of the most unique in film history, and one of the most fitting. As odd as the sounds were, I never felt they were misplaced.The British cop, Calloway, was not unlike Mike Myers in "Inglorious Basterds"... but I doubt this was any inspiration. Either way, "The Third Man" has been far too long overlooked. Sure, it's known in the right circles, but not really so much outside of them... until recently, I had never heard of it. That was a mistake -- one of the finer films I've seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the only Carol Reed film I've watched so far, and I most definitely do not intend it to be the last. The story is immediately engaging, and the setting, post-WWII Vienna, where crime is an all too common thing, is stunning and draws you in. This also has amazing cinematography and editing, with some camera angles that I have not seen in anything from the late 40's, or many other places, for that matter. The lighting is also gorgeous. I understand that this is British Noir, a sub-genre I don't believe I've been exposed to before. The script is marvelous. Every character is great, well-developed and credible, and the dialog is all sharp and delivered with perfect timing. The plot is brilliant, compelling and intriguing, and not so convoluted that you can't follow it, or even require a second viewing to piece it all together, and the mystery and its conclusion are satisfying. Every acting performance is spot-on, and there is a lot of charm and chemistry to it. Heck, *the kid*, whose age I cannot possibly imagine had hit double digits at the time, is quite good, and certainly convincing. This actually uses other languages than English when it makes sense, German and Russian, often broken. Tension and suspense is built up well in this. The only negative I can really say about this is that the score, whenever it appears in the last half of the picture, is disruptive and draws attention to itself in how little it fits in tone with what's going on. I have experienced that in other older movies. There is a bit of disturbing content and brief mild to moderate violence in this. I recommend this to any fan of those who made it, and this type of fiction. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"I don't want another murder in this case, and you were born to be murdered..."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Had I gone into the film cold, I would have thought it came from Hitchcock, employing elements from that director's bag of cinematic tricks. You've got the spiral staircase motif initially seen way back in 1929's "Blackmail" and later given more profound treatment in 1958's "Vertigo". There's also the amusement park background that provided suspense in the latter part of "Strangers On A Train". But the thing that really appealed to me was the insertion of a key Hitchcockian element suggested by the movie's title. The 'third man' upon reflection seems to be one of the all time great maguffins of cinema history. In all actuality, there never really was a 'third man', unless one considers Harry Lime to be that character. For that though, he would have had to be at his own 'death' as the unknown individual who helped two other men remove a hit and run victim from the middle of a road.Which upon reflection, makes the core premise of the story very confusing. Not that Harry Lime wouldn't have wanted to fake his own death, but why didn't anyone who attended his funeral realize that it wasn't Harry in the coffin? The real victim wasn't in a very good position to hide his identity, so how did the appearance of Harry Lime's burial come to be accepted as fact? And why was that body so easily identifiable upon exhumation as the medical orderly Joseph Harbin who worked for Harry in the illicit penicillin trade? If you really think about these issues, most of the story seems to unravel regarding the main plot.Yet the story works on an entirely different level once you get beyond that particular point. Harry Lime winds up alive halfway through the picture, and spends the rest of his time trying to stay a step ahead of his friend Holly Martins (Joseph Cotten), who's intent on solving the mystery behind Harry's 'death'. What makes the film so intriguing is the deft camera work and the battered post-war setting of Vienna, Austria. The picture simply wouldn't work in color, it's the stark black and white cinematography that contributes to the harrowing cat and mouse game between Harry, Martins and the authorities.You really have to study Orson Welles' performance in the picture to see just what a great actor he was. He doesn't have a lot of screen time here, but everything he does is memorable, right from that first haunting appearance under the street lamp. His conversation with Martins on the ferris wheel is perfectly nuanced and laced with palpable threat; it's just a perfect scene. You have to go well beyond the subtlety of his outward demeanor to realize what a true low life his character actually is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Orson Welles's 3rd great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Third Man" functions as a sort of half film noir, half look at post-WWII Vienna. The plot centers on Holly Martin (Joseph Cotten) learning of his friend's (Orson Welles) death in Vienna, meeting various and sundry strange people, and getting a big surprise at the end. Probably the movie's strongest aspect is the zither music. You can feel it moving the film along, almost as much as the mysterious setting does. But when they set up the trick at the end, it's especially neat how they set it up! Even if you know what's going to happen, you still have to admire what they did.Anyway, it's one of Orson Welles's many great movies, along with "Citizen Kane" and "The Lady from Shanghai" (I have as yet never seen "Touch of Evil"). Definitely check it out. Also starring Alida Valli.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, Third Man is one of the greatest films ever made. Yes, it has some fantastic cinematography (especially in how it captured the shadows and the mystery of Vienna). Yes, it had the terrific writing of Graham Greene. Yes, it had tremendous acting by Joseph, Valli and Orson Welles. It had the memorable -- sometimes irritating -- zither music.BUT it also had one of the best endings in all of film. In the last scene Anna (the former girlfriend of Harry Lime) is walking out the cemetery after Lime's funeral. Holly Martins (Cotten) is waiting for her at the cemetery's exit. For nearly a minute we see Anna walking at a steady pace through the cemetery, with the nearly bare trees losing the last of their leaves and Holly hoping she will stop. A small part of me wanted her to stop -- but if she had stopped to talk to the man who betrayed her lover, we all would have BOOed her off the screen. Instead, she continues to walk past him without even a look in his direction. The absolutely perfect ending to a perfect film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I recently saw this film for the first time and was well entertained. I was particularly intrigued by the soundtrack, though. Very different. Does anyone know what music was used? I am a tango dancer and found the strains of the violin very reminiscent of some of the music we dance to. I know there is a main theme that is repeated quite frequently throughout the movie. Unfortunately, I don't recognize it and was hoping someone else might. It would be wonderful if someone knew the the performers as well as the composition. I wonder if this information would be available in the jumbo, super sized version of membership. I'm not able to spring for it now and so would appreciate any further information. Seems I've filled the 10 line requirement.TIA-----Peter</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>that famous fifteen minutes ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is indeed the brief appearance of Orson Welles that stands out from this Carol Reed film, famed also for its zither theme and those shots in the depths of the sewers. Joseph Cotten plays ?Holly' Martins, a writer trying to locate his old friend Harry Lime in a corrupt Vienna. But Harry has been killed, or so Martins is told ?Notable for an excellent supporting role from that wonderful character player, Trevor Howard, and for appearances from the likes of Wilfred Hyde-White (in a role merged from two intended for UK film regulars Radford and Wayne), Bernard Lee, and Alida Valli as Lime's girlfriend; it is the moment when Welles steps from the shadowed doorway that lingers in the memory; his speech about the Swiss and cuckoo-clocks (his own moment of inspiration, not Graham Greene's).Greene's screenplay is sparse and clever. I love the way that when cornered and forced to address a cultural gathering, Martins claims a leading pulp fiction author of westerns as his key influence (while he has never heard of James Joyce). The famous ending is also of note, that long, long walk past the eyes that do not see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am sure that being posted on this website, I am greatly in the minority of people who do not believe that The Third Man is the greatest film ever made.In fact I do not really rate it at all. Having studied the book at school before having seen the film, I felt that the film was a great disappointment for several reasons. I think that I am also in the minority in believing that the book is however extremely good, and in my opinion the film does not do it justice.The whole book is based around irony. Even the very minor details in the story are ironic, such as in the opening few chapters, Martins tries to hit Calloway, however later on in the book, both adjoin, and help each other to find Harry Lime, because it is an achievement that both parties want to accomplish. Of course, all of the main events in the story are ironic as well, such as Rollo ending up killing his best friend. I believe that the film ruins this, because the entire way through the film, there is swaggering and brash music, that encourages the viewer to recognise the many moments of great ironic value, instead of leaving the audience to discover this for themselves. The music also in my opinion interrupts and ruins the more sensitive scenes, such as the two funeral scenes of Harry Lime.My next sledge against the film involves the most dramatic scenes and the imagery. During the book, there are the most controversial and surprising twists that take the reader by complete surprise. The film however ruins these moments in several ways. The same tired old music plays in the background, the camera fixes on the position for too long, highlighting the point to such an extent that a baboon would appreciate the events taking place. An example of this is, what many people say is the greatest moment of the film - the revelation that Harry Lime is still alive. During the scene, Holly Martins can see a pair of feet standing in an archway, and bravely stands up to the figure, hurling drunken abuse at the lack of spying ability of Harry. Then, an old women opens her window, and starts hurling abuse even more viciously at Holly for being too loud - as if that would really happen. By an immense stroke of luck, the light from her window is angled so perfectly that it illuminates Harry's face - incredible. Then, perhaps the cheesiest happening of the film, Harry Lime gives a smug, conceited, cheap smirk at Holly. The camera, unfortunately, holds on this frame for what seems like hours, as though to highlight the point, just in case nobody had understood. The woman then closes her window, and all is dark again. As Holly goes to cross the deserted road, that has not seen a car for the whole eight-hour scene, guess what comes tearing around the corner? Apparently, this little diversion gives Harry enough time to escape, proving that he can in fact run at the speed of a car - incredible.So please accept all of my apologies, those who think that it is the greatest film of all time, but I simply do not agree - the film is not an all time classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another "Masterpiece"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is like a painting that someone declares a "masterpiece". Paintings that look like a 4 year old did it but people who really know paintings say it is a masterpiece, then you got some fool paying millions of dollars for something that looks like somebody drank a bunch of paint and barfed it onto a canvas. I know, I know, Im just not educated and cultured enough to understand you say. No, I like what I like and don't like what i don't like. Anyway, first off it was like the experience I had watching another "masterpiece" Citizen Kane. When it was over I was kind of angry, what a waste of time, I kept waiting for it to get "great" right up till it was over and it never did. How can people think this is so Great! It is not great! It is not even good. From now on anything with Orson Wells name on it I WONT WATCH!! His films were bombs at the box office for a reason, because there aren't enough real smart cultured people on earth to go watch it and make it profitable. Even if the movie had been great it is hard to watch because there is a "Zither" being played during most of the film. This is supposed to be the score. It is awful, it sounds totally ridiculous paired to what was going on in the movie. It is funny to read the 10 star reviews here who have been brainwashed about what constitutes great art. They actually rave about the score being one of the greatest all time. Give me a break! I guess if there had been a kazoo playing zip-i-Dee do-DA all through the movie it would have been ground breaking too. Come on people, think for yourselves. If you ask me instead of the title The Third Man, it should be titled The Turd Man for two reasons. One, they spend a lot of time running around in the sewers of Vienna, and two the movie stinks!</fullReview>

Welles doesn't appear much in the film, and not until over an hour in. But his work in this is terrific. Cotten also does a great job; one of his best. Alida Valli is quite good in her best-known performance. Robert Krasker's cinematography is beautiful. It's a visually stunning film. Anton Karas' zither score is memorable and stays with you long after the movie is over. Carol Reed's direction is brilliant. For years rumors persisted Welles must have ghost-directed some of it. This isn't true, of course, but Welles did contribute dialogue. Particularly the "cuckoo clock" speech, which is possibly the highlight of this amazing film. Classic lines, scenes, performances. It's a fantastic work everybody should see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a near perfect film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Carol Reed's post-war thriller was filmed in 1949, but since then there haven't been a half dozen movies as intelligent or exciting (or amusing, or romantic, etc. etc). Among its many virtues are: Graham Greene's tightly plotted web of deceit and corruption; a vivid setting in the (genuine) rubble of war-torn Vienna; a superlative, perfectly balanced cast; moody and evocative black and white photography; and several memorable set pieces (the Ferris wheel confrontation, the chase through the sewers). Capping it all off, and setting the perfect tone, is the famous solo zither score by Anton Karas, forever calling to mind the rueful smile of Orson Welles as black-marketeer Harry Lime, caught unaware in a darkened doorway by a stray light from a nearby window.From beginning to end the film is a masterful blend of Old World romanticism and post-war cynicism, with the former represented by na?ve American pulp fiction writer Holly Martins (Joseph Cotton) and the latter by the cheerful, dangerous Lime (Trevor Howard's impeccable Major Calloway is the realist between them). The more bitter-than-sweet image of Alida Valli departing Harry Lime's (second) burial leaves a final, indelible impression, marking the film as a rare, true classic that actually improves with every viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark Crime Movie With Flashes of Gallows Humor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Third Man follows the journey of novelist Holly Martins to post-war Vienna, only to discover that the friend who invited him is dead. This isn't the most tragic revelation. Holly soon discovers that his friend, Harry Lime, was a black market operator involved in theft and murder and closely watched by the allied troops.Holly, getting himself in something too big for him to handle, decides to investigate the murder, only to fall in love with Lime's mistress, Anna, and discover that his friend's death may not have been the accident that the allied troops claim to be.Spoiling more of the story would reveal too much of a great story. Suffice to say that this movie has a unique twist in the story, so well placed in the narrative, that it certainly deserves a place amongst other great examples of twists, like Laura, The Crying Game and Se7en.Carol Reed and the Oscar-winning director of photography, Robert Krasker, deserve credit for having created a dark and oppressive movie, suggestive of terrors around all the street corners and in the dark interiors. Krasker sure deserved the Oscar for cinematography in this movie.But the reason I truly love this movie is Orson Welles' performance as Harry Lime. Welles had no trouble playing ruthless, remorseless people, like Citizen Kane and Touch of Evil demonstrate, but his best villainous role is this. Imagine a businessman who rationalizes all the evil he commits on the pointlessness of human life; Lime is incapable of feeling any remorse for the people he kills, for him they're just 'dots'. Such joyous indifference to human life makes Lime one of the greatest film villains.Anton Karras provides one of the finest scores for this movie. Wonderfully upbeat, comedic even, Karras' music is a twisted counterpoint to the evil and darkness that permeates the movie. It's another way of showing the detachment the movie has from human existence, the irony with which it treats matters of life and death. For although this movie is dark, it's also humorous in a black, gallows sort of way. Life isn't tragic in The Third Man, it's absurd, small and ultimately insignificant. Such insight places Carol Reed's masterpiece amongst the most modern of movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautifully Photographed and Directed; Artistic, Seminal and Overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I regard the "Third Man" as artistic, very strongly so, in the sense of being "minimally graphically depicted, filled with memorable images and intelligently photographed,I disagree,for many reasons, with calling it more than very good. I review the film here because its artistic successes have been much imitated, as have elements of its storyline. The story of "The Third Man" can be stated simply. "A writer of genre westerns travels to Vienna to find his boyhood friend Harry Lime, at Lime's request. He discovers the man has recently died, a fact attested by several of Lime's friends. The local occupation force's leader, whom he seeks out to ask about the death, warns him to stay away from the case, that Lime was a thoroughly bad sort. Deciding to investigate the death and perhaps clear his friend's name, or at least prove the authorities were wrong about Lime, the writer becomes involved with Lime's girl friend, finds rumors of Lime's death were exaggerated, then must face a final crisis--what to do about the man." Acting in the film is decidedly uneven, I assert. As the writer, Joseph Cotten captures the man's psyche but he does not sound like a writer of westerns. As Lime, Orson Welles is understated, quirky, powerful at times and generally perhaps believable. Trevor Howard as the head of the authorities is not as strong as he soon will be in a series of 1950s triumphs, while Alida Valli as the girlfriend seems the best feature of the film, visually and professionally. Unfortunately, owing to the noir nature of the writer's central role--he cannot ask the police for help, since he is ignoring their assessment of Lime's bad character--and to his being a stranger in Vienna, the characters he meets remain intelligently defined but on the adventure level of types and acquaintances. Even Lime's friends cannot be individuated; so that the best scenes in the film, by my standards, occur when Cotten or Valli has something specific to do--she being questioned by police or he by literary overly-intellectual zealots, he chasing after her, or she telling him he does not understand his old friend. Lime ,at one point, revealing himself to the man he had sent for, defends his action in committing black market crimes; he famously likens the people (whose lives he is destroying) to "ants" he is stepping on, which is what people glimpsed from the top of a Ferris Wheel upon which he and the writer are riding look like from that remove.. The motive for Lime's needing to disappear after being found out as the perpetrator of a deadly dangerous fraud seems more real to the viewer, I claim, than does his idea that he might get away with such a crime for any length of time. This I found to be quite unconvincing. And it goes to the heart of three matters--why Lime sent for his old friend, what he thought he was doing and how convincing is the entire plot. But the shadow-haunted, textured B/W quality of the scenes filmed, the over-used but generally splendid Anton Karas' zither accompaniment and the artistry with which director Carol Reed has presented his story are the triumphs of the project. Credit for the artfulness belongs to cinematographer Robert Krasker, set decorator Darion Simoni, assistant director Guy Hamilton and others such as art director Joseph Bata, Ferdinand Bellan, Vincent Korda, John Haworth and James Sawyer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The fine acting, stunning cinematography, incredible lighting, and remarkable art direction is all accompanied by the numbing, bouncy, unsurpassable zither music. This complex, eerie story is told with cynical narration and shadowy imagery. From the amateur floating in the water, to (spoilers) the balloon seller, whose enormous shadow is thought to be that of Harry lime. The story is almost brutal to the protagonist, the poor sap by the name of Holly Martins who falls into an unhealthy love story.The final scenes and opening scenes reach perfection. In fact, so do the middle ones. This is is one of the few films that I would never change anything in. From the wry humor to the masterful suspense and dark villains, this will always be one of the greatest, if not the greatest, movies ever made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The good: Reed did show off one resonant idea here - the congruence of the visual narrative with the story. That is to say, the unsettling effect produced by the camera's tilt off the vertical axis that nicely reinforces the notion that 'nothing and no one is who he seems'.The not so good: whatever noir value this had has long since been superseded and bettered (the concept of "noir" was named by the French after a series of crime novels published with black covers, and would refer to authors such as Raymond Chandler and Dashiell Hammett). This movie worked at the beginning of the Cold War, because of the audience's recognition of new political complexities, and especially the growing influence of espionage and Orwellian disinformation.But not any more. What we get is a hack actor carrying the role of a hack writer in a foreign city whence so much art and culture originated. And Reed is just as uncultured as Cotten when it comes to handling the locals. It's as if the cinematic touches and the world which they reflect don't match at all.Welles and Howard can hold up their end no sweat, but that's not enough to carry this today. "Foreign Correspondent" and "The Big Clock" have more staying power. See this for its historical value, only.</fullReview>

So much so that it Balances All the Great Stuff to, Honestly and Objectively, make this Only an Above Average and a Very Different Film.The Music...Nothing but Oddball Zither and Near Two Hours of it Might have You Screaming in Pain or at the Very Least Turning the Sound Off.The Woman...Constantly Moping About and Pining for Harry just gets Sad and Boring with Her Relentless Drooping Demeanor and Praising the "God-Like" Lime. Her Strong Rejection of Holly Martins in Virtually Every Scene as he Pants after Her like a Dog in Heat is just Embarrassing.The Foreign Language Without Subtitles...Unattractive People Speaking Non-English All the Time that goes Undeciphered because it is not Subtitled is a Distraction that Demands the Highest of Tolerance. The Elderly Woman Wrapped in the Blanket Takes the Cake.Overall the Good Outweighs the Bad and it is a Film that is Essential Viewing for Anyone but the most Aloof Movie Goer because it is Rated so High and it is a Visual Treat and the Dialog (that is in English) can be Intriguing and Amusing. If You can Tolerate the Three Irritants Above it can be Considered a Fine Film.</fullReview>

If I had to pick something out of this that would be considered a negative, it would have to be the plot. At times, the plot is slow and lazy, taking away from the story being told. Other then that, the film feels spotless. Orson Welles and Joseph Cotten bring excellent performances to the film, leading it towards a fulfilling conclusion. This is worth a purchase in all forms, and especially plenty of re-watches. Of course this is just my personal opinion, but it is a very sincere explanation of the long list of positives this film dishes out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Third Man.....almost a perfect film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched The Third Man yet again on TV. However, I think this is the longest gap since I watched it the last time. It is, in my opinion, an almost perfect film and in my reckoning I cannot give higher praise than that for anything. Call me a cynic, but nothing is perfect. Perfection is something to strive for. As I watched it I realised several things. One of them was how perfect, sorry, almost perfect, the casting was for the characters. I cannot imagine any other person to take the part of Holly Martins than Joseph Cotton. Nor can I contemplate Harry Lime to be no one else except Orson Welles. Trevor Howard is wonderful and Bernard Lee is marvellous. But then again is it because I've watched it so many times that it's now a case that Holly Martins is Joseph Cotton and Harry Lime is Orson Welles and so on? Another thing was, and here I am slightly prejudiced as I like B/W photography, is what if this film had been made in colour? How ghastly a thought is that? None of the slippery bleakness of the city, none of the suspicious shadows and none of the bleakness of the night. And the final thing was that I cannot remember a better character introduction into film than Harry Lime. A cat purring around a pair a shiny black shoes of a man in a very dark doorway - suddenly a light switched on from a room in the apartment opposite spills across the road into the doorway and there stands Orson Welles. Truly Great!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece of British Film Noir, possibly a bit old fashioned for younger viewers?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Third Man is an example of British Film Noir and was recently voted the greatest British Film of all time. It would not have received my vote as such however. One of my major issues was with the sound-track. At times, I found the music overly-loud and intrusive. That being said, it was different.The other issue I had was with the character of Major Calloway, (played by Trevor Howards) playing his usual role as the stiff-upper lipped Englishman. I often find the acting to be quite unnaturalistic in noir movies, over dramatic and sometimes featuring really unconvincing characters or sometimes, almost caricatures. Case in point, the jolly Austrian haus-frau near the start of the movie and the afore-mentioned Trevor Howards character.The film features Joseph Cotton as Holly Martins, who plays a somewhat naive American pulp western writer. He is invited to post-war Austria, which is divided into four by the victorious allies, by his friend from high school, Harry Lime (Orson Welles). When he arrives, he finds that Limes has been killed in a car accident under suspicious circumstances. The movie traces what happens when he decides to play amateur sleuth to find out what really happened to his friend.It turns out that Harry was a black marketeer who, it is implied, is responsible for causing deaths by supplying watered down penicillin. So the over-curious Martins finds out some unpalatable truths about his old friend. The plot is complicated further by Limes actress mistress, a Czechoslovakian who fears that she will be deported to Russia if it is found out she is not Austrian. It was Harry Limes who got the forged papers for Anna (played by (Alida Valli). Martins also sees four shadowy figures meet on a bridge and eventually it turns out that the third man out of the four from both the accident and the meeting on the bridge, was in fact Harry Lime himself.He was not dead, but faking his own death in order to avoid taking responsibility for his criminal actions.I won't rehash much more of the plot here but instead move onto my other observations about the movie.There was quite outstanding cinematography provided by Robert Krasker, which won an Academy Award. There is a really nice scene near the start of the film, set on a spiral staircase, in which dialogue between Holly Martins and an old building porter (Paul Hörbiger) is the first Martins finds out that his friend Harry has been killed in an automobile accident.I also loved the way the scenes in the sewers were lit and shot, very dark and atmospheric. It is to the sewers that his friend appears and disappears when Holly finally discovers he is still alive. I am sure the metaphor here is pretty obvious.My favourite line from the movie has to be atop the Ferris wheel.Harry Lime "Don't be so gloomy. After all it's not that awful. Like the fella says, in Italy for 30 years under the Borgias they had warfare, terror, murder, and bloodshed, but they produced Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, and the Renaissance. In Switzerland they had brotherly love - they had 500 years of democracy and peace, and what did that produce? The cuckoo clock. So long Holly".After seeing that Lime has no regrets about his crimes, Holly decides to help the international police trap Harry. Harry being a slippery character, manages to elude them all down the sewers and it ends up it is Holly who ends up shooting his old friend, as he also no longer trusts him.The scenes just before the denouement, although to my mind, sometimes pretty clichéd, with men all standing about really grim and suspicious looking in the gloomy streets are again, very nicely done for the time.There is much to admire in the movie, it being way ahead of it's time in some ways, the scenes of a bombed out Vienna, the shadows everywhere, like the shadows that were still being cast by WWII and the on-coming threat of the cold war. A vast city, often wet and damp looking, which appears almost entirely empty, adds to the air of mystery. The scene in which Welles first appears from the shadows of a doorway is one of the most famous in movie history. The camera is often tilted off the horizontal axis to help portray the sense of lurking danger and foreboding in the city at that time, a time when desperation drove people to highly questionable and criminal activities when often there was no choice. However, it seems clear that Harry was simply making profit out of the misery of others.Although not intended as a historical document, it can also be appreciated in a historical context. Cities all over Europe were lying in ruins and the repercussions of the war were still being keenly felt.I enjoyed the stylistic feel of the piece and can appreciate why some people love the movie. However I just was not too turned on by the plot or most of the characters, apart from Harry, who despite being the villain of the piece, I much preferred to Trevor Howards Major Calloway. There literally was something about Harry, which was almost likable and one could see why Anna loved him, even though he was a rat.Love the bit at the end when Anna, Harry's ex, whom Holly has just killed, totally ignores him as she walks past him. I am left wondering what exactly he expects to happen here (it is a credit to the writing that a romance does not develop between the two) and also why he lights a cigarette and throws it away without taking a single puff. As an aside, I noticed that although a lot of cigarette's were shown during the movie, I don't recall seeing a single one being actually smoked!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Part of this film is brilliant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have gone back and forth over the years regarding this film. I had seen part of this movie on commercial television way back when old flicks were all chopped up with commercials. Hated it! Then, a few years go I saw it on TCM (probably) and was quite impressed. Tonight I watched it again and have reverted back to...well, not really hating it, but not seeing anything that special about it. Is it a bad film? No. Is it a great film? No. It's different, even for film noir, but I'm not finding exceptional.That's not to say there aren't a few things that I like here. Starting with the performance of Joseph Cotten. I've always like Cotten and feel he is a very underrated actor. I am not impressed with Cotten's character in the first half of the film. Would an American visiting Allied-occupied Vienna right after the war really be that aggressive in dealing with the authorities...particularly as an author? I doubt it. But, that's a problem caused by the screenwriter and director, not Joseph Cotten. Valli, whose only other film I remembered was "The Miracle Of The Bells" with Frank Sinatra, is also superb. I do not admire Trevor Howard here in the first half of the film, though he (or I should say his character) becomes a bit more multidimensional in the second half of the film. If you're an Orson Welles, you may be disappointed. Welles' scenes are top notch, but he is not in the first two-thirds of the film at all.The story is interesting, all the more so when the dilution of penicillin surfaces as a motive. The photography, stunning for a black and white film considering that it is filmed in Vienna. Many of the techniques I don't particularly like -- such as shooting at odd angles and the use of shadows -- worked well here. And the climax in the sewers of Vienna is stunning; and it's brilliant how they don't show the death of a main character, making it all the more haunting.You know, as I think back over the film, it's the first two-thirds of the film that disappoints me. Yawn. The final third of the film IS what all the fuss is about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Might Be the Greatest Film Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Voted by BFI as Greatest British Film Ever MadeSomehow the big ego-ed super-producers David O. Selznick and Alexander Korda were able to collaborate and make a film as flawless as The Third Man. Of course there are the stories of Selznick, director Carol Reed, and screenwriter Graham Greene all on speed working 20 hours a day. Much has been made of Orson Welles as Lime. His entrance around is great, the cuckoo clock scene is fantastic and the movie is most interesting when he's on screen, but there is much more to the movie than just Welles. Joseph Cotten, one of the most underrated actors of the Golden Age gives his best performance here, a performance that is rarely given the acclaim it deserves. His Holly Martins is a complex character dealing with themes such as loyalty, betrayal and morality. Complementing him is the Italian actress Valli, who plays Czechoslovakian actress Anna Schmidt, Lime's former lover. It is clear she loved him unconditionally, refusing to believe that he was any sort of criminal and resisting her newfound feelings for Holly.The film is excellent from a technical standpoint. It almost has the feel of the feel of the Italian neorealism films of the '40s. The cinematography is great, making heavy use of dutch angles, jump cuts and other tricks. I just couldn't see this movie being made in color. The score is fantastic, entirely composed of zither music by Viennese play Anton Karas. It's upbeat tone contrasts the dark setting of the story in a great way. The dialogue is superb (I especially love the opening monologue spoken by Carol Reed himself.)Overall, this film is basically essential viewing. I find it to be far better than another Welles-starred movie Citizen Kane. I know that there are some people out there who won't watch just because this movie is in black and white or made over 60 years ago, but give it a chance. You won't be disappointed. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Orson Welles and Joseph Cotten take the stage as the characters of Harry Lime and Holly Martin with Valli as Welles' love interest in this eerie tale of betrayal. I won't give away anything because then it defeats the film's suspenseful purpose and would reveal the important details. I will comment on the performances of Cotten and Valli because I cannot comment Welles as I'll give away key elements. Cotten is a familiar presence for anyone who has seen 'Shadow of a Doubt', but this film is a different one for him. He is charming in his fashion and makes Holly Martin seem hard to figure out what he is about. Valli is the innocent woman who is also a puzzle we need to figure out, but she is a fine member of the cast. If you like suspense then you should check this one out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Viennese film noir bliss</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>British director Carol Reed couldn't have made a more perfect choice for his film noir taking place in post-war Vienna than to hire local entertainer Anton Karas to compose a zither score for it. The unique theme climbed the charts worldwide and has become an instant evergreen, common even to those who have never ever seen the film itself. Yet the score is only one among many things that make "The Third Man" essential viewing. While the music makes the picture distinctly Austrian, it was also shot entirely on location, complete with land marks, bombed out buildings, the vast Viennese cemetery and its sewer system. Even famous Austrian actors got bits parts and added to the general look and feel. This is what post-war Vienna was all about.The screenplay, written superbly by Graham Greene, is pure gold. It entraps the viewer in a web of black-market treachery, intrigue and deception narrated by the traditional film noir voice-over and feels like a detective story that eventually reaches existential depth. The action takes place in a divided country where the future is uncertain and anything goes to make a buck if you just do it right and aren't caught, and that's exactly what happens. The acting by Cotton, Welles, Howard and Valli leaves nothing to be desired, also the picture features one of the most legendary entrances of a character in movie history... The cinematography is a first rate lesson in style with all its tilted angles, beautiful lighting, shadows creeping along the walls, rarely seen in such impeccable mis-en-scene. Just consider the famous last shot of the film showing a character walking out of screen: It lasts nearly one and a half minutes and deftly condenses the whole drama that has taken place until then in a poignant visual convergence, the icing on film noir bliss. Well, and there's always that music. That incomparable, melancholic, bizarre, yet wonderful catchy music that will ring in your ears for quite a while...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my all-time favorites</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this on television as a youngster of about 10 years old. That would put it around 1973. I have since re-watched it at least 20 times and have purchased the Criterion disc and continue to find new elements that rock my world. I've heard complaints from friends that it's so obvious who Orson Welles will play, and also that the music doesn't fit the mood of the movie. Those complaints have not curtailed my enjoyment one iota. To me, this has been always about as close to perfect as a single film can come. It isn't bloated with unnecessary character development. The actors have depth and we get their stories with an economy of words. It has humor, suspense, great music, intriguing camera-work, stellar dialogue and it's all in a package that isn't the overblown 3 hour epic that gets spit out by Hollywood these days. I hope it is never remade.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nothing ever worked better than complete audio-visual contrast. Here you have a story which can be described as true baroque noir mixed with ironic wit and intelligent puns on post-World War Europe. And what better way to tell a film-noir than to use a a zither-player from a bar to record a soundtrack for it? Setting is almost everything in this masterpiece of a movie by Carol Reed, where a frivolous and unemployed writer by the name of Holy (of any reference to Hollywood?) goes to Vienna to meet his friend Harry Lime who has promised him a job. The viewer is taken into a labyrinth of thrill and mystery in a city that is divided by the Iron Curtain.The beauty of the movie is a combination of technical mastery (the dancing of shadows on the wet concrete walls of Vienna, the extreme close-ups that insert us into the mind of the characters and their worlds), witty fast paced dialogue ("You have to break rules - humanity is a duty.") and incredible casting which includes not only stars but true characters, all of which, through their own subconscious, have contributed to a true farcical tour-de-force.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think the biggest problem with the movie is the music. As much as it was a great soundtrack and as a stand alone soundtrack I would not be surprised if it could land really high in the rankings, but as a movie soundtrack it did not mesh with me. There were multiple scenes where the music brought me out of the scene because it contrasted with the tone of the scene so much. I think a lot of people will hate me for saying this about the soundtrack and I understand how it adds to the whole feel of Vienna, but it did not work for me. A scene with a lot of suspense would be ruined with an upbeat bouncy song. The acting was fine and the story was really good. I loved the title of the film and how it played so well with the story and the way the events were revealed in the movie. I loved the ending and it was a great shot. So like any mystery noir movie like this is really dependent on the script and it did a fantastic job with revealing the truth to the viewer. So two things that need to be address when talking about this movie is the cinematography and direction. I love the way Vienna was caught on film and I really feel as if the noir genre benefits from black and white. The film makers were able to transform Vienna into a dark place filled with shadow and secrets. I also loved the direction and how Reed kept choosing to tilt the camera and skewing the picture. It just added to the whole feel of the movie. I kept trying to use it as a clue to the story, but it evaded me on the first viewing. I honestly really loved the feel of the city and it really played a huge part in the movie, but that music.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the music enhances the movie creatively</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think the zither music in this film shows remarkable variety and expressiveness--it can be lively and jaunty, or poignant, sad and haunting, it can express suspense, tension, anxiety, confrontation. It's amazing how it can change to enhance and intensify the mood or action--or comment on it from an ironic distance. It's interesting how Reed chose when and how to use this music in various ways, or not use it. The final scene is poetic. I'd like to know what other movie scenes can compare to its lyricism?there may be some, can't think of one right now. Any suggestions?It is enhanced by the poignant music, expressing regret at longing. The scene is beautiful with the long lines of trees, as she walks down from afar. as he waits motionless, and she passes him by without a look, as the leaves fall?and he is left standing there, looking after her, lighting a smoke?.ah, sublime. This ending plays out the identity and personalities of these 2 characters and the whole tone of the movie. And it shows the artistic creativity of Carol Reed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Film Noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To say this film is very famous is kind of making a moot point--if you've heard of it, you've heard a lot about it, and most people who pay half attention to old movies have heard of it. It's a real classic, containing everything that makes movies great: great cinematography, great acting, and great story.In war torn Vienna, a pulp Western writer discovers that his friend has died in a suspicious accident. He decides to look into it and finds out that though all official reports say that two people carried the dead man away, a doorman at a local hotel saw three. Our hero decides to find out who that third man is, deciding that he's the key to finding out what really happened to his friend.This movie is pure film noir. The canted angles and chiaroscuro are set in relief against a war-torn cityscape that provides extra terrain for the shadows and chases that make film noir so exciting. The image of Orson Welles entering through a door has become an icon, and Carol Reed is very respected for auteur-ship of films like these.There's a discrepancy between the American and British cuts of this film. I'm not so sure what it is, but I saw the British cut and it was very good, so I'll imagine whatever the ten minutes were that were cut out of the American edit are probably important stuff. I don't know why this happens so often, but it's America for you.--PolarisDiB</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is considered one of the best Film-Noir movies. Shot in Black and White by Robert Krasker. Yes! It looks good, but the first hour of the film moves so slow. Only when Orson Welles's character Harry Lime appears (Which is 40 minutes to the end of the film), I started to feel the thrill of this film. Unfortunately, I don't know how, but I knew that the Third Man was Orson Welles, and that Harry Lime faked his death. Knowing that ruins the interest in the first hour of the plot, as the first hour is the investigation made by Holly Martins.The story of the Third Man reminds me of a short story by O. Henry called "After Twenty Years". Two friends meet after 20 years, and find out that their values are in conflict as one became a crook the other became a cop. The cop will meet the crook for the last time before sending him to prison. Unforgettable scenes: * The Old Clown walking with Ballons, casting a huge shadow over the street. Impressive! * The Sewer Scene is thrilling and fast paced. Wonderful! * The Ferris Wheel scene. I've actually been on the huge ferris wheel in Vienna at the Prater.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a very good film, but it could have been better. The plot, while clever, is rather predictable. (I figured out who the Third Man was as soon as the Romanian guy denied there was a third man). Also, while Welles' brief performance is probably the finest of his career, Cotten's acting is rather flat and uninspired, making his character more one-dimensional than is really necessary. The cinematography is inspired, truly some of the finest to be found anywhere, but the editing is rather choppy. The movie deserves to be on the AFI 100 list for its contribution to cinematic history, as it is really the forerunner of the entire film noir genre, but on its sheer artistic merits it does not quite rank with Fantasia, Network, The Manchurian Candidate, and a number of other films AFI placed farther down on the list. However, on the whole The Third Man is certainly worth seeing--Welles' entrance (however predictable) and the superb ferris wheel sequence can make the film worthwhile all by themselves.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Considered a classic as it rightly should. Definitely one of the finest suspense thrillers of all time. The plot is twisting and complex (if occasionally hard to follow); the acting ranges from OK (Cotten and Valli) to superb (Howard and Welles). The worst thing about the movie is the VERY annoying zither music. Supposedly it's supposed to compliment the mood of the film. Well, it didn't! It made me want to cover my ears! Halfway through the film I wish there had been a way to shut the music off and keep the dialogue on! The best thing about this is the direction. Director Reed constantly keeps the viewer off balance by shooting numerous scenes at a tilted angle establishing a sense of paronia and uneasiness. Very rarely is something shoot at the correct angle. Also, the set design is stunning. The movie is set in Vienna, but was shot in London. You'd never know it. It looks and FEELS like Vienna. The sets are huge and crumbling (result of WWII) and increase the feeling of dread. Also excellent use of night and shadow. Some of these sequences wouldn't be out of place in a horror film. Hard movie to describe...it has the be viewed. If you get the chance to see it, do so. You won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a film I saw many years ago, and without a vivid memory of the film in its entirety, I felt another viewing was in order before I wrote any comments. It was probably over 25 years since I had seen The Third Man, which would mean I was under 18, and at that age, I was really more interested in films that provided surface entertainment, rather than social commentary or a visual impact.With that in mind, I wanted to absorb everything this film was reputed to contain. What I found was a film with tremendous cinematography, several extremely powerful images, and a few memorable exchanges of dialog. However, it was not able to create an overall mood of other films typical of the genre. This may be due to my dislike of the score, which interrupted the growth of tension or intrigue, rather than enhancing it. Overall, the acting was pedestrian.As a mild excuse, the copy of the film was poor, and the sound quality substandard. I would like to see this film again, in a theater if possible, but certainly, a better print couldn't hurt.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this film for many reasons. First and foremost, it is an exceptional story told by a consummate storyteller, Graham Greene (writer of "The Fallen Idol" and "The End of the Affair").Add to that a superb cast with Joseph Cotten, Orson Welles, Trevor Howard and others, and you have the perfect canvas for the story to unfold. Then add to that a perfect setting such as you have in post-war Vienna. I can't think of another movie, other than San Francisco in "Vertigo", where perhaps a city figures so prominently into the fabric of a film.The cinematography is the other stand out quality of the film. So much of the dark mood and somberness and suspense is captured by the angular and tense camera work.My only complaint is the zither music. While many love it and think it sets just the right mood, I find it very distracting and annoying. This fact causes it to detract from the movie rather than adding anything to it. Perhaps if it was toned down some, or used less frequently it would have a been a better addition to the film. I understand that it is a classic instrument to Austria, but to me the tone of it was all wrong for the film. Maybe back in the period this was filmed it was more understood. But I just found it completely strange and out of place. Perhaps this was another piece of the "unexpected" they were trying to add to the film, like the unexpected twists and turns. But again, to me, it was just a distraction.</fullReview>

Calloway (Trevor Howard), who is commanding the investigation, offers the ticket to Holly return home, but while waiting for the trip, he talks to two friends of Harry that tell that they had been the firsts to help his friend. However, the porter of Harry's building tells that there was a mysterious third man that helped Harry and Holly Martins becomes intrigued with the inconsistency and decides to investigate further. Sooner he discloses that Harry Lime was the leader of a gang that robbed penicillin from the military hospital to adulterate and resell it, and has caused the death and anomalies in many children. He continues to investigate and he has a great surprise when he finds who the third man is."The 3rd Man" is an unforgettable masterpiece of mystery and thriller by Carol Reed. The fascinating story has no flaws, with witty dialogs; the acting is perfect and the cinematography is wonderful with the perfect use of black and white and shadows to show the environment and corruption in Vienna in the post WWII. The manhunt in the end in the sewage system of the city is one of the most impressive that I have ever seen. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): "O Terceiro Homem" ("The Third Man")</fullReview>

The performances by Orson Welles and Joesph Cotton are quite good, as is the zither music on the soundtrack, but overall it's an exasperating movie, full of promising scenes that don't quite take shape and have no pay-off.

That being said, I heard from many that The Third Man was a must see film, and that it was one of the best. So with those lofty expectations, I bought the darned thing. The best thing about the movie was Orson Welles performance, all too brief, though admittedly appropriately so. The photography is creative and effective, and the music is one of a kind and unforgettable. But to be honest, I just did not care who the third man was. I have never been so bored by a movie in my life. Again, I want to stress that I do appreciate the genius camera-work and brilliant music. I liked the film only when Orson Welles' character was "introduced", but it was far too brief, and nowhere near enough to meet my lofty expectations. Overrated and boring.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Holly Martin, an American writer comes to Vienna, just after the end of the Second World War. He is here to meet his old friend, Harry Lime. But sadly, he comes to know that his friend, Lime, has died in a road accident, just a few hours ago. He manages to attend the funeral, where he meets the British Army Officer. Shortly afterwards certain contradictory opinions regarding the road accident raise his suspicion and provoke him to investigate the matter further. During which he meets Harry's girlfriend and few other friends. His inquisition into the matter changes the course of the investigation and induces a truth about which even the police was in absolute darkness. One of the most important things about Third Man is its Vienna setting. This is Vienna at a crucial moment of history. The Second World War has just ended. Vienna, divided into international quadrants administered by the Russians, Americans, British, and French, was filled with spies, refugees, thieves and foreign powers who were trying to take control of it. This film is quite successful in portraying this Vienna of shadows, of notorious gangs, of black marketers. Third Man is highly praised for its of lighting and cinematography, and I guess deservingly so.Third Man was nominated for three Oscars, including Best Director, Best Film Editing and Best Cinematography. It won the Best Cinematography Oscar in 1950. In 1949, it won the Grand Prix at Cannes and the Best British Film award (BAFTA). But the most prestigious of all, Third Man was voted the best British Film of the Twentieth century by the esteemed British Film Institute (BFI).Of course the film has apposite use of light and shadow and brilliant camera-work, but I don't think I would rate Third Man as one of best thrillers I have ever seen. Somehow, as a whole I don't think Third Man is that brilliant as its stature would otherwise suggest. I find it seriously lacks in keeping the suspense throughout, in parts a bit too loose and even the performances, I find, at times, not up to the mark. If this is best British film made in the 20th century, then I kind of feel sorry about the British films of the past.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked the Third Man but I do not feel that this was Josef Cotten's best performance, as many have quoted it to be. On the other hand, I felt that Orson Welles as Harry Lime and Trevor Howard as Major Calloway were brilliant. The first half of the movie though felt slightly flat. The whole cover up act performed by Lime's aides would any day arouse enough suspicion. The exaggerated emotions, meant to draw a stark contrast between Holly's innocence and his wily opponents, come off as artificial at times. Holly's attempts to woo Anna felt insincere considering his friend had presumably just died. It was only when things started to get out of control that the movie really picks up. In steps Orson Welles and one of the best second halves a movie could have. Orson Welles' performance is refreshing and the scene at the top of ferris wheel is truly captivating containing one of the most iconic movie quotes. Welles feels ever so comfortable portraying Lime and every bit of his role comes off as genuine. One is very well inclined to be deluded into believing that there was nothing ethically wrong with his character but both the viewer and Cotten's character are then served a reality check by Major Calloway in the Hospital scene. Anna's unwavering loyalty to Lime leaves the viewer baffled at times yet we not go deep into Anna and Lime's past leaving that part of the story in the dark. I rate the final scene of the movie as one of my favourites next to those of City Lights and Manhattan. Overall, I felt the movie slightly overrated at first viewing but opinions do change with time and hopefully I'll be able to see what the most qualified critics have been able to.</fullReview>

Stylish from the first to the last, with inimitable backgrounds of zither music and war-torn buildings pointing up a then-topical black market story, full of cynical, corrupt characters, but not without humour. A dazzling creation. Upon its release in the US, The Third Man received rave reviews by critics.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Possible alternate title: "The Truth About Harry Lime" {{Spoilers Possible}}</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll admit that I rented this movie as somewhat of a "seat-of-the-pants" rent when I was trolling the library video stacks,since I only ran across this with not much design as to what I was going to check out. I took it because I'd heard of it and felt like viewing the was a must. For the most part,I'm glad I did.The story of dime novelist Holly Martins(Joseph Cotten,a forgotten matinée star of yesteryear,which seems kinda unfair)who comes to Post WWII Vienna looking for work promised him by his longtime friend Harry Lime(Orson Welles,only co-starring here) plays out like a classic Noir. Lime,as it turns out is dead. He decides that the story behind this is hinkey,so he does his own investigating and uncovers some stuff he'd probably rather not have known.Besides an unique story that reads like something out of a more intelligent pulp detective novel,this is also a bit of a sly social commentary by screenwriter(adapting from his own book)Graham Greene,basically disguising his somewhat dim view of America over the Post War landscape as a whodunit,as the two American characters Martins(the unassuming semi-idealist who doesn't know the culture)and Lime(the cynical opportunist)are paralleled,with the locals being sort of the unwitting victims,among them the trusting actress Anna Schmidt(Valli,sort of a rougher version of Ingrid Bergman)who is running from her past. The British occupational police,personned by the dry and ever-suspicious Calloway(Trevor Howard,very good here,as really everyone is)is watching Martins,both disliking his idealism and sneering at his naiveté.A distractingly unbalanced soundtrack and music score coupled with a sadly poorly patched copy of the film somewhat marred my experience of this film(of course,my seeing this in segments probably didn't help either),but the story and the acting is definitely intelligent and worth the time to watch. Definite must-viewing for someone who tires(whether mostly or just sometimes)of more dumbed-down contemporary films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Apparently Kim Philby, the notorious spy, was a close friend of the director, Carol Reed (a male, despite the name)and Philby's real first name was "Harry". And of course Grahame Green wrote the script ... hence "Lime".The viewing of The Third Man is essential. It is quite stunning in all respects and there is just one serious fault: the devotion of the female protagonist for Welles' anti-hero is inexplicable. There should have been hints of a more pure Harry Lime, perhaps suggestions of heroism in the war, perhaps his criminal adventurism had at one time been a virtue. Her love for Harry is never justified.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A rather simple mystery tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some of the mystery in this mystery film is very quickly spoiled early on with the application of simple logic. But aside from that I have further complaints about this classic. On the other hand, I can't say I didn't enjoy it either.What the story has going for it are some fairly interesting characters, some acted very well, and a nice mystery plot. More interesting are the relationships between some of the primary characters and the expected turn-about in character direction. I like that few of the characters are what we initially think they are and how their relationship to each other changes. There are also just a few really well done scenes that are still pretty memorable.One of the problems with this film is that it's not much of a mystery. It's not hard to figure out what's going on from the start, which sort of neutralizes a little of the suspense. Another issue is that it's not consistent. There are a number of really good scenes and there are a number of mediocre scenes. That's not to say it isn't interesting, and unless you're really focusing on the direction, you might not see it--I didn't until I was looking at it a second time.But those issues aren't too big. I suppose my biggest issue is that it feels like a popcorn movie. It doesn't have a potent "so what". You saw glimpses of important decisions that might have been made, but the story is so railroaded that you never really get a sense of you wanting the characters make decisions, but rather, just follow along. It's an enjoyable popcorn movie, mind you, but you never have to get invested in it.And so, I guess it was a letdown for me. The movie has a lot of esteem as a classic and such, and I think that led me to believe that it would be a particularly impressive movie. Rather, it just ends up being an enjoyable but rather simple mystery tale. I guess I prefer my movies a little less obvious. The zither music is a neat diversion though. 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great entertainment but we remember it better than it is</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are some films (such as Citizen Kane and Shawshank redemption) that are largely overlooked on release only to be praised as masterpieces years later. Then there are some films that are praised as classics simply because the style or subject matter was relevant at when it was made. The third man was recently rated the greatest British film ever made (and one of the top ten best films ever made in the world). While I normally love seeing classic movies, after seeing The third man I felt a nagging sense of disappointment. The cinematography, acting, lighting and music are all brilliant, but we have seen better examples throughout the years. The movie has an original plot when all is revealed, but the first half of the film is simply a traditional mystery story. The final hide-and-seek chase in the end is truly well done, but it's effectiveness is undermined by the fact that Lime is at this stage depicted as a truly unsympathetic character. He is too evil for us to have sympathy with him, and he is too scared to be a frightening villain in the scene. I felt some sense of "What's the point" throughout the story. there is a nice story about ethics and duty, but the entire development happens in the last fifteen minutes, and seems rushed. Ultimately therefore, I found the film good, but dated and not timeless as there were few elements in this film that haven't been utilized to greater effect before and since. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Third Man is really quite a brilliant film, and one of the best British films ever made in my opinion. There are several reasons why I think this. The cinematography is just outstanding, and helps fashion a city full of menace and the score is jaunty and flawlessly echoes the film's wit and drama. Then there is a dark yet playful script(two other words to describe the film itself too), impeccable direction from master of place, angle and shade Carol Reed and a gem of a story that grips you right up till the ending. The Third Man is also blessed with performances more perfect than you can ask for from Joseph Cotten and especially Orson Welles. Overall, it is a brilliant film, very well made and has a great story. 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Didn't live up to the hype</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must admit I was more than a little disappointed with this film, it really didn't live up to what I'd expected, and is nowhere near in the league of Welles' classic Citizen Kane.To be 100% fair, I probably didn't help myself by buying the commemorational video with all the previews at the start, and the features on the music. By the time the film started I absolutely hated the music, it was driving me insane - so it took me a week to watch the video!Welles is competent - and definitely has that streak that made Kane such a compelling character - as the smuggler come drug thief in this tale of post war Vienna, but this film just didn't grab me as being anything special at any time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Top 100 (!)?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Very disappointing. This film is highly over-rated. The story is set in the war-torn Austrian city of Vienna, just after the Second World War, and is told from the point of view of an American pulp western author, Holly Martins, who is searching for a college friend, Harry Lime, who had offered him the opportunity to work with him in Vienna.At the beginning of the film, Martins discovers that his old friend Harry Lime, whom he had not seen since before the war, has been killed in an accident under mysterious circumstances just prior to Martins' arrival in Vienna. The deeper he delves into Harry's death, the more Martins finds that there was more to Lime than he knew and that Harry has been accused of being a black market racketeer, trafficking in adulterated penicillin.The only interesting angle to the film is the way in which Martins sort of becomes the heroic advocate of justice that he writes about- only this time the setting is post-war Vienna (which is fairly wild and untamed) not the wild west- a rather intriguing parallel, but not enough to save the film, which suffers from a generally lack-luster plot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Orson Welles stars in Carol Reed's adaptation of the Graham Greene story, which sees Joseph Cotton playing pulp novelist Holly Martins, who has arrived in post-war Vienna at the invitation of old friend Harry Lime(Welles) a mysterious man who has reportedly been killed in a peculiar traffic accident. Holly decides to investigate matters, and meets up with Lime's girlfriend Anna Smith(played by Alida Valli) whom he also falls in love with, much to his later regret, as she is still very loyal to Lime, who may not be dead after all, and not such a nice guy... Brilliantly directed and written film features fine performances by all, with a most atmospheric feel to its post-war setting, and the new morality that has taken hold. Bittersweet film is quite cynical, oppressively so at times, but is nonetheless memorable, with lots of quotable dialogue, and a haunting finale.</fullReview>

The movie will be remembered forever as an art piece for filmmaker' sand I definitely think it is a must see for anyone that wants to get involved in making movies, it shows perfectly how you should start a finish a film and also develop your characters.My only problem with the movie is the music,it's suppose to be a thriller but the music is almost comedy like,it certainly did not contribute to the movies mysterious storyline and when you find out the plot twist the music doesn't help make it shocking.I would highly recommend the Third Man to all moviegoers.When detective Holly Martins heads to Vienna he ends up investigating the very mysterious murder of his close friend Harry Lime.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Greatest Film Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Third Man is an art film disguised as a suspense thriller -- so well disguised that it would make a master of suspense like Alfred Hitchcock proud. But viewers who experience it only as an art film should heed Major Calloway's self-criticism and try digging deeper than a grave. And it's precisely because it allows casual audiences to enjoy it as a genre film that places The Third Man head and shoulders above all other art films (which operate on an art for art's sake format).So if The Third Man isn't just a suspense film, what is it? The answer is, that it's many things. In fact, it is so structured as to lend itself to an endless series of interpretation. Levels upon levels upon levels of meaning. The most prominent ones being: loss of innocence/disillusionment, political commentary, fantasy vs reality, the nature of good and evil, traditional morality vs modern amorality, confrontation with one's shadow/doppelgänger, and a Jungian attempt to stabilize an unbalanced psyche. This last interpretation provides the basic myth-making structure from which all other interpretations arise.Like Vienna, American writer Holly Martins' psyche is compartmentalized into 4 sectors: Ego (Holly), Shadow/Id (Harry), Anima (Anna) and Superego (Calloway). During the war, the shadow had become dominant, and wrought havoc on both America/Martins' psyche and the world (both symbolized in the bombed out landscapes of Vienna). At first the Ego attempts to protect its subconscious counterpart (Harry), but eventually the Superego wins out. Harry/Shadow is killed (banished to the underworld as symbolized by his fingers stretching helplessly out of the sewer grate), Anna/Anima is repatriated to the Russian sector (also suppressed), Calloway/Superego has restored order ... and Holly/Ego is left standing alone in a cold, bleak world of reality, disillusionment and loss.Note the confusion/alliance of identities in Anna's confusion of "Harry" and "Holly," along with her wearing Harry's initial's on her/(formerly his) pajamas. Holly's constant confusion of the real life drama with his pulp westerns (both to Calloway and Popescu) -- the b/w morality of which is as anachronistic as the cowboy heroes he identifies with. And his ultimate (or penultimate, depending on how one cares to interpret his state of mind at the ending) refusal to "be sensible"/"be reasonable" and accept, and to operate within, the modern world in all its amoral ambiguity ("I haven't got a sensible name").Equally ambiguous is the film's final stance: the world without Harry (amoral, corrupt, self-serving) is an empty one for both Holly and Anna. Despite Harry's flaws (which include the murder/mental of destruction of dozens of children he sold watered down penicillin to), we like him (as an audience) and need him (as a part of our psychic totality). In his self-serving way, he has even managed to perform some acts of kindness (forging Anna's papers to keep her the Russian sector). As if in demonstration of his famous "cuckoo-clock" speech, the return to order leaves our hero/ego alone in a graveyard of leafless trees with the psychological crutch of a socially acceptable drug (cigarette) as his only source of comfort. As he tosses the match to ground with a gesture of disgust, we're treated to what is possibly the single most bleak image a film has ever ended on.And, while the film is so justly celebrated for these points that they hardly need mentioning: Robert Krasker's cinematography is highly innovative, and superb, Carol Reed's direction brilliant, the acting of Joseph Cotton, Alida Valli, Orson Welles, Trevor Howard, as well as the wide array of wonderful character actors (Bernard Lee, Ernst Deutsch, Paul Hörbiger, Wilfrid Hyde-White), and even the extras (Krasker and Reed pick dozens of fascinating faces out of the Vienna streets to focus on) flawless, Graham Greene's original screenplay a masterpiece, and Anton Karas' "Greek Chorus" zither playing is both a stroke of genius and a blessing from the gods.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While this remains one of my favorite films, the choice of the actress "Valli" remains a major disappointment to me.She lacks any sort of expression throughout the entire film except for maybe, what, two scenes? Other than that, she holds the same expressionless sad puss throughout the entire picture. Good grief - couldn't they have found someone who could actually act?? They could have pulled someone off the street to "act" her part better.And apparently she really thought a lot of herself, based on her insistence that she be credited by one name only "Valli". How utterly precocious &amp; vain, especially considering her complete lack of talent. Exactly who did she think she was - the next "Garbo", as she was supposedly promoted when this picture came out? This picture, while terrific, could have been so much more with a better actress - or actually, ANY actress - in the female lead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Third Man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a really good example of a film noir for a death that never really happened. Basically a man who used to know quite a close friend Harry Lime witnessed his coffin being taken away. He was reported to have been killed by enemies of his and he is quite devastated to find out. He is now trying to find reason for his death, then one night he sees him, he sees Harry Lime (the excellent Orson Welles) back from the dead. He sees him later again and Harry tells him that he needed to pretend he was dead to stop his enemies chasing him. But now Harry is in trouble with the police (for some reason) and there is a good sequence where he is being chased in the sewers. Also starring Bernard Lee as Sgt. Paine. Orson Welles was number 16 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Men, and he was number 45 on The World's Greatest Actor, Harry Lime was number 37 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes &amp; Villains, the film was number 75 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills, it was number 26 on The Ultimate Film, it was number 30 on The 50 Greatest British Films, it was number 57 on 100 Years, 100 Movies, and it was number 41 on The 100 Greatest Films.

		<fullReview>You can tell a lot about people by their opinion of Orson Welles.The Third Man is too similar to Apocalypse Now in that most of the time is spent discussing the "secret ingredient". Unlike Brando in Apocalypse, Welles doesn't disappoint because he is more lyric with his role and more calculated in his approach. His acuity is too powerful for someone like Reed to direct him, how sad. Too bad the rest of the material here can't hold a candle to Welles' prose.Three Factors I appreciate: noir, black and white, and aged film. The drug scene has obviously changed since this movie, from extreme taboo to almost proud declaration, and B&amp;W has changed from obvious budget cut to "avant garde". Pshaw! This is not the Maltese Falcon and mystery ranks with science fiction and horror as the three genres that age the worst. Look at the original version of The Thing or Little Caesar, there's a difference between "aging" and "decomposing".The final 40 minutes are what this is all about. The story and scenes are a gaff, so it's up to the scenery and the setting to provide the atmosphere and the mood. That's noir.Overall, 2/3 of a rotten apple. Toss it back. Only worth for Welles' contributions and nothing else. (44%)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Long, boring melodrama that's what I'd call a "bone-ified" classic, not a bona fide classic as Maltin would have us believe. It's old-fashioned at best with annoying music done solely on a zither, which turns possibly intense scenes into a circus-like atmosphere. The over acting doesn't help and the story line is muddled and confusing. Even the so-called good cinematography looks obvious but does offer a few eye-catching shots of black and white contrasts.

		<fullReview>It's a noir classic, yes, but could anyone HEAR it? The audio is AWFUL! AWFUL! Again, the DIALOUGE IS BARELY HEARABLE. Maybe they cleaned it up for DVD, I don't know, I saw it on VHS. If you're in non-English country and saw it subtitled, you are far better off. It seems the Brits really didn't know how to do audio back then.I am not a "real" film buff, I just know what I like, and this was a disappointment since I did have high expectations. And while this film was set in Vienna, the music soundtrack has flavors of traditional Greek music. It's fine music, but a noir film set in Vienna doesn't play well with that. AT ALL. And unfortunately, it seriously detracted from my immersion into the film. Instead, it kind of killed the feel of the film for me. But I could barely hear what anyone was saying, anyway, so there you go.This film doesn't deserve to kicking around the top of any "great" movie list. There are a lot of good noir films that easily deserve to be placed far above this one. Yet, this is the one considered the classic.</fullReview>

How can one even compare Welles' own "A Touch Of Evil", a masterpiece in the true sense of the word, with this pile of bad writing, bad filming, bad acting, bad ideas, bad directing; in other words... pile of crap! Are you the people that highly under-rate Tarkovski's "Stalker" for example so that is has 8.0 avg, which is less than this unspeakable blasphemy of a movie. This doesn't even make justice for normal films-noir, again overrated, like "Double Indemnity" or "The Maltese Falcon". At least TMF has some nice characters. Here nobody inspires anything. It seems that all the people in this movie are idiots. Example: Our hero , Holly Martins, has the idea that Harry Lime is alive because, when our hero was as drunk as Bush in a summer day, he thought he'd seen his supposed dead friend in the city at night. Who in God's name would believe him. Seems the police does... Did those scriptwriters not know that also intelligent human beings, not only Marilyn Monroe fans would watch this movie. Carol Reed is a bad director. This movie actually started to hurt after about an hour. Manos The Hands Of Fate is better. Also, I understand that Orson Welles need the money, but this not a commercial film, this is not even a film.Period.</fullReview>
