		<shortDescription>My favourite of all the Disney animated movies and worth a look for any Disney fans.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a lot of people on this site, this is either one of thew best Disney movies or one of the worst. There is about 40 animated Disney movies and my personal favourite will always be the mad world of Wonderland. I don't actually know why but to me this is what i always thought about as a child, a mad world where simply nothing made sense. It goes like dynamite at only seventy two minutes and in that they have an array of entertaining characters and fourteen entertaining songs. To me it is the genius of Disney creating an entertaining look at a child's world. I think it is because of the Jungle Book that this is not as popular as some of the Disney Classics but you can't help but smile when you watch the Queen of hearts and the Mad Hatter being their own creative self's in the wonder of this amazingly clever gem</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Disney Favorite</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite the hostile reviews from many other Disney fans, I like Alice in Wonderland. Maybe it's because I've never read the original Lewis Carrol novels, or because some people take novel translations too seriously. The only other Alice movie I saw was the one aired on NBC in 1999, which also has its share of defense and offense. I liked that one (only because it included a lot of what wasn't used here), but this Disney version has always been my favorite. But then again, many of the original crew who worked on this movie--even Walt Disney himself--hated this movie. I wonder why? Disney usually does a marvelous job of creating quality cartoons &amp; movies. I can see some of what got people ticked off, but if the characters in Alice in Wonderland were so unlikeable (the major gripe of many viewers), how did Disney let it be so? Perhaps given the amount of time they put into making this film (about 10 years, excluding the WWII Era), the Disney artists could only do so much before wearily going with one thing, and seeing what happens.This film is somewhat different from most Disney movies. Alice is the only true hero, two characters (Alice's sister and Dinah) barely make their mark in the story, and practically every character Alice meets in Wonderland are real psychos, whom by the end of the story, are all against her (a million to one). But just about all of the characters (even Alice herself) were having mood swings. A few of those whom Alice encountered were doing such things as to entertain her, while others were either doing things to persecute her, get her in trouble, or just tick her off. I can see (to an extent) why Alice was the unhappy camper on some levels, because she didn't get the wonderland as she had envisioned, but instead one big nitemare. The whole idea was for Alice to find a way to escape from the boring real-world, then decide between staying with her fantasies, or going back to reality. After all, there's always an equal but opposite reaction for every action.There were numerous shots of Alice sedately giving attention to some of the characters' strange habits, rather than enjoying her trip, and others in where she was either mad or sad to be the main passive victim in the story. This all led up to a scene in where Alice begins her trek home, and leads a melancholy moment when she gets lost in the Tulgey Woods. Things didn't get much better for her when she met the Queen of Hearts...All of the characters were individually twisted, but most were strangely funny. The Tweedle brothers' story of the Walrus and the Carpenter was pretty weird (as were the bros themselves), and the flowers seemed friendly at first, but when they realized that Alice wasn't a flower, they instantly turn on her (notice how the Rose didn't do much to help her). The caterpillar was smoking from a hookah (a popular drug reference during the 1970's), and got easily p***ed at anything Alice did to him (such as laughing at his expense when his arms or legs weren't in unison). The Mad Hatter and March Hare both had an unusual way of hosting a tea party (the part where they destroy the White Rabbit's watch was really funny).The Cheshire Cat seemed to be a nuisance the first time, then a brief friend, and later became a troublemaker. The Queen of Hearts was big, fat, ugly, and screamed at almost anything out of line (That must have really put a strain on Verna Felton's voice!), while the King of Hearts was small, meek, and practically powerless (the polar opposite). There was also a ton of other strange characters taking unexplained hostility towards Alice, but I found most of those incidents to be the main vein of humor in this film. While many of these characters were unfriendly for the bulk of the film, nothing came to be as scary as did a couple scenes from Pinocchio. But based from this lengthy paragraph, this overload on story structure is probably another reason (along with the twisted character developments) as to why Alice in Wonderland came to be hated by critics, movie-goers, and the Disney crew upon its first release.Two of the more positive things about Alice in Wonderland are the artwork and the music. The background arts are pretty stylish (thanks to Mary Blair), and many designs I didn't catch until just recently seeing the movie again.The character designs and animation are also beautiful. The designs on Alice (the lone protagonist) were an overall visual standout (thanks to the then-teenage Kathryn Beaumont), and the designs of most of the Wonderland characters were great, too. I also liked the animation of the cards heralding the Queen's arrival (excellent choreography &amp; colors). Most of the songs were wonderful, particularly "In a Golden Afternoon". These are the two elements that kept some Disney fans' attention to a strange movie, even to this day.Overall, Alice in Wonderland is a good movie, and I can see some of why a lot of people hate it. I just wish that there was more to the "real-world" frames to the story, as in the time Alice was with her big sister and Dinah. The opening scenes could've used more impact on the main idea, while the closing scenes shouldn't have been so abrupt. During her trip, Alice made several references to Dinah, although the cat's barely visible role was being Alice's best friend. The beginning of Alice's nitemare (when she was chasing the White Rabbit) doesn't get much of a response, but the interesting parts begin once she meets the Doorknob. The ending (when the Queen of Hearts calls Alice to be killed, while every Wonderland character she met turned against her) was what reminded those who hated this movie that it was all a bad dream. More thankfully for everyone, the movie had a happy ending (as per usual for any Disney movie). But as I was saying earlier, there was a lot of what most people hated that I thought was funny, but I too felt that the story need a little more polishing. While I'm against the recent round of sequels Disney has been making, I'm a little curious of what they have planned for Alice in Wonderland. But as Alice said in the movie: "Curiosity often leads to trouble."Many kids have grown up on this Disney version of Alice in Wonderland (like most other Disney movies), and it'll still be that way for years to come. Again, despite the hatred this movie has gotten for more than 50 years, I still like it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Maybe not as 'charming' as most Disney films...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...and certainly "Pinocchio" had a more popular and memorable song score, but for my money I'd pick "Alice In Wonderland" as one of Walt Disney's top achievements in animation. From Lewis Carroll's story, and filled with knock-out colors (pinks and blues and reds on inky blacks), this episodic tale would not have worked so well if the direction hadn't been so graceful, setting a light, jovial mood, and the songs so tongue-trippingly clever. Alice herself (voiced by Kathryn Beaumont) is lovely and funny, the supporting characters appropriately manic, and the quiet moments gently even out the craziness (as with the Tulgey Wood/"Very Good Advice" sequence). Disney certainly runs hot ("Pinocchio", "Bambi") and cold ("The Sword and the Stone"), but this fantastic journey into nonsense, from a practically-unfilmable book, is endlessly interesting from a visual standpoint. ***1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderful Disney adaptation of Lewis Carroll's classic novels.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was a little worried when I went to watch the film version of Alice In Wonderland, because I just read the novel and Disney has a tendency to dumb down the material that they make into their films with goofball romantic nonsense and cutesy talking animals. While I did get more than the traditional share of talking animals with this film (as well as a variety of other inanimate objects), the film stayed more faithful to the original story than is generally expected from a Disney film. On the other hand, this WAS made in 1951, which makes me wonder what a more modern adaptation would look like. I read Alice In Wonderland and Through The Looking Glass for English 180 (Children's Literature) at the University of California, Davis, so needless to say, I read it with more of a literary appreciation than is generally applied to children's books. I was pleased to see so many of the characters from the second novel in this version of Alice In Wonderland (such as the Cheshire Cat, the talking flowers in the garden, and Tweedle-Dee and Tweedle-Dum), although I must admit that I was slightly disappointed to see that Through The Looking Glass has been assimilated into this version of Alice In Wonderland rather than adapted into its own film, which I think is an honor that it certainly deserves. As far as being a full length feature (although rather short at roughly 75 minutes), however, I think that this movie does justice to both stories, converting them into a single story rather smoothly, and only leaving out things that will only really be missed by people who know the novels enough to be disappointed that certain things were not included. I, for example, would have loved to see the whole chess story in Through The Looking Glass included in the film (there certainly was time for it), where Alice travels through Wonderland on her quest to become a Queen herself, but I am more than happy with how this film turned out.One of the only things that I noticed about this film that did not match up to the quality of the novels is that the books have so much more in them for adults than the movie does. There are so many tricks with language pulled in the books, such as in the conversations with Tweedle-Dee and Tweedle-Dum as well as several other characters, that it really makes you think about the English language as a game with which an endless variety of tricks can be played. In the film, this is hugely downplayed, even if only because it is done visually and the language tricks pass by so fast that kids are almost certain to miss them and even the most attentive of adults will have a hard time keeping up with them.As a whole, however, Alice In Wonderland is so wildly entertaining that the loss of some of the literary substance does not detract from it as a terrific tale of adventure and discovery, certain to be enjoyed by people of all ages. I have heard plenty of rumors that Lewis Carroll was on any of a variety of drugs while he wrote the novels (and plenty of rumors that he wasn't on any drugs at all), but there are certainly some things in the books and in the movie that could have only been conjured up by the most, um, eccentric of imaginations. We may never know for sure, but at least we have some wonderful entertainment. Read the books to your kids.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Timeless magic of warped genius.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most films age over time. In 20 years will Titanic still be as amazing as it was in 1998? Will Jurassic Park still have people gawping open mouthed at the cinema screen? I think not. Its a rarity, but sometimes, just sometimes, there comes a movie that is timeless, magical and eternal, one such film is Alice in Wonderland.It seems to me, when watching most Disney films, that Walt Disney had an evil masterplan to mess with the minds of children, young and old. Dumbo is a film about an outsider, Pinocchio is a film about a freak child who cannot stop lying. Walt only made these films family viewing through constantly having a moral ending. Dumbo can fly and Pinocchio is rewarded for risking his life to save another, however, these moral endings do not disguise the fact that, at times, Disney films were quite peculiar.Alice in Wonderland on the surface is a dreamlike fantasy about a child nodding off and visiting a wonderful wonderland where flowers sing, caterpillars smoke and rabbits talk. However, similarly to Blue Velvet, this film is not about the surface values, its is about the dark, seedy undertones that exist beneath the aesthetic surface.Below its surface lies a wealth of wholly unlikeable and unhelpful creatures. Aside from the King (Hooray) of Hearts, each character only serves to hinder Alice in her attempts to come to terms with her warped dream. The Cheshire Cat is responsible for putting Alice in court, the White Rabbit wants to have Alice destroyed when he finds her at his home, the flowers shun Alice when they incorrectly perceive her to be a common garden weed, the Mad Hatter and the March Hare also shun Alice for no reason whatsoever, this list is as long as the tunnel that leads Alice into her Wonderland.To look back at the film nowadays, one could surmount that the ending is nothing more than a cop-out (these thoughts were true for Lynch's Boxing Helena). She dreamt it all along is nothing more than saying, here, we'll give you licence to create a magical world, no boundaries because it all exists inside a young girls mind.I'll admit this review might seem overly critical of the film, but it is for these warped reasons and the context of what the film represents or least what it should represent that I absolutely adore it. Walt Disney might have had a masterplan to screw with the minds of his children, but I say, good luck to him. A subtle undertone to the magical shell of the movie shows that the yolk is in fact sour. I daren't but will compare this movie to Adrian Lyne's Jacob's Ladder, another film about a false surface level and the warped undertones of life and death.Sleep is only a state of mind, it's what happens in this state of mind that really matters. Or at least, what mattered to Walt.Classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oh You Can't Help That.....Most Everyone's Mad Here</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Disney has a knack for enlightening children to tales from centuries ago by animating them, adding some songs and making everything pretty and colourful, Alice In Wonderland is that and a whole lot more. Learning about Literary Classics from Disney cartoons is the most convenient, entertaining and wildly amusing ways of seeing what an author had intended the viewer to create in their mind. But nowadays, thanks to television, children can hardly get past the first sentence of a book without wanting a Pikachu or some sort of explosion to take place. That's where the magic of Disney films come in. The animators, imagineers, musicians and creators take massive pride in the making of their literary classics to Disney masterpieces and Alice In Wonderland is a prime example. The story of young Alice toppling down a rabbit hole and meeting a bunch of locals in the magical world of Wonderland is created perfectly through this Disney adaptation. Taking aspects from both the original Alice and Through The Looking Glass, the exploits of Tweedledum and Dee to the Mad Hatter's Tea party blend seemlessly in this brilliant animational masterpiece. The musical score, with each character owning their own theme music, and the various songs throughout are enjoyable and fantastic. The characters themselves shine, making each and everyone of them memorable especially the talents of Ed Wynn as The Mad Hatter and the brilliant J. Pat O'Malley as the Tweedles and their story telling equivalents. So, the ideal way to introduce children, or even Highschool Students having to do books from the 19th Century, is to find a Disney Classic such as Alice In Wonderland and marvel at the creative genius behind the team that made books exciting for the new generation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some brilliant animation in semi-successful adaptation of classic novel...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's face it, there are moments in ALICE IN WONDERLAND that are absolutely dazzling, imaginative and as artistic as anything the Disney artists were capable of doing. And yet, for all its achievement in the art of animation, this Disney film has always drawn mixed notices. Perhaps part of the problem is there is seldom a letup in the zany goings-on--seldom a chance to draw a breath and rest between each overly imaginative episode. Then too, it's the episodic quality of the whole story structure that upsets some as well as the frantic cartoon movements of its weird characters.Faults and all, it's still a colorful event--probably one of the richest uses of color Disney ever attempted and with some wonderful styling in its background art. For me, a highlight of the film is the singing/talking flower sequence ("Golden Afternoon") with its haughty flowers discussing Alice as if she was some kind of other worldly creature with funny looking stems. (It reminded me of the snooty elephants laughing and speaking with contempt of the new baby elephant in Dumbo). Other bits are equally brilliant--the shuffling army of cards in the Queen of Hearts episode; the baby oysters clothed in blue bonnets and pink dresses for the Walrus and the Carpenter; the droll humor in the Tweedledum/Tweedledee sequence; the smoking Caterpillar becoming irate when his three inches of height becomes the subject of conversation; and of course, the Mad Tea Party, full of hilarious slapstick and immensely aided by the voice talents of Bill Thompson (White Rabbit), Jerry Colonna (March Hare) and Ed Wynn (Mad Hatter). No less impressive is Verna Felton as the raucous voice of the Queen of Hearts in some of the film's funniest moments. With her army of cards, she plays a wicked game of croquet with flamingoes as mallets, hedgehog as a ball and cards as hoops, all the while displaying a lethal temper.Despite some brilliant animation, pleasant songs and gorgeous art work, it's just another example of how difficult it is ("impassable" to quote Carroll) to translate this particular tale to the screen and still remain faithful to the original. Others (many other versions, in fact) have failed--but Disney at least provides a sprightly, if frantic, version that has appeal for adults and children.Perhaps because its surrealism matched the hippy culture of psychedelia, ALICE enjoyed a welcome theatrical return engagement in the '60s and has become more respected in recent years (an American-made British fantasy popular even in the U.K.) as one of the studio's finest efforts.Ironically, one of its most delightful characters--the doorknob--never appeared in the book but was applauded everywhere as an inspired bit of business.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best Disney cartoon, by far</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Among all the Disney cartoons I have seen (and I think I've probably seen them all, until "Taram...", in 1983), "Alice in Wonderland" remains my favorite one. Of course, it has a lot of differences, comparing to the wonderful book from Lewis Carroll, but Walt Disney managed to give a strange object, without a real classical story (with a starting and an ending), which gives this film a funny "experimental side"... And I particularly love the beautiful colors in this film. It simply makes you want to follow Alice, who follows herself the White Rabbit, in the wonderland. Maybe "Alice in Wonderland" is more an "adult cartoon".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty Good Adaptation With Enjoyable Characters and Scenes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For material that does not lend itself very easily to cinema, this is a pretty good adaptation of "Alice in Wonderland" with some enjoyable characters and sequences. It succeeds, at least in a basic way, in capturing part of the manic but imaginative nature of Lewis Carroll's story.Much of the language, poetry, and ideas that make the original story so captivating cannot really be conveyed very easily in a movie, and so it would be nearly impossible for any cinema version of Alice to be completely satisfying to those who love the book. Instead, this version simply tries to make the characters come to life, and to use the animation to recreate the feel, if not the depth, of Alice's experience.The animation drives most of the movie, and at times it is pretty imaginative. Some of the voices work very well, too, with the likes of Ed Wynn and Sterling Holloway fitting the animated characters quite well.Carroll's stories are so enchanting and creative that it is no surprise that there have been so many efforts through the years to capture the magic of the Alice stories on film. None of the cinema versions has yet come close to matching the books, yet the material itself has made most of them worth watching. In this one, the overall production has a definite Disney style to it, which makes it different from the original, but as a movie it works pretty well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Classics from a golden Age</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have always liked this film, being a true blue Disney fan I consider it on of the great ones. I like the animation from the fifties. I have read the books and they frightened me more than this film, I know some of the reviewers feel the opposite. I feel that the Disney artists had a touch of what Wonderland is like and just had fun with this one. It is true there is no great feats here but when I have had a stressful day I like to put the brain in neutral and just enjoy the dazzling colors. The silliness is great and the cast brilliant. Alice was one of Mr. Disney's least favorite characters, he thought she was too cold. But when you are surrounded by a bunch of loonies that don't care for you I think you might be cold too. On a scale of 1 to 10 I would rate this an 8.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.I spent a goodly part of my life becoming an expert in the Alice material, so have had to work to temper this comment: My initial feeling on this project is one of utter despair, as Walt and company took something that was both fun AND rich, and bleached all the richness out of it. But you don't want to read that.What is interesting is the fact that it is still fun, and this puzzled the dickens out of me for a long time. That Dickens thing - I think I understand it now.The notion of a story entered the Victorian era and emerged in three pieces, and that story of the story is quite a story.Those three `pieces' founded distinct threads - traditions of storytelling - that are in a sense at war among each other for mindshare. And it is not simply for control over how we are entertained, but how we situate ourselves in life.One thread, wholly new, was created by Charles Dodgson. It was a voyage into an internal space created by one's own mind - itself a modern notion. There, we encounter all manner of ourselves and the puzzling artifacts of the world as we receive them. It is rich stuff, this literature, worth spending time with; highly self-aware and self-referential. In fact, a goodly part of Dodgson's self-reference was in ruminating on the nature of self-reference. Joyce comes from this tradition, as well as our reinvention of Shakespeare.Another thread, equally new, was created by Charlie Dickens. Previously, we had a literature of situations, often driven by an external fate. Dickens turned this on its head by creating a form based on characters. What Dickens does is create amazing characters - using a variety of tricks - that are so alive that they drive the story. Instead of the reader understanding the nature of fate, or of the situation, he/she merely needs to become familiar with the characters and follow them as they bump up against each other.(The third thread, the one that cinema most uses, is the detective form where the writer and reader are engaged in a battle of wits to create the narrative.)That Dickens model is less work for the reader/viewer. All the fun of the read is in discovering these personalities. This combination of fun and ease makes this thread often run into the lower scale of entertainment, all way down to wrestling and soap operas. Dickens' method of writing was so extreme in this regard that he would write and publish chapters of large works without knowing where the characters would take him.What Disney did with `Alice' (and other projects) was to transport the story from one of these threads (that of Dodgson) to another, that of Dickens. So instead of Alice going through a Kabbalistic Tarot-structured series of encounters with various problems in self, knowing and representation, she just goes from one colorful character to another. It works because Disney makes these characters more fun than they ever were in the books. There, they were puppets through which he could speak. Here, they are the faces of the world.While I worry about the destruction of an intellectual landmark, I have to have admiration for the intelligence of what Walt did. The technical details of the transformation are pretty ponderous and required some extensive reworking of the episodes. For instance, check out the tea party which in the book is an amazing confabulation of reasoning about the inadequacies of reasoning. Disney turns it into a dance, even though many of the words are preserved, including the `writing-desk' riddle. The garden of flowers is an even more extreme case. Its absolutely amazing, wonderful.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 4: Has some interesting elements.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Any number of Wonderland movies, treatments, stage plays and TV series have been filmed and every couple of years, someone tries again. IS Disney's the best? Best is a trifle irrelevant, as it presupposes that one version can poke its head above others in all categories. I tend to think of the Alice films as a series of oral histories; all of them deviate from the book in drastic ways, but each has good and bad points.For Disney, the plot (of which there is none in the classic masterwork) is Alice learning to pay attention to good advice and be more responsible. A bit heavy handed, perhaps, but it was 1951.This considerable sub-plot aside, the character treatments and voice actors are dead-on.There are a few "stananks," however. A few problems never addressed by Disney (corporate) in the fifty-plus years Alice has been out. The most egregious is the final segment of the tea party, which includes a scene animated, but never colored and two sections of animation and dialogue out of sequence. Likely, unfortunately, to remain out of sequence for all time, because Disney artists, being mainly priggish, tend to agree with Walt himself, who felt the film "lacked heart"(read: had no love story)...and "never made sense anyway."So, what makes Disney's version so worth seeing? He gets the story wrong, he interposes characters i9n random order and leaves out half of them. Why is this the best-known version?Because it is the most memorable. The colors, the wonder, and the (hate to say this) magic are at a premium. This is the one I remember form my childhood, and it was 75 minutes that changed my life. Imagination lived in that wonderland, in a way rarely seen in today's cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fine film, one that the Disney organisation can be proud of(with one exception).</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It would seem that I have a great many complaints about various DVD releases of famous films(check out my reviews for 'Krakatoa, East of Java' and 'When Worlds Collide' if you don't believe me). Well I'm afraid nothing has changed.However, up front I must say that this is a brilliantly animated movie and will always be one of my favourites--despite the criticism that follows.When I purchased my first DVD copy of 'Alice In Wonderland' I was tempted to get rid of my videotape version.I'm very glad that I didn't and I'll tell you why.For three quarters of an hour I revelled in the story as well as the artwork involved.Then we got to the Mad Hatter's Tea Party.Possible Spoiler Here:No doubt something went wrong when the engineers were creating the digital transfer. Perhaps someone belched at the wrong time. That is the only explanation I can give for the transfer of two pieces of dialogue. Originally(and my tape version confirmed this) after the pocket watch has gone berserk(what watch wouldn't after having the likes of tea, salt, butter and jam inserted into its inner mechanism?)the White Rabbit says, '...and it was an Unbirthday present, too.' The Mad Hatter replies with, '...It Was?!' Then he and the March Hare throw the Rabbit out of their garden to the tune of the 'Unbirthday Song'. Well on the DVD the two conversations have been reversed making the conversation(and the whole sequence) irrelevant. For me it spoils an otherwise perfect film.In the hope of finding the problem had been corrected I purchased two more DVD copies. The first of these was the last region 2 release; it was no better than the previous copy. Finally, in desperation, I purchased a region 1 edition(the Gold Collection). You can probably imagine my disappointment when I discovered that the Americans must have suffered from the same problem!Regretfully I must conclude that ALL copies of Disney's 'Alice In Wonderland' suffer from the same complaint. The only thing I can do is to keep my tape copy(I have no idea how much longer it will last; it's showing considerable wear. I must have had it for at least ten years and maybe longer) until as such time as Disney rectify this irritating situation.I have never read the books so I'm unable to comment on that aspect of AIW. All I can say is that the film looks and sounds marvellous.I give the film 9 out of 10 because of the above criticism.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>one of a handful of Disney films that work very well for totally different crowds</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alice in Wonderland is, as well as what the one-line summary suggests, is one of the more abstracted kind of animated films the Disney studio has ever released. And it needs this edge for what the material requires. Here is a film that means different times throughout a life, for some people. As a kid it's a wondrous, madcap adventure with as much sincerity and polite little moments with Alice as it contains vision after vision where varied forms of caricatured anarchy and odd transformations in the guise of fables. As an older teen, it comes off more as seeming like a 'drug' movie, and of course Carroll's original story has become not just a phrase for 'through the looking glass' in society, but as part of metaphors for the drug community ("White Rabbit" is one of those classic, strange 60's songs that still works today). For what Carrol intended when he wrote the book - for his child friend named Alice - it's taken on other, surrealistic connotations over the centuries. With various allusions to such substances like the big-and-small pills, the caterpillar with the pipe, the hare and hatter with their 'tea', and the Cheshire Cat going in through the out door, it's not too hard to picture it as being a precursor to the 60s.But, of course, there is also that very innocent approach that the Disney films had of that early period. Alice is as innocent and day-dreaming as Snow White, though with a little more interest due to her having to be a formidable enough guide through this imaginative world. And there are little, surreal fables that are laced in that, again, capture the absurd poetic tone of Carroll's work. The segment with the Walrus and the Carpenter is a very good example of this, and is one of the funniest segments not only of the film but maybe of any Disney feature of the period. And stretching out after going into taking the ideas and images from the book into animated form, the abstractions become rather incredible for their time. As a kid as well as now I loved seeing the large Alice start to cry to the point of creating a dangerous sea of it right by the snobbish doorknob. The Cheshire Cat is one of those insane concoctions that is delightful in its unhinged abandon. The Queen of Hearts sequences towards the end are, for me, the only ones that are more closer to the 'traditional' Disney films where the looser, crazier nature that went on before with the March Hare and Mad Hatter took place (one of my all-time favorite Disney scenes by the way- that little mouse deserved some sort of prize).Overall, this is quite a treat to revisit years later- yes, even in a non-induced kind of state- with cheerful songs, and a neat balance of delirious humor and silly imagination. In short, a film like this probably couldn't be made today, at least by Disney.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The essence of what it is to be a child.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wonderland is the essence of what it is to be a child, to have an imagination, to bask in complete and utter nonsense, to revel in the chaos of dreams.Alice is all children. They want adventure, they want to giggle, they want flowers to sing and delightful little cakes to possess potent magic powers.The book is much less over the top. But the movie captures something else. Something far more extravagant. It's simpler and I think it benefits from being so simple. It's not trying to be clever. It doesn't need to.At its roots, this is a fantastical celebration of nonsense.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underappreciated and overlooked</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Right from the stunning (hand drawn!) opening sweep of a verdant riverbank on a lazy summer's day, "Alice in Wonderland" is one of the most beautifully animated of the Disney films of the 1950s. Unfortunately, this film has always been one of the most maligned in the Disney canon.Many books on the subject of Disney's animated films will often only devote a paragraph or two to the film, and in that short paragraph it will invariably mention how "Alice" was a financial flop, how Walt Disney himself wasn't very fond of it, how it's a chilly film. I don't find this film chilly, I find it refreshingly free of sentiment or cliche that can often weigh down other Disney films.To start with, we have Alice. Unlike Cinderella or Snow White, Alice has a lot of personality. Who among us hasn't been very frustrated that Cinderella just took all the abuse from her stepmother and sisters and was powerless? Alice, on the other hand, is not one of the "shy little violets" and operates on more than just one emotion; she gets mad, befuddled, disgusted, amused, angry and, best of all, she stands up to adults (how odd for the 50's) and tells them when they are being ridiculous. This film has a subversiveness that may have been unintentional in showing how the world of adults, with its rules and logic, can be purely nonsense and that a child can be the only sane person in the lot. (To be fair, this sentiment is in keeping with Lewis Carroll's original books.)Alice is beautifully voiced by Kathryn Beaumont (who did a similarly excellent job as the voice of Wendy in "Peter Pan" a few years after.) The real appeal of Alice here is that unlike many other Disney heroines,Kathryn Beaumont was a young girl when she recorded the voice and therefore, Alice looks and sounds like a girl of a certain age. Contrast that to Mary Costa's voice and the animated figure of Sleeping Beauty who looks as if she could be a 1950s pinup model despite only being 16.The story itself is a wild trip through an ever shifting dreamscape most notable for the wild color schemes that anticipate the 1960's motifs. This is not implying that "Alice in Wonderland" is one big drug reference; it is not. Many people who worked on this film have commented that it felt like the film was getting away from them, that the characters took on lives of their own. This is evident as the film just gets wilder and wilder as it goes on with the introductions of the most bizarre and colorful characters Disney ever brought to life.The only real flaws in the film include a scene when Alice breaks down and berates herself for never following her own advice, this moment stops the film cold in the middle of what has been a non-stop thrill ride. The extremely abrupt ending of the film is a very strange choice. I think even an extra 20-30 seconds between Alice and her sister at the conclusion of the film would have made the film a little stronger.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>People say Alice is a poor film. They say it's meaningless and lacks the warmth of classics like Snow White, 101 Dalmatians and Bambi. But what happens in Alice. It's just a perculliar dream. Snow White is about jealousy and attemptive murder. 101 Dalmatians is about illegally poaching animals to make a coat. And Bambi contains hunting, murder and setting a forest alive. Along with Pinocchio, this is my favorite Disney movie because the characters are more colourful than any other. Characters like Mad Hatter, Walrus and The Queen are fun. The marijuana smoking Caterpillar doesn't look very high. Originally, the characters were going to look more like the Teniel drawings, but they went with a more cartoony approach. This is a bit disappointing, but never mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most imaginative and creative animated Disney classics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 13th animated Disney classic is, without a doubt, one of the most original, distinctive, imaginative and creative movies Disney ever made. It isn't a perfect movie but it sure makes the difference.Through the years the successive re-releases of this movie saved it, giving it the deserved credit and success, but when this initially came out in 1951 it was a failure and largely criticized.I heard that Walt Disney didn't like very much the character Alice because in his opinion she was cold. I don't see why Walt Disney had that opinion about her. There's nothing cold about her. I think she's a nice little girl. When she falls in despair, it's easy to feel sorry for her.Some parts of this movie are a bit weak, but that's not a major flaw. My least favorite character is obviously the Queen of Hearts. I don't like her at all. I guess nobody likes her, because she is meant to be hateable.But apart that this movie is full of awesome characters: the Cheshire Cat, the Dormouse, the Mad Hatter, the March Hare, the Caterpillar, the White Rabbit, the army of cards, Alice, Alice's sister, Dinah, the Doorknob and even strange creatures like a dog-broom, duck-horns, bird-mirrors, bird-cages, bird-pencils, etc...The creativity of this movie is not only on its peculiar characters, but also on its extravagant details: sceneries, gardens, places, original designs, etc...What also makes this movie so different is the personality of the characters: they're all mad, but hilarious (except the explosive Queen of Hearts, of course) and they do the craziest and silliest things. That makes them so funny. The silly humor of this movie is very classic, which is another big attribute.Only in "Alice in Wonderland" you can see hilarious things such as the unbirthday tea party celebrated by the Mad Hatter, the March Hare and the cute Dormouse.Where else you can see such an enigmatic and cool character like the Cheshire Cat, a mad character with great sense of humor and the power of becoming invisible? Only in "Alice in Wonderland", of course.Dinah (Alice's kitten) is one of the cutest Disney animals. She was drawn to be cute and adorable, like Figaro and others. The way she movies her little paws is so lovely and so is the way she chases Alice. To see kittens like Dinah and Figaro makes you wish to have a cat like that.Richard Haydn is hilarious as the Caterpillar, a character who speaks in a very calm way, but with a voice that seems to come from his nose and a short temper.The great Sterling Holloway has one of his most spectacular performances ever as the voice of the amazing Cheshire Cat.The unforgettable Ed Wynn gives such an energetic performance as the voice of the Mad Hatter and Jerry Colonna is great as the March Hare's voice.Bill Thompson is cool as the White Rabbit's voice. But I must say that Kathryn Beaumont is wonderful as Alice's voice, James MacDonald is fabulous as the Dormouse's voice, Joseph Kearns is funny as the Doorknob's voice and Heather Angel is awesome as the voice of Alice's sister. They're all great Disney legends.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining Disney classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On a warm summer afternoon, Alice is playing with her cat when she spots a white rabbit complaining that he is late for something. Curious, Alice follows the Rabbit and falls down the rabbit-hole. When she reaches the bottom of the hole, she finds herself in a crazy world where everything is topsy-turvy. She meets Tweedledee and Tweedledum. She discovers that certain foods can make her grow taller or smaller. She meets the ever-grinning Cheshire Cat. She joins the Mad Hatter and the March Hare in their crazy tea party. Alice finally meets the loud-mouthed Queen of Hearts, who challenges her to a croquet match, which is stopped short when Alice is accused of playing a prank on the Queen. After causing a disruption in her court trial, Alice wakes up, realizing that she had dreamed the whole thing.Walt Disney, ever since the 1930's, had always wanted to adapt Lewis Carroll's classic books to the screen, but had problems with the story. When he finally got the chance, he was disappointed with the result, and the film, unfortunately, was a box office failure. But the film is entertaining nonetheless. The characters are wonderfully brought to life, just the way Lewis Carroll wrote them. Wonderland is beautifully drawn, with the Disney animators giving it just the right amount of fantasy. The songs (some of which are adaptations of poems found in the ALICE books) are fun, especially "A Very Merry Unbirthday"! The voice talent is perfect, with Kathryn Beaumount (later to become Wendy in Disney's PETER PAN) as Alice, Jerry Colonna as the March Hare, Ed Wynn (at his best) as the Mad Hatter, and Verna Felton (the fairy godmother in Disney's Cinderella, Aunt Sarah in LADY AND THE TRAMP) as the Queen of Hearts. Overall, this is one of Disney's best! Recommended. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you ever feel like writing a book about nonsense, breaking the number 1 rule of ending it with "it was all a dream" then making it so surprisingly popular that it is going to be the next big thing in Disney movie history then I ain't stopping yah! Alice in wonderland is just this, a cross between childish dreams and real life, the real life being that it was all a dream. However, when first watching this film I did consider the ending a spoiler but the second time I watched it, it captured my heart. The animation clarity may not be all that but the film most definitely is.Just like legendary Disney films such as "The little Mermaid" and "The Lion King" it will remain a family classic forever.But one thing that did bug me from time to time in the film was the way that Alice kept on giving into the temptation of curiosity, I don't know about you but if I saw a talking rabbit with a waistcoat, matching watch and gloves I'd leg it the opposite direction screaming for my mum. But it did capture the immense stupidity of most kids who just have to try some things even when they know it would lead to trouble. Those where the days eh?</fullReview>

This movie manages to capture many aspects of the original novel but has been adapted so that children of all ages can enjoy. The voice acting for this movie is well done as with most Disney films at this time and the quality is simply stunning. The story rarely manages to keep good balance and keep you moving up and down. The movie does have some animated violence but no real blood is used. The songs are enjoyable if a bit dated but considering things as they are this music is something that is enjoyable and memorable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Film Adaptation to date- C'mon Hollywood!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Honestly, When I was about 3 or Four was when Alice first hit Video- sometime in the early 80's- and it was, by far, my favorite movie. Although, having bought it last year as the two disc special edition- I realized that it didn't feel as magical as it did when I was younger, but it is, in my humble opinion, although flawed, the best film adaptation. Flawed? Well, I don't understand why Walt would "Condense" the two books- being a pioneer, in not just animation, but in film all together (thank him for foreign dubbing, original soundtracks, and surround sound) it seems odd that Walt, although firm in his principles (Unlike the Disney half A$$ed approach to their animation in the last 6 or 7 years)- he was ever the businessman, and two movies could have faired well (back then the straight to video watered down make the money but don't spend too much on them sequels and prequels)- Which also make one wonder with all the crappy sequels Disney comes up with- why not make a sequel that actually exists? Aside from that, the movie still maintains the imagination of Lewis Carroll's original work, through the fantasy, and even a little darkness, and Beaumont's voice work as Alice is still the only one to talk to herself and still sound sincere, rather than crazy or forced like all the others (one that stands out is the Fiona Fullerton Alice who left me annoyed. The songs are tolerable, not as catchy as most Disney fare, and although the film seems, at times, like an acid trip, it's responsible for how we see Alice today (another ability attributed to Disney- name any Disney character based on literature or fable, and chances are you'll see the Disney one- Snow White- Blue and Yellow Dress? And the Classic Pooh always gets overshadowed by Disney's Winnie, and pre Disney, the Little Mermaid generally had Blonde Hair, and a blue tale, bet you saw a fiery little redhead with purple shells and green fins.) With the advancement in technology and the amazing ability to do almost ANYTHING in movies nowadays, why hasn't anyone created the next great Alice in Wonderland? Overall, It's Diney, it's a classic, and if you're going to watch an Alice movie- stick with this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favorite classic Disney</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, this is the one. Little snippets from 'Alice' have actually been incorporated into my persona over the years. When I write notes to coworkers I sometimes draw the Cheshire Cat face on the note. The bureaucracy I work in sometimes reminds me of Wonderland. I don't have mushrooms that make me big on one side and small on the other, however. Alice's bizarre dream world has always appealed to me at a more adult level than most of the other old Disney classics, no matter what you may have heard what really happened with Snow White in the dwarf residence. Alice is interested in everything rather than just romance and ponders situations in a way that I find engaging.The animation is just as elaborate as any Disney had made up to that point. Generally cheerful solid and pastel colors, it has been remastered with the same TLC that Snow White and Cinderella were. You have your choice of the original mono sound track or the remastered 5.1 track. I listened to the 5.1 and can't say that there was a lot of action on my surrounds or subwoofer. I sounded fine, just not very 5.1. I give the movie an 8.5/10.The 2 DVD set has a bunch of extras. Included is the Mickey Mouse short that went along with 'Alice', titled 'Thru the Mirror' and the 1st Walt Disney TV broadcast, which featured 'Alice' and several Disney cartoons. At the dawn of TV they were still working out exactly what to do on screen, and this 1st Disney show was a get-together. The sponsor, Coca-Cola was served at the party in its old 8 oz bottles while the narrator blabbed about how refreshing it was. Actually that's not so bad as the barrage of disjointed sound bites commercial TV has now (and why I watch very little of it). Also included are trailers, a making of, some kiddie stuff, etc.. Overall a nice package and it rates a 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clever visuals but not a Disney classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the success of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) and many other animated films to come after it, there came a time when Walt Disney would adapt a famous story in his vision that would involve a much different tale. That story is Alice in Wonderland,...unfortunately, it may create some mixed results for various viewers. For the most part, this is based on the original story to begin with. If you don't like the original, you probably won't enjoy this either. I was on the fence for this even though I do support it more than I didn't enjoy it. But it still lacked a lot of what many people would consider a Disney classic.The story begins in the real world where Alice, a little girl is being a taught a history lesson from an adult. But Alice has other plans, she's too much into fooling around like a kid and not having to care about education and other important skills. She becomes bored and follows a rabbit yelling that he's late and thus begins her vertigo adventure into the world of wonderland. I think the term really should be called crazy-land or nonsense land because that's really what is the description of this place. There's nothing to gaze on in wonder about. The pace at which these inhabitants live is remarkably fast. Almost like they're all on a sugar rush. A lot of them are also very rude which is a bit strange for Disney.It doesn't last forever but the pace is very quick for about half the film and it can get extremely annoying to watch. It won't help that the main character, Alice, becomes fed up with everything around her as well. It's good character development but for me, if the main lead is frustrated, then so am I. If the lead is tired of its surroundings I will be too. This is mostly because the first half of the movie was all random occurrences. There didn't feel like much of a plot to begin with and by the end, my opinion had not changed. The point at which where viewers might change from annoyed to appreciating the cleverness of Disney's adaptation, is when Alice runs into the garden bed full of flowers. It'll be cool to see how Disney and Co. smartly marry the names of flowers and adjectives together. From there, viewers will finally be able to enjoy the zaniness that is the more popular characters like the Mad Hatter and the Cheshire Cat. Thankfully for them, they are given more charm than most of the other characters. But again, they're all a little too goofy to be liked all the time because even they become nuisances at some point.However, if there's something to give credit for, it's the animation and music - score wise. The soundtrack that has the musical numbers,... they were alright but there were only a few that were catchy like "Painting the roses red" or "The un-birthday song". The animation though is as great as all the others are. The imaginative drawings and character design are extremely unique. Oliver Wallace, a composer for many other Disney films like Peter Pan (1953) and Lady and the Tramp (1955) did a good job at the score as well. Besides this, if there's one useful lesson learned from this movie, it's that being crazy can be funny but too much nonsense can dilute the experience.This is probably the most divergent of all Disney oldies. The animation and musical score are appreciated but the plot is seriously lacking along with very few likable characters with the rest being fairly rude. Even the few likable characters can get tiresome.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Something of a Wayward Tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In some ways I like Alice in Wonderland very much. And in some ways it falls kind of flat. I think it all stems from the transition of mediums and the radically different beast the original book was.As pretty much everyone in the Western Hemisphere with any education knows, Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass are simply nonsense for nonsense sake. There are no real moralizing overarching themes: they exist on the merit of wit and wordplay. Now in that, they are wonderfully successful and entertaining. So why adapt them into a film- namely a Disney film, known for it's life lessons and happy endings? Well that is the question that everyone would like answered.While glimpses of the original wit shine through during the entire movie, there is a disconnect in the obliged Disney storyfication. Now I never begrudge Disney for tailoring their sources to their trademark pattern- they do it so well. However this time it does feel a misstep choosing a source so unsuitable to their goal. Here the words are a tumbling, bumbling servant, not the framed focus and the morals leave a heavy taste in an otherwise whimsical palette.That being said, Alice is not without its values. The serial stories were mostly entertaining, especially the walrus and the carpenter. Even more than that, the characters are vividly memorably and interesting, though when you really sit down to think about it, not a one is extremely likable or even pleasant. That is the greatest feat, so props both to the animators and the writing team (and obviously Mr. Carroll).And the film is itself quite interesting visually- with Mary Blair at the helm of the backgrounds. I wish her influence had spread to the character design - it could have really punched it up. You can see this film starting the crossover from the soft rounded "typical" Disney animation to a more graphic style that culminated in Sleeping Beauty.The music is pretty good- nothing outstandingly stunning, but it all fits in and moves the story along very well. I have to say I do not find Katherine Beaumont to be a gifted singer- her warbling voice did nothing for me.While I do not find Alice in Wonderland to stink of all that is wrong with the world, I cannot shout its praise with any enthusiasm either. It has its highs and lows, its merits and pitfalls. While Alice captures my interest for the time she is on, I never find myself clamoring for her presence, humming her tunes, or even thinking about her really. If I was presented with a quote, my mind would immediately race to the novel, not the film. And that, I think is a testament to the endurance of the original.Quote of the film:"The time has come" the Walrus said, "to talk of many things. Of shoes and ships and sealing wax, of cabbages and kings. And why the sea is boiling hot, and whether pigs have wings."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lacking in comparison to many other Disney films, but overall, still decent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think I first became familiar with the title, "Alice in Wonderland" when I saw a TV show of that name, but it wasn't long afterwards that I first saw this Disney adaptation of Lewis Carroll's stories. Just like probably every other animated Disney feature I saw in my childhood, other than "Pocahontas", I enjoyed this one, and can recall seeing it several times. The last time I watched it was just last night, and watching it shortly after watching "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" and "Pinoccio", I was mildly disappointed, but fairly satisfied in the end.One afternoon, a young girl named Alice is up on a tree branch, as she is read to from a history book. She is very bored by this book, and finds it hard to pay attention, so she begins to think of her fantasy world. Soon, she sees a talking White Rabbit, who is in a big hurry for some reason! She follows this rabbit into a burrow, and soon finds herself gradually falling down a hole! After she finally gets to the bottom, still following the White Rabbit, she comes to a small door with a living doorknob! After some struggle, she manages to get through, and enters Wonderland, where she sees many strange things that she has never seen before! After a while, she finds that this world is very confusing, and she no longer wishes to be there, but it appears that getting out and back home will be a challenge! Many Disney films have widely been considered masterpieces, and I can certainly give some of them that label myself! However, I personally can't do that with "Alice in Wonderland", as I have definitely found some problems that bring it down. The songs in the movie generally aren't very memorable, and some parts are a bit dull, most notably the part with the talking flowers (which includes a very forgettable song). The Alice in this movie lacks a bit in her character and emotions. However, despite those shortcomings, this "Alice in Wonderland" adaptation does have some amusing characters (such as the White Rabbit, Tweedledee and Tweedledum, Caterpillar, the Mad Hatter, etc.), humour, very interesting places that Alice finds herself in, and a fair amount of excitement, all of which it deserves some credit for.Like you would expect from Disney films, this one has a lot of entertain kids with (I know I enjoyed it way back), and has some things to entertain adults with, though maybe not as much as other Disney movies. Overall, "Alice in Wonderland" is far from a perfect family feature, but if you're a Disney fan, regardless of your age, I think you would PROBABLY find something to like about it. Undoubtedly, many superior animated features have come from Disney through the decades, both before and after this one, but this one is a mixed blessing, with both memorable and forgettable elements.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Walt Disney's animated version of the popular children's story by author Lewis Carroll is about a young girl named Alice, who is bored and restless, and also has quite a vivid imagination, as she sees a white rabbit holding a watch crying about how he's late, and following him into the Wonderland, a crazy place where she finds no end of trouble, being shrunk to tiny size, only to be restored to normal height, but running into nutty characters like Tweedledee &amp; Tweedledum, the Mad Hatter and his wild Tea Party, the elusive Cheshire Cat, and finally the evil Queen Of Hearts, who wants Alice dead... Colorful film lacks a certain amount of warmth and charm, but is still entertaining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The poetry of dreams lies in their inner anarchy and total freedom ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a time to be a child! Today is so tainted with obviousness and technological abundance that the age of imagination seems long over. As a future father, I hope my child would walk on the edge of a sidewalk imagining it's a tightrope above a ravine, or avoiding the red paved stones that would be bottomless pits. I wish modernity would never destroy this treasure which is imagination, the only natural craving to never be fully satisfied.And Lewis Carrol's "Alice in Wonderland" pushes this natural thirst for escapism to an overdose-like limit, featuring one of the richest and most colorful galleries of character in literature's history, so many peculiar creatures that have enriched our memories, from a wisecracking cat to a hurried rabbit, a gluttonous walrus or a tyrannous Queen. Just like "The Wizard of Oz" or "The Little Prince", we follow the journey of a child, embarked (or trapped) in a fantastic world where friendly and hostile encounters would provide valuable lessons. Both picaresque and coming-of-age stories, their timeless and universal appeal wakes up children's capability to learn from imagination, the closest form of philosophy for a child, the eternal dream of a world 'over the rainbow' or under a river, where dreams come true.And who was more entitled, skilled and anticipated than Walt Disney to adapt this literary exhilaration of imagination into a film? to unfortunately meet with relative disappointment. Indeed, regardless of the film's initial intent, it obviously didn't succeed, and exploring the reasons of this mixed reaction made me wonder if the project wasn't doomed from the beginning. Most of the first Disney features, from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" to "Cinderella", were adapted from fairy-tale stories, short enough to leave room for new plot devices, artistic licenses, memorable songs or better characterizations of the villains and peripheral characters. Yet "Alice in Wonderland" features so many characters that even a ratio of one-per-minute wouldn't have been enough to cover the 60-minute format, and it's such a classic of literature it inevitably compromised any attempt to deviate from the original story.I had the chance to grow up with the 80's animated series of "Alice in Wonderland" and each episode was centered on a Wonderland character, including some that were absent from the film like the Duchess or Humpty-Dumpty. While the series-format fitted the episodic structure of the story (the tea party with the Mad Hatter and the March Hare, the Oysters' story, each had a specific episode dedicated to it) unfortunately, in the film, there was not enough time to generate an appeal. Much worse, through all her interactions, Alice was constantly abused, teased and tormented by wisecracking and snobbish creatures. Even the cute flowers who resurrected the magic of "Flowers and Trees" started acting as pompous divas. And Alice's streak of bad luck didn't end there and went on and on until the climactic confrontation with the Queen, probably the only character with relative substance, even more than Alice.Alice is still an endearing heroine as she mirrors our child's fears and curiosities. We all imagined how it would feel be to be bigger and smaller, or been tempted to taste or drink some mysteriously appetizing food. It's still ironic that all through her adventure, she only becomes more annoyed and suspicious, as if the underlying lesson of her adventure was that sometimes, a nonsensical world could be as tough and rough as reality. After all, when there is no place for conventions, when un-birthdays are celebrated, it also conceals such positive aspects of real-life as good manners and courtesy. And if Dorothy came to the conclusion that 'there was no place like home', she would still have a soft spot for this wonderful world of Oz and the friends she met, while Alice would probably be traumatized by her trip in Wonderland..However, if the episodic structure and the characters' meanness seemed to have canceled the positive effect the film could have, time played like a solid ally and allowed the same kids who were puzzled by the film to appreciate its surrealistic aspect as adults. At the peak of the drug culture that prevailed in the late 60's and early 70's, the film met with a new public and garnered more positive reactions, admittedly opposite to the values for which Disney stood for but since when does Disney only appeal to children? And the enumeration of "Alice"' flaws became totally pointless as soon as you regard the film as a surrealistic adventure, without purpose, where the only thrills come from literally wondering what comes after. Why does Alice follow the rabbit, if not because it's simply the seemingly linear structure of dreams as a series of episodes without a beginning (the Rabbit was already walking) and without an end, as suggested by the climactic chase in the maze. The poetry of dreams lies in their inner anarchy and total freedom.But I concede that the surrealistic aspect wouldn't necessarily make the film more enjoyable, it's still a little too zany and cacophonous. I had the same reaction while comparing two Bunuel movies: "Un Chien Andalou" and "L'Age d'Or" and wondering if a short story wouldn't better fit the dream-format. Maybe this is why Alice could have made a great animated series, even more since Disney make his debut through a live-action animated series inspired by Alice's adventure. We all enjoy a little trip sometimes, and maybe this is why the four minutes of "Pink Elephants in Parade" in "Dumbo" will forever be more unsettling, disturbing and memorable than "Alice in Wonderland".It's easy to speculate on the causes of the film's semi-success: too ahead of its time, not aimed for the right target, too unstructured or unfocused, there still is something undeniably appealing, if only on the imagery department and the gutsy deviation from the usual Disney material, and "Alice in Wonderland" is still a wonder in the history of Disney's animated features.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Disney's animated version of the Lewis Carroll's classic, "Alice in Wonderland" is one of the most underrates entries in the Disney Animated Canon.It is true that isn't completely faithful to the original source material (Like most of the Disney animated adaptations of fairy tales and books) but even with those differences, this version manages to capture very well all the sense of magic and wonder that the movie had to offer.Combining some elements from "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" with a few additional elements from the book "Through the Looking-Glass", this is, in my opinion, one of the most satisfying and most captivating adaptation of the worlds created by Lewis Carroll. Not only the animation have the incredible beauty of the best Disney animated classics, but also the whole movie it's a delight to watch, with charming, (but at the same time strange) characters and situations, making it a timeless entertainment for the whole family of high quality.While this version captures the charm and fun of the book, another memorable version (Done by the Czech filmmaker Jan ?vankmajer) captures all the strangeness of the Alice in Wonderland stories, with a dark, but surprisingly faithful adaptation. Personally I like both movies, and I think that both were excellent capturing the same story from a different perspective.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Disney standout</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Incredible piece of filmmaking and certainly the most adult oriented cartoon of the early Disney days, Alice in Wonderland walks gracefully among the paradoxes and surrealism of Carroll's story of a bored of normality little girl who decides to tread a world of things turned to their meaning. Terry Gilliam would have absolutely killed to have done this but, truth be said, Clyde Geronimi, Wilfred Jackson and Hamilton Luske have done the inimitable task of combining old Disney magic (which is simply unreproducible even by nowadays Pixar) with a totally unexpected delirium of cinematic madness, plot deconstruction, thematic ambivalence and visual inventiveness. Even if you don't care for that kind of movie-making, Alice stands as an apocalypse of standout narrative.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This thing is just completely wacko. It's like an insane acid trip. All the characters except Alice are totally insane, the weird creatures in the woods are beyond strange, the events that happen in the movie are crazy, and I love every moment of it. It is one of those movies that says "Marijuana may be illegal, but this movie isn't". It is totally insane, but that is why it is so enjoyable. It is a little trip to beautiful insanity that isn't illegal. That's the best part about it, but it also has some good voice acting, great characters, and good animation. My favorite characters are The Cheshire Cat, The Mad Hatter, and The March Hare. The best scene I have to say is the tea party, and the insane climax. Alice in Wonderland is a film so insane it has to be enjoyed. It is crazy fun.4 stars out of 4</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How do you get to Wonderland? I personally went by Eurostar!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In preparation for Tim Burton's take on "Alice in Wonderland" chez Disney, I decided to have a watch of the original (well, semi-definitive) version of Lewis Carroll's classic. Although somewhat less revered than some of the other major Walt-era animated films, this has always been one of my absolute favourites (it was also the first film I supposedly saw as well), but I hadn't actually seen it in about four years or so. Having watched it again, critically and not trying to watch it through rose-tinted glasses, I felt thoroughly delighted for just over an hour, and am now beginning to wonder whether or not I'll come out of the Tim Burton film comparing it to this version, which is a showdown of fanciful characters and situations set alongside delightful art and music.The general style of the film is frankly wonderful. In terms of character design, it's a slightly Disneyfied version of Tenniel. The character animation is lively and the backgrounds are fantastic, creating a world that could seem like it were pulled out of a dream; bold colours, modernist shapes and patterned plants are just some of the wondrous delights that will make you want to stop and pause the DVD player. Art-director Mary Blair should be the one who is commended here, as it is overall her who gave this film (and many others, including "Cinderella", "Peter Pan" and "The Three Caballeros") such a whimsical feel. There are some strikingly beautiful scenes; such as the Tulgey Wood changing its very form during the song "Very Good Advice" (a very Carrollian effect) and the March of the Cards.The score, penned by Oliver Wallace, is delightful and there are a handful of charming Disney songs ("Painting the Roses Red", "The Unbirthday Song" and "The Walrus and the Carpenter" are amongst the best). As an adaptation of Lewis Carroll's original, it's quite successful. Sure, it may not be the ever elusive perfect adaptation, but it's certainly not painfully Americanised like some adaptations have been (namely the 1985 mini-series, which very nearly becomes a crime against humanity) and it retains the satire and zaniness of the original. The Queen of Hearts, for example, seems to be more of the pitiful and sham of a character that she was in the book than Helena Bonham-Carter's extremely villainous rendering looks to be (granted, that is just me judging from the trailer and I could be proved wrong). Overall, "Alice in Wonderland" proves to be a pleasant mesh of Disney and Carroll, and comes highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Colourful animation, based on a great book!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This version on Alice in Wonderland is the best version of the classic book. What impressed me most was the mix of "Wonderland" and "Looking Glass". The animation was the best element of the movie, with a gorgeous sequence in the song "Golden Afternoon", which was the best song in my opinion. Not to mention the watercolour-painting like landscapes of the English countryside. The songs, while not as memorable as later Disney films, were very pleasant to the ear, with an appreciative nostalgic feel. The characters were what make this film, as they are memorable and engaging. However, Alice sometimes was a little bland, but that is the only weakness here, and Kathryn Beaumont did voice her beautifully. The Cheshire Cat and White Rabbit were very well done, likewise with the Mad Hatter and March Hare. In fact The Cheshire Cat is my favourite character, and Sterling Holloway shone voicing him. The best vocal characterisation was the Queen of Hearts, voiced by Disney regular Verna Felton who did a great job. I know they missed the Mock Turtle and the Griffin out, but if they were included, the overall film would've been too long. In conclusion, an imaginative and solid version of a great book! 9/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Among the best fantasy films of all time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Disney's version of "Alice in Wonderland" is, without a doubt, one of the best fantasy films of all time. The Story: Alice is in the park with her sister (that's right. The older woman is her sister, NOT her mother. I found it hard to believe, too). Her sister is teaching her a lesson in history, but Alice plays with her adorable kitten, Dinah. Her sister gets snappy and Alice says that she can't pay attention to a book with no pictures in it and goes on about her fantasy world (or really, Wonderland), where nothing is what it seems. Along comes a white rabbit who says he's late "for a very important date!". Alice follows the rabbit down a rabbit hole and ends up in the world she created and spends the rest of the movie exploring Wonderland and trying to find her way home.A classic movie that the whole family will love. 10/10 all the way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even though I haven't read the books, ALICE IN WONDERLAND, in my opinion, is an excellent Disney classic about a bored young girl who gets a big surprise for all ages. The music was good, the production design was excellent, everyone was cast perfectly, the performances were top-grade, and the direction was flawless. However, there was only one thing that kind of gave me the creeps, and that was the queen (voice of Verna Felton). In conclusion, I highly recommend this excellent Disney classic about a bored young girl who gets a big surprise for all ages to anyone who hasn't seen it. You're in for a real treat and a good time, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with someone close to you, and watch it. I guarantee you you'll thoroughly enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If I Had A World Of My Own; Everything Would Be Nonsense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know I sound like I'm repeating myself all the time, but this movie is another example as to why today's society is not seeing this, and other films, in their glory because they don't work as well on the small television screens as they do the big magnificent movie house screens. To see films like this and The Wizard of Oz on the large movie house screen would make you feel like you're seeing these films for the first time.When Alice first came out, there were just a few people, like myself, who really liked it, but in it's initial release it flopped at the box office, and it was years before Disney entertained the idea of ever releasing it again, but then something happened. There was a museum, forget which one it was, in New York City, that was having a Disney Film Festival and they asked people to request the Disney films that they would like to see, and an amazing thing happened that the most requested was Alice In Wonderland. So, after the overwhelming response, Disney re-released Alice and it finally gained the popularity that it deserves and it's charm has been charming audiences at home ever since.But, this is typical of some films. In their initial release the were flops, but years later, like a good bottle of wine, the films age and finally become the hit films that they should be, but I think it goes further than just that. I believe that Disney's version of Alice In Wonderland was just too ahead of its time, and I think that that is what has made it such a hit today. Let's face it, the same thing happened to Fantasia that happened to Alice. Fantasia finally got the popularity that it really deserved when it played for many years in San Francisco, but that was because the pot smokers watched it under the influence and with the stereophonic sound, ran for many years! It may not have been the way Disney would have liked the movie to become famous, but nevertheless - it did!Disney artists were interviewed and they all claimed that Disney was very unhappy with the way the project was going, but the artists would look at the rushes and everyone ended up trying to out-do everyone else with making the characters out if left field, but through it all, the one who steals the show is the very laid back Cheshire Cat. "Can you stand on your head?" It's admitted that the score for Alice is the best that Disney had in any of his movies, and even though out of release until the Museams Art Festival, the score has always been very popular! True, this is not Disney's best, but - of all his movies, it's the most fun!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Snow White and I are the same age. I was born in September of 1937 and Snow White came on the scene slightly after in December of 1937. Except for Snow White, which I saw in it's re-release 7 years later, I have seen every Disney Animated Feature on its first release in the movie theaters.Concerning Alice in Wonderland: This is not Disney's best animated feature, but it's the most fun. Even if you don't like much of the film, The Mad Tea Party is worth sitting through this movie. Sure, it's really Disney's idea of what Alice in Wonderland was in his minds eye, or, was it? One animator on the film said that they would sneak in and see the rushes and it ended up who could out-do who in the film. Almost a contest! When Alice first appeared, the movie initially was a flop and taken out of release for many years because Disney felt he had failed to bring Alice to the screen. The film appeared in a shortened version on the early black and white T.V. show "Disneyland", and then it seemed to disappear. Then years later, I believe it was in New York City, a museum was having a Disney Film Festival and the most requested film to appear was Alice, so they showed it and the audience loved it, so the Disney Studios heard of this and decided to release after many years being stored in the Disney Vaults. When they released it, I think, in the 1970's, it became the hit that it should have been when in it's first release, but just like a bottle of wine, Alice had to ferment and then become the hit that it deserved to be.The musical score had always been on recordings and when you come right down to it, it's one of Disney's best scores, if not the best! The music was what kept the film alive until it's re-release many years later. Finally it's enjoying the popularity it always has deserved.Oh, my goodness, what's this? A white rabbit? "Oh Mr. Rabbit - waaaaitttt!" Sorry folks! Gotta follow that rabbit and find out what he's so late for! "Oh, my rabbit! Waaaaiiiiit!" Running off it hot pursuit of the White Rabbit!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a colorful take on the famous story, both in animation and in story content. Overall, it was a fun movie with interesting, strange characters following each other as "Alice" chases after a rabbit in "Wonderland" (although that name is never mentioned in the film.).The songs in here are nothing noteworthy, but at least they didn't go on too long. For a short film - 75 minutes - it's good "escapist" fare and not a bad way to spend an hour-and-a quarter. Any longer than that, for classic animated films, would be too long, because they didn't have the humor and slam-bang action scenes modern animated films possess.I would imagine kids of today would be bored by this, compared to what faster-paced stuff they see now....but that's no criticism of this movie, just about attention spans have shortened.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why do so many people like this movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***SPOILERS***I've never written a review for a movie before on this site, but I felt I should for this one.I'll admit, I used to like this movie when I was a kid, but when I grew older, I realized I was liking it less, and now I can say that I don't like this movie, and don't understand why so many people love it.Why don't I like it? Well, because it's just so mean-spirited in tone and spends pretty much its entire run time treating Alice like garbage for no reason, over and over again, in an attempt to teach that you should be careful what you wish for. Now, teaching that I don't have a problem with. It's just that there have been countless other projects (films or shows) that teach that same moral, and they were not nearly as cruel as this movie was.The thing is, pretty much everything in this movie seems to conspire to torture Alice, either physically or emotionally, or both. Pretty much every character is a total jerk, to Alice and to each other: the Mad Hatter and March Hare play around pretty cruelly with her, the flowers kick her out of their garden, rather meanly, when they think she's a weed (even though they have a dandelion, which IS a weed, in their garden, those hypocrites), the Caterpillar is also rather unpleasant, having a temper that makes his scenes painful to watch (am I supposed to be laughing at Alice choking on smoke? Well, I'm not!), and the Queen of Hearts has the worst temper of the whole film, and even wants Alice dead, for no real reason.But then there's the Cheshire Cat, who seemed to go out of his way to make things worse for Alice, as it's his fault she ends up on trial, and it's also his fault that everyone in Wonderland tries to kill her! I'm not exaggerating when I say that this is the Cheshire Cat at his worst!But one of the biggest issues I have with this is that I feel like the movie is putting the Wonderlanders in the right for how they behaved. At the very least, it didn't put them in the wrong, which was a big mistake on the part of Disney. Worse, when Alice tells the Queen off for her behavior near the end, you find it justified, considering how she was treated by everybody. But even Disney had to mess that up by having her shrink again, which lands her in trouble because she was standing up for what was right.What makes all this worse is that Alice did absolutely nothing to deserve the torment given to her throughout her journey. All she wanted was to do something more interesting than listen to boring history lessons. And for this she gets punished, because wanting to do something more interesting than listen to lessons automatically makes you bad, apparently. It also seems to be teaching some morals children shouldn't learn, like, as someone else pointed out, dream worlds aren't happy and fantastical , but rather cruel and mean- spirited. (I know most of the film was a dream, but that kind of made it worse because that seems to teach that dream worlds are mad.) Also that it's OK to treat others badly if they're different from you or if you find it fun, and that you will only regret it if you stand up for what's right.I will admit, I do like some things about this film, like the animation is great as always (this is Disney, so what can I say?), I like almost all the songs in the film, as they're fun to listen to and well-written, and the beginning and very ending are pretty nice. I also did like a few characters, like of course Alice, but I also like the White Rabbit, the Dodo, the Dormouse, and the Doorknob, and I also find Tweedledee and Tweedledum kind of funny. These are my reasons for not giving the film only one star. If it wasn't for these elements, I probably would have given this film a 1. So yeah, I gave this three stars because there are some good things in it, but to me, the bad things far outweigh those.So bottom line, I don't like this film. I actually find it one of the worst Disney films of all time, and probably THE worst Disney film made while Walt Disney was still alive. I just don't get why it's so loved, especially since there are other projects out there that too are mean-spirited, but not nearly as much as this one is, and yet those get attacked while this gets a free pass. In fact, I don't think I ever will understand it. I just know that this is definitely not something I'd ever watch again if I was offered things I like. I guess I'll have to wait to see a truly great animated adaptation of the great book "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" (yes, I like the book; at least it's not as cruel as this movie), because, to me, this one was just bad.</fullReview>

One day, while enduring just such a poetry reading, she spots a large white rabbit...dressed in a jacket and carrying a large watch. He scurries off, saying he's late, for a very important date. She follows him through the forest. He then disappears down a rabbit hole. Alice follows, leading her to all manner of discoveries, characters and adventures.A wonderful, imaginative adaptation of Lew Carroll's famous novel. Captures well the sheer randomness, weirdness and wonder of Alice's adventures in Wonderland.Great animation, even by today's standards. But, then again, this is a Walt Disney production, so that is a given.Voices are spot-on. Kathryn Beaumont, at 12/13 years old, shines as Alice. Disney must have liked her performance too - she provided the voice of Wendy in Peter Pan, two years later.The quintessential adaptation.</fullReview>

With a little help from the Lewis Carroll series for which it was adapted from, this film's surrealism makes for a completely unique entry in the Disney pantheon. It's like the black sheep. To this day, they haven't made another one like it.The story isn't one in the linear sense, but more of a compendium of unrelated series of events. But they all lead to a common goal.Alice, herself, has some radical ideals when it comes to the world around her, and faces hostility from the adults in her life. But she learns her imagination is mild in comparison to the oddities of Wonderland. She ventures off to this magical world, only to discover she isn't very welcome. She has a terrible time and no one wants her to be there. And at moments, she finds herself questioning the silliness of the realm, appropriating her mindset to that of her closed-minded mother back home.The depth of Alice is deeper than most realize. It's subtle, but her attitude is brilliant commentary on contrasting our own independent philosophies with those that we're raised on.Surprisingly, the film is not as dated as you would think. Some of the humor holds up well compared to today's standards.Considering the very short runtime, the songs are in abundance and create a high ratio to the non-singing scenes. And naturally, there are one or two weaker tunes, but most of them are ear-worm classics. At 75 minutes, we spend enough time in Wonderland to warrant a complete story. Or collection of events. Alice in Wonderland is meant to be episodic. And it's very dark and deranged at times, too. While many people find that those things make the movie harder to warm up to, it's actually part of what makes it one of my favorite Disney films from the Walt era. An underrated piece of cinema.Twizard Rating: 95Read more at www.TheTwizard.com</fullReview>

With a little help from the Lewis Carroll series for which it was adapted from, this film's surrealism makes for a completely unique entry in the Disney pantheon. It's like the black sheep. To this day, they haven't made another one like it.The story isn't one in the linear sense, but more of a compendium of unrelated series of events. But they all lead to a common goal.Alice, herself, has some radical ideals when it comes to the world around her, and faces hostility from the adults in her life. But she learns her imagination is mild in comparison to the oddities of Wonderland. She ventures off to this magical world, only to discover she isn't very welcome.

		<shortDescription>Bizarre And Mostly Entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To put it simply, Alice In Wonderland is bizarre. To put it less simply, Alice In Wonderland explores the oddities of a child's imagination, and the utter weirdness of a seemingly mad person to such an extent as to create one of the strangest films I have ever seen. We all know the story. Alice sees a white rabbit exclaiming "I'm late, I'm late!" over and over, and of course, silly Alice, follows the talking rabbit down a rabbit hole and into the land of...well, wonder. Like all Disney films, memorable characters abound. Yes, Alice is a little thinly drawn (really, all the characters are a bit one dimensional), but in the same way, they're all so distinct, and unlikely to be forgotten. The strong voice cast only supports this.Alice In Wonderland is far weirder than I expected. At times, it seems to make no sense whatsoever. This is not a bad thing, mind you. Curiously enough, I laughed very little during this film. I smiled a lot though, and the utter weirdness of it all was so absurd, I could not help but be entertained, though I retained any laughter. The one primary scene that provoked laughter was the "Tea Time" scene with the Mad Hatter. It's even more outrageous on screen than it is in the book. Alice In Wonderland certainly does not represent the height of Disney films, or even animated films in general. What it does represent, is a solid film with no real flaws, but not exceedingly entertaining. It serves it's purpose as a weird and enjoyable film, but does not extend it's hand any farther.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the Disney movies I watch least often. My favorite thing about it is the colors. Mary Blair is one of my favorite artists, and her influence seems to be strong in the way this looks. I also like almost all of the songs. There are certainly some funny segments, and lots to like. When I was younger, I even liked to read the original Lewis Carrol text with annotations to try to understand where some of the ideas came from. However, I became much less interested in symbolism over the years. Most of the other Disney cartoons are very straightforward, which I like. I think it makes it easier to share with younger viewers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bouts of eccentricity and horror, both of which adding to the charm; this 1951 adaptation is a maddening and meaningful 75 minutes of animation mayhem.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seeing Disney's 1951 animated film Alice in Wonderland for the first time in a dozen-or-so years was my first proper interaction with the rather famous 19th Century Lewis Carroll text; and in clocking in at just over 70 minutes, this is either a short, sharp, brisk ride through animated Disney shenanigans initially designed for kids to lap up in no time at all, or an extended surrealist piece documenting some pretty grown up material under an overhead banner of the uncanny. Regardless, the film is a strange beast; a piece that straddles a line between some rather absurdest material, of which additionally carries a genuinely comedic undercurrent with out and out farce blended in with sequences of rather unbalanced horror. It would be true to say the film feels a little longer than the runtime reads, but such is the achievement of this addition of Alice in Wonderland, that items and specific content such as those explored within would come across as broader than usual.The tale sees a young blonde girl named Alice (Beaumont), who sports a light blue dress that brings out her eyes underneath a white apron-like piece of clothing, go on a sporadic journey through a place of both unearthly delights and horrors, the beautiful; the unreal and the terrible of what this strange and distorting place has to offer. It would appear that Alice's Wonderland is, in fact, the real world, but diluted through the viewpoint of a ten or so year old girl of whom is still living within a pretty sheltered existence. We begin with the titular character sitting in a tree, daring to dream about another life; another existence away from the authoritarian rule of an elder relative and her reading of an educational book Alice must pay attention to. Alice lusts for escape, for adventure ? I suppose a shifting away from the family and these authoritarian individuals; in doing so, dreaming of her own world of nonsense in which she can get away to. The rest of the film seems to be a process of humbling, a process that sees her at one point hit the lowest of lows as sadness and desperation settles in. If Alice's circular journey teaches her anything, it's that one's lust for individuality and release into another world away from one's peers is a bigger deal than one thinks and ought not be taken lightly.I'm unaware of the structure of the book and the process in which the interactions are unfolded, specifically in what order, but this 1951 adaptation includes a short piece very early on entitled "The Walrus and the Carpenter", something that I read appeared in an altogether different Alice fable. In including so early this text-within-a-text, co-directors Clyde Geronimi and Wilfred Jackson capture the essence of the entire piece; something that can be read into as a frustrating laying out of the cards for all to see so early on or a clever inclusion from another piece altogether foreshadowing the arc of Alice's adventure. That is to say, a premature leaving of one's homely 'safe zone'; the ignoring of parental, indeed family-driven, advice as well as the allure of following something, or someone, of great exuberance and eccentricity into whatever rabbit hole or there-other. The emphasis on Alice's inability to quite understand the short story that the two Brummie twins deliver only highlights Alice's ignorance to her situation; something that will get worse before it gets better.In addition to this, it precursors Alice's interaction with The Queen, as the hapless individuals at the centre of the twins' tale documents their eventual decline in well-being to an over exuberant and powerful figure. Granted, the item that led Alice away from her natural state is a white rabbit, but the rabbit's association with The Queen and her quarters aids in drawing on parallels with the oysters and their doomed interaction with the Walrus. But a lot of Alice's flitting interactions are interesting, even if few of them carry as much substantial weight as the one with the two twins and their poem. The film will jump from content which emotes laughs to other such content that is just creepy and of an absurdest, horror driven nature; but it's a series of jumps that are handled deftly. The tea party scene, in particular, is a quite wonderful demonstration of physical comedy between two parties; one of whom is a lost wandering soul that doesn't belong where she is, with the other made up of two individuals in the shape of The March Hair (Colonna) and The Mad Hatter (Wynn), of whom are so wildly insane that they don't seem to belong anywhere.In its final throw of the dice, the film will use a newfound area of antagonism from the character of The Queen of Hearts (Felton) in order to propel Alice through a grinder and give her a reason to arrive at some peril. The stumbling into this final act driven purely by curiosity for what the white rabbit's purpose is, an introductory sequence in which Alice merrily joins in painting The Queen's roses with three minions and appears to be uncannily able to hear some instrumental music which the servants sing along to, yet gives us no reason to assume it ought to be diegetic. Regardless, the film services on a comedic level which in turn sits well with all the surrealist driven horror stuff such as smoking caterpillars and talking flowers; while Alice's own arc in realising that the coming of age process need not be rushed given the original circumstances she lived under, is satisfying in its own right.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic that Continues to Twist my Mind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those movies that people can still watch 50 years after it comes out and still enjoy it. Unlike many movies, it seems to be timeless. Show someone a movie from 10 years ago and they will constantly be critiquing the effects, acting, script, and basically everything. This is one movie that you truly cannot find problems with the animation or whatever, because that is beyond the point. The true heart of the movie is beyond animation or script or whatever. It is in the meaning of the film and everything that goes into it. I first saw this movie when I was rather young. I found that it was a wonderfully cute movie. It wasn't until rather recently that I saw it again and to put it honestly found it somewhat disturbing. This movie gives me chills because I've read into it more. I've seen meanings that perhaps were meant to be in it, or perhaps I'm just seeing it for myself. Either way it is a movie that constantly intrigues me. I am going to agree with people that the book was better because it kept some of the truly disturbing parts in that Disney decided to take out. But besides that I enjoyed this movie. When I saw the 2010 Alice in Wonderland I almost left because of how much it seemed to destroy the whole meaning of the book by taking it into a much more "cutesy" fantasy film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is Alice In Wonderland Influenced by Drugs?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have never read the fantasy novel of Lewis Carrol's, but like most of us I've watched the film Alice in Wonderland since childhood. When I watched the film as a child, it did in fact spark my imagination and drew me into the childhood fantasy. Wonderland was a place with limitless possibilities of fairytale, and brought my imagination to new places.I'm now 24 years old, and my view of the film has slightly changed. I still love the film, but as I've grown older and a little wiser, I'm starting to wonder. Is Alice in Wonderland about drugs or not? I'm sure Lewis Carrol wasn't into drugs, but here are a few examples I can remember off the top of my head that seem to be referring to drugs. Alice falling down the rabbit hole, Alice chasing the white rabbit, the caterpillar smoking from a hookah, the stuff she had to consume to grow big or small, the cat fading in and out and changing colors after eating mushrooms, the tea party, and the game with the queen all seem to be influenced by drugs. Or am I just crazy?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This story is amazing it catches your audience with a simple moral be grateful for what you have and don't wish for anything more because it won't make you happy. The film is suppose to mess with your head and make you understand all the bad things that happen to Alice and the music is so good you don't notice that it is there. The drawings are great but if you noticed In the Mad Hatters tea party sequence, the Hatter and the Hare decide to 'mend' the White Rabbit's watch. After treating it with everything from butter to jam the watch starts to fly around the table and the Hare swipes it with a large mallet. Just as the mallet hits, the colour fades from the scene. why? many have speculated but nobody knows for sure. One theory is that bits of the original print went missing and all they could find was a black and white insert. However, it's a gradual fade across several frames - not a quick cut from colour to black and white - which perhaps indicates it was a deliberate "effect".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Classic Disney adaptation of Lewis Carroll's famous story may not please all purists but, for my money, it's the best film version of the story yet. For those who don't know the tale, it's about a young girl named Alice who follows a white rabbit down a hole and winds up in a strange world full of bizarre, colorful characters. As with most of the great Disney animated films from the Golden Age, two of the main pluses here are the lively songs and the gorgeous animation, with rich colors and some beautiful backgrounds. Of the songs, my favorite is "All in a Golden Afternoon." The movie's full of memorable characters like the Cheshire Cat, the White Rabbit, the Mad Hatter, and the Queen of Hearts. Terrific voice work from Kathryn Beaumont, Sterling Holloway, Richard Hayden, Ed Wynn, J. Pat O'Malley, Verna Felton, and many others. It's one of those movies everyone should see at least once, preferably when you're still young enough to be wowed by its charms. Like many others, I first saw it as a kid and it left a great impression on me. I still enjoy it as an adult, but on a different level.</fullReview>

Kathryn Beaumont is really believable in the title role and you get the sense of wonder and magic going around from scene after scene advancements. So many characters to remember the most iconic for me are Tweedledum and Tweedledee with the crazy honking sounds they make while hitting each other, the Mad Hatter and March Hare with their insane tea party and the Cheshire Cat that keeps appearing and disappearing randomly. The music is well thought out, the animation is impressive for the time, and you get this feeling of excitement while traveling through Wonderland. Great family flick!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good surreal trip</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alice in Wonderland is at the same both very untypical for a Disney film, yet at the same time exactly what Disney does well. What do I mean by that? Well, in a word, Alice in Wonderland is surreal. It follows no logic but its own, is not really a fairytale by any stretch of the word, is actually somewhat mean-spirited in tone and Alice as the main character doesn't really follow the Disney formula we've come to know.And yet, it functions so well precisely because it's a Disney film. The animation is gorgeous, reflecting the feel and mood of Wonderland perfectly with crooked angles, painfully bright colours and contrasts, fluid motion and some fantastic character designs. The music scenes are also done very well, though most of them are not just short, but really short. But, most importantly, Disney does weird magnificently, especially in those first few decades when Walt Disney himself was still alive. And this is his crowning achievement in that regard. It's fast, loose, bat guano insane, always changing rules, always ready to burst into a non sequitur, each less logical than the one before.And if that's your thing, then this is the perfect movie to check out. It doesn't have the grandeur and charm of the true Disney classics, but it has some of the most memorable characters in the whole Disney canon and as a whole is a fantastic romp unlike anything you're likely to see otherwise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Perfect but A lot of Charm</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alice in Wonderland (1951) *** (out of 4) Disney classic about teenaged Alice who follows a rabbit into a mysterious hole, which leads her down a big drop off and into the world of Wonderland. Once there Alice meets all sorts of strange characters as they lead her on an adventure like she's never experiences. There's no question that ALICE IN WONDERLAND deserves the "classic" label but at the same time I think this is a lesser classic from the studio. I have one major problem with this film and it's the fact that it just never struck me as being all that magical or adventurous. If you're read any of the Alice books, seen any of the earlier or later films then you know there's quite a bit of magic going on in the stories but I don't think that comes across too well. Perhaps this is due to there simply being too many characters and none of the supporting ones really standing out among everything. Of course the Alice character is a great one as is the Mad Hadder and the rabbit but outside of these there are many supporting ones that just show up, have a few nice lines if that and then they're gone. I'd say the overall story has a somewhat strange mix and match going on as well with too many scenes that just feel out of place. Still, there's no question that the animation is downright beautiful and this is especially true once we get to all the vivid colors of Wonderland. Another major plus is that there are some pretty funny moments including the various scenes where Alice is either shrinking or growing too tall. The sequence where she gets stuck inside the small house is just priceless. ALICE IN WONDERLAND isn't flawless but there's certainly a lot of charm that helps keep it moving along.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alice in Wonderland is a movie that's different from the other Disney Classics. Instead of having a crazy character or two, everyone is crazy; maybe a physcopath (how do I spell this word?) would be a better world. Seeing this from an adult's point of view, this film teaches us that no wonderland is perfect; it's corrupt and strange and such. Utopia is the first word that comes to mind when watching this film or even thinking about it. Wonderland is portrayed as such a magical land with mythical characters with wacky things and all; it's not that way, it teaches us that even a "wonderland" can be corrupt. It's sad, but true.I think it's very good. It's definitely more mature that some of the classics. unique characters, wonderful animation, great storyline, and a lot of peer pressure. To all the teenagers reading this, when a stranger or someone gave you "eat/drink" me in something, imagine what Alice went though when she was pressured to do this. It might teach you to not take drugs or get drunk. Plus the many drugs and drug references in this movie. My friend told me this is a great movie after you've been through such and I find it kind of true. It's weirdly good in a way and fun too! There are 2 things to learn from this movie... 1)Wonderlands aren't what you expect to be 2)Peer Pressure is bad</fullReview>

But does saying that something is weird mean that something is bad? No, of course not. There have been some strange films in our time, and most have been great. Alice in wonderland is probably the weirdest of the Disney animation films. Alice is a little girl who falls through a hole and ends up in Wonderland. Where she encounters many things. The Cheschire cat, a rabbit who runs away from Alice every time he sees her cause he's late, a caterpillar, The Mad hatter, and others. And The Red queen of course, who isn't exactly a happy person. Alice tries finding a way home. Can she though?If you have never seen the film, or at least read Lewis Carrol's classic novel, then you are missing out. I believe that Tim Burton's film will actually be better than the animated movie. Alice in wonderland isn't as good as lets say Beauty and the beast, but it's a must see.</fullReview>

So though I give the film 9 out of 10, I give Disney minus 10!!!!! for the way they are showing it on their channel today, with is Disney premiere. Because Disney has the biggest logo, I am especially disgusted with the way they treat their viewers. As far as I am concerned the 2 things that really ruin viewing on sat TV is logos, and people doing deaf language in corner of the screen. People complain about films being cut, b/w films being colourized, widescreen movies being shown as pan and scan etc, but why no complaints about the worst thing on TV in my opinion?Colin.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Wonderland, a psychoanalytic symbol</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alice in wonderland can be seen as a parody, a satire of the English society in which Lewis Carrol lived, the Victorian society. In this sense, the wonderland appears as the a place where the girl can express herself freely, without taking into consideration the Victorian morals, values and manners. This social parody is quite obvious in the queen's discourse, she emphasizes the fact that all the ways are her ways, a fact available in England, all the territories are considered to be the queen's territories. The queen and her servants are nothing more than some card figures. On the other hand, we can take the movie and the book and analyse it from the psychoanalytic point of view. The wonderland is the mad world of the dream, where the subconscious interferes. The psychoanalytic elements are abounding in this movie: we have the doors, the keys the mushroom as a phallic symbol, the dream as a way of suppressing desires.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fun movie the whole family will enjoy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This a great movie. At the start of the movie you see Alice and her sister. Then the fun begins when Alice sees a white rabbit. She decides to follow him. It seems the best of curiosity got her. She follows the Rabbit with Dinah her cat down the rabbit hole. There she meets the doorknob and cries herself to tears which makes the doorknob let her get in. She passes by the Dodo. Along the journey she meets some fun loving characters including the hilarious Cheshire Cat and more of Lewis Carol's creatures. This is a movie you definitely can't miss. I love this movie so much because it has the coolest characters of any Disney movie ever made and some of the songs are stuck somewhere in the back of my head. What makes it a Disney Classic is that it is created with the imaginations of two young artist known today as Walt and Roy Disney...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the most sarcastic movie that i have seen. "Alice in wonderland", based in the story of Lewis Carroll, is our dear girl's imaginative adventure through a world in what is not, is exactly what is.With the magic touch of Disney and perfect drawings, "Alice in wonderland" is a immortal, lively cheerful and disheveled comedy for the whole family. Alicia's qualities are beautiful. Alicia, a girl that wants to live in a different world... and, at the end, she realizes that it should appreciate what she has.This Disney classic will never be forgotten.PD: Hey, today is my no happy birthday too * Sorry for errors in sentences or letters</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Imaginative wonder</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although I have never read Lewis Carroll's novel, I can still appreciate the creativity and imagination that went into this story. Alice in Wonderland will always be one of my favorites, if not just for the absolute originality of the story, for the lack of an obviously physically romantic part to the story. Almost un-"Disney"-like, no two people fall in love or chase each other throughout the movie. Instead, the romance occurs in the truest sense of romance - all in Alice's imagination. She is a very passionate character and chases what she wants. She follows her curiosity and takes chances, without regard to the consequences. Although she tries to make the best of the situations she gets herself in, she is always true to her character. She tries her hardest to follow the rules she was taught - be polite, sit up straight, say yes your highness - but she's just a little girl, and not all rules are meant to be kept. The essence of Alice's character keeps the story alive, in addition to all the incredible people she meets. I get irritated when people attribute the creativeness of this story to drugs or other substances, because they disregard the originality of the story. Who knows if the substance theory is true? But honestly, who cares?! Regardless of whatever Lewis Carroll did to get this story, the end result was this absolutely genius story. I have not seen or read any story that can compete with Alice in Wonderland in terms of creating the impossible and making it seem possible. You may or may not agree with me, but I will always cherish this movie for these reasons.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>That white rabbit ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Disney version of Lewis Carroll's tale is diverting enough, with pleasing animation, some memorable songs ('I'm Late') and sequences (the mad hatter's tea party; the caterpillar's letter smoking), as well as some superior voice talent (Ed Wynn, Sterling Holloway, Jerry Colonna, Richard Haydn, and the versatile J Pat O'Malley).Several of the characters look as if they have stepped straight from the pages of the book's famous Tenniel illustrations, while others take on unexpected personalities. And it all starts with Alice following that cursed White Rabbit ...Is this worth your time? Definitely yes. It does justice to the book and adds its own sprinkle of Disney magic. This movie should have a lot to offer children and adults alike.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>[CONTAINS SPOILERS] One morning, a young girl named Alice laid back in the park as her teacher read from a book. Now I think this woman was her tutor but she's credited as Alice's sister. Go figure. Anyway, Alice wasn't at all interested in the book and drempt of a world of her own. Then suddenly she saw a white rabbit run by. He seemed to be in an awful hurry. Alice followed him and fell down a deep, dark hole. She saw some pretty strange stuff on the way down. When she landed, she saw the rabbit go through a door. She tried to follow but the only door out was locked. It even said so. Besides, the door was way too small for Alice to fit through. Luckily there was a shrink drink that miniaturized Alice. Unfortunately, she left the key up on the table. She eventually got through the door, escaped a crazy caucus race and ventured into the woods where she met Twiddle Dee and Twiddle Dum who told her the tale of the Walrus and the Carpenter: One day, in the land of shoes and ships and sealing wax, cabbages and kings, the Walrus and the Carpenter walked along the beach and Walrus coaxed some young oysters to come with him. Carpenter built them a restaurant and while he baked a loaf of bread, the Walrus ate the oysters. Furious, Carpenter grabbed his hammer and chased Walrus away.  Continuing on, Alice, still shrunk, chatted with some flowers and met a smoking caterpillar. She even attended the most bizarre tea party ever. She met the Cheshire Cat then went to go see the Queen of Hearts. Some of her faithful subjects were painting roses red due to they planted white ones by mistake. When the queen found out, she orders them to be beheaded. She then challenges Alice to a croquet game. Queen is a sore loser. Alice becomes enlarged from a piece of mushroom from earlier and she tells off the queen. Trouble arises when she shrinks back to normal and is then chased out of Wonderland by everybody and everything, eventually waking up in the park just in time for tea. A pretty good Disney movie. Ed Wynn from Mary Poppins is The Mad Hatter. Veteran Disney player Sterling Holloway is the Cheshire Cat. Kathryn Beaumont is Alice. She would later go on to do Wendy in Peter Pan. Bill Thompson is the white rabbit and Dodo and Richard Haydn is the caterpillar. Jim Macdonald who voices Mickey Mouse from 1947 to 1983 is the poetry reciting mouse at the tea party. So in conclusion, if you're looking for something to watch perhaps on your unbirthday or just any golden afternoon, then the time has come to check out Alice in Wonderland. That's some very good advice!-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some Urban Legends concerning this story Debunked.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Recently I had the opportunity to watch Disney's old cartoon "classic" Alice in Wonderland....the first time I have seen this movie since I was a very young kid. The movie itself was alright I suppose...though the dialouge certainly is pretty dated and the music pretty campy. However mostly I wanted to write this review to de-bunk some of the urban legends surrounding this story. Namely those of the "many" drug references this story contains. Contrary to popular belief...there is actually no evidence that Lewis Carroll ever took any Hallucinogenic substances or narcotic substances in his life. The Lewis Carroll institute has preserved many of Carrolls letters and memoirs and none of these have references about Carroll "experimenting" with any substance. Remember also that back in the 19th century no substances were actually illegal so there wouldn't have been any incentive for Carroll NOT to mention these in any of his letters. Now...there goes without saying that there are numerous "questionable" scenes in both the book and this cartoon which certainly can be interpreted as being a subliminal drug message. My particular "favorite" in the cartoon would have to be when Alice meets up with the caterpillar who is smoking a hooka on top of a large mushroom and the caterpillar changes color several times...As well as Alice eating a mushroom to become Taller or smaller. But like I said no actual evidence exists that this story was inspired by drug trips despite the popular culture opinion that it was.That being said...like I said the Dialouge in this cartoon is extremely dated...and the music mostly campy and unmemorable. But it still was semi-enjoyable due to its short length and for some of those "subjective" scenes" I discussed in the previous paragraph.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If there's one thing that most people remember about Alice In Wonderland then it must be this version of the film!Alice In Wonderland is just great, and this Disney version is the one thing that sticks in my mind. The animation may not be a landmark and it isn't very true to the original story (it's a shame that not everything is included) but it's been given that certain Disney magic which just grips you! It's the kind of story that can only really be shown by animation.So strong is the Disney version of the film that one day I told a friend that I was getting something for my sister to do with Alice In Wonderland. She replied 'Is your sister really into Disney?'.The one thing I really love though is how someone can just write a whole load of complete and utter rubbish, mix it together by calling it 'wonderland', turn up the curiosity and have it enjoyed my millions of people around the world! I still watch it at times as it's so enjoyable seeing this complete fantasy world where anything could happen! It's just a shame that Alice's adventure ends so quickly!My rating - 7 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The mind trips...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alice in Wonderland is one that critics, audiences, and I remember for being one of the more ambitious and unorthodox concepts for an animated movie, but of course, Disney could make it happen. With sheer craziness occurring across most of the film, intrigue is very strong but on some levels gives way to filler. The filler is in between, mostly being a bore but offering some wild mind trips to nearly make up for it. Outside of the book, the plot is not highly engaging and left me pondering over highly irrelevant topics such as what I was proposing to do following the conclusion of the film. Overall, I appreciate the direction Disney was taking with this, and generally the ways that they succeeded overshadow the ways that they failed. Expect plenty of ups and downs when you, the reader, see this. Some things will miss, a majority of the things will hit.</fullReview>

This is actually I think my second favorite Disney movie, right after The Lion King and with good reason. This is a really crazy ride and it is one of those rare animated movies that (in my case at least) can make you feel sad and delighted almost at the same time. Alice in Wonderland is crazy, dark (but at the same time colorful), beautiful, sad (and also at the same time an amazing) experience that definitely deserves its status as a Disney Classic.

		<shortDescription>A whacky animated fantasy about a girl who gets caught in another universe.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alice In Wonderland is a 1951 animated feature and is Disney's 13th in the Disney canon. The story is about a girl called Alice who is at the park with her mother as she is reading Alice a book. But when Alice sees a white rabbit who is saying im late, im late, im late she decides to follow him into the rabbit hole. But when she does,she ends up in an alternative universe where she meets whacky charcthers including Tweedledum and Tweedledee as well as a cat named Cheshire Cat that can hide(like a chameleon) and the red queen who hates white roses,she only likes red roses. Can Alice ever get back to her own world,OR is she actually daydreaming about the whole thing this whole time.Overall I thought it was a fairly good movie,its not one of my favourite movies but I was glad I got it on DVD as I never seen it in a long time. I notice though that A lot of Walt Disney's movies before his death in 1966 has charcthers smoking pipes as this indicated that Walt was a heavy smoker back in the day and that's why,whereas now you don't see any charcthers smoking. The animation is flawless,the charcthers are engaging and whacky and the plot is good but when it came to the end I was like wait a minute you mean to tell me she was hallucinating this whole time.Overall im giving it a 6.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bizarre but entertaining classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Walt Disney was looking to adapt Lewis Carolls books (Alice's adventures in Wonderland and Through the looking-glass) into an animated feature for a long time. At the age of 21, Disney worked at the Laugh-O-Gram studio in Kansas City. This is where he was first introduced into the world of animation. The last short he worked on was called 'Alice's Wonderland', which combined animation with live-action, as a girl named Virginia Davis featured in an animated environment. After the short was finished, the studio went bankrupt in July of 1923. Walt and his brother Roy formed the Walt Disney Company and released a series of shorts called 'The Alice Comedies', which were also a combination of live-action and animation and also featured Virginia Davis as Alice. In 1936, Disney released a Mickey Mouse short called 'Thru the mirror', resembling the Alice stories.It's safe to say that Disney was inspired by Lewis Carolls tales. There were even plans to have Alice in Wonderland be the first full-length animated feature, but those plans were put on hold and Disney decided to go with Snow White in 1937. But after Cinderella was big success, Disney had enough money to finally release Alice in Wonderland in 1951. Was Alice in Wonderland successful? Not exactly. The film disappointed in the box office and the response from critics was mostly negative. During Walt's lifetime, Alice in Wonderland was never re-released in theaters. It wasn't until 1974 that the company pulled the trigger and re-released Alice in Wonderland in theaters. This time, the film struck a chord with audiences and critics alike and became a lot more successful than it was during its initial run.Alice in Wonderland is perhaps the most bizarre Disney animated feature. The atmosphere in the film is rather dark and gloomy. Alice(voiced by Kathryn Beaumont) stands out as being the only normal person in a very strange world. That's why her character isn't very interesting at times, but I think Kathryn Beaumont does a great job in developing some character for Alice. Throughout the film, Alice tries to find out what's right and what's wrong in an entertaining way. There are a lot of interesting characters in wonderland. The Mad Hatter(voiced by Ed Wynn) and the March Hare(voiced by Jerry Colonna) are celebrating their un-birthday when Alice meets them, which results in a hilarious scene. The Cheshire Cat is amongst the strangest creatures in the history of Disney, but he has some funny lines. The White Rabbit(Voiced by Bill Thompson) is the reason Alice ended up in Wonderland. She tried to follow him because of her curiosity. She wants to find out what the talking rabbit is up to, but he always claims he's too late. Throughout the film, Alice continues to follow him. Alice ends up in a maze where she meets a bunch of talking cards, who are painting the roses red. The Queen of Hearts(voiced by Verna Felton) accuses Alice of painting them red. The queen is absolutely insane, which makes her a fantastic villain. At one point, she can be calm and collective and then she suddenly bursts out in frustration and malice. She screams 'off with their heads' to one of the cards and Alice, which is actually rather grim for a Disney film. Alice manages to escape Wonderland when she convinces herself to awake.This Disney feature is like a fast train. The scenes keep coming and there are a lot of interesting characters involved. The visuals are very intriguing and abstract. The songs aren't very memorable like they are in other Disney classics, but they are still a lot of fun. Alice herself isn't very interesting, but Kathryn Beaumont gives a solid performance. The entire presentation of the film is strange compared to other Disney films and isn't based on a fairy-tale, which is probably the reason it didn't perform well in the box office during its release. Luckily, a lot of people started to appreciate this fantastic piece of animation and it's known as a classic today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kinda weird, but it's great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's no secret to anyone that I watched a lot of Disney animated movies when I was a kid (well except for Home on the Range....I will talk that movie when the time comes). I watched them repeatedly and still have fun with them...this movie is no exception.The story (of course that we all know today) is about a girl named Alice who grows bored of listening to her older sister reading aloud from a history book of someone that I just don't care about (sorry, Brits). Alice tells her kitten Dinah that she will live in a nonsensical land called Wonderland. After she daydreamed about it, she spot a rabbit called..White Rabbit, who's late for something that has to do with the Queen of Hearts's stuff or ceremony. Alice and her kitten follows the white rabbit and Alice goes inside the rabbit hole and falls into a place called (you guessed it) Wonderland. A place that's so weird that it's better not to explain it at all. (Spoilers!) However, all of this was just a dream from Alice, and she, Dinah, and her older sister just go went back home and it's obviously time for tea.The way they show Wonderland was very, and I mean very strange. There's a Dodo bird that sorta looks like Christopher Columbus, fishes that have no problem breathing without water when doing this dance, Tweedledee and Tweedledum telling a story about the Walrus and the Carpenter, a short guy with a hat and his rabbit celebrates tea party and 'unbirthday' all the time, the Queen of Hearts and Alice herself playing croquet by using a flamingo as a mallet and a hedgehog as the ball, and there's this caterpillar, and and and......IT'S WEIRD!! But you know what, it's so much fun because of that.The animation is colorful and top notch, despite (again) the weird imagery it had. The songs are catchy. The voice acting is great as every Disney animated movie out there. And the pacing is wacky but necessary.But, there were some flaws. One being that the Alice character wasn't all that convincing. The running time is too short. And some of the weird imagery may be too much for my taste.But in all seriousness, the movie is still a lot of fun and it's easily recommended. For those who want to know about my thoughts about Tim Burton's version of Alice of Wonderland, I thought it was decent but nothing special, however I'm obviously gonna do a review of it but for now, you'll just had to wait. This movie though weird, is a fun ride for your kids and yourself.Score: 8.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The only Disney film I like</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's get something straight, I am certainly not a Disney fan. Disney is usually conforming, at times racist and sexist, complete trash. However, Alice in Wonderland, filmed in 1951, colored my whole childhood and I still remember it today. Lots of kids have imaginary friends, role-play with dolls, teddy bears, paint pictures of made-up far away lands... but as we get older unfortunately we have to leave these creations behind for the adult future. Alice, stuck listening to lessons from her teacher outside one day, gets fed up with studying and reading and lets her mind drift. Suddenly she notices a rabbit, dressed in human clothes, and she curiously chases it, along with her beloved pet kitten Dinah. The rabbit leads Alice falling down a rabbit hole (often a phrase used to describe mental illness), and goes into a strange exotic little kingdom called Wonderland, where animals can speak and flowers can sing and be more snobby than a room full of ladies at a Tupperware party. Alice enjoys herself until things begin to get crazy, and she meets the friendly but mischievous Cheshire Cat, who offers to help her get home. lice in Wonderland has frequently been used as a plot for games and films portraying mental insanity. Go Ask Alice (1973) features a teenage girl in the hippie era who tries L.S.D. and gets hooked. Alice, Madness Returns is a bizarre video game where Alice is a brunette teen rather than a blonde little girl, and she wanders through scary mental hospitals and fights creatures. Lucid by Alice Dawn is about a teen and her imaginary world she makes up to escape from her many psychiatric appointments. Resident Evil (2002) has often been believed to be an allegory for Alice in Wonderland. Nevertheless, this is one version that hasn't been tainted by this plot. The real plot of Alice is that she is trying to make sense of the adult world, which is nonsense to children, whereas a child's imaginative world is nonsense to adults. The voices were great choices, although Alice sounds like she's in her twenties. I loved the strange little creatures that followed Alice throughout the film, birds with umbrellas for bodies and dogs made of brooms tied together, animals made of household items. The Cheshire Cat was voiced by the man who voiced the beloved children's "Winnie the Pooh" cartoons. The mad hatter, mad from mercury poisoning, was a very likable character, as was his friend the March Hare... well, every character was likable, even the cunning Red Queen, a fat woman with a short temper and a love for chopping heads off. The film isn't really violent, it's a great film for children and adults alike, anyone who feels like they want to escape into their own imagination.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Often criticized for being too "American," this film was far from it. Not only did it respect John Tenniel's original illustrations and pull from the most iconic scenes in Lewis Carroll's novels, but the masterful animation brought the imagery to live in a creative fashion. A film that keeps you smiling from beginning to end, its lack of definite plot is greatly overshadowed by the smooth flow and easygoing entertainment experienced while viewing. Its playful line-up of songs, partially based or inspired by Carroll's own genius poetry, greatly adds to it. Alice is simply an incredible character that captures purity, creativity and humour through simplicity. If only this film were longer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disney's most vivid and surreal work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lewis Carroll's classic fantasy novel got the Disney makeover back in the early 50s as one of the early Disney animated features. It certainly isn't a dead-on accurate representation of the novel, but if like me you've never read the original story then there is a lot to get out of this version. All the unique characters are played up to their fullest potential and the use of animation gives to film added amounts of creative that are utilised well. Alice is not as popular as the other Disney films from that time and, though it is understandable, that is somewhat unfair on the film.Alice is an easily bored and overly curious girl who one afternoon sees a White Rabbit in a hurry and follows him down a rabbit hole. It is no ordinary hole though as Alice quickly discovers that she is in Wonderland were everything is not as it seems. At first Alice wants to know why the Rabbit is in a hurry but after meeting many of the strange people who inhabit Wonderland she just wants to go home, but only after meeting the deranged Queen of Hearts. The story of the movie works very much in a road-trip style. Alice meets a character, something unusual occurs and then she moves on. Normally this gets repetitive, but here I find that it works very well. It makes sense that Alice meets someone new as she moves further along and the encounters are always a ton of fun. There is a lack of development, yet it doesn't affect the film too much due to this stop-start format.What really makes the film are the colourful and interesting characters. Alice herself is a very likable heroine and is played in a nicely realistic fashion, she is kind and thoughtful but has her limits and can get annoyed. It would be easy for her to get lost in the madness, but the excellent design and Kathryn Beaumont's enthusiastic voice acting add to the role immensely. Disney regular Bill Thompson perfectly voices the always hurried White Rabbit, who we are dying to know the reasons for him being so 'late'. The Cheshire Cat is a lot of fun thanks to the fact that his intentions always change, he is the right amounts of slightly creepy and weirdly funny. Sterling 'Winnie the Pooh' Holloway adds an eerie quality to the role. The eloquent Caterpillar is very enjoyable too.The Mad Hatter and March Hare are my favourite characters. There is such a wacky sense of humour and incredible enjoy brought to the screen when they are around. The fact that their Tea Party involves 'un-birthdays' and smashing up watches kind of says it all. Ed Wynn and Jerry Colonna clearly put their all into the voices too. The Queen of Hearts is another funny Disney villain. She shouts almost everything she says and blows her top if everything isn't as it should be. This of course leads to a lot of funny tantrums and destruction.I think a strong reason why the film wasn't well received is because of how crazy and slightly sinister the characters, except Alice, actually are. Yet I feel that this gives the film some uniqueness in similar vein to Pinocchio, in which most of the characters were menacing. All you have to do is look at the characters actions, the Cheshire Cat toys with Alice, the Hatter &amp; Hare effectively shun her, the Caterpillar gets angry at her very easily and the Queen just wants to cut off heads. I think this explains why certain people gravitate away from Alice, the fact there is only one real protagonist may help to explain it. But as said I personally like this as I think it offers something different to the usual Disney features. The animation is excellent as you'd expect and the unique features of Wonderland are given added vibrancy, in some areas it is possibly the richest usage of colour in any Disney feature. It's interesting to note that a lot of the backgrounds are dark, this is a great effect as the colours almost leap off the screen when they are presented. It makes very little detail standout more and the character designs themselves all look fantastic. The animation in general some of Disney's most surreal and it is noteworthy for that reason alone. The music is very good too. Each character seems to have their own little tune and they are all pleasant to listen to, whilst songs like 'I'm Late' are amusing pieces that add to the film.Seeing as the film is only 75 Minutes long there is a lot of substance to it. Though it moves in quick manner, enough time is spent with the characters to understand them and the fact that it manages to pack in so many personalities is impressive in itself. One aspect that is iffy is that the film can seem a bit rushed in certain areas, but when you consider how much is going and trying to be fit in that becomes less of a concern. I'm also unsure how much replay value the film has, as it is certainly more of an engaging film if you watch it every so often. Overall I do really enjoy Disney's version of Alice in Wonderland, it remains the best version of the story to this day. Its strengths are extremely well done. The characters themselves are really memorable as well as out of the ordinary and the animation is amongst the richest that Disney has ever put to screen. I still think that Alice in Wonderland is still a little under-appreciated compared to its contemporaries, like Cinderella, and that may be for its unusual tone. Yet I think that the bizarre tone and crazed characters give it the unique edge. Alice is enjoyable on the surface and an achievement beneath as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alice in Wonderland id a challenge to put into but here its been animated and Disneyfied and for most parts it works really well whilst giving us an iconic Mad Hatter and Queen of Hearts.The film does well in getting into the spirit and imagination of the Lewis Carroll's tales. The animation is used to evoke the slightly psychedelic spirit of Alice's adventures and vivid use is made of the animation with characters such as the Cheshire Cat. Of course animation should lend itself well here but the voice work is also excellent as it fits with the characters very well such as the Cheshire Cat, March Hare and others.Even after sixty years there is much to enjoy in this zany animated adventures of Alice.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I happen to be a huge fan of this movie! "Alice in Wonderland" is, in my opinion, one of Disney's best cartoons ever produced, as far as the animated features go. I do not enjoy it because of nostalgia, hell no! I like it because it has a good story, cool characters, nice art and animation, lavishing music, marvelous dialogue and voice acting by the actors, and of course, being based on one of my favorite stories. Sadly, this movie, as well as other Disney-related media, have been relegated to a children's marketing. And people need to stop being so ignorant in saying "Disney is so childish!" Bullcrap, Disney is not exclusively for children! Besides, kids don't make them, for the most part. Adults direct, write, produce, animate, compose music for, and record voices for all of Disney's beloved cartoons. In my opinion, children under 6 years old should not watch Disney movies, shorts, and television shows. Disturbingly, children are watching such material at such a younger and younger age these days, I mean children as young as 18 months! This should also count for Mother Goose poems, fairy tales and other fantasy fiction that should not be be viewed or heard from anyone under 6 years of age. Even though, I admit that I've watched Disney movies as young as age 3, but I didn't pay to much attention to it anyway. Anyway, that is all I want to say! I just love "Alice In Wonderland (1951)!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alice in Wonderland still seems young and fresh even if it's nearly 2014.Based on the famous book the girl Alice falls into a hole in a forest after chasing a rabbit.The girl meets many memorable characters on her journey.From talking flowers to other strange creatures.Also a hothead Queen too and her army of living cards.It takes more than one view to find all the hidden details.The movie is overly cute, but not in a bad way.Beside the cute characters and tea parties there are the Queen who shouts about beheading.There is something for everyone here from kids and adventure seekers to painters.Then I recommend Tim Burton's live action version, and also the G4 S2 opening of My Little Pony that are having the same feel good atmosphere.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Whimsical and fun.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Walt Disney's 11th full-length film, about the story of a little girl named Alice who fell into a rabbit hole and entered the world of the Topsy turvy, imagination and wonder, with characters based on author Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and its sequel, Through the Looking-Glass. It's a colorful movie that does not need a plot to follow since it, like the books, takes place in a dream. So, Disney decided to make it an all-around cartoon fest with oddball characters and crazy plot points like the Tea Party, Croquet Game and Courtroom Scene; it's basically about Alice's adventures in Wonderland as she tries to catch up with the White Rabbit, trying to find out where he was going. Along the way, she bumps into the oddball characters.This film will make you suspend reality and enter a trip to a make-believe warp zone. Aside from the somewhat boring and out-of-place flashback scene told by the Walrus character, this is a pretty fast-faced film with some memorable music, like "Golden Afternoon" and "The Unbirthday Song." I loved Alice's portrayal in the movie - a prim but carefree girl with a slight English accent. And, the Cheshire Cat is my favorite. He seemed to be the only character "real" enough to guide Alice throughout the dream. He is voiced by Winnie-the-Pooh actor Sterling Holloway.So, suspend your disbelief and a take a trip to Wonderland.Grade B+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Alice in Wonderland" is worth visiting for the main character and the main moral about dreaming up such a place as Wonderland</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Have you ever dreamed of a world that is the exact opposite of your world in almost every way imaginable? Have you dreamed of a world where "the books would be nothing but pictures"? Have you dreamed of a world where "the flowers would talk for hours"? In the case of Alice, the main character from Walt Disney's 1951 animated feature "Alice in Wonderland", that's exactly the kind of world she wants to escape to. After she sees a white rabbit with a coat and a pocket watch who claims that he's "late for an important date", she becomes curious about where he's going and follows him into a rabbit hole. This rabbit hole leads her to a world called Wonderland which is basically the kind of world she was talking about escaping to. This place is the opposite of the world she came from in that any sense of logic seems to be completely absent here. Whenever she takes just one bite or sip of a single food or drink, respectively, she literally either shrinks too much or grows too much. Throughout her adventures in Wonderland, she discovers many other unusual inconsistencies such as animals running around in the ocean to "get dry", comes across some insane characters like the Mad Hatter, the March Hare, and the Cheshire Cat, and realizes that maybe she was better off in her world than in this world she dreamed of. If there's one thing that I've learned from this film, it's that you get what you wish for sometimes, for better or worse. Hopefully, the next time Alice thinks of a dream place that she would like to explore, she'll think of a place where everything that takes place makes much more sense than it does in Wonderland. If you think about it, "Alice in Wonderland" is a cautionary tale of sorts in that it shows us the consequences of not thinking about every single little detail regarding what you want. In Alice's case, she didn't think any magical world such as this would be this wacky or nonsensical. Another key element that makes "Alice in Wonderland" hold up well after at least 60 years is the main character herself, Alice. Out of all the female lead characters that were created while Walt Disney was alive, including Alice, Snow White, Cinderella, and Aurora from "Sleeping Beauty" (1959), Alice is easily the best developed one of the bunch in my opinion. What sets her apart from her counterparts is that she has a sense of independence. Unlike Aurora or Snow White who allow any creature in sight to make decisions for them, Alice makes all of her decisions by herself regarding if she wants to stay or go somewhere else and what's right or wrong. I also think that Alice is a more identifiable character than any of her predecessors in that she has a certain curiosity not just for this world, but for everything else in general. I think I am able to identify with someone who wants their curiosity to be fulfilled rather than someone who wants to be married and live happily ever after. Though the film's songs by Oliver Wallace may not be quintessential Disney music, it's still pretty good. I liked the songs "In a World of My Own", "All in a Golden Afternoon", and the title song well enough. The song "Very Good Advice" was weird though since it was a combination of singing and crying, and if you're not into that type of stuff, this song isn't for you. The animation may not be as detailed as something like "Bambi" (1942), but that's okay since the style of the drawing and the backgrounds definitely fit this kind of world. The famous scene between Alice, the Mad Hatter and the March Hare does a very good job at further demonstrating how unpredictable and wacky the inhabitants of Wonderland really are. The fact that the Mad Hatter notices a full cup of tea, believes it's empty, and everyone apparently has to move to another seat on the table because of it is just one of a couple of instances that prove how wacky these characters are. The final act when Alice meets the Queen of Hearts also proves the wackiness of Wonderland very well, too. The way the Queen of Hearts orders her servants' heads to be chopped off for the silliest reasons is brilliant. To be frank though, I could have done without an earlier scene between Alice and the caterpillar since it was fairly tedious. I really liked watching "Alice in Wonderland" when I was a kid and I still enjoy watching it now even despite the fact that it's for different reasons than when I was young. I guarantee that other Disney animated fairy tales that came out at that time, like "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" (1937) or "Cinderella" (1950), would be even better if the main characters for those films were as well developed as Alice in this film. Because of its strong moral, awesome lead character and the crazy, imaginative world it shows us, "Alice in Wonderland" is an underrated Disney gem that you owe it to yourself to take a look at.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Although not as "by-the-book" as possible, Disney is still able to capture the magic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a big fan of "Alice", both the books and Disney's adaptation of the tale, I can see that there are several things in the movie that doesn't match up to the book. For example, the 'Unbirthday' song, although a very catchy and memorable song in the movie, has its own share of inaccuracy, as unbirthdays are not introduced by the Mad Hatter and March Hare, but by Humpty Dumpty in the original "Through the Looking Glass", the sequel to "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" of 1865. As another example, the doorknob doesn't even exist in the books, but is a character created by Walt Disney, probably to fill in the gaps that Lewis Carroll would have filled in by his narration. If you think about it, the reason so many things are different is for time's sake, or for the fact that some things look better in books than they do in movies. In the books, Alice often goes off talking to herself about a subject for a whole two pages at a time, but this would look odd in a movie. As for the scene with the duchess and her baby (in this bit I'm assuming you've read the book), I personally think it would not end up looking as good in a movie. Although "Alice" is very odd in itself, you can consider why Disney did not include these things so it wouldn't get to out of hand, and therefore confusing and perhaps a small bit exhausting to watch. Even if he was adapting a book, he needed his own personal touch on things, the one we are all so familiar with, the one that makes it so "Disney."As for one complaint I have seen among critics, concerning the fact that "Alice"'s animation is closer to the Disney cartoons than that of his movies, I say that after thinking about it, I honestly don't care. This wasn't something I noticed in particular, but when I consider it, the movie's entire nature screams cartoon. It's fun and vivid script and songs are perfect for the cartoon-based, bright animation. Back to the subject of the book relative to the movie, when watching the movie I honestly did not care. It was Wonderland, it was a good Wonderland and it was Wondrous enough for me, even if it may not have been word-for-word from Carroll's original version. Next time you read it, or when you first pick up the book, enjoy imagining the characters as the ones Disney provided. I can honestly say I enjoyed the book, even more than I would have normally, reading it with these images. Thinking of some of the other parts not included in the movie, I can admit that I prefer the movie without the Duchess, or the Mock Turtle, or the mouse at the beginning right before the Caucus Race. Disney has sparked imagination, brought a smile to my face, and, unlike many filmmakers' attempts (such as, I'd say, Burbank Films' version), has kept every last drop of, well, wonder, from the original story, and plunged it into his own take. The characters are fun and memorable, as well as the songs, score, scenes, and (often-quoted) lines. I would almost prefer visiting Disney's Wonderland to Carroll's, even though I am one for the original. So even though the version leaves out maybe half of the books, and twists the story a good bit, the magic is still there, and with this said, I think it's safe to say that this can be considered the best movie version out there, and Lewis Carroll himself would have approved in a heartbeat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overrated...But Not Bad At All!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think it would be fair to say that the 1951 Disney animated film is most people's introduction to Lewis Carroll...while I blush to admit it, it was certainly mine. However, having read the books and seen various other adaptations of the stories of "Alice," I find that this one is vastly overrated.Before I go into the problems with this movie (for me), let me give the good things: first of all, the animation is simply superb, and Mary Blair's color styling and backgrounds give everything a very surreal, cartoonish look...indeed, this whole film feels more like a return to the original "Silly Symphonies" for the sheer amount of "cartoon logic" it packs into it, which, in its own unique way, actually heightens the absurdity of Wonderland and its many wacky denizens beyond what even Carroll and John Tenniel envisioned. The voice acting is superb, and the characters are well done: prior to this movie, I can't think of a single film that captured the characters so well. The 1933 film has...problems, the silent films, obviously, were silent, and there are two films before the 1951 movie that have been lost, so it's hard to count those, as I've never actually seen them, and, sadly, probably never will.Specific aspects of the characters never before transferred from the pages of the Charles Dodgson's work to film successfully are well defined: Alice's curiosity and innocence, the White Rabbit's impatience and neurosis, the Mad Hatter and March Hare's zaniness, the Queen of Heart's frightful temper, and the mischievous nature of the Cheshire Cat, just to name a few, are all well played, and the voice actors ? for the characters I've listed, that means Kathryn Beaumont, Bill Thompson, Ed Wynn, Jerry Colonna, Verna Felton, and Sterling Holloway (who also appeared in the 1933 film) ? are excellently picked.To be honest, it's hard for me to find anything particularly WRONG with this movie, other than the fact that it contains fewer characters from the stories than most people think, and the ones not present in this movie, while very often present in other adaptations, are largely forgotten because of this. Being as much of an advocate for "pure Carroll" as I am, that just bugs me beyond compare. Several poems, bits of dialogue, and other moments are meshed together, dumbed down, or just omitted completely, to the point where this particular film seems less of an adaptation of the books and more of a reimagination, but, let's face it, Disney's just notorious for that sort of thing. Also, the designs ? while wonderful ? are almost never like John Tenniel's illustrations, or only vaguely resemble them...I think Alice herself is the only exception.But, gripes aside, do I hate this movie? Hardly! It is one of my favorite films created by Disney, and one of my favorite takes on "Alice" made. Still, as the "building block" that many other adaptations are based on, I don't feel it deserves the reputation it has. Still, it's a very important film, both for the legacy of Lewis Carroll and the Walt Disney Studio, so I guess it deserves a good amount of credit, and I love it all the same.It's also, in my opinion, the best way to introduce Lewis Carroll's work to kids: it's rather lighthearted, especially for a Disney film (these movies are A LOT darker than many people give them credit), and the spirit of Carroll is decently embodied, and the music and characters are great; if you haven't said "I'm late, I'm late, for a very important date" at least once in your lifetime, you are officially dehumanized.Other "kid flick" takes on the stories warp and twist it to fit another medium, like "Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland" or Sesame Street's "Abby in Wonderland." This one doesn't: it changes a lot, but it doesn't include previously established characters or a heck of a lot of pop-culture references either, which is a plus. If you haven't seen it, not only are you an extremely strange person, but you REALLY need to.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Classic Disney here, so much so, that the images of such iconic literary figures as Alice, The Mad Hatter and Queen of Hearts, to name but three, are inextricably and indelibly linked to their animated selves here. The story writes itself of course and is a free-wheeling delight practically from start to finish, as each "chapter" unfolds. If it did falter a little holding one's interest round about the middle, that's soon put right and more, by the appearance of the Queen and the Cheshire cat. The music is light bright and tuneful, in fact my wife stills sings "A Very Merry Unbirthday" 364 days of the year. My only criticism would be that some of the backgrounds are a bit flat and lacking detail, but these are more than made up for by the unforgettable main characters. Vintage stuff, nothing curious about it.</fullReview>

So, she dreams of a world of nonsense called "Wonderland". At Wonderland, she meets a bunch of strange and crazy characters, such as the goofy Mad Hatter(Ed Wynn) and his equally silly partner the March Hare(Jerry Colonna), the mysterious Chesire Cat(Sterling Holloway), two mischievous brothers Tweedle Dumb(Pat O'Malley) and Tweedle Dee(Also Pat O'Malley), the always worrying White Rabbit(Bill Thompson), and the notorious Queen of Hearts(Verna Felton), not to mention her not-so-popular and pint-sized husband, the King of Hearts(Dink Trout in his last starring role). From the books by Lewis Carroll, Alice in Wonderland is packed with laughs and memorable songs. It's all in a Golden Afternoon. I think you'll love this movie. Oh, and by the way, a very merry unbirthday to you!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best adaptations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alice in Wonderland- 1951 An adaptation, if not the most famous one, of the 1867 Alice's Adventures of Wonderland and a bit of the sequel Through the Looking Glass, the movie starts with a narration of Alice's Wonderland and her exploits with a song. The movie acts like a musical, but at the same time has that random structure that a classic Chuck Jones cartoon would have with more play on words than slapstick. If the movie would be summarized it would be Alice goes through the rabbit hole, she cries because she can't get home once she grows, meets the sailing Dodo, follows the white rabbit again, meets Dee and Dumb which tell her the story of the Walrus and the Carpenter and other random stories such as Old William who stood on his head. Then Alice finds the rabbit once again in his house who he confuses for his wife Mary Ann to fetch his gloves, Alice being curious again, eats unknown food because it's labeled "eat me" which causes her to grow and be perceived as a monster to the Dodo, Bill the Lizard, and the Rabbit. She eats a carrot and grows 3 inches high to meet the flowers and the Caterpillar. To summarize the rest of the film, she meets more mad denizens of Wonderland in curiosity of the White Rabbit's destination and then changes her goal to returning home once the inhabitants of Wonderland are becoming more hostile to her after the Mad Tea Party, which sympathize with her when she breaks down crying about how she seldom listens to good advice due to her curious nature. The Red Queen is supposed to lead her to a way out, since the Cat lead her there and she is the ruler of Wonderland, but instead she is a selfish, mad, random cartoon who is as nonsensical as all of the other creatures like the Hare or the Hatter and decapitating anyone who displeases her in the slightest. This is not by any means a complaint, but a compliment to the film, since the madness, especially the randomness of my favorite scenes, the Tea Party scene and the verdict of Alice which has even a child like Alice rolling her eyes with the madness of the Queen and her subjects. More similar to Fantasia at times and adapting very little of the second novel focusing more on the first one with spectacular but random animation, this is a treasure to behold and I give it a 9 out of 10. The only reason it lost a point is because as you saw from my summary, the movie is too short just running at 75 minutes long and if it incorporated Through the Looking Glass, it would have been nice to include the Chess elements and the White Queen. The Jabberwock monster would have been a nice addition, I understand they put excerpts of the poem in the movie like Twinkle Twinkle Little Bat and How Doth the Little Crocodile but the monster would have been nice. The Duchess deleted scene is available in the 60th Un-Anniversary Edition DVD release which is worth watching since it adds another mad character and random situation which adds to the insanity of Wonderland!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this film endlessly as a youngster. As an adult now, I just watched it today. It was great! It's absolutely wacky and thoroughly nonsensical, which is of course the point. I suppose also there's a moral in there about how sometimes wishing for what we want, and then getting it, isn't always best. Getting what we want and ignoring the good advice of others tends to leave us (especially young children) wanting to return to our previous situation.The animation is superb, the score is good, the voices are top notch and the characters, well - if ever a film could win an Oscar for characters, it would be this one. Also, it's a very short film, only lasting a mere 70 minutes - if that. But in that time, it manages to deliver a healthy dose of idiocy and madness, and I must admit that it was genuinely hilarious on more than one occasion. The Mad-Hatter and the March Hare are the funniest and every scene they are in is just brilliantly entertaining. It's no wonder why they have gained such popularity for decades. In addition, there are plenty of other ways that this film can cheer up a downcast soul on a rainy day. The sheer variety is also a pleasure.It was really enjoyable! I think it's one of Disney's best films and I'm glad I managed to find it for just 20p in a charity shop earlier! Well worth it!</fullReview>

Things including a tea party, a caterpillar, etc.Alice finally gives up and wants to go home when she goes face to face with the queen herself, who is quite nutty.

		<shortDescription>A wonderful, imaginative mindtrip</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my favorite early Disney cartoon. The whole movie has a dream-like quality, which is apropos because Alice is dreaming throughout the story. A number of reviewers refer to the "trippy" quality of the movie. And indeed it is trippy, from the mad-hatter tea party to the opium smoking Caterpillar to the Cheshire cat fading in and out and whose smile is mistaken for a crescent moon, to the Queen of Hearts and the final chase morphing into a whirling, twirling swirl of colorful cards. I disagree with critics who say the action is too slow or that the songs are not up to par. The action, in my mind, is appropriate to "dream speed," focusing intensely on the strange characters Alice meets and then cutting away to a new scene. The songs are fine and perfectly in context - I particularly like "A very merry unbirthday to you." I highly recommend this cartoon to viewers old and young - sit down, tune in, and let your imagination run wild.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Cinema, More Disney Than Carroll</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anyone looking for a 100% faithful adaptation of Lewis Carroll is not going to find it here. This film is more Disney than Carroll. But that's alright. The word 'adaptation' suggest change of some sort, and every film maker has envisioned Alice's trip down the rabbit hole through their own unique perspective. Every time someone tries to adapt Lewis Carroll's book faithfully, audiences don't care for it. They always seem more interested in flashier, fast-paced adaptations.For faithfulness, the 1972 English film, the Jonathan Miller BBC production, and the Eva LeGallienne/Florida Friebus revival on KCET, are preferred. But for sheer fun and cinematic virtuoso, Disney's film rocks. It's hilarious, colorful and full of Disney charm and heart. Not to mention a work of accomplished cartoon surrealism.People have often been snobbish toward the Disney version for not being faithful and have never once brought up the many faithful versions that exist. There are many good and interesting interpretations of 'Alice' and Disney's is definitely one of the best. If not the most fun. It's time for 'Alice' critics to fall off their high horses and realize that Alice and her wonderland of creatures and humor has been treated kindly and fairly in the media, and to sit back and enjoy the wonderful treasures that have already been given.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not exactly Carroll...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...but I have yet to see a movie version that did truly give the book(s) their just due. The present generation of youngsters will probably notice that the Cheshire Cat sounds like Disney's Winnie the Pooh (thank you, Sterling Holloway!) but are unlikely to recognize any of the other celebrity voices. The Disney version is entertaining, and hopefully has given kids enough curiosity to look up the books.The "Masterpiece Edition" DVD has some excellent bonus material, including demo recordings of several deleted songs, Disney's very first "Alice" cartoon (in which a very young, but still recognizable, Walt is seen!), and the 1950 Christmas special complete with sponsor plugs (and with the originally-aired black-and-white animated segments replaced by the color versions).By the way, Carroll's "unanswered riddle" does have an answer, though you have to go back to the Victorian era for it: Why is a raven like a writing desk? Because both had inky quills, of course.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't really know why but I love this movie. Overall I like Alice in Wonderland and Through the looking glass but this movie got me reading these books. I can see by what the British meant when they "Americanized" it, it was kind of like the Thomas movie that the states made but thats for another time. Alice was kind of boring and wasn't interesting to watch but that was the polar opposite for the citizens of Wonderland. Sterling Holloway does an excellent job as the Cheshire Cat and Ed Wynn is hysterical as the Mad Hatter. I remember seeing this as a kid and it blew me away. I always loved the song " A Very Merry Unbirthday" and I like the deleted song "I'm Odd". I hope that Tim Burtons, what am I saying. OF COURSE, Tim Burtons vision of the story is going to blow me away like this movie did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first watched Alice In Wonderland years back, I was like 'What was the point in that, it didn't even have a good plot!' However, I have just recently watched it again, and I thought it wasn't that bad!I think it's one of those films where you have to watch it again to like it. It's totally random, but entertaining at the same time. It's funny, and Alice is a good character herself! I haven't read the book to be honest, so I can't say if there was some big difference. But, now that I've watched the film again, I can say it's a fine movie.The only people I wouldn't recommend it to are people who want all the scenes in a movie to make sense. It's a generally a good movie, not the best of Disney I've seen, but it's fun when you get use to the silliness and randomness. Really.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't buy a lot of the allegory read into the Alice books - for example that the rabbit hole represents a certain female orifice or the dormouse the downtrodden proletariat. Truth be told, for all its clever deconstruction of language and meaning, the story is chaotic, haphazard, somewhat unpleasant, often over-laboured, and (at its worst) pure nonsense rather than pseudo-nonsense. As a children's story, Disney could only improve it with the added value we would expect of him. Alice is a pleasant character here and the scene in the daisy field at the beginning is lovely. The talking door-handle (not in the book) is a typical Disney characterisation and serves as a useful lead-in and lead-out point for Wonderland. The caterpillar is the finest interpretation, blowing not smoke rings but smoke symbols - a splendid embellishment. The Mad Hatter manages to be mad enough without simply being annoying and the whole tea-party sequence is a torrent of brilliant visual gags that are more than a match for the arch dialogue from the book. The other characters such as the Queen and the White Rabbit are fairly routine and the Cheshire Cat was not quite there (in all senses), nor could the film overcome the long dull business with the playing cards towards the end. All in all though, rich enough to entertain despite the overfamiliarity, and at times marvellous.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brilliant yet sadly underrated classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The famed Lewis Carroll books gets the Disney treatment and the result is some of the trippiest, funniest and most unbelievable imagery ever put on film.You know the story: little Alice spots a White Rabbit and follows it down the rabbit hole into a bizarre and surreal land of talking animals, bad manners and some unsettling monarchs. The story is loaded with pure nonsense but I loved every single minute, character and idea.The Disney version of the story gets one thing right that most other versions fail tremendously at and that would be the casting. Everyone is spot on here with Ed Wynn, Sterling Holloway, Verna Felton, Bill Thompson, and Richard Hayden just shining as the trippy and weirdo residents of Wonderland. A particular stand-out is Holloway as The Chesire Cat. He is cast to perfection and embodies the part with all the qualities we now associate with the character: slinky, weird, menacing and funny.This review almost cannot do justice to the film. It has some terrific animation, great performances, and some very catchy songs (14 songs total and it never feels bloated). I strongly urge any Disney or Carroll or animation fan to seek this out. You won't be sorry.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My personal favourite Disney cartoon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Out of all of Disney's animated classics, this happens to be my number one favourite.This movie has made a tremendous impact on me. I thought Alice was just sweet, adorable and seductive. I loved the adventures Alice went through in the movie, her long blonde hair, blue eyes, black ribbon, etc. I also feel this is a story I could relate with because it is about imagination and I always wanted my own exit from reality just like that. It is also what being a child is all about.The animation in this movie is just terrific. The songs were also a thing about this movie that has absolutely delighted me.I also happen to be a fan of Lewis Carroll's novel upon which this movie is based on. I know this movie didn't follow the book precisely, but if it hadn't been for this movie, I would not have read the book.The things I dislike about this movie is how some think that the characters are nasty and unfriendly and some think that it has no genuine story arc to it. Didn't the book have no genuine story arc to it? I also disagree with all the critics calling it one of Disney's weaker animated movies.Another thing I also dislike about this movie is that Disney are doing another adaptation of the book, but it will be a live-action, Gothic interpretation because Tim Burton is directing it, and it will include some of that computerized fakery that is often popping up in movies nowadays. People will mostly go to this new movie because of hottie Johnny Depp being in it, and I'm not fond of either him or Tim Burton. And Tim Burton is not even casting a child as Alice, he's casting an 18 year-old named Mia Wasikowska as Alice.As one of the best movies Disney made during his lifetime and one of the best animated movies ever made, I recommend this highly for anyone (apart from Lewis Carroll purists, you'll just be displeased with it). If you haven't seen or own this movie, you should. My rating: 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Alice + Disney = Disney's most surreal yet enjoyble "Golden Years" efforts.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Take: Colorful animation and clever storytelling; Disney is more than just capable of telling Carroll's classic story. Disney's golden age has been a parade of hit-and-miss affairs. Although their classic style of animated wonders have always been classic and have lived on as superb forms of entertainment, not all eventually held up to the standards. Disney version of Lewis Carroll's ALICE IN WONDERLAND is a hit-and-miss affair. On one hand, this is one crazy story that's bound to befuddle a few youngsters just as the original 'Alice' stories have. Disney is pretty odd ground for Carroll's "faerie tale", but I beg to differ. I think Disney animation would be more than adequate in bringing this strange and eccentric world, resulting into one of Disney's most bizarre and mostly under-appreciated efforts. Disney's version of Carroll's fable doesn't exactly charm as much as it is supposed to, but there's still a lot to be seen in little Alice's (voiced by Kathryn Beaumont) journey across the world of utter nonsense. Disney's term of nonsense sure is a sweet one, since this movie is filled with charming and colorful surreal visuals, lifted straight from the pages of Carroll's story. From the Cheshire cat (voiced by Sterling Halloway) to the hot-headed Queen of Hearts (voiced with malice by Verna Felton), to the Mad Tea Party featuring Ed Wynn's wild antics as the voice of the Mad Hatter.The clever nonsense stated in Carroll's stories don't always fit screen standards and a little dumbing-down is bound to occur, but Disney's ALICE IN WONDERLAND doesn't strip the story down completely as a bare bones kiddie flick. There's enough sophistication here to do justice to its source and the eye-candy animation is very eager to please the youngsters. It's far from perfect, but this is such a trippy film that it's hard not to get lost in it. Rating: **** out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here is another classic story beside "Gulliver's Travels" that in intrigue me, and after reading Alice, it became one of my favorite books. I thought this film from Disney is a colorful and imaginative animated interpretation of the classic children's novel. Of course I love both Disney's version and the live-action made-for-TV version from Hallmark with Martin Short (The Mad Hatter) and Whoppi Goldberg (The Cheshire Cat)...I am not one to take sides. I love 5 out of 14 songs out of the film's soundtrack, which are: "Alice in Wonderland," "In a World of My Own," "All in a Golden Afternoon," "A Very Merry Un-birthday" or "The Un-birthday Song," and... "Painting the Roses Red."And I love our adventurous little girl Alice and how she's designed . I now admit, Marc Davis is a champion behind female figures. He also did Cinderella, Princess Aurora/Briar Rose from Sleeping Beauty and Wendy from Peter Pan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Disney's Best Cartoon Movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although "Alice" was a dud when first released in 1951, it remains one of Walt Disney's best animated features. Disney stuck by Lewis Carroll's world of whimsy and nonsense, and deftly wove together Carroll's first "Alice" book with some scenes from its sequel "Through the Looking Glass." Purists may be disappointed, but Disney made the film all his own, and succeeded mightily in creating a unique and highly entertaining film while still retaining some of the subtle charm of Carroll's books.First and foremost, the animation is excellent. Storyboarders and art designers did a wonderful job in creating a surreal landscape and fantastic characters for Wonderland. Although the mark is clearly Disney with regards to character and background design, there is some hint at recreating, at least in part, some of John Tenniel's character designs from his illustrations from the original "Alice" book; this seems apparent with the Mad Hatter, who looks like a hybrid of Tenniel and typical Disney character design.The voice actors are also excellent. The Mad Hatter and March Hare were played by old time radio icons Ed Wynn and Jerry Collona, respectively. They bring their comedic talents for eccentric voices and witty wordplay to the fore in the "Mad Tea Party" scene. Kathryn Beaumont is also very good as the protagonist Alice. An assortment of veteran British and American voice actors round out the cast; some, such as Sterling Holloway, would become Disney stalwarts that would remain with the company after Disney's death. Their talents buoy the film.One clich that nonetheless holds true for "Alice" is that this is a movie that can be enjoyed by both children and adults. Adults may, for instance, be able to pick up on some of the nonsense verse and clever and subtle dialogue and wordplay that was adapted from Carroll's work. While many have accused Walt Disney of ruining a classic work of literature by removing the adult wit and replacing it with simple pablum that only small children would like, the film still retains some of Carroll's charm, in spite of Disney's efforts to dilute the film in his adaptation.I loved this movie as a child and it is still one of my favorite movies. It is one of Disney's best works, and, in spite of its original critical and commercial failure, lives on as a justifiable cult classic. Watch it with your kids and enjoy the show!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly true to the book and a good film in its own right.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With its tense, beautiful, hilarious and exciting moments, this Disney film is not only good on the books (mainly the first one) but also exceedingly entertaining, especially for slightly older children and adults who love Disney (the reason for this is that it may be very upsetting for young children, but not all young children). With lots of similar things to the book, plus the good work of Walt Disney, the animators and the actors, this makes a very enjoyable Disney film! :-)While Alice's mother/sister is teaching the young Alice history outdoors, the young girl complains that she can hardly pay attention to a book without pictures and tells her cat Dinah how she would love to go to a world of her very own, where everything would be the way she wanted it to be. Suddenly, as if in a dream (which it really is), a white rabbit comes hopping along the river bank and curious, Alice follows it into a huge rabbit hole, where she falls into Wonderland...With good characters, themes and events chosen from the book (with only a few left out) and two characters and a poem from the second book by Lewis Carroll, this Disney film is sure to delight many, especially (as said at the top) slightly older children and adults who like Disney films.Enjoy "Alice In Wonderland"! :-)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perhaps I am only in love with the movie because I am in love with the book but to be honest, I really don't like the stereotypical "classic Disney" feel.A typical Disney movie has some storyline about a kid with one or no parents because one of them died in some tragic thing. They are always the "good guy", and only "bad guys" come after them. In Alice, the whole point of the movie is pretty much that it HAS no point.I like the book better, definitely People also fight over drug reference in Alice. I'm not sure if that was Lewis Caroll's original intention or not, but even if there is drug-ness, who cares? If it was indeed all drug created, and the mushrooms were shrooms, the hookah was pot, and the Hatter was on opium, at least its a fantasy that can be related back to realistic problems.And who doesn't like a trippy smiling cat, anyways?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Imaginative Disney adventure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've got to admit that I was never much of a fan of Disney when I was a kid; and Alice in Wonderland is one in particular that I remember not liking. Based on the writings of Lewis Carroll, Alice in Wonderland tells the tale of a young girl in a mysterious world of wonders. The plot works by following Alice from one sequence (usually involving a weird and wonderful set of characters) to another, and by ensuring that every section of the movie is different; the film manages to stay interesting throughout. The stars of the show are undoubtedly the set of characters; and imaginative ideas such as the Mad Hatter, The Cheshire Cat, the Smoking Caterpillar and the Queen of Hearts are legendary. The animation is good, and by using bright colours; the film always seems otherworldly and fascinating. One criticism I can direct at the film stems from the central character - I'm not sure how old Alice is supposed to be, but she seems a bit to savvy to be a little girl. Even so, that's a small criticism and while I personally can't buy into a plot like this too much; I'm sure Disney fans will get a kick out of it.</fullReview>

Singing walruses, vanishing cats, lunatics in the woods, a psychotic queen, a hookah-smoking caterpillar, warbling flowers, psychotropic food and drink...this actually sounds like an Andy Warhol film to me. But no, it's Disney. What's interesting about this film, to me, is that the more charming the various critters are, the creepier they become. Look at Tweedle-Dee and -Dum. My girlfriend doesn't even like to think about them. There's something indefinably distasteful about the two of them gamboling in the dark forest, waiting for a new playmate. Or the queen, with her unnatural delight in decapitation.I take it back: it doesn't sound like Andy Warhol. It sounds like David Lynch with cute songs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Never has a movie captured the word "nonsense" in such a brilliant and truly perfect manner. To really look closely at the dialogue in "Alice in Wonderland" you can't help but wonder just what was going through the writer's mind when he created the various creatures and characters of Wonderland. Walt Disney also deserves a great deal of credit for making this one of the greatest book to film translations in cinematic history. The flawless animation of things that truly make no sense whatsoever is a testament to the genius of Disney. I have seen this movie countless times and the shear insanity of it never fails to make me laugh. 10/10. Great for the whole family.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tepid and disappointing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd once thought of the period under Walt Disney himself to be a nearly spotless time of creativity, where each film was a spectacular achievement for the art of animation and an example of nearly impeccable craftsmanship. The key word is "nearly." Despite its iconic status, I'm afraid a rewatch of Disney's Alice in Wonderland has not been kind to it at all. In fact, this I think is the first sign of the kind of film making that would plague Disney's work following the death of its famed producer. It's not quite so bad as all that, of course, since there is great animation and artwork to be found in each individual scene, but none of its adds up to much of anything, and when it's all over it makes no impact.According to certain workers in the studio, it was Walt Disney himself who failed to make this project work. While his perfectionism and insistence on placing his own personal stamp on everything usually worked out for the better, in this case Disney was constantly clashing with his writers over the humor of the story. The original novel was much too Victorian for him, and his attempts to liven things up with slapstick and screwball humor led to a watered down product that was too surreal and weird to work as conventional Hollywood storytelling, yet, too commercialized to be much of an art film. In the end, it's a curiosity in search of a throughline.Which isn't to say that the craftsmanship isn't as impeccable as on any Disney film. If for no other reason, this film must be viewed for the beautiful design work by the great Mary Blair, easily one of the most influential art designers in all of animation. The bright colors and exotic locations make every scene feel like the eyes are munching on a visual pastry.The other reason to watch this film, and I believe the primary cause of its following, is that it's packed with memorable characters. It's a real tour de force where character animation is concerned, with Milt Kahl and Ward Kimball and Eric Larsen and all those other guys giving each individual a real feeling of weight. Kimball's work on the Mad Hatter's party remains great fun to watch, and Kahl does a few interesting bits here and there. However, the real scene stealer is, bizarrely, Frank Thomas. His bombastic work on the Queen of Hearts (which he based off a glimpse of a woman at a musical performance of his) is so over the top and fun to watch that it's easy to forget Thomas's forte was usually naturalism (he'd also break this habit of his with his work on Captain Hook).And yet...it just doesn't work. Alice herself just doesn't endear at all, as she just sort of wanders from place to place and is subject to a bunch of wacky cartoon gags. There's some fun scenes, some good music...but that's it. To be fair, it's far better than Burton's take on the story, as it at least isn't burdened with trying to be hip, but it still remains the weakest of Disney's feature films before the seventies. Much better semi-adaptations have been made of Carroll, such as Miyazaki's Spirited Away or Rivette's Celine &amp; Julie Go Boating, that make this proper adaptation feel wanting (I haven't yet watched Svankmajer's Alice). It's simply too lightweight.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The best thing about Lewis Carroll's Alice books, by far, is the poetry. As books they really aren't so great as they are made out to be; but ... Jabberwocky! You Are Old, Father William! Humpty Dumpty's poem about the fish! These are masterpieces.The poetry can't make it to the screen and Disney's attempts to work in bits of "The Walrus and the Carpenter", "Jabberwocky", "How Doth the Little Crocodile", and perhaps others that don't leap to mind at the moment, as song lyrics and chanted pieces of verse, is contrived. When the Caterpillar says, in effect, "I will now recite a poem" ... why, it's just asking us to fall asleep.There has never been a good screen adaptation of the Alice books and there can't be. This may be the pick of the bunch. (Not, I admit, that I have tortured myself by watching every one of them to make sure.) Carroll's atmosphere is gone but it has been replaced with a different atmosphere, that of the Disney studios entering the 1950s and deciding that backgrounds must now look surpassingly strange. Disney did wonders making the setting dreamlike and claustrophobic - as Tenniel did in a highly different way. Indeed Disney does necessary work that Tenniel was inclined to neglect.After a while, though, our nerve-endings become raw as one village eccentric after another is being paraded in front of us; and Alice's incessant monologue doesn't help. I defy you to be caught up in the story. It can't be done. To watch this you need to be determined to grimly forge ahead and attend to the images - for they really are memorable images.</fullReview>

As least the movie this time around has some funny bits like the Tea Party and the monster in the White Rabbit's cottage plus there's is no bits that are just saccharine or paint by numbers or characters that are such a pain it's impossible to hate them!

		<fullReview>After the huge success of Cinderella, they wanted to put out another movie and in the summer of 1951, they put out Alice in Wonderland, which did not do so well then.The story is about a girl named Alice that falls in a whole while following a White Rabbit. Tech hole leads her into a world called Wonderland. She then mets a bunch of characters and is in an adventure of a lifetime. The story can be very episodic and boring. For the entire movie, she meets a character, they say and/or act unusual and don't make sense, something wacky happens, and then she moves on, with those characters never to be seen again. The plot in this is not very strong at all.The characters are as flat and one dimensional as they can be, but I think they Re suppose to be like that. They are memorable though, everyone knows the Mad Hatter, the March Hare, Queen of Hearts, and of course the main character Alice. This story is not much about plot and character, which is a problem for me, but you mint still like it.The songs are not very memorable as well. I remember that down sound like the songs from other Disney films at the time, but I cannot label any of them. The animation is impressive as usual. It is in the same style as Cinderella, and the colours and contrast are extremely bold. The character styles are very good and detailed as well.If you like a whole lot of wackiness, and a story that is no much about story or character development, you will like it. This film is a bit different from the Lewis Carrol books, but if you like the books, give this movie a watch. If you like in depth movies with in depth characters, this movie is probably not for you</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Somehow "Alice in Wonderland" has attained classic status and many folks seem to like it. However, I really don't know how any film based on the Lewis Carroll stories could be that entertaining--especially for kids. After all, the story is more like a drug-induced experience instead of having a lot of charm.So, if I am not at all excited about the story, that means I hate the film, right? No. You cannot hate a film which features such lovely animation and a few of the little vignettes. The mad tea party with "A Very Merry Un-birthday" is enjoyable nonsense and a few of the characters scattered throughout the film are pretty nice. But if you compare this film to its contemporaries, such as "Cinderella", "Peter Pan" and "Lady and the Tramp" it comes up wanting because of the story. Worth seeing perhaps but quite weak compared to most Disney films of the era.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst Disney Movie Made While Walt Disney Was Still Alive</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of Walt Disney's worst movies. I was so excited to see Alice in Wonderland from Disney due to my trust that this company gives a storybook fairytale a great picture (that's not what i really think right know), and I've used to love reading Alice in Wonderland storybooks, but after seeing it, it appeared to me that there's a lot of works from books and other films on this fairytale better then this lame film. The writing for this film was very bad, and not to mention the script. I hated almost every word that came out from Alice's mouth, and not to mention the way they made the bunny react and repeat 'I'm late'. This movies gives the viewer a headache to me and makes him say the word 'LAME' after only few scenes from the movie.I once saw this not very good cartoon movie on Alice as well from Golden films, and i was surprised to find this low-budget movie better then a Walt Disney Production. Guess high budget and quality don't serve a work dramatically does it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Alice in Wonderland</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I was a kid, this used to be quite a good animated film from Walt Disney Pictures, a bit more aimed at girls and readers of the famous book by Louis Carol, but good. Alice is listening to her boring older sister reading History research and then she is distracted by a white rabbit in clothes with a watch. She follows this rabbit into a rabbit hole which leads to Topsy-turvy world of Wonderland. In this world there are talking locked doors, talking Dodos, twin fat blokes that squeak called Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum, a Mad Hatter (voiced by Mary Poppins Uncle Albert, Ed Wynn) and a March Hare, a nasty Queen with a deck of cards as guards and many other bizarre things. Alice later gives up wondering about the rabbit and tries to find her way home. Will she get out, or will the Queen have head chopped off for making her lose her temper? It was number 71 on The 100 Greatest Cartoons. Good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pure ridiculousness but fairly amusing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This animated 1951 RKO/Walt Disney Pictures co-production derserves credit for its lavish and very colorful animation as well as several highly amusing and imaginative supporting characters but the film as a whole just doesn't seem to be on the level of "a true Walt Disney classic." The film seems to pay more attention to nonsense than sense and as good as that sounds for a cartoon, that may be one of the problems. Fortunately, it ends at an appropriate time. A proximity of 1 hour and 15 minutes is about as long as any film like this should run.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember, as a child, watching this mvie and never really enjoying it. When it didn't scare the living daylights out of me, it bored me. Watching it again for the purpose of doing a direct comparison to the book (which I just finished reading for a British Lit course), I can start to see why. This film decides that a world of nonsense is a horrible, scary place. Also, it really has no plot, though they attempt to make the chasing of the White Rabbit into one, and later escaping the queen. Apparently, they decided to go with the angrier meaning of "mad" and hence all of the creatures Alice meets are either trying to kill her or ar just screaming at her. The book does not do this-while the Mad Hatter and the March Hare are certainly ruder in the book, the caterpillar never started shrieking at her and the Cheshire Cat was never out to get Alice in trouble. The first sequence of the movie, with Alice's sister declaring Alice's world to be ridiculous nonsense, seems to capture the spirit of Carroll's book, which is declaring the adult world to be utter nonsense. After that, the movie takes the direction that nonsense is bad and fantasy is evil. How dreary.Message aside, this movie is interesting to watch anyway, for some of the moments are lifted from the two Alice books, and if you've read them, you can tell which characters are quoting the book and where the quotes would get moved to. The animation is fantastic, even for the time the movie was made. The story does have it's moments, such as the Caterpillar speaking with smoke and of course, Tweedledee and Tweedledum. Overall, though, this is a movie that suffers from the fact that it attempts to make sense out of a book that is all nonsense, a task that is quite impossible (or is it "impassible?").</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the last film that I can imagine a studio producing in 2000. The movie's theme song sounds palpably like it's being played on a 78 R.P.M. The song "Golden Afternoon" sounds like a hit from the turn of the century or something. There is no technology in the story, except when Tweedledee and Tweedledum ask "Would you like to play 'Button, button, who's got the button?'" And there is no male-female relationship in the story, unless you count the family photo (barely visible) on the White Rabbit's stairway. In all, it seemed like an oxymoron when I saw that this film was distributed on DVD as early as it was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Alice in Wonderland</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie recently and I think it's pretty good. It does have a strange storyline, but it's a different, refreshing type of movie. Unfortunately many people are obsessed with whether or not there's drug references in the movie and wonder if the author was on drugs while writing the book on which it's based. Personally I don't really care where the story came from as long as it entertains me. The music was pleasant and the animation was pretty good for the early 50's. I thought some of the characters were kind of annoying but that's just me. It's not the best movie I've seen, but it is worth watching once or twice. Some parts of the movie seem kind of frightening, like when she's lost in the Tulgey Wood and is crying because she can't find her way home again. So, yeah, it's not the best movie I've seen but I would definitely watch it a few times just to be acquainted with the story. Anyway, the movie is probably a lot easier to understand than the book would be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Disney's worst.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After being disappointed with the supposed "remastered DVD" of the '72 Shaftel production, I decided to give the renowned animated Disney version a chance. The last thing I remembered hearing about it was my grade school English teacher giving it a thumbs down.But, hey... it's Disney! How bad could it be? Well, the animation itself is fine, but the story execution is abysmal. It's like a Waner Brothers' Looney Tune gone bad, and, considering the contention between the two studios at the time, I'm sure that comment's not too far off the mark.In Disney's offering Alice traipses from one bizarre episode to the next, seemingly for the sake of it (though she's supposed to be following the white rabbit, but, in my opinion, Alice doesn't give the audience sufficient impetus for her actions, other than the fact that she's curious). In other versions there's a kind of child-like cohesion to Dodgson's tale, but this one really zig-zags all over the place, and without rhyme or reason.The voice acting is fine, the songs, for what they are, are OK, and as I mentioned the animation is up to Disney's extremely high standards. But the rest of it, the actual story structure (and what little plot there is) just is scattered, making watching this very technically well done animated film a chore to watch.Well, Disney's learned the lesson of trying to be and create the kind of product they're not known for, and it seems to have stuck for the most part. They weren't WB then, and it shows.Myself, I'm at a real loss as to why people heap praises on this film. It may be the upbeat and high energy delivery, but, personally, I prefer the more sedate and character driven approach.Well, to each his own. If you like it, then enjoy. Otherwise take advice from my English teacher; if haven't already seen it, don't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good for kids but far too cutesy and lacking a real sense of wit or wonder</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While her aunt reads her a story by the riverside, young Alice notices a white rabbit and chases it down a rabbit hole. At the bottom of the hole she finds an entirely new world populated by all manner of strange characters. Struggling to get her head around the confusing things she sees and hears, Alice wants nothing more than to get back home but it doesn't look like being an easy task ? certainly not once the Queen of Hearts gets involved.It seems strange to think that, given my familiarity with the Alice books, that I had never seen the Disney version until it came on television one Sunday morning. The first thing that struck me was that, not having seen an older animated feature for quite a few years, the animation is almost unbearable cute and colourful. I know this is less about the period and more about the studio but I found it a little harder to get into for that reason. I did get past this very quickly thought and did find that the colourful characters were still quite fun even if it rather took away from the sense of wonder that I wanted to feel by being in this magical new world full of strange characters ? by animating them in this way the whole thing felt, well, almost ordinary. Likewise the Disney style of humour didn't totally suit the wit of the books and, although it did get it at times, the film felt more about bright colours than about wit and charm.The characters are pretty well imagined but I would have liked them to have more personality rather than just being made into standard Disney creations. Of course this is a minor complaint because they are still good and I'm aware I'm judging the film by modern taste ? perhaps unfairly. It still works well enough to be worth seeing, the songs are average but there aren't too many of them and the story will still be of great value to children who will love it regardless.Overall this is a fun and enjoyable cartoon but the mix of books and failure to really deliver the qualities of wit and childhood wonder marked it down to be not as good as I had hoped. My suggestion would be to read the books yourself of course but if you need a cartoon version to get the kids into it then this is definitely worth a look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A flunk childrens movie.But is mad.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember the first time I watched this movie as a little girl. I found it scary, disturbing, and very upsetting. The caterpillar and Queen had the most violent temper, and were upsetting. Alice in Wonderland involves mad people, but Disney seems to make them too hot tempered for younger children to watch without being upset, scared, or just plain un-enjoying the expierence. This movie draggs along the classic story by changing the order, cutting importent parts, and changing the origanal text around. The movie has little imagined parts, and makes the main theme that mad people on rage are what is in the imagined wonderland children dream about. Instead of the question is a fantasy world better, it states from the second scene on that a fantasy world contained mad and insane people about to kill Alice at any second. Is that what you thought when you grew up as a kid? Instead of demonstrating that the people are different and not psycho-murder mad, but think differently and contain some psycho's like the Queen, they demonstrate that that everyone there is about to kill Alice at any moment. I think that this movie has the most perfect mad people in it, but needs to have them be more strange and curious then just plain psycho. I give it a 5 for adults and a 2 for children. I think Disney failed to create a good childrens movie this time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Theory on Alice In Wonderland (Symbolicly)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Excuse some of my spelling and writing... I'm slightly lazy to go into depth with this.The whole story is about a young innocent little girl seeing things that she has never seen before (AKA: DRUGS). She hop's down a Rabbit whole to which nothing seemed the same any more. From there she discovers a small bottle in which she grows extremely large. I believe this symbolizes Alchol). Alcohol can make you seem like your above the world in which you can do any thing (feeling when you hurt yourself when your drunk but you don't feel it). It escalates from alcohol to more extreme levels. The Catepillar seems to smoke hookah....But can we be sure? We can only infer from the facts.... the smoke is vivid with color, Little Alice inhales the colorful smoke accidentally (peer pressure), the Caterpillar seems to have no control over his body, the Caterpillar gets angry easily, not to mention he turns into a butterfly and flies away (High).Alice feeling perplexed and lost; just wants to go home. The Catepillar informs her of a solution... to eat a mushroom (shrooms)with some advice as too which side of the mushroom (good trip vs. bad trip). Then Alice meets the mad hatter, the hare, and the little mouse. (This Part I cant be sure if it is opium or coke... If id take a guess Id say they were doing coke). Tea = Caffine = extremely hyper = coke. A Rabbit ( the Hare) is a speedy creature as it is. For those of you who don't believe this movie has ne drug relation.... look at the mouse and don't tell me that mouse isn't on something. Alice then Faces the the queen ( Authority/ aka police). Then she sees every one in the movie in a trippy turn of events ( the big trip out) and all she wants to do is have it all end and go home.This movie is extremely satirical and has many drug relations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Way overpraised Disney film. That critics alike supposedly call a classic..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a childhood favorite when I was a kid. I loved the weird situations Alice would get into, and the wacky characters she encountered. I'd just sit their with a big smile on my face while it all happened. Well now I've fully grown up, and the enjoyment level has really quite wained. For starters it's way too dark for a Disney film. There are some images in this film and situations that could still scare a kid in my opinion. Sitting through this movie years after, I couldn't help but feel a sense of discomfort. I'm not that big on Disney movies anyway, but for some reason I really got uncomfortable.Bottom line. It isn't the classic it portrays itself to be. It really is too dark to be fully enjoyable, and I wouldn't suggest it in the slightest for your kid's 1st Disney film either. Worth a look due to it's overrated reputation, I suppose.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay. This isn't a bad movie. In fact, it's good as children's movies go. This is certainly fine to entertain the young ones. However, I'm the kind of person who likes movies with some kind of plot or story. Alice in Wonderland doesn't have any. Or at least it has very little. It's just Alice stumbling into one oddball character after another. In this sense, almost everybody is a minor character. And Alice herself is a strange one. She's practically a whiny brat who can't sing. I mean she REALLY can't sing. Many of the songs are a tad awful. If you're looking for a decent babysitter, this will do. It's charming enough. However, if you're an animation buff, this may be a bit too strange to watch.</fullReview>

They took away some of the best parts of the story, and made it too "cute", when in fact parts of the original book are actually quite disturbing. The only good bit about the film is the Cheshire Cat.The film is certainly extremely over rated.If you're a fan of Lewis Carroll then I would personally recommend avoiding this film.

		<fullReview>Obviously, our perception of Lewis Carroll's classic novel has been slightly altered by the quintessential '60s song "White Rabbit". Being the Disney movie that it is, "Alice in Wonderland" now looks kinda hokey, but it does sort of maintain Carroll's wry humor. Still, after everything that's happened in the world since this movie came out - in fact, maybe all of world history - a Disney movie doesn't quite seem the same as it once might have. I know that this was during the heyday of Disney's animated features (think "Cinderella" and "Peter Pan"), but I wish to assert that their computer-animated movies from the past few years have actually been more clever ("Monsters Inc.", "Finding Nemo").So overall, there's nothing particularly bad about this movie (the Mad Hatter has some neat lines). It's just that things have changed. No matter, I think that we can all agree that, to play off of a movie title, Alice still does live here after all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alice doesn't know it, but she's about to embark on a strange adventure. She meets many strange characters. This includes a Cheshire cat, two twins, Twidledee and Twiddledum, a Mad Hatter, a March Hare, and a furry white rabbit. It's the rabbit that really sets her off, and she tries to find him, but without much success. Strange things happen, and she comes across the Queen of Hearts, a vicious woman who's mean to everyone, including her tiny husband, the King if Hearts. Any card who's get out of order, gets their "heads" off. I really don't get that part, since cards really can't talk, much less walk. But everything in this movie is fantasy.Not the best of the Disney movies, but only worth watching if you're 100% bored of other movies.My score: 3/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not a Disney fan, perhaps because I grew up in a household with a father obsessed with them. In fact I came to loathe Disney by the time I was a teenager; I am a WB enthusiast and only like Pixar's films with Disney, along with "Aladdin" and "The Lion King" - which I found a bit more "adult" in nature (who can't love Williams' animated impersonation of Woody Allen?!) Some of the classics are good for what they are but in no way are they favorites of mine, and I can't say anyone over the age of 10 is going to enjoy them terribly much."Alice in Wonderland" is a film I watched often as a child and I have not seen in from beginning to end for many years. I remember it very clearly as well as the musical numbers. I can't say I ever want to watch it again. The book is much better. Actually no it's not, it's just as muddled and drug-crazed. Alice must have been smoking some serious weed in that tree - I'm starting to think the White Rabbit was cocaine or something.I do like the tea party though.</fullReview>
