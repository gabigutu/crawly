		<fullReview>KING OF KONG is one of the greatest movies I've seen in a while - not documentaries, movies. The film-making here is nothing short of extraordinary - building suspense, creating anticipation, and playing with the archetypes like the best Hollywood movies. If you have ever played the original Donkey Kong arcade game, or on the original Nintendo, you have to see this movie. I have never beaten Level 3 on the third cycle - the spring on the elevator stage, if you know what I'm talking about, is going extremely fast. These guys get beyond 20 cycles. I don't want to give anything away...I heard they are going to make this a feature movie with actors, but I think that eliminates the main draw of this concept - these guys are in their forties, in some freak cases have wives and children, and they play Donkey Kong with as much heart as Lance Armstrong rode bikes. They are some of the strongest characters I've seen in a movie since STAR WARS. To best summarize how enjoyable this movie is, after watching the DVD for the first time, I immediately restarted it from the beginning, and watched it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an incredible documentary, and as with most great documentaries the story arises as the filming happens; it is not preconceived. The film starts out as a story about a battle between two gamers who each want to hold the donkey kong high score records, but what it turns into is a story about man vs. the empire(and not in a star wars sense). It is a story about how who you know is always everything and how much harder an everyman must work to make it in a world of networks. The story of these people, especially steve's, are really inspiring and you find yourself feeling all of the twists and turns of the film along with the characters. A truly wonderful film about human beings not just donkey kong.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>King of Kong (or Billy vs. Steve, basically), is an excellent film about a rivalry that says a lot about competition in our culture. The movie portrays Billy, the Donkey Kong Champion, doing everything in his power to keep his record and to deny Steve Wiebe (wee-Bee) the title of world record holder in Donkey Kong. Steve is an outsider in this culture where Billy is an icon, and at first there are people within the video game community who do not want him to succeed. It becomes kind of a struggle between good and evil, as the powers that be try to hold down those not in power. Suddenly, Steve is the guy you're rooting for, if only just to beat that smart-ass Billy. It is a journey that takes you through the darker and seedier side of the video game revolution of the '80s. If it seems silly to be writing about such weighty issues of good and evil when a movie is about a video game, watch the movie: it really does the job of making you care about what happens to these odd, fascinating people.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun and exciting documentary that everyone will enjoy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this at the Traverse City Film Festival and it was probably the best film of the festival.This excellent film has everything that a movie fan loves to see: the classic hero and villain story, action, suspense, drama, and comedy. Who would have thought all of this would come out of a documentary about Donkey Kong? The story follows Steve Wiebe, a family man from Washington trying to beat the arcade juggernaut Billy Mitchell's world record score on Donkey Kong. The film is perfectly edited by introducing both characters, showing their history in the video game culture, and giving the viewers a sense of which person to root for. It's hysterical the way this simple story is made out to look like an action adventure film. Steve is the underdog, the man that has a big journey ahead of him. But to overcome the challenges and try to claim the title of Donkey Kong master, he must face the opponent Billy Mitchell and his video game minions.This film is one of the most fun times I've had in a theater in long time. The whole audience was involved, cheering on some characters, laughing at others, and applauding many times. It's so much fun to watch an underground culture and see people you didn't know existed.My favorite part in the film is probably when Steve has to show up in person and prove his ability. It's so hilarious, suspenseful, and inspiring.The King of Kong is a terrific film. It's a lot of fun, there's never a dull moment, and it really shows what a great film is supposed to be like.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The best movie I've seen this year! I laughed to the point of exhaustion. I'd recommend it to anyone with a heartbeat. Must see!The only thing I can't get over is that this Billy Mitchell guy is a real person. I mean you can't make up a character like this. And Steve Weibe... how humble can you get. I mean the guy is the poster child for humility. (Okay so here is where I admit that I actually know Steve personally. Thing is, he actually IS this humble. No lie. For his recent 20 year high school reunion he listed as his proudest accomplishment: "recieving my teacher's certificate", no mention of Donkey Kong. Now that's the kind of hero everyone should look up to. Especially anyone with a huge ego. And lord knows there are enough of those to go around. So don't walk, RUN to the movie theater and see this movie. You won't regret it. (Just make sure you use the bathroom before the movie starts, you won't want to miss a second!)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a truly exciting, funny, and inspiring 'sports' movie about the players of the toughest game in the world</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If it weren't for the sincerity of it all- or maybe because of it- King of Kong could be conceived of as a mockumentary. But there's no joking with these guys, which sometimes makes it a lot of fun to watch the competition between Billy Mitchell and Steve Weebie (right way to say the name?), where sycophants and idiosyncrasies fly on the former's self-spun empire/network and on the latter just your average suburban housewife and kids going somewhat begrudgingly along the ride. It's a saga though not just about them, but about the world of gaming, of the mind-set that pervades everyone from lawyers to 'Roy Awesome' to little old ladies competing at Qubert, and the nature of competition itself. Not since Rocky- and maybe even better in its exuberance and humility- has one seen a tale of the underdog and the king played out in odds that should seem somewhat silly.But what's so amazing is how first-time director Seth Gordon plunges the viewer into this world, and it's immediately recognizable to anyone over 18 and under, well, 55 to 100- anyone who's ever gone to play one of the "old-school" arcade games like Donkey Kong or Pacman/Mrs. Pacman or even Pong. We see how the players have to not just go into the games haphazardly by luck; like football, there's game-plans and strategies, and like that sport there are also some obstacles that are apart of the nature of the design of the sport. There's a whole incredible facet one takes for granted, for example, about the technology of the machines, which despite being eclipsed many times over by new systems can still be tampered with, as is the case with Steve's first machine that reaches the top score, and then discredited because of a chip possibly (or not) being replaced or implanted in to give leverage at a non-gamer store.Yet the more slippery side-stepping for players is what's even more intriguing. Characterization can be a tricky thing for the documentary director to deal with, but in King of Kong it becomes something of a controversy left by the wayside as Billy surpasses Steve's score with a game he played recorded on videotape- while Steve set his score by an official Twin Galaxies referee (Walter Day, to be exact, who's a character in and of himself)- with more than a few skips right were the score should register. Saying it skims the line of reality and mockumentary comes with the territory- after a while watching Mitchell is like watching someone who's improvising as he goes along, hiding behind his perfectionist guise as a world-class champ and purveyor of fine hot sauces with his fake-buxom wife and lackeys watching every move Steve makes.Aside from it being compelling storytelling as one sees the transformation of Steve from failed baseball pitcher and drummer to a Donkey Kong (and Donkey Kong Junior) champ, making all-time high scores while his kids cry about their poor behinds, it's one of the best kinds of sport-genre features in years. Many times one sees this played out, and it's been parodied in the likes of Dodgeball ("Nobody makes me bleed my own blood" came to mind once or twice looking at Mitchell, and his smart but biased cronies are like classic supporting characters), and the clichés and conventions get the better of the narrative. This time there's no pressure to push it into what's expected: we genuinely care what happens in this battle of the joystick, as Steve sheds genuine tears playing his ass off at all accounts of live events whilst Billy sulks away in his living room hearing the updates on his phone.As far as triumph-of-the-human-spirit stories go, King of Kong is hilarious entertainment, sometimes for all the strangest (Day's would-be musical career) and silliest reasons (what's so special about the Guiness book of records, Steve's daughter asks), but engrossing as documentaries should get- one of the best of the year in fact.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great film and a great documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just got done seeing this film in Santa Monica and was so happy that it lived up to how great the trailer makes this film and the characters out to be. It was totally entertaining from start to finish and lives up to the obvious Rocky comparisons. And like Rocky this film deserves it time in the sun right now and hopefully a ticket to the Oscar dance next year.And yes the film was carefully edited to make for some dramatic moments as all films are. It is after all entertainment. But nothing so much that it taints the great story this film tells. I can think of quite a few documentaries and films in the past few years that did the same thing. Fahrenheit 9/11, An Inconvient Truth, JFK and pretty much any story you see told on the news tonight. The truth is left on the editing room floor. AlphaPepper should probably change his login ID to Sour Grapes and remove his head from... well you know.Billy Mitchell is no doubt a nice guy but is perfectly edited as the villain for this film. Steve Weibe is likewise edited to be the perfect underdog. All the other cast of characters in this film and some of their comments make this a film worth seeing. And without a doubt Steve Weibe's daughters "from the mouth of babes like" comment steals the whole show in the end.In the end this is just a great story about two men Steve Weibe and Billy Mitchell fighting for title of King of Kong. I hope this film gets picked up for larger distribution so more people can enjoy it like I did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maybe the best documentary I have seen in years... A must-see for anyone who loves rooting for the underdog. King of Kong tells the story of two men competing for the highest all-time score in the arcade classic Donkey Kong. Seth Gordon skillfully explores this whole American subculture of die-hard classic video gamers. The fact that this is all real (as opposed to a Christopher Guest style mockumentary) makes it all the more hilarious, but above all this is a true story of inspiration that should appeal to anyone regardless of whether they know anything about video games. In a country dominated by politically-fused documentary/movie propaganda, we need more films like this to remind us of how wonderfully weird we can be. Michael Moore eat your heart out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I totally disagree with the characterization that Billy Mitchell is made the villain and Steve Weibe the heroic underdog. This film did a great job of just letting each person fill in the colors for themselves. At the end, when Billy Mitchell's finally turning hypocrisy inside out, there are a few shots inserted finally that show that the filmmakers notice what is going on, but that is the extent of it.This is a great film. Like the film American Movie, it is a whirlwind in which the power and depth of the material is remarkable, and yet it is incredibly compelling to watch, start to finish.Another important point is that the film is not only a great treatise on individual psychology and what our winning-obsessed culture has wrought, but a great meditation on how the various types are fostered by and then fuel their immediate relations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More fun then non-gamers should think</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though this geeky arcade fighting flick may remain an acquired taste, The King of Kong feels like one of the more entertaining documentaries to emerge in years. Even though you would think the chief demographic of forty year old virgins and basement-ridden, antisocial, hardcore, old-school gamers would flip the bill, Kong immediately offers so much more on so many different levels of psychological and sociological intrigue that anyone not self-conscious enough to feel embarrassed for investing an emotional stake into a Donkey Kong showdown, (highlighting a bittersweet anti-climax) will find themselves deep inside a world they never thought imaginable.The mock-epic tone, which so many supporting characters delightfully contribute to, feels seized by director Seth Gordon and infused into his charming take on good-vs-evil, letting this potentially inspiring metaphor stretch it's wings into a blossomed, well-rounded quirk-fest far more fun then it's rigorous gaming pedigree would suggest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fairly Accurate Look At Gaming Sub Culture.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After having worked with video games in a professional capacity for several years, the people shown in the film were pretty accurate representations of the various levels of gaming personality: The contenders, the arrogant zealots, the wannabes, and the know it alls who claim to be the undisputed masters of things gaming.The film was funny in a sad, yet sympathetic way. Steve Weibe is this "average" guy who gets his 15 minutes of fame, only to have it continually disputed by a mullet-haired Billy Mitchell (who bore more than a passing resemblance to Superman's General Zod), who seemed to not defend his titles out of fair competition, but out of insecurity that he might not be known as "the best".The main prize of the whole competition seemed to be not the point of having the highest score in Donkey Kong, but it was more a battle of Steve's point to be credited for a score which he kept earning time and time again, versus Billy's fragile ego. Steve video tapes his high score, Billy contends that it's not credible unless played live. Steve goes to play live in a public place, Billy sneaks out this "top secret" hi-score tape, where the editing and quality are questionable. And yet, that's somehow okay by the judges board.The Twin Galaxies organization also seems very much like a "Boy's Club" looking out for their "bro", and are willing to subvert their own set guidelines to keep their buddy's prestigious spot within the organization.As a gamer, it was very frustrating to watch Steve get his title taken away time and time again, due to frequently changing "technicalities" insisted on by Billy Mitchell, especially when Steve proved it repeatedly, and Billy never bothered to show up to any of these competitions at all (save for one where he skulked in the background like a 12-year old comic book villain), much less even play a game during the run of the whole film. The only game he had at all was just running his mouth, and I'm surprised he didn't start twirling his mustache like Snidely Whiplash.Even if it was the editing that could have put Mitchell more in a negative light, all the editing in the world couldn't remove his preening, skulking, and making arrogant and ridiculous comments throughout the film. He seemed so incredulous that he would be incapable of losing anything he attempted, but it was obvious that he wasn't willing to risk the chance of even the slightest chance of losing. It was very clear that the guy was willing to do whatever it took to not only protect his high score, but his ego and status within his circle of hangers on.Without divulging anything regarding the ending. my theater clapped at the end of the film due so several surprises that take place in the last 20 minutes or so. In a sense, this is the "Rocky" of video game films (complete with "Eye of the Tiger" playing in the background at one point). As a video gamer, I've seen the world portrayed in the film, and there really are Steve Weibes and Billy Mitchells out there, along with the rest of the supporting cast. And for a documentary, it's a lot funnier than what one would expect, though in unexpected ways.For those who enjoy video games, or even the excitement of seeing an unusual competition, it's a worthwhile film, and definitely recommended if you can find it in theaters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Best movie I have seen in years. A wonderful stage is set up for a battle between good vs. evil. Will the underdog, who has been kicked down his entire life, reach his goal of scoring the highest Donkey Kong score ever? Will he meet face to face and defeat the evil, pompous villain in a match of "competitive gaming?" The protagonist is built up as a normal simpleton who has not been able to achieve his goals throughout life even with all the talent that he possesses. The antagonist is portrayed wonderfully as an arrogant hypocrite who thinks that the entire video game world revolves around him. You want nothing more than to see the villain fall down.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Film about Video Games, Life, Human Nature and Determination</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just attended a screening of "The King of Kong" in which I was the only person in the entire theater. While normally I find this to be fun and unique I feel that I lost something viewing KoK alone. I wanted to gage the reactions of other patrons and make sure they were as impressed as I was with this amazing documentary. What I took from the movie, which has yet to be the subject of mass discussion due to the apparent controversies this film has caused is this: Steve Wiebe is a man who seemingly lost his "life", yet became determined to make something his own and finish it to completion. This movie is a story about a man who wants to satisfy his own desires and does so! I applaud Steve for having conviction...a rare quality in this world.P.S. In addition to the great story of a man who wants something... If you have ever played any of the Kongs, or Pac-Mans, or have ever marveled at someone else's video game ability this is the movie for you!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An outstanding film which earns a perfect score</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a great film which is well made and full of fun eighties graphics and music. It's engaging, compelling, and takes you into a world of competitive video gaming which isn't always pretty, but is all good. Although the film is rated PG-13 (for a "sexual reference" which I can't recall) I would recommend it to the whole family.SPOILERS BEGIN HERE As I have noticed there are one or two negative comments here on IMDb and I thought I'd offer my two cents here. First of it's important to realize the film is presented from a certain point of view, I would argue against anyone who says it lies, but you must acknowledge that events might be seen differently though different pairs of eyes, that's just human nature.- Billy Mitchell: The film is unapologetically presented from Steve Wiebe's point of view - it is his story after all. And although Mitchell comes off as arrogant and egotistical and a jerk at times he isn't "made out to be a villain." In fact the filmmakers offer him endless opportunities to present himself and his case and the reasons behind his actions constantly giving him more and more rope which he only uses to hang himself. It is also important to realize that one of Billy Mitchell's longtime friends, Steve Sanders, who is in the film, stands by his friend but also stands by the film. I had an opportunity to interview Mr. Sanders, who totally enjoyed the film.- The "Break-In": I've seen a comment or two talking about the "break in" and saying how if it happened the police should have been called. Steve's wife discusses the event in the film and never alleges the two men broke into her house. What she does say was they arrived when Steve wasn't home as she was leaving and her mother was the only one in the house. Since the machine, and the home for that manner, belong to Steve she asked them to wait as he was expected home shortly - which they agreed to do. Here is where POV comes into play again, the men talked their way into the house after she left and dismantled it before Steve got home. Is that a break-in? Well, I'm sure we can agree their activity was hardly 100% honest and above board.- One comment states that Billy never wanted his 1 million score to be recorded, yet the film contains a phone conversation where he asks Walter Day for the score to be submitted, despite some oddities to the video tape which were never accounted for.SPOILERS END HERE I hope that helps to explain what seems to be some issues people have with the film.Go to RazorFine Review to read my full review of the film and the interview with Steve Sanders.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I usually don't write reviews, but this film compelled me to write how great it is! Yes, Billy Mitchell is portrayed to be a jerk, but after hearing his comments and seeing his actions, there is no denying this is the case. Basically Mitchell and his video game cronies make life difficult for Steve Wiebe when it is found that Mitchell's once long standing score in Donkey Kong has been surpassed. To see Wiebe try to overcome these odds and claim the high score is an inspiring tale and not to be missed! I also have to comment about the other posters who are speaking of the supposed "break in" to investigate Wiebe's Donkey Kong machine. It is never claimed by Wiebe's wife that they broke in. Rather she told these "investigators" that she was uncomfortable with them looking at the machine while her husband wasn't home. Instead of respecting her wishes, they waited till she left and went in while Steve's mother was the only one at the household.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Real Life Almost Always Stranger Than Fiction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love these strange documentaries, where real-life people are interviewed, followed around and we get to witness yet another example of how life is often "stranger than fiction." In this case, it's video game geeks. And, man, I mean "geeks." That's the main story here, more specifically, is the quest between two of these " players" to become the top "Donkey Kong" video game champion in the world. I'll get this out front first: yes, these are real people doing their thing but a lot of this is very contrived and set up for dramatic purposes. The "good guy" is made to look even better than what he probably is, and the "villain" is made to look like the bad guy so much so it's laughable. I mean, come on, man! It's just tooooo hokey.Steve Weibe looked like the only normal human being in this film, but if you read the ending graphics, you have to ask how many "nomral family men"would be traveling all over the U.S. to set a video game record? The black-hat-and-clothes villain Billy Mitchell was a little too bad to have credibility. Yeah, he's arrogant, and I do believe he his one of those guys who lives on past glory and is deathly afraid of losing in front of a crowd. But, they (with his cooperation, of course) made him into a cartoon character in this film. It was ludicrous..The more believable parts still made me shake my head in wonder how some people are just plain nuts......and don't know it! "Nerds" is good word to describe almost all of the old arcade video-game zealots. I think the oddest one might have been the "referee," Walter Day, the bearded transcendental meditation guy. He's is the third leading "character" in this documentary. Actually, he didn't appear too wacked until the second half of the film when we saw and heard him trying to sing, among other things.And by the way, if you've ever read about guys who set multiple records in the Guiness Book Of World Records, they are, indeed, a strange lot. Notice the intense, Charles Manson-type eyes on a lot of these people; it's scary!Like other documentaries about unusual people or controversies (i.e. "My Kid Could Paint That," "Crazy Love") this will keep your interest throughout and having you rooting for the good guy, big-time, even if it is contrived. In the end, manipulated or not, we care about what happens in this story, so director Seth Gordon did his job well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just spectacular</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was lucky enough to see an unfinished version at the AFI Dallas film festival. The best thing about this movie is that you can enjoy it on any level that you want to, and it still works perfectly. If you want to root for the earnest underdog Steve Wiebe as he tries to break the Donkey Kong world record, overcome some truly pathetic human beings along the way, and step out of his own not-quite-good-enough shadows, you can do that. If you want to learn more about one of the hardest arcade games ever made, and see how players are able to crack the codes on classic games and rack up insanely high scores, you can do that. If you want to laugh at some of the social misfits of the competitive classic gaming elite, many of whom look exactly the same as they did 25 years ago, you can do that. If you want to sit back and enjoy the Uncle Rico, stuck-in-1982, puppetmaster douchebag that is Billy Mitchell, you can do that. (Seth Gordon was at our screening and I thought about asking him if he ever wanted to just blurt out, "Man, you're a loser!" at any point during their interviews.) If you want to just laugh at everyone and think to yourself, "It's fricking DONKEY KONG!", you can do that too. Or you can do all of them at once. The film is layered with so many different plots and subplots and a healthy amount of extremely low-stakes espionage and subterfuge. But importantly, it never feels like there is too much going on.This movie does everything a great documentary does. It finds a subject that you didn't know you cared about until you saw it. Its characters tell a fantastic story but the movie doesn't choose sides (in this case, one character was so incredibly unlikable that Gordon doesn't have to). And it gets lucky to capture moments that are so surprising, intense, and exhilarating that no one could possibly write them in a script. If you see this version first, you may not want to see the fictionalized version that's in the works, because there's no way it can possibly top the real thing.</fullReview>

Reminiscent of "Spellbound", this documentary deals with a subject that can be considered living on the margins of "hot documentary topics", but when you have a very talented filmmaker telling its story, you find a drama that is very human.On the surface, this documentary is about classic arcade games (focusing on Donkey Kong) and its players. But by the end of it, you will see what it means to stand up for what it's right, to stand up against your friend, to find the will to continue after what seems to be endless hurdles, and to stay decent and true when it feels like it doesn't do you anymore good - all play out in front of you in a movie about Donkey Kong.As the credits roll, you will continue to find yourself rooting fervidly for the film's protagonist, Steve Wiebe, and wish that he does find what he is looking for.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You know how there are so few great films and even fewer great documentaries other than those that make you want to shoot yourself out of self loathing for our planet or our society??? Well here is a film that is dramatic yet fun and will have you wanting more.I have never rated a film a "10" but this film certainly is a 10 in my opinion. It is as entertaining as the games depicted and quirky as the characters shown. I had never heard of Billy Mitchel before the previews of this film came out- in fact I never knew there was a video game champion of the nation- I never knew there were records kept and scores to beat other than the proverbial 9999999. I wish not to say anything about the characters or the barriers some characters in the film had to overcome because I fear I may give something away and this film is far too wonderful for me to spoil for anyone even if accidental. Let it be said that one mans quest is endearing, another mans life philosophy proves him to be shallow, void and full of cowardice and yet another is merely a sick groupie for Billy Mitchell. All I can say is that the film is worth the price of admission and concession. I have never rated a film a 10 until now and that when it comes to DVD I will buy it. PLEASE PLEASE see it for yourself!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic underdog story--a little too classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a difference in perception between people who've seen this movie, and those who haven't. Those who haven't seen it but know about it pretty much assume that it's a Darkon-like make-fun of people who take their "games" a lllliiiittttlllleee too seriously. Those who have seen it felt their air choked off as they journeyed into some of the darkest arenas of the human soul.It's actually a pretty archetypal story of a man fighting and clawing his way to the top against corporate oppression. Steve Wiebe gets it in his mind that he wants to beat the high score of Donkey Kong, held for twenty years by the nefarious Snidely Whipla--I mean, Billy Mitchell. Wiebe's a small-town guy, he's lost his job, all he wants is to make something of himself with his brains and his talents, but first he has to confront the system. The system is headed by Walter Day, who, without knowing Wiebe personally, has to essentially distrust him until Wiebe proves himself live. Wiebe does so, but is met at every corner with the terrible and devious machinations of Mitchell, who won't confront Wiebe live but does everything in his power to pull the ropes to destroy him.Okay, so this movie is a little over-exuberant. Though Billy Mitchell does show a lot of cockiness in his self-assuredness on-screen, and though it's obvious that Steve Wiebe really cared about what he was doing, I can't help but feel a strong editorial leaning in this movie to help make it more dramatic. Real life isn't quite this cut-and-dry, and though Mitchell is incredibly self-centered, I'd be willing to bet his side has something to say about this movie.However, the underdog wins, trust is regained in the world, and the man who pulled himself up against constant adversity with the straps of his boots finally gets his apotheosis. So what's not to like about a movie like that? Tell you what, I'll settle for calling it "inspired by true events".--PolarisDiB</fullReview>

		<fullReview>KING OF KONG is one of the best documentaries I've ever seen. It is brilliant. The battle between Steve Wiebe and Billy Mitchell is a classic! I would not be surprised if this film ranks on the Top 10 documentaries, twenty years from now - it's that good.After watching the trailer I instantly knew that I could not look this movie up before watching it. That was a good call. I started out watching the film with a slant liking for Billy. He was a cool guy with a superb record on Donkey Kong. But here comes this loser nerd Steve and wants to shine and break that record. I didn't think that this Steve-guy was nice, so I started to like Billy more and more.But then something happened. Billy is surrounded by this Billy Myth and all the people around him believes more of Billy than they really should. The facade seems to crack a bit, and soon Steve really proves that he is The Man.But everything isn't perfect, and the ultimate battle between Billy vs. Steve is, as I mentioned, a Classic.Filming, research, editing, music - most in this film is very very good. It's a very interesting film to watch, mostly because you really get close to these people. And it is also very nice to watch a film where you actually see GOOD people. Walter Day impressed me very much, and it seems to me that he is the real Hero of computer games. It is nice to know that Day has been there for the records, because his presence alone makes it believable.Overall, this documentary is a must for anyone who ever played a computer/video/arcade game.9 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Turns into a startlingly fascinating character study.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie proves two things: 1), a documentary really can be about anything, and 2), movies aren't always what they're about, but how they are about, as Ebert puts it. This movie begins by retracing the early video game craze of the early 80's, and it focuses on the 20 year plus record-holder of the highest score ever for 'Donkey Kong'. His name is Billy Mitchell, and he's the Michael Jackson or the Wayne Gretzky of the video gaming world. We learn of other players who helped to define the era, one who no longer plays but gives much of his time away by refereeing video game competitions. Perhaps all that would've made for an interesting doc in it's own right, but in walks Steve Wiebe, a pretty normal guy with a wife and two kids, and we learn how he got into video gaming after a handful of setbacks in his life. As it becomes clear to us that Wiebe is an amazing player in his own right, politics enter the picture and we end up with a fascinating study about the nature of people that gets beyond simple competitiveness and digs a little deeper into the psyches of how we perceive our own selves. I'm so happy to have run into this title. You don't have to be interested or know anything about video games to really care about this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed this movie as did apparently a lot of other viewers. My interest was piqued enough that I wanted to see if I could find details on why Robert Mruczek, the Twin Galaxies Head Referee, resigned shortly after the Funspot tournament (as noted in the credits). I didn't find any information on that subject but I did find that Walter Day of Twin Galaxies has put together a lot of information debunking the "facts" as portrayed in King of Kong (http://www.twingalaxies.com/forums/viewforum.php?f=86). I strongly urge viewers to read the full story before making up their minds about Twin Galaxies and Billy Mitchel.I am not in any way affiliated any of the parties involved in this movie. I'm not really even a big fan of classic arcade games. This just goes to show how interesting the movie and this controversy are.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really great quirkumentary that is entertaining enough to make you ignore the twisting done in the editing room</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there is a genre that I love when it is done well, it is the quirkumentary. The quirkumentary is a documentary but it focuses on an unusual activity that is rich with unusual little characters and the focus is often to produce an entertaining film much more than it is to inform. King of Kong appealed to me as a gamer (my favourite t-shirt is a Donkey Kong screen) but also as a lover of the genre and I was very pleased to find that, as a quirkumentary, it was one of the better ones I have seen. Part of the reason I liked it was that you could easily see this film being remade as fictional, with Will Ferrell as Mitchell, Vince Vaughn as Steve and having it be a spoof sports movie in the mould of Dodgeball. In essence this is what director Gordon has done himself with reality, is deliver a classic sports movie with an arrogant champion who has built a life off his teenage successes, an underdog trying to break the record as part of countering his teenage failures, a ruling body perhaps a little too attached to the status quo and a rivalry that has tension you could cut with a knife.It is all here and it is really well put together. The film starts by presenting the history and success of Mitchell and it does so in a way that makes him look arrogant and a bit of a t*sser ? although to be fair the bad ties, blow-dried flowing hair and definition of "having it all" don't help him refute this presentation much. Then we move to Steve Wiebe ? a "normal" guy who is unassuming and relaxed about everything but decides to shoot for the title. We see him do this, only to be rejected by the ruling body (whom we also get to see as an enthusiastic but still geeky group of men), which leads Steve to decide to compete live and prove his scores in front of a crowd and in direction competition with Mitchell if possible. So the film has a clear villain, it has a guy we can easily support, it has a showdown and it has suggestions of conspiracy, with the deck stacked up against our hero that he must overcome ? basically everything is in place and works really well. As a result it is surprisingly gripping considering it is a film about grown men playing a retro video game and you will be willing Steve on in his attempts and really feeling for him when things go against him.In the aims of fairness though, it must be noted that a lot of this is brought out in the edit and I can totally understand those involved having issues with how they have been presented. For example, Mitchell's videoed score was only formally accepted after months of review ? it was taken off the website despite having been put on it immediately, and the inspection of Steve's machine was probably not as shadowy as the film suggests. However, beyond individual feelings this didn't matter to me and actually I think Gordon deserves credit for what he managed to produce in the editing room because he has made a film better than many of the comedy sports underdog films out there ? yes it is a shame that Mitchell looks like a pr*ck to get this, but the film is gripping and fun enough to prevent you thinking about this while watching.As well as the drama the film is also surprisingly funny. In some ways the humour is painted into the characters themselves, whether it be the comic creation of "baddie" Mitchell, the couple of hangers-on that he has who treat him like a God or just the constant juxtaposition of geeky men playing games with their words and attitudes suggesting a pursuit of much more import and worthiness! This stuff runs constantly and well but there are also some great lines scattered around outside of this ? the best coming from Steve's daughter who can't understand why anyone would care about the Guinness book of records.The King of Kong seems a limited-interest film that will only appeal to geeks but this is far from the truth. In reality the film is a "real life" underdog sports comedy, with the real-life aspect making it more gripping than any similar Will Ferrell film has been. Yes, it is unfair on the individuals to twist the facts to suit the film, but it is also unfair to Gordon not to give credit to him for how well he does it and what a great little film he has produced as a result. Ignore the fact you hate video-games, this film is engaging, funny and it will have you caring deeply about the outcome more than you should. Great film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant documentary of a personality cult</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While this documentary may at first seem to be a "Trekkies" of classic video game players. it's actually a battle between two very different personalities in a very rarefied and unique crowd of people who don't just take video games seriously but even view the masters of these games as heroes and leaders.The messiah of this strange subculture is Billy Mitchell who at 17 years of age achieved fame by setting several world records at various classic arcade games just as the video game craze had peaked. As these arcade games were replaced with more advanced games, Mitchell apparently lost interest in setting new records just as people lost interest in attempting to break his old ones. His records seemed to be unbreakable. No one was more certain of that than Mitchell.When there was a sudden revival of classic arcade games in the 90's, Mitchell's nearly-forgotten records once again dazzled another generation of arcade game fanatics. Mitchell apparently had been unaware that he had ever left the public limelight and speaks to camera as if it were still 1982. Nothing about his appearance or behavior could have been changed to make him more villainous to the audience. His hair and clothes make him look like he had just stepped out of 1982 yearbook. He touts his ancient glories to the camera with sneering grins and the unblinking stare of a salesman who is trying to get you to spend a lot of money on something you don't want. His motives are completely transparent to the audience yet he's unaware of this. More disturbing, his fans are just as clueless. We realize we're seeing a personality cult straight out of a college textbook.Then enters Steve Wiebe who has built a Donkey Kong game from spare parts in his garage and clearly breaks Mitchell's "unbreakable" record on it. Wiebe's personality could not be more different than Mitchell's. He is a smiling unassuming and somewhat introverted science teacher, a good musician and has an incredibly kind and supportive wife with much smaller breasts than Mitchell's wife's. Wiebe sends in the video tape of his record breaking game to the web site who keeps track of such things assuming that he would simply be awarded the new world record.The results of this video tape could not have been anticipated by Wiebe nor anyone in the audience who is unfamiliar with the strange cult of gamers. The documentary has to unweave an odd history of rivalries, personality clashes, and bad blood going back decades to explain why this community had no choice but to claim that Wiebe's new score was a fraud. He was not part of the cult and even worse unwittingly made a connection to someone who is considered an "enemy" of this cult. For the record to stand, he must "redeem" himself by going through what can only described as an initiation ritual. Only then can he be considered someone worthy of having his name placed next to the name of Billy Mitchell.It's clear that these men are not looking at Wiebe as someone has mastered Donkey Kong. They're looking at him as a potential new hero, a new idol, a new leader for their isolated subculture. Wiebe is not interested in worship; he simply wants his record to be acknowledged. This causes dissonance to the ranks because worship was all that Mitchell ever wanted from them. As Wiebe publicly demonstrates his mastery of Donkey Kong, Mitchell is shown actively avoiding Wiebe and his new fans and having a Svengali-like power over his most dedicated fans as he plots against this new interloper.If all this sounds outrageous beyond belief then you simply must see this film. It shows how desperate some people are to be part of a community, how certain personalities can shamelessly control these people and make them say ridiculous things to the camera to show their worship and devotion, and how someone who enters the community and refuses to play by the unspoken rules can throw their make-believe world out of balance.</fullReview>

Now, I realize editorial license may have been taken, but it sure seemed like the screws were being put to Wiebe, especially when Mitchell's videotape was accepted. Did the guy who checks the videos find any discrepancies, once the original was submitted? *WAS* the original submitted? Was it my imagination that the two wives were portrayed as two different types? One seemed so wholesome, the other, well, not so much. I also found it interesting at the end when Mitchell and Sanders are sitting in the booth, and Sanders made some really nice comments about Wiebe. Mitchell says something derogatory, and Sanders is clearly uncomfortable with what Mitchell said.Thanks to this movie, my son now wants to go the Fun Spot in Weirs Beach!</fullReview>

He has to overcome adversity of the record keeping board, Twin Galaxies and their match referee and previous record holder Billy Mitchell.In a plot filled with gripping conspiracies we get to meet memorable characters including the lovable Walter Day, the founder of Twin Galaxies. This documentary draws you to a world that is strange and takes you in a ride that you will never forget. 4.5/5 P.S. discrepancies exist in the actual film, they can be ignored for a pleasurable viewing or investigated further at the Twin Galaxies website</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Didn't really know what to expect when I sat down with this but I always loved games so I thought what the hell.Most people are familiar with the game Donkey Kong, the arcade game from the 80's, and this documentary follow a world champion, he is a big hero in this bizarre little group of people, and a newcomer who try to beat him. Does it sound boring? It isn't! Some of the characters in this documentary you couldn't make up, that said, the makers of this docu does a great job editing and putting people in the standard bad guy/ good guy roles, and it works great. In between when I wasn't laughing hysterically, it was a touching/interesting/confusing journey through human behavior.This isn't just a documentary about a classic video game, it is so much more and I would recommend everyone to watch this!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The superb documentary, "King of Kong: A Fistful of Quarters" takes us to a strange and fascinating world in which otherwise reasonable, responsible adults compete to become the high scoring champions of such video arcade classics as Pac Man, Ms. Pac Man, Asteroids, and, of course, the inimitable Donkey Kong.Seth Gordon's film focus on two key players in the field, Billy Mitchell, who has held the high-scoring record for Donkey Kong since 1982, and Steve Wiebe, who, in 2005 (the time of the movie), was threatening to knock Mitchell off his throne. The movie is mainly about Wiebe's obsession with challenging Mitchell to a competition and Mitchell's dodging Wiebe's efforts at virtually every turn. Like a true king who has long enjoyed the privileges and trappings and sense of entitlement that come with royalty, Mitchell is clearly not one who will abdicate easily.At first, it seems as if the movie is going to be just another tale of quirky obsession in a niche area that the majority of us know little or nothing about. Yet, a funny happened to this movie on its way to completion. It found its own unforeseen drama in the nature of the two protagonists. When they began making their documentary, the filmmakers clearly had no intention of making one of their subjects a "hero" and the other a "villain," but, thanks to the actions of each of the men, that is exactly how things eventually turned out. For Wiebe emerges as a pretty decent guy overall, a bit obsessed with the game perhaps (as, indeed, any person bucking for the title of world champion would have to be), but a comparatively modest, hardworking family man who is treated rather shabbily by the official record keepers of the sport, Twin Galaxies (though they do tend to redeem themselves somewhat at the end). The many comments from Wiebe's supportive wife, Nicole, and others who know him, go a long way towards humanizing his character. Mitchell, on the other hand, comes across on camera as a real jerk, a conceited individual more concerned with maintaining his record than engaging in open and honest competition with a potential rival. It is this unexpected turn into insightful character study that gives the film its special added kick.Beyond its probing of obsession and competition on an individual level, the movie also lays bear the complex political dynamics that take place behind the scenes and away from the competitions themselves. We see the manipulation that goes into deciding which scores to validate and which to not, as well as the favoritism and "boys' club" mentality that favor established stars like Mitchell over upstart newcomers to the scene like Weebe. In fact, Weebe spends most of his time in the film simply trying to get some of his record scores accepted by Twin Galaxies."King of Kong" would make an impressive double feature with "Air Guitar Nation," yet another study of a fringe world filled with obsessive/compulsive players and cutthroat competition. In a year rife with impressive documentaries, "King of Kong" is clearly one of the best.</fullReview>

All the nerdyness of 'Trekkies'...all the seriousness of 'Super Size Me' and the flawless assembly of 'Roger and Me'...'Kong' is and will always be one of the best documentary films ever made. This film takes on a premise so benign and yet it's still able to capture the importance of everything that IS NOT classic video games...bringing us all together.. One of those films that is so good that half way through you kinda picture the way that you would love it to end... you get your hopes up and I won't say if the film lives up to those hopes.... only that I don't give out 10 stars to just anything. When the credits rolled I stood and threw my hands in the air like I had just won a state championship... a shoe in for my yearly top ten ..for now, it's right up top...just like a high score in Donkey Kong.

		<shortDescription>Interesting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many have praised this documentary and I agree it's an interesting watch. It's a look into people who are determined to do one simple thing better than others. Very refreshing after all the self serving pathos that is usually passed as a documentary film.The King of Kong is mainly about a guy who once got a high score in Donkey Kong (or "donk" as it's known on the streets) and another guy who challenges him with a new high score. The holder of the record, Billy Mitchell, is depicted as a bad character and the contender, Steve Wiebe is the good guy. There seems to be a bias against the less viewer accessible people, be it intentional or not. While Mitchell is an elusive character by nature, the camera mostly following Wiebe makes him look even more suspicious.The whole culture of retro gaming (playing video games considered obsolete by those who feed all the money to the industry, i.e. kids) is slightly introduced, mainly by using characters such as a video game referee, a geriatric lady playing Q*Bert and so on. The film doesn't explain everything about the featured games to the audience - which is a big plus considering the audience mostly consists of video game fans who have done their homework and of those viewers who are interested about the inner workings of the people playing the games.My only real complaint about the film is how a lot of well-known tunes were used in the soundtrack. While they were mostly period pieces (i.e. from the golden (neon pink) 1980s), the film would have benefited from music that wasn't already worn out. Even The Eye of the Tiger makes an appearance, the film being a sports film of sorts. Maybe they should have contacted some of the people making their own versions of classic video game music.I found funny about the film were some of the reviews. Apparently aiming for a better score in a video game is ridiculous and in sports it's not ridiculous at all. Even when they have to check the gender of an athlete. Or, that the reviewer didn't find video games interesting enough as the subject - even though as I hope to have explained well enough: it's not about the games.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderfully spirited, heartfelt documentary...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Shaun Munro's Reviews (ShaunMunro.co.uk):Seth Gordon's "The King of Kong" assumes a stance rarely adopted by the mass media in relation to computer games - one that, rather than vilify it, attempts to glorify the activity and the persons who partake in it. A gamer myself, I find it to be a refreshing turn, and as an exploratory piece into the world of old-school, coin-op gaming, as well as what can be characterised as "Rocky for geeks", this is an immensely enjoyable documentary.From the opening moments of this glorious documentary, gaming is discussed as though it's a sport, and it may seem to veer on the plain of facetiousness, but I assure you, there's nothing tongue-in-cheek about the people we meet in this film, as endearing and amusing as they are. Whilst, as they attest themselves, their attempts to break the Donkey Kong world record are in no way comparable to, for example, a Triathlon, the participants are equally as dedicated, probably spending as much time perfecting their craft as these athletes, and get just as frustrated when they don't achieve their goals.Whilst I cannot deny that The King of Kong in many ways reinforces the archetypal "geek" stereotype, it at least serves as a reminder that they aren't all socially inept individuals who live in their parent's basements, repelled by women. Steve Wiebe in particular (one of the forerunners in the battle for the Donkey Kong world record) is something of an everyman, a family man who usurps the stigmatic connotations associated with gamers - he was both an athlete and musician in his younger days, and now enjoys the (more than) occasional pop at Donkey Kong on his home arcade machine, as his wife and child look on.The King of Kong avoids the pitfalls that beset many specialist documentaries, in that they assume that the viewer has knowledge of the particular field. Kong, however, still manages to keep you in the loop, and quite frankly, if you've never heard of Donkey Kong, gamer or not, you're likely so far from the loop that it's the least of your problems. Nevertheless, the actual concept of the game is explained in clear and concise detail, and further still, the concept is quite basic in itself.The glue of this documentary, and by far the most entertaining and engrossing aspect, is the rivalry between the two front-runners for the Donkey Kong world record. The battle between Steve Wiebe and Billy Mitchell, the two men in question, is compared by those in this documentary to the spectacular rivalries of the mainstream sports of America, and the passion with which they make this claim, whether you agree with them or not, is admirable. This feud, which begins as something of a friendly competition, builds and builds and builds, with accusations of hacked arcade motherboards and doctored video tapes, well and truly drawing you into what is essentially nothing but a contest of "can you top this?", a war about nothing more than prestige and reputation. The technicalities and considerations postulated in attempting to oust suspected cheaters are quite remarkable, and to this effect, it wouldn't surprise me if the world record regulatory committee (a company named "Twin Galaxies) were to implement mandatory drug testing next, for shame.Gordon draws an extremely clear line, perhaps too clear, in relation to who we should root for and who we should revile in this competition - we see glimpses of Wiebe's family frequently, and he is driven to tears by his frustration in attempting to break this record. Billy Mitchell, however, is only ever shown to be a smouldering, perhaps calculating individual, with his wife only shown in brief, and as the head of a burgeoning hot sauce business, there are obvious acerbic connotations with "bigwigs" such as that. If you read interviews on discussion boards and articles on the Twin Galaxies website, you are likely to think very differently of Mitchell than this documentary attests, but the dichotomy of a villain and a hero made this film all the more enthralling, and it's not as though Gordon was manipulating a social or political issue, so I'll let him off.Through all of the passive-aggressive attacks on one another, with all of the supposedly modified devices and doctored videos aside, the superbly telegraphed build-up leads to what is quite literally the war to settle the score. By the competition's end, I felt a wide variety of emotions - sympathy and happiness being the most prevalent two. Some of the film's greatest moments are the contemplative, thoughtful ones, such as where we're treated to quick glimpses of Wiebe playing the piano, and when Gordon examines the personal torments of these competitors, these individuals who are so driven to win. Furthermore, Joe Esposito's classic "You're The Best" pumping along with these gamers exhibiting an inhuman level of dexterity is truly emotionally engaging, and oddly enough, quite inspiring to watch.Clocking in at under 80 minutes, The King of Kong doesn't keep you for a second too long, and in this short running time, manages to explain why games aren't "just games" to these people, and whether or not you find them caricatures of the stereotypes that some of them attempt to avoid, their determination and heart for this activity is truly inspiring. This is their Olympics, and they'll be damned if anyone's going to take it away from them. The conclusion to this tale caused me to smile, but the documentary is unfortunately already dated by a competition that took place recently. Still, this is hardly the fault of the filmmakers, and not only as a gamer, but as a film lover, I hold this documentary in high regard, as not merely a documentary, but a wonderfully inspiring piece that stands among the great documentaries of our time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Loved it - but then discovered that it was completely fabricated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the kind of documentary that makes me really dislike the entire medium. I tell you, I hate to say that, because when I was watching it, it seemed like an amazing movie. I love the picture of the competitive video gaming subculture, and it tells a compelling story about a lovable, meek fellow battling against a debonair villain and an evil empire. This was the only documentary ever to bring a tear to my eye (well, okay, let's not count ones about the holocaust and other such horrors). The problem is, I found out the day after, the underdog story was completely fabricated. Seth Gordon manipulates facts and events ridiculously. I suspected that there might be some manipulation while watching it, but Gordon is really inventing a fictional story involving real people. Which must suck for some of the people, especially video game champion Billy Mitchell, whom the film makes look like an utter jerk. Some of his meanness might have been real, for all I know, but with all the stuff I now know Gordon did to make him look worse, you can't trust the movie whatsoever. The real story isn't bad, and if Gordon had stuck to the facts and not tried to create a gamer version of Pumping Iron (which at least never made any pretenses about not being phony), it wouldn't have irked me so much. The depiction of the subculture and the detail into which the film explores Donkey Kong still make it worthwhile.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unexpectedly thrilling documentary on an unlikely subject</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two men face off for the Donkey Kong world record. That doesn't sound like the subject matter of a thoroughly engrossing documentary, to be sure. But thanks to a clear good-vs-evil narrative, a cast of fascinating players and some terrific editing, "The King of Kong" is undoubtedly the most watchable (not to mention rewatchable) documentary I've ever seen. The world record for arguably the most difficult arcade game in existence belongs to (as of this doc's filming) Billy Mitchell. Mitchell has been a superstar in the world of competitive gaming for many years; and thanks to this film, he's now known to us non-gamers, as well. Armed with his lustrous mullet and neverending stream of motivational bromides, Mitchell moves with alpha-male swagger, an unlikely center of adulation among the rather geeky crowd of competitive gamers. Enter Steve Wiebe, a family man from Washington state who accepts the challenge of besting Mitchell and claiming the ultimate record. Wiebe possesses in himself a near-OCD need to succeed, albeit without all of the bumper-sticker philosophizing. Standing between the two is Walter Day, acting as referee in the battle for supremacy. Day is the figurehead of Twin Galaxies, the foremost record- keeper in arcade gaming. It is essentially the story of the newcomer vs. the grizzled veteran, with Wiebe's record-breaking videotape submission being denied (out of suspicion of cheating) by Twin Galaxies in favor of performing live in a sanctioned arcade. It's here where we see the film's cast of oddities really come to life, from nerdish Mitchell devotees to downright conspiratorial backroom dealings. Everyone here elicits a reaction, whether it's jeering or just pitying some schmoe who devotes his every free minute to playing video games. But it's Wiebe's central underdog story that keeps the film dramatic and interesting. We go through the journey with him, from triumph to heartache, from rationalizing to getting back on that horse for another go. It's a deeply personal story, and it's one that many of us can relate to. What's impressive about "The King of Kong" is that it's a highly-entertaining movie about a niche subject; but the way in which the movie approaches that material makes it accessible to the rest of us who don't play Donkey Kong. That Seth Gordon and Co. are able to make us care about (some of) these people and get fired up is remarkable, indeed. And it's a movie I can't get enough of.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fascinating movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Who would have thought a documentary about a bunch of geeks who are trying to beat old school video game records , would be so interesting?Back in the 80's games like Space Invaders , PacMan and Donkey Kong were all the rage. You could play them in arcades and pubs alike and they were state of the art technology. This film revolves around a group of very strange people who seem to have forgotten that it's the 21'st century and are stuck in a time warp , still trying to beat highest scores on arcade machines that were set back in the early 80's.This story revolve around two people in particular. Billy Mitchell , the world record holder of Donkey Kong. A man who is so slimy and unlikable that he makes you want to vomit , yet is held in high esteem by the video game nerds and Steve Wiebe , a family man who despite being genuine nice guy and the best player of Donkey Kong ever , has obstacles put in his way to stop him getting the world record.This is a great little documentary. I've never been in to playing video games myself , even when i was young , yet i loved this film just for highlighting how nasty ( and nerdy ) some people can even though they don't realise it.Recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As good as a documentary gets</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>King of Kong is a simple enough story, and if you're confused why the matter of who's the best at some obsolete arcade game would make interesting movie material, it's totally understandable.However, the characters we encounter in the world of arcade games is nothing short of hilarious. The main guy, Steve, is a likable everyman who seems plucked out of some Hollywood family movie. His manners and even looks reminds me of Mike from the cult show MST3K. Pitted against him is the overlord of all things arcade, the absurdly confident and self-centered Billy Mitchell. Holder of several world records he set in the 80's, Mitchell is the perfect bad guy, and he gives the movie a big boost. Funnily enough, he also looks like a less-attractive Tom Cruise.Technically, the storyline is perfectly set up. There's a great buildup, suspense, drama, music, and a good finish. It really works as a feel-good movie, and even if you have no interest in or knowledge of arcade games, you will recognize the age-old story of a man trying to prove himself against the authority. So enjoy the crazy, larger-than-life geekery in the unexpected little gem.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The best documentaries open up a world that didn't exist to you before you watched. The King of Kong did exactly that for me. I had no idea there was a group of people who religously guarded the their records--for the highest score on the video game Donkey Kong. What's even more fascinating is how driven these people are! Our hero, Steve Wiebe, is the Rocky Balboa to Billy Mitchell's Apollo Creed. (The Rocky theme music even makes an appearance during a key scene.) The filmmakers carefully follow the obsession of these professional gamers. What will they do to prove themselves? Are they above manipulation and deceit to keep their reputation? It makes for riveting drama.My one complaint is that after watching the movie, I did a little bit of googling to find out more about the subjects. Apparently, the filmmakers may have left out key details and interactions to amp up the tension (and to present a certain angle) in the movie. This isn't necessary and is disingenuous to the viewer. Regardless, this documentary is compelling.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was amazing, I saw it four months back, saw it again today, its just great. There is not much story, or revelation(like the moore films), but somehow you love the characters, they are real and exciting. Steve is a true champ, doesn't matter if it is any great sport, or donkey kong, the spirit of winning is the same. Billy mitchell is projected as a cocky guy, but I did some research, apparently he is not, and some of the facts in the documentary are not correct, around the relationship of steve and billy. A must see for all documentary buffs, and sports fans.The best part of the movie is the pace and originality of it. Although Steve takes the record in 2006, billy I checked has won it back and rivalry goes on, which is even more exciting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An imaginative and magical little documentary about a video game</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The premise seemed interesting enough to me, being a video game fan, and it came highly recommended so I sat down to watch it. The film is definitely not your run of the mill documentary and you won't learn any life changing lessons from watching it. In fact when it started out I felt like it was moving very slowly, the people in the film didn't seem all that interesting and I was desperately curious as to how they were going to drag this out for an hour and a half. Then twenty minutes in I found myself sitting on the edge of my seat watching this documentary keenly. Then forty minutes in to the film and I'm practically on my feet cheering for this underdog of a guy who never gets a break and is suddenly finding himself ready to take a world record...in the old arcade classic Donkey Kong. The film is brilliantly made...Michael Moore would be proud because film maker Seth Gordon, who really has no huge claims to fame, paints this out like a battle of the ages. It has a hero, a very distinguishable villain, supporting cast and all set against a very nerdy background. You won't believe how incredibly stereotypical these gamer nerds look with the exception of the main hero of the film.Steve Wiebe is the hero. We meet his family, we get his background and we get to see him working towards this goal. I don't know if director Gordon knows him or just really likes him but they definitely set him up as the underdog and as someone with rather poor luck so you root for him instantly. On the flip side of that coin you have the absolutely evil looking Billy Mitchell who is painted as a complete ass. Maybe he is I don't know but certainly this film doesn't help. Everything he says and does makes you despise him as a person and as an adversary of sorts to Wiebe.Whether you like retro arcade games or not the film will draw you in and just really put you on the forefront of this insanely popular hobby that is bordering on sport to these people. It's really just a close character study of these two men and their greatest hobby and what they are best at. Anyone can watch this movie and get hooked on it. It's a rare gem and something you wouldn't instinctively look for or pick up even but I recommend it when you're tired of all the other stuff out there and want something totally off the wall. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The video game world comes alive as a slew of people traverse it, through the eighties up to today. What's great about it is: that it creates that raw eighties energy from back in the eighties, (that same great energy I realized I miss so much), and, it actually tells an epic, even Shakespearean story of success, struggle, surprise, relative failure, camaraderie, companionship, and heroism. The only thing that I would have done different is blew it up in the opening scene(s), and not begin the film with Billy Mitchell interviewing at Burger king. Like a phantasmagoric video game montage to open the film with, don't you think? The great thing about it is, the film actually has a compelling story to tell. Wiebe is a fantastic gamesman, a polymath, and a great guy. It's interesting to see him fight through his illusions, and finally come out on top. The story anchor's just as much with Mitchell not showing up for the head to head competition. He is a neat guy too, but he has been champion, and famous, for so long, that not only is he not willing to risk defeat, he can't do it. His ego won't let him. That's fantastic. That's Shakespearean. It would have been tremendous if he accepted Steve as a formidable opponent and been gracious about it, but he can't do it. He does, however, concede in a wonderful way when he says at the end of the film, again, that "You have to keep doing it on game day, otherwise it doesn't mean anything." So, in his own way, the only way he can, he calls Wiebe a champion. Billy Mitchell is awesome. Steve Wiebe is awesome. The referee, Walter Day is awesome. This film is awesome. The music is awesome.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to admit that I don't understand what makes these people so driven to conquer this game and go down in the history books for being so great at it. It was casual curiosity that made me watch this. But I was surprised by how interested I became. Billy Mitchell is the reigning Donkey Kong champion, and classic video game legend, and Steve Wiebe has been chasing the record. You may not understand the obsession but you find yourself enthralled in the drama and rooting for these guys (well, one of them anyway). As the documentary goes along there develops a good guy and a bad guy. There is the drama of the taint of cheating and the possibility of conspiracies and the emotions of a lifetime of striving and falling just short so many times. There is a cast of quirky supporting characters on one side or the other, some conflicted and some just interested observers but all woven into the surprisingly complex and intense world of competitive gaming.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Billy Mitchell set the Donkey Kong record back in the 80s that stood for almost 20 years. Walter Day founded Twin Galaxies which keeps track of the world records of the old original arcade games. Billy is a cocky skilled gamesman who is part of the Twin Galaxies establishment. Steve Wiebe is the newcomer from Redmond, Washington. He is a regular slob struggling to reach the top of anything. It's a game of back and forth as records are challenged and personalities clash.The movie starts off as a David and Goliath competition. Billy Mitchell is such a fascinating character. I don't think he's a hated cartoon. Instead he's a real human being with real ego and real fears. Steve is more of the classic quiet nerd. But the movie takes unexpected turns and brings weird personalities like the crazy nemesis, the sycophant, and the rest of the nerds. It shows that no matter what the competition or the stakes, the emotional drama remains the same.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Game Over! King of Kong is King of video games documentaries!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the Rocky of old school video games tournaments! A great watch! Directed by Seth Gordon, the movie was originally supposed to be a documentary about competitive gaming in general. It wasn't until the film was well into production, that the crew discovered the events surrounding Steve Wiebe and Billy Mitchell in the Donkey Kong high score tournament. Seeing how tense it was becoming. They decided to re-focus the film entirely on this rivalry. This largely accounts for the amount of coverage the film gives to minor players, such as the elderly Q-Bert champion, and other champions in several parts of the film that has nothing to do with the same plot. Those scenes serves as filler space. Without spoiling too much. Most of the movie follows the struggles of Steve Wiebe in his attempt to become the leader of the world high score of the popular 1980s arcade game Donkey Kong. Good at many things, but never number one in anything, the movie follows this underdog of a person, as he takes on, the reigning champion of the time, Billy Mitchell. The movie portray them in different light, as Steve Wiebe is portray as new comer normal family man, who just happen to come across, this sub-culture looking for a challenge. We're learning through him. Billy Mitchell took a more villainous role due to his arrogant and egotistical nature. I have to say, meeting Billy Mitchell in person. He isn't as annoying as he is in the film and really friendly. Still, he's a bit cocky. I believe Brian Kuh was portray in a negative light as well, and makes him look like Mitchell's lackey, than Mitchell's friend. Every shot of him was taken out of context. The film also makes Walter Day &amp; Twin Galaxies look bad, as the film makes them look a bit biased. I do find the movie, a fascinating reel character study. Most of those depicted in the documentary are not film accurately. It should never be taken as real. For example, Wiebe and Mitchell were, and still are, on friendlier terms than is suggested in the film. Also, no mention of Tim Sczerby's scoring from 2000 that broke Billy Mitchell's record. Instead, the movie plays it off that Wiebe is after Mitchell's score. Also no mention of plastic surgeon Hank Chien who broke the record during the filming of the documentary and after. As of this writing, he's the current champion. I do like how they do show the history of Walter Day and the Twin Galaxies high score on arcade games board, because it shows why these people take the scoring seriously. The reason why the documentary works is because all the people on the film, while are die-hard arcade fans, they not made out to be losers. You see that some of them are very successful in other part of their life. Even if video games isn't your cup of tea, you see that these people are just as driven as the rest of society. They just want to be champion of Donkey Kong. You feel for Steve Wiebe after all the sh*t, he had to deal with before entering the Funspot Arcade in Laconia, New Hampshire for the showdown. You feel for him when things don't go his way after it. You admire his mentality. The movie could had been made to play off of how awkward these people might be, but the film was made with respect and heart. I like how the documentary doesn't need narrating to tell the story, but rather allow the art of editing, to do it. Indeed, the fictionalized account is more entertaining. It does bug me a bit, that it's less a documentary, and more script-based reality show, here. I know a scripted film adaptation is in the works since this film was really popular, but I would rather see a sequel to this documentary, then a fake movie. I really hope Director Seth Gordon doesn't make a fake remake in the future. Instead, I would rather have the sequel tells how the story of the King of Kong changed both men's lives, as well show their continuing rivalry. I have to say, this is a must-watch on DVD as it has lots of special features. The first commentary has the director and producer talking about the movie and telling what inspired them to make the movie, how certain scenes were shot and so on. The second commentary has nobody that work on the production, so it's pretty awful and pointless. For a 79 minutes movie, it was entertaining as hell. If you like this movie, watch 2007's Chasing Ghosts: Beyond the Arcade. Overall: The film is full of gripping twisting of reality, but you can't help loving the film for it. A great watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice guy underdog takes them all on</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie started a little slowly for me, perhaps because I've never really played arcade games. It was only about halfway in that I found myself really caring what happened, essentially because the challenger, Steve Wiebe, emerges as a really nice, sincere guy and I found myself wanting him to win.To me, most of the other characters seemed clearly to be rooting for the champion, Billy Mitchell, even willing Wiebe to fail. I thought it was telling, for example, the way Brian Kuh seemed basically to try to distract Wiebe as he was approaching the record. Another scene that comes to mind was when the challenger and another guy show up at Mitchell's restaurant. The others are all there. They hadn't invited Wiebe and from their comments, they had plainly decided to exclude him from their clique.They talked about how mental strength was essential, but no one played mind games on their friend, the champion. They talked about how you had to prove yourself in public rather than just on video at home, but it seemed that requirement only applied to the challenger.Some reviewers have suggested all of this reveals how competitive the whole thing was, but to me, a group of the characters just came across as somewhat petty and mean spirited.Mitchell was the worst of all. Whereas at the beginning, he seemed quite likable, the impression of arrogance and entitlement he increasingly gave off as the documentary went on became quite unattractive.It's impossible to say whether all of this reflects the reality of what went on, or if the narrative emerged primarily out of the way the footage was edited. Whatever the truth, I found myself siding with Wiebe, agreeing with his comments that he wasn't being allowed to compete on a level playing field.The way the film builds the viewer's support for the underdog challenger is effective. There are moments of suspense and drama. Most notably, I found myself engaged in and caring about a documentary on a topic I have little knowledge of and virtually no interest in. In my eyes, that's an achievement.So why not more than seven stars? Just an attempt to avoid hyperbole. I see a lot of ten-star reviews on this page. This is a good documentary, not a great one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great manipulative documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In one, very important aspect, The King of Kong is a truly great documentary film; it manages to address a subject that would seem silly to most viewers at first - that of competitive (to the point of obsessive) classic-video gaming - and make them care about it. The film doesn't, like some other documentaries, look at the situation from afar while subtly mocking the subjects for their weird obsession; it steps into their world and makes the viewer, at least for the duration of the film, care as much as them about who holds the world record in Donkey Kong. That's an impressive feat and it places The King of Kong firmly in the same league as the finest master documentarist Errol Morris has to offer.The story told in The King of Kong is simplistic and manipulative, and what it all boils down to is the flawless underdog and the big, sleazy, corrupt fat-cats. It's a simple and timeless story that's been told many times before and as such it's satisfying to watch, but a lot of it is clearly down to manipulative editing that allows for 'good guys' and 'bad guys' to exist. That's the only real flaw I could find with the film, though; because while this trite and simple story takes place, we get some real insight into the world of competitive gaming and what makes these people tick, and that's enough to make for a truly fascinating document.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Utterly fascinating documentary focusing on efforts of a world class Donkey Kong player to get recognition for his accomplishment. Now, you always have to say in these things, what was the point of view of the film maker? I've learned that lesson enough from the contrived PBS &amp; other evolution "documentaries". One of two things is going on here - the film maker got entranced with the idea of the film and took Steve Wiebe's side once he got into it, or the film maker did this film intending to make his antagonist, Billy Mitchell (once legendary video gamer and one strange dude) the villain. There's no way to tell. As it is, Wiebe sets the all-time live Donkey Kong score only to get upstaged by a tape with a higher score from Mitchell. Billy, supposedly an advocate of live competition, is quoted talking up live and head-to-head competition. All you need to know is the gaming world schedules a face-to-face showdown 10 miles from Billy and he fails to show, leaving Wiebe to take the Donkey Kong crown and the video gaming officials with egg on their face. It's hard to figure Mitchell's side on this, but the fact that you care about any of this means the movie works. From Google it appears that the Donkey Kong crown has since moved around, with Wiebe showing the expected class. Excellent job.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better Than Actually Playing The Donkey Kong Arcade Game</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The King of Kong: A Fist Full of Quarters is a unique and compelling documentary set in the competitive world of Donkey Kong gaming. Directed by Seth Gordon (Horrible Bosses, Modern Family) the film follows underdog Steve Wiebe as he attempts to break the world record for highest score on Nintendo's 1981 arcade classic. However, the peculiar record holder, Billy Mitchell, is ready to undermine his new rival at every turn, manipulating nerds and ducking numerous open challenges to determine who is the best.As with any good documentary, King of Kong explores a weird and wonderful world unlike anything seen before. Here, achieving high scores on retro arcade machines is the top priority, and swarms of nerds compete against each other for respect. The polar combination of Wiebe (pronounced Wee Bee ? don't get it wrong), a quiet and clean-cut science teacher with a young family, and Mitchell, the paranoid hot-sauce mogul who looks like a magician, makes for a very entertaining watch, and at only 90 minutes, the film flies by.Aside from the novel plot, assured direction, and excellent editing, the movie is abound with memorable characters that will stick in your head for weeks. Director Gordon and his crew capture scenes of espionage ? geek style, candid moments of conversation, and of course, Walter Day, the aged gaming referee and founder of Twin Galaxies, an organization to monitor major arcade records. Recorded over several months gives the movie a tangible sense of development, and we come to know the two leads quite well during this period. It is hard not to feel sympathy for the obsessive Wiebe, whose family must endure his need to overcome this enormous challenge. Similarly, it is hard not to despise the cowardly Mitchell who avoids the much-wanted head-to-head and later steals Wiebe's thunder with a dubious video. As far as light documentaries go, The King of Kong: A Fist Full of Quarters is up there with the best. Full of interesting characters and nail-biting scenes, this is a surprising film that teases your every emotion without ever losing its playful heart.</fullReview>

It turns into the good versus evil David versus Goliath with the hero and the villain which may not be completely accurate but i do feel that this was necessary to allow us to relate to the film and so poetic license was used and should be forgiven for the sake of our entertainment.

		<fullReview>Here is a mildly diverting excursion into the insular world of competitive Donkey Kong.Billy Mitchell holds a title won back in the Eighties and is so insecure about giving it up that he refuses to accept Steve Wiebe's challenges to compete in such public venues as Funspot in New Hampshire.The subject of this documentary is the central characters -- the rather icy, big-haired Mitchell; nice-guy, puppy dog Wiebe, and the somewhat tedious, self-styled umpire of this domain, Walter Day.There are a bunch of other personalities populating this realm, all talking about the stakes involved. Except for a lovely female octogenarian interested in another arcade game, I couldn't keep any of these characters straight. They're all given way too much screen time.There's an element of sadness in all of this. Wiebe seems more fortunate than Mitchell in that he has a young family (Mitchell's family consists of a buxom wife). As young as his children are, though, they both seem to question his fixation on what seems like a very monotonous game. Wiebe's uncomplaining wife seems to draw only passing attention from her spouse.I found out about this movie in "50 Documentaries to See Before You Die," but I don't quite get why it was so honored. I AM happy to have found out about Funspot, though; I think my two boys would love a visit to this iconic arcade.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a forty year old male, I admit to spending part of my youth frequenting dingy arcades. I remember Donkey Kong and remember it being almost impossible to survive more than 3 or 4 levels. After watching this I revisited the game via MAME (Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator). It really was impossible. Therefore, the level of obsession required by the protagonists in this movie makes it even more mind boggling. These guys must have played 4/5 hours a day for decades. The fact that they take it so seriously leaves you open mouthed. Billy Mitchell is simply my favourite movie villain of all time. Yes, I include works of fiction, big budget sci-fi stuff....this man will have you shouting 'Boooo'! and then feeling ashamed that you really care who wins.Despite the seemingly weak subject matter this documentary will have you laughing out loud, open mouthed with amazement at grown men behaving this way and suddenly getting roped in yourself and cheering on the good guy.Fantastic stuff. Just like a Rocky movie with inane subject matter and incredible characters. Oh...and it's for real.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fanaticalaboutfilms Review: The King Of Kong- A Fistful Of Quarters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This appealed to me on two levels. First off I was drawn in by the old school arcade games but secondly and more importantly this movie has a great story to tell that does go so much deeper than video games. This film is about 2 men as they fight for the right for the top score on Donkey Kong. Just thought I'd mention this now but you DO NOT have to be a fan of or even care about video games to enjoy this movie.Billy Mitchell is the prodigal child- the shining icon of the sport, I dare not say hobby in fear of offending any fanatical arcade enthusiasts who might be reading. Back in the early 1980's he held the high score records for Donkey Kong, Donkey Kong Jr, BurgerTime?!? and was the first person ever to achieve a perfect score on Pac-Man. In 1999 he was proclaimed the Video Game Player of the Century so he knows what he is doing and isn't modest about it. There was a point in the movie when he told the film crew to guess what his three character high score name was and I was a little surprised when I found out it wasn't 'GOD' although his answer is nearly as good.Steve Wiebe, the unknown contender, comes across as a very down to earth and amicable chap in his quest for the high score crown. Life has dealt Steve an unfair hand as despite being extremely talented in sports, music and work he became injured, never found his big break and was laid off as a Boeing engineer (he now works as a school teacher). So your already siding with Steve and this only becomes stronger when you get to know Billy and the hostile network he builds up around Steve to try and discredit his high scores.During the movie you can't help but smirk with the seriousness that they take their arcade games but then again you have to respect them for being able to achieve these scores that you and I are never going to even come close to achieving.It was especially well produced and I liked the way in which there seemed to be minimal involvement from the documentary makers. If they did ask any questions then it was edited out and it make the whole story seem less contrived. Although there were interviews during the movie, it felt as if a film crew had just pitched up and were following everyone around rather than being intrusive. No doubt there has been some editing to alter the story but every movie does this.I wasn't exactly sure what to expect when I put this on but I really got into it as the makers create suspense, anticipation and drama out of something that really shouldn't have made that much of an impact on me. After all it is essentially about a video game but you, like me, will find yourself rooting for Steve in this emotional roller coaster. It's not only an exceptional documentary but a exceptional movie as well! For further reviews feel free to check out: http://www.fanaticalaboutfilms.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A doc that pulls the mask off the ugly face of competition</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everyone knows that one family member or friend who hates to lose. Whether its chess in a competitive setting or Go Fish with a bunch of kids, that person tries their hardest every time. "The King of Kong" unveils the extremes of competitive time-wasting in a way you didn't even know was possible and offers complete proof of the war-hungry spirit that some possess more than others.When we see that mentality in a pro athlete, we admire it; many know that Michael Jordan was the best in the game because he had that fire and drive to be the best. But when it comes to racking up high scores on Donkey Kong -- you start to wonder. Seth Gordon's documentary puts that into perspective quite well in addition to capturing some unique and quirky subjects who make for compelling characters."King of Kong" establishes quickly that Billy Mitchell set the Donkey Kong record in 1982 and became the Tiger Woods of arcade gaming. Around that time, LIFE magazine had put together a spread of the then-world record holders, which helped popularize the past time and lend credence to Twin Galaxies, a small group that was establishing itself as the official record keeper/verifier of game scores.Enter Steve Wiebe, a Washington native who as his family tells us, was so great at so many things but could claim the ultimate in any of his endeavors. Without shame, Gordon paints Wiebe as an underdog (with mad hand-eye coordination) whom you feel obligated to root for on his way to breaking Billy's record. Billy Mitchell's conditioned long hair, weird ties and general cockiness rub off more and more as the film goes on. I'm sure he's not that awful of a person, but Gordon plays up the tension between these two vying world record holders, even if their actions justify it.The controversy stems from Twin Galaxies disputing and disqualifying Wiebe's video- recorded record-breaking score due to bad blood between TG and Roy Schildt, the man who helped Wiebe replace his Donkey Kong Jr. hardware. Truth is, the only reason they knew about that was because they intruded on Wiebe's property and examined his Donkey Kong Jr. game out of disbelief that someone not in their "fraternity of arcade guys" (whose poster boy is Billy Mitchell) could have beaten the score.When Wiebe goes out to Funspot, an arcade where Twin Galaxies founder Walter Day holds a live tournament every year for arcade games, he hopes breaking the record live will clear his name, but then we meet the whole cast of characters who worship Billy and start to realize how sad some of this is and how normal and well-meaning Steve is despite his competitive nature. When Steve breaks the record only to find Billy sent a video of an even higher score to Funspot, the drama really cooks.An underrated part of Gordon's filmmaking that deserves a quick mention is how he uses seemingly irrelevant parts of the doc that simply show Steve's life to enhance the telling of the intense game-related moments. Steve's hobby of piano becomes the soundtrack, for example, of his final attempts to beat Billy's record. It's a nice touch that makes the documentary feel more organic.In the end, how on Earth these two simply couldn't come together for some friendly competition blows my mind. The only time Steve and Billy are seen together is when Steve's playing at a tournament and Billy comes in and walks around solely to put the pressure on Steve. Doesn't say hi or anything. It's sickening, but it's what makes "King of Kong" a powerful documentary that regardless of exaggerations, reveals the dark heart of our competitive nature.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The King of Kong: A Fistful of Quarters is a 2007 American documentary film that follows Steve Wiebe as he tries to take the world high score for the arcade game Donkey Kong from reigning champion Billy Mitchell. This film is counterintuitive examination of the competitive gaming world. You may think computer games like the classic arcade centipede of Donkey Kong has been resigned to the 80s along with Betamax and Dolph Lundgren. Your wrong, there is a group of ageing man who wouldn't look out of place in a clandestine paedophile ring still playing and competing as we speak. The film follows Steve Wiebe a genuinely kind hearted soul who as failed at most things in his life to the bewilderment of his wife, who always thought big things, would happen to him. His friends states that he has exceptional, bordering on the autistic hand eye coordination. So the obvious path to take is, buy a classic video games machine and queue the rocky training montage. This documentary really comes into its own when you learn about the lengths and tactics the record holder and "gaming legend" Billy Mitchell goes into preserving his record. I am talking dirty tactics that would make Nixon blush. Bill Mitchell is one of the greatest characters I have ever seen on a documentary. He is pure gold as self conceited megalomaniacal man child who as devoted horde of fellow game nerds whom carry out his evil bidding at their masters whim.This film is like a microcosm of how politics is evident in every section of society whether it's your work place or local gaming club. It shows how power corrupts and how fame can delude people into grandeur. It's packed with fascinating character and genuine touching moments. On face value this just seems like another quirky character study but it goes much further, highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shockingly Good Movie About Shockingly Bad People</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really wasn't expecting to see a well put together film when I started watching The King of Kong. I was more interested in the subject matter. This film is put together very well and definitely keeps the viewer hooked. But, that isn't the interesting part of the movie.I was shocked by some of the people in this movie. And by that I mean I was shocked by how terrible they were as people. I'm mostly referring to Billy Mitchell. Seeing this "man" walk around with his Donna Price haircut and silly ties acting like he is God's answer to all the suffering that has been laid down upon mankind is at the very least, incredibly revolting. Its shocking that this man is looked up to as a role model by some sects of society. What is even more disturbing is how he and the people at Twin Galaxies did not accept a perfectly valid score from Steve Wiebe. It seems like there was a conspiracy to make it seem as though Billy Mitchell was the greatest Kong player, even though he clearly wasn't. Its also really pathetic seeing how Billy Mitchell is afraid to compete with Steve in any way throughout the movie; disgraceful.The Twin Galaxies group comes off as a very corrupt group when watching the movie. It really seems as though they are a tight nit group of individuals that aren't interesting in competitive gaming, but in protecting their own. You can see Billy Mitchell's followers trying to trip Steve up and be extremely vindictive when he achieves the live record on the Kong machine.But, by far the most revolting character in the movie is the guy who is in charge of testing whether scores are fraudulent. This man comes off as pedophile, homosexual, violent, slightly retarded sociopath. Its sick seeing him view Steve Wiebe's Kong tape. Its almost voyeuristic when you see this guy watching the tape. Added on to that the fact that he sneaks into his house when he's away and falsely claims his machine was tampered with, is really disgraceful.So I guess if you are in the mood for a horror movie of sorts, check out some of the ghouls in this movie. I guarantee you will at least get goose pimples from it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Documentary Film Ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are a fan of the 80s and with playing video game machines where the real games are. Then this is a film for you. As it shows Billy Mitchell, a self-proclaimed video game king that has the records and also a pretty wealthy so-called hot sauce king. Verses Steve Wiebe, laid off of a major airlines and just got his masters in order to teach at a middle school. Vie for the video game records "Donkey Kong." While Billy sends in tapes and gets accepted. Steve does the same but doesn't get accepted and Billy sends in two people to see if Steve cheated on the records, which he didn't. As someone gave him the boards as he couldn't afford to buy the board himself. You will see how this person who bought him the boards, and Billy dislike one another.Steve is looked upon as the villain while Billy is looked upon as the media darling. But that doesn't deter Steve it seems that much.While Steve again doesn't get the record, he has to go to Funspot. Where we meet also, a bunch of video game junkies playing in the annual, Funspot competition that takes place once a year in the summer. As they also have a story or two, to tell. How they got into video games and still are hooked on them. Including an woman in her 80s, who loves Q-Bert! It shows both men's families, mainly Steve's family and how they have to put up with traveling with them in order for the men to achieve those records. Will Billy finally go head to head against Steve, face to face? Will Steve win back his records? Will Steve win back his dignity not just in the video games. But in real life.Not into documentaries films. But this one was great. As it shows how you love video games. The 80s and the styles as a kid myself, growing up in that era. Plus, how family and life are far more important than those. Funny, full of humor, as well as full of life! This is a film you have to see. Even if you don't like documentaries!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The King Of Kong is one of the best documentaries I've ever seen. I might be a bit biased since I'm a long time video gamer but even a non- video gamer would find this one to be utterly interesting.Steve Wiebe, a then unemployed schoolteacher, decides to try and break arcade ace Billy Mitchell's long-standing score at Donkey Kong. He does so and that begins his rocky road to getting a bunch of gaming nerds to recognize him for his efforts.It's amazing to see Billy Mitchell (who comes off as the Brad Pitt of video gaming) using his smarmy charm and stroke to control the nerds who kowtow him when it comes to his beloved Donkey Kong record. All Steve Wiebe wants is recognition for his prowess at Donkey Kong; he doesn't really want to join Walter Day and his merry nerds. However, we see Billy Mitchell (who doesn't play a single game in the film) continually belittle Wiebe, talk about how great he is and use BS tactics to keep Wiebe away from his record. The Twin Galaxy nerds want to accept Steve but they are so under Billy the Egotist's thumb that they can't lest they lose their biggest "star". It's sad to see people simply let one guy walk all over them and think they deserve to be respected.We see a group of people fighting over something so trivial as a video game score record and it's a shock. That something so insignificant is taken so seriously will surprise many people.This is one documentary worth seeing just to see some real hardcore video gamers trading barbs and talking big. These guys didn't stop after the filming. Billy, Steve and a few others are still trying to be The King Of Kong as we speak.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Steve Wiebe: Current Kong Champion (and more)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Steve Wiebe retook the top score in Donkey Kong on September 20, 2010 with a score of 1,064,500."Before we talk about Steve Wiebe holding the current title, let's talk about something almost as important: the fact that in the documentary 'King Of Kong' the relationship between Billy Mitchell and Brian Kuh is perhaps ONE INCH shy of being the non-parody-real-life version of 'East Bound And Down's Kenny Powers / Stevie Janowski. Overt mullet: check. American flag tie: check. Florida: check. Dweeb sidekick who'd apparently take a bullet for his dubiously-moral idol: check. It's been said that the film was constructed to portray the "beef" between Steve Wiebe and Billy Mitchell as more tense that it really was However: unless Billy Mitchell was specifically instructed to act vain, slippery, and uptight throughout the filming (HIGHLY unlikely / impossible) then we did get at least a snapshot of his Actual Persona - and likewise Steve Wiebe: bets are that warmth of his nature can't be faked.Of course none of that really matters - or does it? (it does and here's why) If I followed this documentary clearly: Steve Wiebe's videotaped high score was rejected (and his garage / game machine invaded by Billy Mitchell's crew) yet Billy Mitchell continued (continues?) to submit videos documenting his top scores.. This has been brought up more than once here but: HOW IS THIS NOT ADDRESSED by the Twin Galaxies people? The "authority" Walter Day seems to take such pride in seems completely biased which in itself is unsettling but given the fact that he also represents (or represented) the Guinness Book Of World Records.. seems like downright Dirty Politics in action.Near the end of the documentary said Twin Galaxies offers Steve Wiebe an apology letter of sorts though it's as non-self-incriminating as it is specific in terms of what they (or he: Walter Day) is apologizing For. Correct me if I'm mistaken but this is an admission of favoritism / bias towards Billy Mitchell which would be absolutely fine UNLESS this is the recognized Official Score Keepers for video games.. (sigh) Steve Wiebe owning the current title feels like very good news and it's hard not to get a warm "the nice guy wins" feeling because of it. Of course I expect the Donkey Kong title will trade hands back and forth and side to side but one thing is more Permanent than any Kong Title (in my opinion) and that is: no matter how many achievements one makes it does not justify dead-eyed-greed or American flag ties worn in non-irony.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>King of Kong is a documentary about setting the world record for the classic Donkey Kong game from the 1980s. It begins with the story of Billy Mitchell, who set the world record for Donkey Kong back in 1982. It explains where he went from there, which included starting his own restaurant chain, and how he felt about owning the title of Donkey Kong champion. Basically he is a guy who is very well off and respects his title and admittedly flaunts it. Then we introduce the no-name suburban dad, Steve Wiebe, who in 2003 beats Billy Mitchell's score and sends it to Twin Galaxies arcade, the cream of the crop arcade for all avid retro gamers. From here a duel ensues against Billy and Steve that is captivating and very exciting to watch unfold. The documentary is filmed as it happens, as opposed to a record of the events after they occur. This makes for an extremely fun story that will always keep you wanting more. An array of players are introduced into this serious world of gaming that are each interesting in their own way.There is a certain something that is captivating to me about documentaries. It is possibly because they are about real things and real people, allowing the viewer to connect to characters on a different level. King of Kong had me interested the entire time. The feud between Billy Mitchell and Steve Wiebe is very unconventional and will make you side with one way more than the other. As the story progresses we see the vast differences between these two people and how that plays in to their immersion in video games. I will say that some of the people interviewed in this film take immersion to the next level. There are some people in this intense world of gaming that are so unbelievable that you can't help but crack up at the things they say and the lengths they go to, for the integrity of the gaming competition. Every element of King of Kong is so wonderfully executed and it creates for such an entertaining ordeal in such a different kind of element.Where this documentary truly amazes is towards the end, when it becomes not so much about the video games, but more about personal integrity, hypocrisy, and living up to your beliefs. I highly commend this movie for exploring truly emotional topics that caught me by surprise as to how deep and human they really were, even in such a different realm of human interaction. King of Kong is a fantastic documentary that will captivate and amuse all at the same time. It has its own quirky style that works so well and on so many levels. Definitely check this one out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a weird, interesting film that I'm surprised was even made. It seems like a simple process, get the world record, media hovers over it for a while, then it passes. But this could almost be a full length behind the scenes feature on a Guinness World Records DVD if one was to be put out. But the film's main focus is on a little arcade time killer called Donkey Kong, one of the most successful video games in the 1980's. The film is similar to a movie that came out around this release called Chasing Ghosts: Beyond the Arcade. The only difference is that one explores "The Golden Age of Gaming" more than a competition.The film follows video game world champion, Billy Mitchell who had world records on games Donkey Kong and Centipede. He even went to level 255 on Pac-Man with one life. The 256th level of Pac-Man has an infamous "kill screen" which is half scrambled text which is believed to be the game codes. So it declares Pac-Man unbeatable, there's no end.Steve Wiebe seems like a regular guy, he's laid off and finds solace with an old arcade machine of the classic Donkey Kong. He researches high scores of the game and discovers Billy Mitchell's 874,300 record score. He figures he could beat the score, and embarks on a challenge that will change his life.Some people will find this movie sad and question how much of no life's these guys are. I found these people cool and I find it extremely interesting. I love learning about old 80's arcade games and try to research and find as much as possible out about the games. I knew Billy Mitchell held the record for most #1 high scores, but I didn't know him and Wiebe were in steady competition. I must admit I was siding with Mitchell for most of the film, but went to Wiebe by mid-film because of his ambition and focus on the game, though Mitchell was a very clever man.The current record holder for "highest score in Donkey Kong" is a plastic surgeon named Hank Chien who scored 1,061,700. He was inspired by this film and was crowned on February 26, 2010. No surprise some random unknown person decided to take the challenge of beating one of the all time greatest gamers. Surprisingly he seceded though. So for a movie that has a 97% "Certified Fresh" rating on Rotten Tomatoes I couldn't help but see the film for myself. Truly an inspiring and remarkable film about two men striving to be the best, to get beat by someone unknown.Staring: Steve Wiebe, Walter Day, and Billy Mitchell. Directed by: Seth Gordon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As entertainment, King of Kong is quite good, portraying a strange insular world of video game fanatics and a good vs. evil story of a scrappy newcomer fighting to win the record from its sleazy holder.But as a documentary, it is quite possible that almost everything in it has been twisted in pretzels to fabricate a story.After I saw the documentary I looked in up on wikipedia, where I saw some fairly shocking claims regarding what the movie altered and left out. I went to the Twin Galaxies website and read more.Of course, since Twin Galaxies and Billy Mitchell (I found an interview with him in AV Club) are portrayed negatively in the movie there's a possibility that they aren't telling the truth, but since some of the most important claims would be common knowledge within the classic arcade gaming community, they would ruin their reputation by lying, and be instantly refuted, so I have to lean towards believing them.This is quite frustrating. The movie is entertaining. And it is fascinating to see how seriously people take this tiny little world. But if what Twin Galaxies claims is true, then I was totally mislead on what was going on, and I basically can't trust a single thing in the movie.Documentaries, in my opinion, should strive to tell the truth more than to tell a good story. King of Kong tells a good story, but its relationship to the truth is highly suspect.</fullReview>

Camp BM even went to Steve's house to dissect his machine and check the electronics - they obviously know that altering the board is a possibility. There are enough nerds in camp BM to be familiar with a logic programmer.Random plays on the same hardware is the only fair way to verify these scores but even that can be hacked to an unfair advantage.Also, the tape submitted by Steve was likely used by Camp BM as an instructional video. It was not fair that Steve's tape could be made accessible to BM.I think the modern day BM is incredulous - although I believe his 198? achievements.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In life there are winners and there are losers. Whether it's in love, war, politics, sports or a simple game of cards, some people either play their strengths appropriately or come out on the lucky side of the dice as history's leading figures. For Billy Mitchell, arcade video-game extraordinaire for the better part of two decades, life thus far has been a series of events only proving his excellence. Believing himself to be as close to perfection as you can imagine, Billy holds his world records with video games in particularly high esteem?the crown jewel being a score on classic game Donkey Kong of which nobody has even come close to beating out since he set it back in the early eighties. After soul-crushing defeat after defeat however, the stage is set for underdog Steve Wiebe to challenge the throne; to storm the gates of the Mitchell and Twin Galaxy Empire; to dodge barrel after barrel and overcome the odds in order to finally come out on top and receive just one segment in a page of history for himself.This is the story of The King of Kong. Presented as a documentary, director Seth Gordon sets out to document the rise of one legend as he attempts to crush that of another. It's the classic fable of a man coming from nowhere to challenge the powers that be even when darkness surrounds and hope is all but lost. Indeed, in this regard The King of Kong takes on a structure and narrative more akin to Star Wars than your typical documentary and with this territory comes positive and negative elements. On the one hand, Gordon achieves what so little works of this nature do in that it informs and documents a polarising, esoteric subject without ever burdening the viewer with tedious exposition. So take someone who has very little previous investment in the world of video games whatsoever and you can be sure they'll be engrossed by this tug of war that transpires here regardless. As Wiebe concedes late into the film, the events slowly become less and less about Donkey Kong or video games, and more about that climb to the top?whether it's a mountain or a body of water, or in this case, platforms, barrels and lifts?and the struggle to get there.However, despite the movie's uncanny ability to strike emotion through its story and get you on the edge of your seat (this might be a little too subjective, but it isn't hard to see others being in the same position), there is a definite lack of integrity to Gordon's feature here that seems dubious. For all intents and purposes, the entire proceedings of The King of Kong are more than likely extremely close to the actual events that took place back in 2005, but the way in which Gordon brings this across too often undermines this sense of realism. For every turn that The King of Kong takes towards delivering that final epic climax from Star Wars, more distance is gathered from leaving viewers with that sense of conviction and reality that is necessary to drawing the line between fiction and documentary.Nevertheless, while this is certainly true, there is still no denying the entertainment value inherent to Gordon's feature here that is very hard to refute. As much as the numerous manipulations go against the better nature of The King of Kong's story of determination, truth and perseverance in the face of adversity, there's still a lot of fun to be had in cheering on for underdog Steve as he tries valiantly to overcome the utter douchebag that is arrogant and insufferably pompous Billy Mitchell?or at least, that's how Gordon wants him and his gang of goons to be seen. All dubious assertions aside, The King of Kong is an engrossing look into the realm of competitive gaming and most importantly the heart and soul of one man that attempts to take the realm by storm. It's uplifting and does enough to keep itself from becoming a tired niche movie for niche crowds?this is the cinematic documentary, lightsabers alluded to but not included.- A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A fantastic documentary about the unlikely subject of competitive Donkey Kong champions. Bill Mitchell, a brash self promoter, deceptive and cunning and Steve Weibe a trusting, honest, family man searching for a way in life battle for the honour of being called the greatest Donkey Kong player of all time. The gaming officialdom Twin Galaxies fathered by Walter Day, a man who has given his life to transcendental meditation, has been lured by the dark charisma of Bill Mitchell to favour Bill's past exploits over the honest efforts of unknown upstart Steve Weibe. As fantastic, humorous, charming and heartening a story you are ever likely to find.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I understand that this is a 'real' documentary, but I think that with one or two degrees of difference, this would make a tremendous satire. The concept that grown men would be so obsessed with something so inane is in itself, one for the record books. And, the clothing styles and haircuts on the cast- not in the scenes from decades ago- but in 2006 are beyond description. This truly seemed to be 'A Mighty Wind' for 80's video-game addicts. And, the 'villain' of the piece, Billy Mitchell, acted like a character in a Kurasowa film. I loved the film, but many times because of the inherent absurdity of the material, I thought that "all the volume control numbers went to eleven". However, this in no way prevented me from enjoying the movie--just had me kinda shaking my head.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...well, that's the overall feeling i had when the credits rolled at the end of the movie. I absolutely loved this movie because it was the weirdest cast of characters i could ever have hoped to watch in their natural environment. Excluding Mr. Weibe, everyone in this movie qualifies as a borderline psychopath.Didn't that guy who's the referee and creator of Twin Galaxies say he doesn't even make money on this? he does it all as a volunteer...? Oof, Anyway, i've seen a couple of comments citing how inspirational this film is, and i'm actually inclined to agree. I couldn't help but feel obligated to hate and detest that long-haired, wing sauce pedaling, donkey turd (Billy Mitchell). What a pompous coward. His little lackey (Steven Kuh) narrating the scene in that New Hampshire arcade,("everyone's watching your video billy, all eyes are on your video billy, there's no distraction in the world that could make people turn away from this billy...")made me want to throw up. Everyone associated with this Billy Mitchell defended and revered his actions, both past and present. Listening to his interviews and "life lessons" for the cameras on what makes a true champion, only led to the clear cut assessment of him being a hypocritical, non-sensical, douche bag of unparalleled magnitude.i'm sorry, i'm actually very passionate about how awful that guy is.Obviously, for me, this movie is so great because it hooked me and kept my undivided attention the whole way through. This movie demands an emotional investment from its audience. I picked it up without having heard anything about it before, it turns out that it's more than just a collaboration of nerds playing arcade games. It really is a great story with a better ending.Weibe has such a different background than all the other Donkies in this movie. He actually made love to a woman, something i've yet to believe achievable from the other cast of characters. So with his family's frustration and disinterest towards him continuing his donkey Kong pursuit (farther than just beating the record in his garage), he goes out into the world to conquer this record live and in person. All the elements of Weibe's life/character made him one of the most likable underdogs ever...I wrote a few too many insulting things in this comment, and that's not the point of reviewing a movie...maybe you can take all that to heart and give this movie a try. I think we've all known a few people (thoughout the entirety of our lives) who remind us of these characters, maybe the relatability is the biggest/most welcomed surprise...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie couldn't have been better if it had been scripted by the worlds top writers, cast with the most insightful and skilled actors, and made with a budget of millions to perfectly capture the feel and look of what actually happened for real. so many moments in this film couldn't have been staged better if you knew they were going to happen. The scene where Steve first sees billy in the flesh is a perfect example. The name of the movie itself. Chance is obviously completely in their favour.Maybe its that I'm a reformed arcade nerd who spent large parts of my teens battling silly games (highest score on crystal castles where the score is not reset when the power goes off, why do I care about that some decades after the event?) so I 'got' the context but there was more, much more going on to this movie than insider knowledge. There was a hero, bold and true, his enemy, not without his charm and detail, the wannabe contender, the overlord, man it had all the components of a movie epic, but it was all true and playing out before our eyes.I'm in awe. Seth, a story expertly told, everybody - brilliant job,</fullReview>

In this continuation it convinces the viewer of facts (an essential of documentary film making) without manipulating any truths. It is very obvious that this film isn't about the obtainment of recognition but the obtainment of the status as a decent human being reguardless of race region or other factors. This modern interpretation of an old story helps to expose a major unhealthy force in western culture (the undeserved hero vs a role model we can all hope to be). Fail multiple time then successed or at least in your own understanding become the person you always hoped to be. Be decent the benefits will begin to show.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I heard great things about this movie and it managed to live up to all of the hype. The only reason I do not rank it higher is because I always like to see certain things from a documentary and this documentary did not inform me on any level. I watch documentaries to inform me and not for enjoyment. I do enjoy them and this was possibly the most enjoyable documentary I have ever seen, but it was not one of the best documentaries I have seen. I loved all of characters for what they were and the fact that they were real made it even more enjoyable. There was the perfect bad guy who was part of the establishment, even if that establishment was only 7 guys with too much time on their hands. Steve Wiebe will go down as one my favorite movie characters of all time and it is because you cannot imagine a nice guy in the world. The fact that he played some of the music for the soundtrack was amazing and added so much more to the movie. The daughter in the car was the best moment of the movie and I think that defined the movie. It was the ultimate let's cheer for the good guy and hate the bad guy movie and it was made better that it was over a video game. I like when documentaries do not put spins on things and no matter how you spun things you cannot make Steve look like a bad guy or make Bill look like any less of a a-hole. Plus Brian Kuh could not look any more pathetic. I loved the movie and would recommend it to anyone and was a surprise find of the year for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As someone who played video games throughout my childhood, I was intrigued by this documentary. When I finished it, I was not disappointed. This seemed like I was watching a movie with a cast straight out of a Star Trek convention. I was waiting for William Shatner to make a cameo...but that didn't happen (of course). Some of the characters have made video gaming their whole life and the protagonist/featured player (Steve) appears as though he's totally out of his element and "trying to beat this empire" that would love to see him fail. You get to a point where you are pulling for this formerly unemployed teacher to pull it off and succeed. It's a good quick watch. A very good movie even for those who aren't video game fans and don't live in your parent's basements.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A story about 'born loser' Steve Wiebe attempting to best well known and popular Billy Mitchell by beating his world record holding top Donkey Kong score is strangely compelling and extremely watchable. 'Strangely' only for the fact that what seems on the surface as a niche film that one would think would only be of interest to hardcore old school gamers, can, and indeed does, hold interest to anyone. Everyone loves a good underdog story and this movie delivers that in spades with all the hurdles that poor Wiebe has to go through. One can't help but root for him, even if the film is a bit manipulative in evoking said feelings from the viewer. The only gripe I had with the film is that the ending felt a tad anti-climatic. However that's only a minor quibble in an excellent documentary.My Grade: A-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As with many films of this nature, the winner of the competition takes a backseat...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie will surprise anyone *expecting* a film about socially-starved geeks toiling over something no one else cares about. While some are found, the film ends up being-- as one other commenter pointed out-- much more Shakespearean than that. I could care less about the video game world but for the 80 minutes I watched/watch this film, I care quite a bit about the people in this movie.First off, I do not feel this film vilifies Billy Mitchell, holder of the Donkey Kong high score record for over 20 years. Instead, it brilliantly depicts he and record-chaser Steve Wiebe as two men each battling insecurity. As the film starts, Mitchell is completely in control of his insecurity (his then-well-hidden fear that his last record will fall) while Wiebe is completely flummoxed by his (despite being so well-accomplished, he was never "the best" at anything).As the film plays out, Mitchell's insecurity gradually increases as he sees that Wiebe is a genuine threat. Meanwhile, Wiebe starts meek (he has to be talked into pursuing the issue by friends and Mitchell's enemies). But the more Wiebe pursues it, the more he begins to see himself for the true competitor he is. I won't spoil the film in terms of who gets the record but the big story is: Wiebe gains more piece of mind from showing up for live competition than he does from having his record in a book.I also recommend watching for more subtle moments that might elude the casual viewer. These moments reveal how even if/as/when Mitchell holds the record, he loses small amounts of respect from his allies, who comprise the inner circle of the gaming world. Even as they pledge their allegiance to him, there are little quotes and gestures of admiration to Steve that demonstrate their recognition that their friend is becoming more cowardly. One of my fave moments is a quick and subtle moment when Mitchell leaves Wiebe sitting playing games and Mitchell's (seemingly) trophy wife glances at Steve for an ever-so-brief second. It seems that even she realizes that it is Steve and not her husband that is proving himself the competitor regardless of who holds the record.The film does contain those other gestures that make the audience want to root for Steve (his rapport with his family and friends, his 'aw shucks' demeanour and what position is more honourable than that of a teacher?). However, Billy is shown to have positive traits as well-- he is a top notch businessman and motivator. His words of encouragement to an 80+ year old woman pursuing the Q-Bert record show his more positive energy. It's just his misfortune that this film mostly captures an emotionally fragile state in his life. The film (and this is a credit to director Seth Gordon) actually plays with you in this way: while part of you wants Steve to break the record to shut Billy up, another part of you wants Billy to show up for the mano-a-mano so that he can overcome his own insecurity and just have a good honest competition.The most entertaining competitions, whether it be the Olympics, football, chess, etc. usually tell human stories to make them transcend their otherwise meaningless or unimportant qualities. For 80 minutes, Seth Gordon helps the video game world do just that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a well made Documentary about a mans attempt to break the world record score of the classic arcade game, Donkey Kong. That man is Steve Wiebe of Washington who is a nice, honest, family man who always felt he fell short in life in a few ways. The current record holder is Billy Mitchell of Hollywood, Florida, who rose to fame in the 80's by becoming a master at Donkey Kong. The camera's follow him as he is today and his arrogance practically drips off the screen. He brags how a true champion of any game or sport can only really prove himself in a live situation in front of others yet he dodges chances to play at tournaments all the time. One such tournament is one right there in Hollywood, Florida where Steve Wiebe was planning on taking on the record. I won't tell you the outcome but will tell you that even if you were never interested in video games you might just like this film, but of course, you'll like it even more as a fan of classic arcade games. Good Stuff!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two Amazing Gamers and one Fantastic Documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, it's been a long-ass time since I've felt so strongly for a person in a film. Actually it was for Bob Flanagan in his documentary: SICK: The Life and Death of Bob Flanagan, Supermasochist. That movie made me seriously feel for the main personality, and just like for Bob, I felt a similar emotion for Steve Weibe, our hero in The King of Kong. The two are completely different characters and enact two different types of emotional reaction, but both share a very important aspects: they were both unique and genuine people. So, if you're looking for a documentary or a film that delivers some serious emotion and human drama, look no further.The King of Kong is about the story of Steve Weibe and Billy Mitchell. Both are incredibly talented classic video-game players. Billy first exploded onto the scene way back when, solidifying himself as the only really hardcore and amazing Donkey Kong player. He's also godly at Pac-Man and a bunch of others. Years later a man named Steve Weibe, crashed onto the scene and made his name as a remarkable Donkey Kong player. The King of Kong follows these two men through their lives and their quest to become/maintain legend as being the best of the best at the classic video game Donkey Kong.Steve Weibe is you're good guy in the film and Billy Mitchell becomes your bad guy. I say "become" because when the movie started you're not against him in any way. He was a weird looking kid who managed to neglect his greasy look and instead used his uber-confidence and strong will to become the first champion of DKong. But Billy does eventually become the baddie. Not because he's a truly evil person, but mostly because he's being compared to Steve. Steve is without a doubt, in my mind, a genuine, caring person, who seems to only give off good vibes and intentions. A family man to a T. On the other hand, Billy through his unwavering confidence and serious out-look on life, molds a very business-like and even political type personality. With Steve seriously focused on his goal of beating Billy's score, and Billy just kind of hoping and sitting back, seeming like he doesn't care that much to compete again, the movie easily chooses sides. Billy would consistently speak in the third person, "BillY Mitchell always has a plan.", and he slicks his hair back in a manner of "holier-than-thou" attitude. Hell, he even bought his wife gigantic fake breasts. The man truly has developed a good life for himself. It's no shame to let the score die away. But Billy still has a competitive gaming side, but one that doesn't step up to the plate like he used to during his real gaming days. He's also serious in his approach to Donkey Kong...perhaps too serious. Through his own characteristics, he becomes the "bad guy" of this film. When in reality he's not really a bad guy, but just a less than perfect person when compared to Steve Weibe, who truly seems like he's doing the right things in life. Being a nice guy is where it's at in the big scheme of things, and Steve is the definition of a nice guy.The King of Kong is a fantastic documentary. But not without it's faults. The movie does not completely share every bit of truth. Scenes where you're led to believe one thing based on the movie are very inaccurate and if you do a little research (look at the TwinGalaxies forum) you'll easily see that Billy isn't the bad guy you're led to believe he is. He still remains the "baddie", but you'll come to see that he's not the complete, narcissistic jerk you're led to believe he is.It sheds light on two completely different men who share an undying thirst to be the best Donkey Kong player in history. One is more family oriented, and the other, slightly more professional in nature.Nevertheless the two are both unique and both entertaining. Don't look any further if you have a love for games and fantastic film, this delivers on all accounts. And if anyone reading this is a Donkey Kong player. Good luck, you're gonna need it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reality is what you make it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sophists may condescend to argue that 'there are two sides to every story' and deny that there are social realities that may be found if we have the time to look hard enough. There is a human tendency to 'root for the underdog' and to see those established in their power as 'evil' for doing whatever they need to do to maintain it. I would like to call to the readers attention the underlying theme: weak vs. strong on a playing field that is not only unlevel but one in which chance plays a greater role that is at first obvious. I would like to describe the film as one that portrays the illusion of justice that many people find it necessary to maintain, as the Darwinian reality that we inhabit can otherwise be too harsh. King of Kong (KoK) is A documentary, one of many that could have been made, though one in which the under dog wins out. There are many similar stories out there in which various permutations in the essential twists and turns of the plot worked out differently (not unnecessarily about a Donkey Kong battle). These stories may or may not have had documentaries made about them. If Steve hadn't have won, would the documentary have been made? Stories about the under dog who almost wins are not the sort of 'escape' that people are willing to part with their money to be exposed to. Market forces dictate that GENERALLY we see more stories about the winner who almost lost. Some times the weak do win (look at VHS vs. Betamax) due to better off field strengths. But in KoK, the person with weaker off field strengths and stronger in game skills HAPPENS to win out. It could easily have been different. So there is a big element of 'choice of story' rather than 'choice of edit' that is at play here.By chance Steve and Billy were both born with genes and to environments that allowed them to get to where they are today. So, to the specious reasoners, the word-smiths, lawyer types, PR types and all their sidekicks out there writing reviews on this film, remember, you can fool some of the people all of the time, all of the people all of the time, but not all of the people all of the time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most moving documentary I've seen all year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"SiCKO" and "No End In Sight" were both well-made documentaries that have been released in 2007. The first was rather emotionally driven, as usual with Michael Moore's movies, the latter was purely based on facts and well-researched. Both had the best intentions and touched topics of great social importance and conflict (the health system in the U.S. and the invasion of Iraque, respectively). Both pointed out great suffering that was due to political grievances. Still, neither of those documentaries moved me as much as "The King Of Kong" did, a movie about a guy trying to beat the high score world record at "Donkey Kong". What does that tell you about me? Or rather, what does it tell you about "The King Of Kong"? The story of Steve Wiebe who tries to become the new "Donkey Kong"-world champion is rather laughable at first. As he breaks the record again and again, though, and none of his accomplishments are acknowledged by the snobbish (and completely nerdy) gamer community, we start to care about this, too. As Wiebe himself put it, it's really not about "Donkey Kong" anymore.Having said that, I have no idea how manipulative "The King Of Kong" really is. Wiebe's adversary Billy Mitchell and all his disciples are clearly the bad guys here. If they are portrayed the way they really are, then, Jesus Christ, these are the most sorry people this side of "World Of Warcraft". The fun thing, though, is that you become just like one of them as you root for Wiebe to finally break Mitchell's questionable high score in public. You get all emotional and feel for the movie's hero and it isn't an accident that director Seth Gordon uses "The Eye Of The Tiger" and other sports drama-montage songs more than once. This really feels like "Rocky "in the end.So, if you want to find your inner video game nerd, go see "The King Of Kong". Just promise yourself you'll leave it all behind as soon as the credits roll.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Sad Reflection of Gamers and Competition Overall</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, I'll have to admit that I possess a long-lived love for videogames, and witnessing the opening minutes of the film felt like it carried an anti-gamer agenda behind it. Gladly, the story dramatically focused on a tense rivalry instead. The documentary ultimately delivered due to its utterly compelling narrative that's intelligently told in documentary form. It's quite rare for a documentary to hook you into its characters and more personal matters instead of solely concentrating on educational purposes. With this work, we gather fairly crucial themes that deal with the act of insecurity, the harmful effects of envy in relationships and whatnot, etc. but we also begin rooting for certain characters as the gripping true story progresses. Throughout its plot, we delve into various characters' lives to learn more about them- their personality, circumstances, upbringing, and the like- which cleverly builds up to a finale that sees properly developed characters face off and address the situation, leaving some saddened and others excited. It's truly amazing to experience a real-life occurrence from which a protagonist emerges and a bitter "villain" to oppose him as if it was yet another fictional tale. Adjacent to popular belief, the editing is what differentiates a poorly- made documentary from a good one, and The King of Kong represents the terrific technicality and precision that comes with editing in documentaries as evident by masterfully executed matching-on-action cuts and numerous other instances of cuts that convincingly travel through time/history whilst effectively conveying the elapsing of time in coherent accordance with the story it's trying to tell. In addition, the editing is utilized in rhythmic fashion as it moves along correspondingly with the frenetic, classic music at play. For instance, the drumming sequence- accelerating in its editing techniques, soundtrack's pace, and character's motions- proves just how excellently the film produces these quickly-paced editing segments, which continually retains the movie's intrigue for the audience. Moreover, the evidence is almost always present whenever the characters within are discussing the matter, exhibited by a scene where the player is barely/slightly hit by an enemy in the game- the footage was accurately recorded whether it's actual or staged. With all that being said, it's definitely frustrating to see the gaming community in such competitive uproar over who the best player is and who the loser is. There's a lack of respect for gamers when it comes to the general population and this verification of immature conduct services the people's skepticism. Steve Wiebe minds to himself and walks with a sense of humility, and it ends up paying off when he shocks the active players as he obtains the highest score in Donkey Kong. Everyone else entails unsporting attitude, and though The King of Kong primarily, or likely, centers on more universal thematic material as to attract the broader movie-going public, the unfortunate enmity of these passionate gamers remains prevalent to this day. Overall, The King of Kong accomplishes what the best documentaries do: ensuring it entertains while explaining a shocking or significant event and encrusting it with relevant thematic substance, hoping the audience leaves it with a sense of moral obligation or a need to change for the better, and this reflection of a cruel group certainly makes me feel the duty to do so.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The King of Kong is a documentary-style film about a continuing modern-day subculture of a subculture: Arcade gaming wars. The game: Donkey Kong. The characters: a long-time record holder for the highest score on Donkey Kong, and an up-and-comer.If you like video gaming, you might like this film. If you like or liked arcade video gaming from the 70's, 80's, and today then you'll probably get a kick out of it. If you are looking for a new area of the web to get completely obsessed with so you can avoid your own pathetic life you'll probably find some direction. If you are into conspiracy theories and fancy that most people are all out to get you then you'll get a 2-hour media meal.I mention these queries for the reader because, at one point or another in the film, I felt drawn to each of the above-named subgroups. To me, that spells, "Effective Film".There's a lot of drama (real or not)and intensity that was added by the makers of this film to make an uninteresting-to-watch subject (grown men spending hours standing in front of a casket-sized electronic trance-enhancer) into an entertaining film.Personally, I'm not the kind of guy who likes to be entertained for entertainment's sake (except when I'm playing video games), so I gave it 6 of 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was just because of its title that this 2007 Seth Gordon film, The King of Kong: A Fistful of Quarters (isn't the title one of the great ones?), gained my entire attention when it was listed in IMDb as a new release. Since then and after reading more or less about it The King of Kong became one of my most wanted films. During last year's December I saw for the very first time the South Park 2007 episode More Crap and it became immediately one of my favourite South Park episodes of all time. Why I'm mentioning this? Well, and actually while seeing that episode back in December, without having seen yet Seth Gordon's 2007 film certainly, I never had in my mind The King of Kong (why would I?) so it was a total surprise to find out, by listening to the DVD commentary of the South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone, that the main storyline of More Crap was based on The King of Kong (after hearing that fact I was like "damn, I really must check out that film"). The main storyline of More Crap is the classic story of the man that is a nobody "fighting" against the super star and everything that surround the star, in that case was Stan's dad Randy against Bono and certainly Randy was the Steve Wiebe and Bono the Billy Mitchell but Randy wasn't trying to achieve a video game world record but he was trying to? enough said, check out that awesome episode! Now, I have never played the classic Donkey Kong (the first Mario Bros video game ever) or in other words, thanks to this film I heard for the very first time about Billy Mitchell, Walter Day (and Twin Galaxies, the Gunnies bock of records ) and about everyone else in the film. But this, like others have pointed out, is not just for video games fans, at one point Wiebe says something like "I think it is not more about Donkey Kong", certainly is about getting the deserved recognition at something. But this is also for anyone since is just extremely entertaining, always great fun with the story of Twin Galaxies, the stuff about one of the hardest games ever, etc.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent documentary comedy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since 1982, Billy Mitchell who is a hot-sauce company owner in Hollywood Flordia, he's also a legendary video game wizard who has been making great scores playing "Donkey Kong" over many years even with "Centipede". However there is a 35 year old rival named Steve Wiebe is a state champion in Seattle Washington and has made a good score over the years on the classic "Donkey Kong" game. Steve is on his journey to compete with Billy in a video game competition in Hollywood Flordia to see who is the "King of Kong".Exciting, funny and fascinating documentary-comedy feature that gives the viewers glimpses of retro video games from the 80's and video game culture. This unique and brilliant movie is one of 2007's best movies as i give kudos to Seth Green who directed this movie for making this special movie that shows what video game geek life is really like and has a nice moral to the story.A must see!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What's the whole truth behind this? Who knows--but it's still a dandy documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow. This film took me a bit by surprise as I never realized people cared so much about establishing and maintaining records for best classic video game scores! In the scheme of things, this all seems rather unimportant to the average viewer--it certainly was to me. However, despite the seemingly mundane aspects of such a record, there is quite a lot to this documentary.Before discussing what the film asserts, I should point out that there is a lot of controversy about the fairness and accuracy of the film. The "bad guy" in the film (Billy Mitchell) contends that he's been terribly misrepresented as does Twin Galaxies, an organization that maintains and verifies records of these games. I have no idea who is totally right and totally wrong, though even if the documentary has a bias (which, I'm sure it does), the film is an amazing psychological study of two very strange men--Steve Wiebe and Billy Mitchell.As for Wiebe, he's portrayed as an underdog--a family man who is a nice guy and who is fighting against the combined weight of Mitchell and Twin Galaxies. However, I was stunned how Wiebe "checked out" on his family--spending all his time playing the game even when he was out of work. Even though Wiebe later seemingly broke the world record for Donkey Kong (an event comparable to curing cancer or bringing world peace according to some), it sure seemed as if Mitchell and Twin Galaxies took it very, very personally. That's because once Wiebe videotaped himself breaking the record and was told by a Twin Galavies judge that it was verified, an unusual step occurred--friends of Mitchell (the old record holder and video game god) showed up on behalf of this organization to inspect Wiebe's machine--seemingly forcing themselves into the Wiebe household like the SS. I have no idea how forceful this really was (the film makes it seem pretty nasty), but the bottom line is now they didn't want to count the record because Wiebe was associated with a rogue gamer (????). However, this is a seemingly unprecedented step AND Mitchell's records that were on tape were accepted without question--and it seemed like the film implied that Mitchell and Twin Galaxies were working together.The problem gets worse, as in response, Wiebe attends an annuals gamers event and tries to set the record in public so there would be no doubt. He succeeded, but the whole thing looked amazingly sleazy--with a Mitchell minion (Brian Kuh) watching every move Wiebe made AND talking to Mitchell across the country by phone throughout--all of which you actually get to see in the film as it's happening. The Twin Galaxies folks, too, talked to Mitchell during this record-breaking event--an odd relationship in that they extended this favor to Mitchell. Once Wiebe breaks the record in public, one of Mitchell's supporters brought out an old videotape that Mitchell made a long time ago but "forgot to send to Twin Galaxies" in which he surpasses Wiebe's new record. This seemed amazingly convenient and although the videotape was a bit fuzzy, Mitchell's new score was accepted without further review--the crowd was not allowed to watch it again and Mitchell's machine was not personally examined and taken apart. Talk about a stacked deck!! Now to me, who is the greatest Donkey Kong player is unimportant. What's fascinating is to watch Mitchell, as he APPEARS to be a rather angry man who seems to run Twin Galaxies as well as use his "posse" to do his dirty work--this is so weird. Early in the film, he talks like a nice guy and wishes others luck in surpassing his records. His actions on the film say otherwise. If this is the true picture of Mitchell, then the documentary does a great job of exposing him as well as his ultra-tight relationship with Twin Galaxies. If it isn't, then I feel sorry for him--at least to a point. Some of his actions simply seem indefensible.The film makers set out to make Wiebe the hero and underdog and in this sense, they were very successful. After reading through the internet (including the Twin web site), I STILL am not sure of the truth, though Mitchell did not acquit himself well in the film. If he's not a sore loser, the film sure painted him as one. A fascinating and compelling portrait--though I still think the whole record thing is pretty silly. After all, in the scheme of things, it all just doesn't seem that important and it is supposed to be a game!PS--One of the funnier and more pathetic parts of the film really didn't have to do with either Mitchell or Wiebe. One guy is talking about his love for Centipede and desire to set a world record because he felt it would "get him chicks"--dream on!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Battle to Be Mr. Kong</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A film that will make you ask the question: "Are there really people like this living out there in the world?" "The King of Kong" chronicles the ongoing rivalry between two celebrities of the video gaming world: nice guy Steve Wiebe (pronounced WEE-bee) and jackass Billy Mitchell, world record holder for his Donkey Kong score. Our sympathies easily lie with Wiebe, who just wants to break into the gaming competition world but who has trouble being accepted by the insular world of nerds who populate it. Mitchell is portrayed as a sad, pathetic man who has a lot of trouble finding ties to match his shirts, and who didn't get the memo that feathered hair and black jeans were last seen in 1982. He acts like holding the world record in Donkey Kong defines him as a human being, and he refuses to face off against Wiebe in public.The movie is absolutely hilarious. Part of me wants to feel bad for making fun of these guys, but the rest of me thinks that if they didn't want to be made fun of, they shouldn't have put themselves out there in the first place. And I have to admit that I admire them all in a way -- after all, they commit themselves to something that's important to them and whatever anyone thinks about it be damned.One of my favorite characters is Mr. Awesome, who makes home videos of himself dressed up as Mr. Awesome giving lessons on how to go about scoring some "poon tang." You won't believe this movie wasn't made 25 years ago.Movies like this make a fictional movie like "Waiting for Guffman" seem entirely plausible.Grade: A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What Documentaries SHOULD Be!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've never played a video game, but I totally GOT this film. Often comedy films attempt to shows geeks, nerds, and outsiders, but here you will see them in their actual environment. Funny, pathetic, and hopeless, though wildly entertaining! I only wish I could follow up on these characters, as this story is clearly not over. EVERY obsessive father should see this, as well as anyone who thinks of themselves as "geek chic". Special props should be to the filmmakers for their editing and camera work.Heroes become villains, and the films largest moments are subtle. When you hear of reality TV folks complaining of how the editing made them look, you will reminded of how naked obsessed people become when exposed to daylight. Hurrah!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>KING OF KONG - A masterpiece!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Who would have guessed that a documentary about gamers obsessed with scoring a world record at Donkey Kong would not only be roaringly funny but serve as a metaphor for the decline of Western civilization? Using Billy Mitchell's need to stay champ and Steve Wiebe's need to beat him, director Seth Gordon deftly manages to show how age, marriage, fatherhood and so-called ethical thinking will not stop man's need to go to war, no matter how stupid the reason.King of Kong is a wonderful trip down memory lane, especially for us gamers who grew up in the '80s. If you ever played the old arcade games or video console, you simply must see this movie.I have seen it over and over again :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining and Thoughtful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film takes what many believe to be a simple enjoyment into a whole other realm of competition, deception, and overall brutality found in the cult of arcade gamer life. Although this is a documentary, director Seth Gordon creates an unraveling tale that could be found in today's blockbuster hits. Steve Wiebe is categorized as the typical underdog character that the audience, and Gordon himself, can't help but root for the entire way through. Conversely, Billy Mitchell is staged as the major villain, who seems to be more of a challenge than Donkey Kong itself. The film is captivating, utilizing dramatic editing and drawn-out scenes in order to not spare the audience from the heat these men are facing. The drama stirred up by these 40- something year old men is hilarious and no more mature than a group of hyperactive middle school girls. The candid moments for not only Steve and Billy, but for all those associated with the history being made, is nothing short of comic genius. The characters are developed, explored, and engaging, struggling with more than just a competition, but on a statement of what it means to be top dog. The film is molded around a seemingly simple plot, however, the people involved and the situations they face are complex and relatable to anyone who's ever wanted to be the very best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a fascinating incursion into the world of gamers. There were all kinds of interesting characters; some just plain bizarre.What was most interesting as how people lined up to support their champion and discount any attempt to dethrone him. Any attempt was questioned, and modified as "getting a lucky break," rather than focusing on the skill of the player.I still can't get over the dude who was running around yelling about the Kill Screen coming up. That was hilarious!It was with great satisfaction that this David (Steve Wiebe) took on the establishment and beat the Goliath (Billy Mitchell). Congrats!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just watched the King of Kong.I had heard, fairly amazing things, not only from this website - but from friends. Perhaps it's just a matter of opinion, but, I simply cannot believe how painful, and boring, this entire film was. Sad, but true. So, just a brief warning - one should not necessarily believe the hype.To put a little perspective into this, and to fill out some more lines in this brief warning-message directed to the high hopes of others... ...I've been playing video games since the age of five, and have spent the last few years reviewing movies and television programming as part of my job. I struggled to finish the film, hoping it would pick up in some manner the whole way through, and ended rather disappointed by the sheer lack of entertainment value that it offered :-(</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Billy Mitchell is a FRAUD</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing the movie - there is only one conclusion : Billy Mitchell is a sad little man who is a plain fraud. To see how the myth is being maintained by people who appear to be stuck in the 80s forever is really sad. The 'role' of Twin Galaxies in this all is also a really sicking one - its sad that see adult men behave so childish just to keep something that hey created intact. Twin Gallaxies therefor is also just a bunch of sad people who can't be trusted.. protecting Billy in every move. The fact that no-one has seen Billy "there-are-certain-people-i-dont-want-to-spend-too-much-time-on" Mitchell actually do it live.. with an audience proves enough right ?Like the sad long haired (what normal healthy man blow dries his hair?) said himself - "you have to do it live with other people around you..." he just proves that he is only a memory from the past - nothing more and nothing less.Oh just one other thing - Brian Kuh - damn you are one sad nerd. Your mother must be so proud of you.. in fact I guess she tells you that every morning when she wakes you up - because surely you must be virgin who still lives @ home ! Oh well a kill screen you will maybe never see - but losing your virginnity is also something you will never experience ! Steve - you know it already - but you are the man !!

		<shortDescription>Sigh. Great movie, but be aware of the truth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm giving the movie a 9/10 out of respect for the movie's superior quality. The craftsmanship of the movie is excellent. The director really made a great movie, presented events in a dramatic and entertaining matter, and provided a good versus evil battle that is totally unexpected but welcome (for the audience) in such an obscure subject.Regardless of the quality of the movie, the director definitely distorted some facts. I saw "King of Kong" at the Seattle International Film Festival, in Steve's home town (well, that's Redmond, but it's just across the lake). In a wildly sympathetic audience, and with kids from Steve's school in the audience, one could not help but be caught up in the emotion and support toward Steve. Besides, it was a great movie and I really enjoyed watching it. However, I was uncomfortable with Seth Gordon's demonization of Billy Mitchell, and I couldn't ask him about it at the festival during the post-movie interview (I had to leave to catch another movie), so I decided to do some research later. I found plenty of clarifications on Kotaku and MTV News (where Billy Mitchell did a couple of interviews recently).- I had always heard bad things about Billy Mitchell's cockiness, but I had never heard he was a bad person. The movie makes him out to be a complete jerk, but the guy donates lots of money to charities, helps a lot of people in his local community and in the video game community, and has been a great ambassador for the video game world in general. Clearly, the movie would not have been anywhere near as good without a villain, but the movie is basically a character assassination of Billy.- Tim Sczerby was the world record holder at the time that Steve started his run, not Billy Mitchell, but he is never mentioned in the film. Maybe Seth Gordon didn't find him compelling enough to make into a villain? - The film claims that Steve's house was broken into by Brian Kuh and Perry Rodgers. But according to an interview with Billy Mitchell on MTV News, it's Seth Gordon (the director) who is distorting an unannounced visit into a "break-in". Even when you watch the movie, it's hard to believe it's a break-in when members of Weibe's family are present (and according to the MTV interview, Wiebe himself showed up later and played a game of Donkey Kong with Brian).- The board that was found at Steve's house was a "Double Donkey Kong Board", which is not an official Donkey Kong board. It has versions of both Donkey Kong and Donkey Kong Jr. on it and is not manufactured by Nintendo. Since there's a possibility of tampering on such a custom job, I can see why there would be doubt about some inconsistencies seen in the video.- The movie makes it look like Mitchell dodged confrontations with Wiebe, but they played together at Classic Gaming Expo 2004 and Mitchell beat Wiebe by around 30,000 points, according to Mitchell. Wiebe claims Mitchell didn't like the controls on that particular machine and left after 50,000 points. Regardless of who won, they did play together.- Mitchell recently beat Wiebe's record, and to erase any doubt, he went through tons of security precautions, including multiple video recordings, independent reviewers, a verification of the board by Nintendo, and more. He also donated many (all?) of the proceeds from the event to charity.- Take a look at AlphaPepper's IMDb comment for some other claims of inaccuracy.In a way, I want to see a movie about Billy Mitchell's story. After all, the guy was really good at Donkey Kong, reached the top, stopped, got a really strong challenger who beat him, and had to practice to get to the top again. If Steve's story is like Rocky, Bill's is like Rocky II! I don't think it could be a 2-hour movie, but maybe a 30-minute short... :-)</fullReview>

It shows the competitive video game world to be populated by boring, vindictive, petty, ego maniacal people, who occasionally - very occasionally - say something to make you laugh, perhaps once it is even on purpose. The reigning champion is quite possibly one of the most cringe worthy people I have ever come across, it would be much better for the world were he merely a character, not an actual member of the human race.

		<shortDescription>A definition of American celebrity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Appreciation of gaming with electronic pinball machines in fluorescent-drenched arcades and dank cellars is an acquired taste, a nerdy world of introverts and con men, dedicated to being the best at eye and hand coordination. And the apex is the game of Donkey Kong, like Pac Man an early but enduring endurance test for only the most committed, some of whom should be committed immediately.Seth Gordon's documentary about the pinnacle of Donkey Kong, peopled by the enigmatic, charismatic, and cagey Billy Mitchell (the reigning king of Kong) and challenger Steve Wiebe, a Seattle family man of normal proportions who doggedly pursues Mitchell's crown after he has lost his job at Boeing and has plenty of time in his basement to follow his dream. While Mitchell provides the romantic grist by wearing a helmet of dark hair, black clothes, and an attitude of mystery, Wiebe represents all the dorky slackers who ever wanted the top score, beyond the reasonable attainment of the goal.The documentary is best at showing how non-geeky some of the gamers are and worst at creating excitement for essentially a solitary competition with little audience participation and no discernible payoff except fame among a small group of devotees. It succeeds in showing how the zealots like Wiebe can consume valuable family time in their lonely quest and how even in this humble sport a savvy player such as Mitchell can make himself a legend by just not competing.Billy Mitchell helps define an essential ingredient of American celebrity: aloof cool. But then, he's no poseur when it comes to swinging the joystick: He's the King of Kong.</fullReview>
