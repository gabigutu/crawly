		<shortDescription>Not about race, about growing up</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not a film about race or racism. Could easily have been done with two white leads instead of black leads. It's a film about a 13 year old boy discovering sexuality and entering an adult world by way of a love interest, as well as how his father deals with this without his wife. Great acting by them both and the lead female. Subtle but not overly complex screen play. Interesting and not trying to be over emotional. Not a superb film but worth watching. I really liked the way they portrayed the father's efforts to do well by his son and manage his adherent behaviour without alienating him. Son was also not reckless but simply unaware of the world he was growing into.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Regardless of inaccurate depiction of Germany...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Really lovely film about growing up, feeling different, parenting and American vs. world culture. Spot on performances from Robinson and Christmas.It might be misogynist and construed as anti-European, but I thought of it more from Morris's perspective. He's young and confused, so why not depict the world as a hostile place. It shows Germans being strangely ignorant, fetishizing Black people and being rude, so.. this isn't a movie for Germans. ..Should have at least had the tutor be a German.. But it's a great movie about a young American.Killer soundtrack, visually on point, strong leads. My apologies to Germany, but I loved it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Coming of age, told a little different</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I do not understand why this movie is getting such a low rating when it easily deserves more.Usually when I watch a "coming of age" movie I immediately see what the outcome will be, they mostly go along the same line but with Morris from America I didn't get that. What I got was much better. Albeit some missing plot holes but nothing that hurt the over all story.The movie gives you that coming of age story without the tacky, over played scenarios. Where those movies fail, this movie excels. I never got that feeling. The feeling of a fairy tale life for lack of a better term. It's funny, nostalgic, romantic, emotional, entertaining but over all, it feels REAL.I have never seen Craig Robertson (Curtis) play this type of role and I am happy I did because he did very well, especially with a cast full of rookies. I hope to see more of this from him in the future. Markees Christmas was surprisingly good but I could not end this without saying something about Lina Keller and Carla Juri.. They both played their roles flawlessly and Keller's role was not an easy one.Definitely give this a watch, it is obviously not of the same caliber as The Breakfast Club but it does entertain. I am sure you will not be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Morris in Germany</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Morris from America is a coming of age story of a black kid growing up in Germany, what part, honestly I forgot (my German doesn't exist). The movie was great. It's a coming of age story and who doesn't like that. I liked how Morris is constantly trying to find his footing in Germany. He's angry but he still find a small glimpse of hope in his new found friend, Katrin. Katrin is what I'm guessing is a typical German teenage girl. She hates her mom, does what she isn't supposed and has a strange thing for Morris. By no means is this a love story. If anything it was a cautionary tale of what unrequited love can do to someone. All in all it was a decent move and worth the watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful coming of age movie - Morris from America!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just watched Morris from America even though it got a 5.6 on IMDb. I usually try and not watch movies below 6 as i end up getting disappointed, but Morris from America was different. It was surprisingly short and beautiful!As the title says its about the romantic and coming-of-age misadventures of a 13-year-old African-American boy who moves to Germany with his dad and tries to fit in with the other German kids. He falls for a girl at a youth club and through her own growing up pangs encourages him to open up a little and share his rapping.We've all had that one childhood crush that we fondly remember - puppy love! The director has beautifully narrated a story that captures the essence of growing up and not fitting in, our first crush and pains with our parents and their side of the story and made a pint size gem! So don't go by the rating and watch it when you have the time and want to remember that feeling of puppy love and not really fitting in!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great coming of age story and an even better fish out of water story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Morris from America is about a black kid from the states trying to survive in Germany after the death of his Mom and forced to live with his Dad who coaches football in the country.Although living with Craig Robinson as your dad was made to be a joyous experience. Mr. Robinson was a great supporting actor for this movie. He comes on the scene and shares time with this new kid in the acting scene,Markees Christmas and the chemistry of father and son between them sparks magnificently. Such a touching relationship between father and son put on camera. You could tell that from the moment these two come on the screen in the first scene and Robinson tries to convince his son that his Old School Hip Hop was the joint, It set the tone for what I knew was going to be a humorous and touching connection.The adventures of Morris from America follows Morris as he attempts to learn the language and learn the culture of Germany. It's a hard task with Morris missing his home and his mom and having to deal with the stereotypes place upon him for being an African American.In a sub plot that reminds me of Melvin Van Peoples' The Story of A Three Day Pass, Morris develops a crush on an older hot blonde whose giving him mixed signals.Lucky for him, he has the love and support from his father and his German language tutor, both looking out for his best interest.Morris From America is one of the best movies about growing up there ever was, using an extreme metaphor of a kid alone in a land of a different language to relate to all of us.http://cinemagardens.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not an accurate portrayal of German society</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The vile and demeaning review from Sven B. prompted me to write my first review at IMDb. This is in now way an accurate portrayal of German society and as a German citizen I am quite appalled that the production is apparently almost completely German-based. Talk about shooting yourself in the head :) (Mild spoilers ahead) They have chosen the most stereotypical actors you could imagine playing a 'snitching', self-absorbed female tutor, a male teacher who doesn't know the first thing about respect or empathy as well as an ultra-mean girl, who loves nothing more than to play games with people and not the good ones. She gains a little more character towards the end although it doesn't help much. If you have never been here you can really get the impression from this movie that all Germans are Nazis with a big stick up their ass. And that may be true for ignorant folks in the Sächsische Wald or elsewhere who never met a foreigner or experienced something different beyond the scope of their own village or for people who are simply nihilistic and irredeemable. But I would like to believe and I have seen it often that there are a lot of Germans out there who appreciate the togetherness of different cultures although it's yet far from the melting pot story in the US, which is also not without its problems. So I guess my point is, this movie just shows that the world is full of mean people at every corner but Germany shares this with I guess almost any place in the world by now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The ending sucks so bad.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story is okay, I liked it but the ending terribly sucked. The ending, was not even an ending... Maybe its an episode.. Haha, I don't know...The movie story gets you interested at first and at the end it gets you even more interested on whats going to happen next and THE END. It was so disappointing.Even it was an episode (tv-series) I would not look at the second part of this movie. If anyone else pays for it... Its a waste of money. I never have done a review on a movie before but I felt so bad about that wasted hour of my life I just had to do it. Im sorry for being so harsh on my first review.</fullReview>
