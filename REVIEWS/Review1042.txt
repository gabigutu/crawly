		<shortDescription>Simple and straightforward but has moments that are captivating</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Courtroom dramas are interesting and this one is a fine addition. Nothing that fancy or over- stylish, it's basically very straightforward and has a simple style. But, that's OK because it works for this film. It doesn't try to be anything it isn't. The scenarios and the dialogue is all very well handled and thought out. It makes you you think twice a few times as well.Some scenes really work and have great tension and intrigue. Especially whenever there is a court scene. Some aspects would have been nice to have seen explored more like when they explain how to tell if someone is lying when testifying.Keanu Reeves does a good job here and isn't so stale like some people like to say he usually is. There might be some truth in that for some films, but here you can see that he stepped up his effort. The role was originally set to be played by Daniel Craig, and I can definitely see how his acting style would have worked well for the character. It's a shame he dropped out last minute, but Reeves makes the character his own and you can understand his motivations.The ending was unexpected and included a strange little twist which the movie could have done without and still worked well and perhaps in some ways been more effective.The film is interesting if you want a mystery with some turns and it has some captivating courthouse scenes which are in some moments disturbing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Ending Makes It Better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Did you like those old Perry Mason shows? Are you an attorney? If you answered yes to either of those questions it's likely you'll enjoy "The Whole Truth". What this movie does well is slowly reveal the truth, very slowly. In the mean time it shows a kind of love of the law itself. How it can be worked to an unlikely outcome, yet one that has some legs as in "well, I didn't see that coming". To a viewer that is not particularly connected to TV law or isn't even that interested in it, let alone being an attorney, there is still quite a compelling story here. Granted it takes the strangeness of an accused killer attempting to protect someone besides himself. But, who?As I write this the rating for "The Whole Truth" is hovering around 6.5 and I've got to think it's just a bit low. This film is better and the reason is that it shows a lot about people and the law. Sure, an attorney could love this, but it's more than that. It's about how a pat situation isn't always pat, at least when it comes to a critical mass in court. It's about different party's agendas colliding with something huge at stake. It's about what you think you know, but in reality you don't because it comes down to just a compacted courtroom re-casting of even less. It's a chess game, but one in which there's more than two players. There's at least three and within the three there is some tremendous manipulation. So, whose the master manipulator whose agenda prevailed? And who are the parties that got played? It can't be denied these are fantastic questions. They're woven well too. I was never bored watching this movie even if it moved quite slowly and revealed little to nothing until the final third. This kind of enigmatic progression worked expertly building up to a real "home run" ending where there was a huge turn of events.Keanu Reeves isn't right for every role. His detached acting skills seemed spot-on here. He played poker with the big boys even though, as actually happens, he lucked into his final courtroom victory. But, as the movie closes the question looms if he was ultimately the played one has to be addressed in ways you wouldn't have seen coming. That's what I call a great ending to an otherwise good courtroom drama. It raised the bar, and the rating.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty Damn Good Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Whole Truth is a courtroom drama. If you're not up for that, then don't watch it. Courtroom dramas take place in a courtroom. If you're not up for a movie that primarily takes place in a courtroom, then don't watch it. If you like courtroom dramas however, this is sure to please. The closest I can compare this to is perhaps Primal Fear. Keanu Reeves plays a defense attorney who is tasked with representing a client (relative of a friend actually) who refuses to speak. The happenings in the courtroom are complimented with speculative flashbacks (could it have happened this way or maybe it happened that way). As things unfold we learn that there is a deeper conspiracy at play that I won't go into because that would spoil it. Suffice it to say, for a movie that was less than two hours long and primarily was shot in one location (the courtroom) I never got bored. This is no work of genius, mind you; it's not A Few Good Men nor is it To Kill A Mockingbird--but it's pretty damn good nevertheless. So if you like courtroom dramas, do check it out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK as a TV episode. Not so much as a feature.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just the other day I stumbled upon an animated short called "Sebastian's Voodoo". It runs about 4 minutes with closing credits and was made by a sophomore student on a shoestring budget. It has it all ? story, characters, visuals, drama, climax, finale, meaning. Now you need to hear it again ? it's under 5 minutes.I'd have thought that the stuff that runs one and a half hour, features Keanu Reeves and Renee Zellweger (I ? guess) and cost at least several millions should be able to offer at least something along those lines, shouldn't it? I mean if it is not by design in the same category as, say, "Mechanic: Resurrection" ? that is not a piece of totally senseless action entertainment which does not even pretend for a second to be anything more than that? Unfortunately, it's not the case here.It's obviously not a movie one would want to write a dissertation about, so let's be brief. Good news first. The story is semi-OK with a couple of more or less legitimate twists. After two decades of preparation Keanu Reeves delivers something that remotely qualifies as acting (at any rate his lawyer here is perceptibly less wooden than in "The Devil's Advocate" and the remnants of his trademark acting quality are somewhat justified in the context of the plot). That's it.Now, would it be good enough? It's not that anybody asked for my opinion, but as far as I'm concerned ? not quite. What would be the justification of a multi-million project with major stars if at the end of the day the outcome feels, as one reviewer pointed out, like a TV show episode? Except for paychecks for all parties involved?The truth is that the movie feebly hints at some points but they are dropped halfway and ultimately not really made. My guess would be that it might have been different in the script but changed during the production ? it would explain why one of the main characters suddenly becomes kind of 'unnecessary'. It is as if the movie was afraid of getting too poignant and chooses to play it safely.The direction is equally mediocre and all about 'been there done that' stuff. It does not even hint at any original vision. No, that's not true. At some point you can have a glimpse of Renee Zellweger's (I guess ? but definitely not a body double's) naked posterior. Despite the fact that it's not as ample as it used to be, this revelation is commendable. And it's never been done before. But again ? that's it.Then again, since patent mediocrity has always been the main specialty of mainstream Hollywood, this all is not surprising. What is, however, is why people like Keanu settle for it time and time and time again. With his ability as a performer mentioned he is hardly in a position to be picky. However, with his financial ability he certainly is.Why not to finance meaningful mid-/low-budget projects with his own money retaining total creative control and minding their commercial potential as well? Reportedly Keanu tried recently. But wound up with "Exposed" after "Daughter of God" was gang raped by Lionsgate executives.Well, Neo, everybody falls the first time. Get a decent crew of inventive dudes who actually have something to say and try again. Stir this morass a little. Who, if not you? Because even "Exposed" has more meaning, real drama and, ultimately, value to it than "The Whole Truth".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A boy's father is dead and you are left with huge breadcrumbs to understand the motive, and twists, behind his father's death.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Trigger Warning(s): Blood | Conversation about Rape | Depiction of Verbal and Physical AbuseCharacters Worth Noting Mike (Gabriel Basso) | Loretta (Renée Zellweger) | Richard Ramsey (Keanu Reeves) | Janelle (Gugu Mbatha- Raw) | Boone (Jim Belushi)Main Storyline The sole focus of Ramsey is to find a way to get Mike a not guilty verdict. This is despite all evidence and the entire investigation solely focusing on him killing his father Boone. Someone who doesn't have the best reputation. There are allegations of physical abuse, there are multiple instances of verbal abuse, and Ramsey tries to make him out to be a womanizer. But is that enough to justify a murder? Does Mike's silence for most of the trial make him seem less of a sympathetic figure? Does Janelle's grilling of a woman named Angela Morley (Nicole Barré), who may have allowed Boone to do something unthinkable, help this slightly fishy case? Well?{Commentary}Something about this film reminds me of Anna (Mindscape) in the sense that you get some real quality performances here but, unlike Mindscape, there is less of a whodunit type of mystery here. The mind automatically gravitates to Mike's motive seeming off, especially as we are told he is a legal prodigy who for some reason ended up on trial for murder. On top of that, Richard tells Janelle everyone lies and Janelle keeps picking at that. It gets her some headway during the trial, but even with her past used to attempt to discredit her, everything seems a bit too laid out for you to be shocked by the ultimate result of the movie. Especially as any and all flashbacks are treated as a matter of fact and not varying perceptions of what actually happened.Though it is perhaps the ending which got me the most. What someone surely considered a "big reveal" honestly felt thrown in there. It is like the writer (Nicholas Kazan) crafted something which may have seen complex on paper but in live action, it didn't translate well. To the point that it almost leaves you with a feeling of indifference, or the need to roll your eyes, for it seems someone thought that reveal would be huge and yet it falls flat partly due to predictability.Review SummaryHighlightsI can't make a claim to being a fan of any actor in this movie, besides Gugu Mbatha-Raw, and while I knew of the actors for their other roles, Bill &amp; Ted and of course Bridget's Diary, I didn't have a formed opinion. Well, if I based it solely on this movie, I would say Reeves and Zellweger are excellent actors. To me, there are only a few different types of actors and I would argue these two, at least in this movie, seem like those who can take a decent script and, make it possibly seem good thanks solely to their performances.For the actors in this film, if you lend yourself to doubt anything, they will try to quickly hook onto you and drag you toward the darkness. Be it how calm Loretta seems through all this, Mike's proclamation and all signs to him being the murderer, or even Richard's part in this. His willingness to take on an unproven lawyer, one with issues, as his 2nd chair and then defend the kid who killed his former friend and client? Then, on top of that, drag Boone's name through the mud? There is so much here to question and if you don't look past the surface you could get lost. However, if you shake away the fog and don't let the actors' grip hold onto you, everything seems clear and Janelle is surely to blame.Low PointsI am not the master in figuring out plots and getting twists and turns before they happen. Even with all the TV shows and movies I watch, including foreign films and anime, which can be quite screwed up, I find myself with wrong theories and perceptions all the time. So when I do get something right, it is a bit disappointing. Movies are fantasies, people actively trying to trick you into forgetting the actor and only recognizing the character. There is this attempt to bring a story, either inspired or fictional, to life and to get you lost in it. Unfortunately, as noted, even when an actor is at their best, when there are red flags it is hard to stay in the dream. When things seem off and don't belong, the trance the actors try to keep you in wares off and so comes you seeing flaws. And that trance is important. In the best films, that trance is only broken once the credits role. Yet, if the trance is broken earlier, it's like watching a ballet in the front row. Yes, you may physically see the artistry and perhaps admire it, but with the sound of feet landing you find a nagging flaw that leads your mind to be a bit too active in the pursuit of taking note of everything around you.Bringing it back to this film, and to summarize, the actors get you early into a trance but the twist and would be shocks are jolts to the system that aren't introduced in a way that could keep you from thinking "hold up, something is not right." They wake you up and lead you to question things, and not in a good way. They lead you too quickly to answers and being proved right too many times leaves you feeling dissatisfied.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suspenseful who done it courtroom drama.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been waiting quite awhile to see this movie. I finally got to view it today. Not sure why it is taking so long to play in the US. First of all, I love courtroom dramas. This one was right on target with the slow build up of the story. With the flashbacks while people were testifying to one way things happened and the way they really happened kept you guessing what the whole truth was. Why was everyone kinda lying? The suspense builds until you do not know who did it until the very end. Then it just catches you off guard because you did not expect the answer that came. Then you just sit in amazement as the credits roll by saying to yourself "oh that one got me". Really enjoyed the movie. Will watch it again to see what I missed. As always, Keanu Reeves does an excellent job as the defense attorney. Really plays it close to the cuff. Renee Zellwiget did a great job also. It was a well acted movie with a great story line. This movie was directed by a woman, Courtney Cox, and she did a great job. I hope we continue to see movies if this caliber in the future. Recommend it highly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The simple act of paying attention ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>can make this a movie enjoyable to watch. It's good; not without it flaws, but good. It needs patience, as it's quiet and slow-building. It delivers its first punch around the one hour mark. Then the second about 20 minutes later...then you're in the ropes (to borrow a metaphor from the movie). It's well acted... but that's all that's well about it. Directing, editing and script are the reason this is a passable but not 'good' movie. As with any old-fashioned whodunnit movie, it's all about attention to detail. And in hindsight, the trailer is pretty clever....especially the last line. Won't give away any spoilers, but the very first clue is in the trailer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Does Keanu ever age?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SLIGHT SPOILER ALERTBeing in the legal service industry, I was impressed that few embellishments with real court proceedings were taken in this film. So many times we see long winded speeches that 'save the day' and 'win the case'. LOLOLOL Nope. Seldom happens. It is the slow plodding along, asking and listening. At least this film didn't go the 'Inherit the Wind' route. BUT - a bit more - umph would have been nice. Keanu Reeves is getting older, but, in a slow - Dorian Greyish way. Supporting cast was good. Overall, a watchable movie -but as a previous posted here said, no action, no sex, but - watchable with a great twist at the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is better off as a Law and Order episode</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Keanu Reeves stars as Richard Ramsey, a small town Louisiana lawyer who takes up the murder case of family friends son who may have murdered his father in cold blood. To make matters worse, his young client refuses to speak to anyone on the matter except to say that he is guilty. The boys mother, played by a barely recognizable Renée Zellweger, begs Keanu to save her son from prison but does she have her own secrets to hide?While the trailer to this movie looks like an intelligent, and mysterious courtroom drama, its sadly misleading. The movie sets up the murder and the characters right from the beginning however the entire movie is played out in either the courtroom...or a series of short flashbacks. It really could have been shot anywhere and except for a few bridge shots, it has no connection to Louisiana. While I have no qualms with the acting, the story is at best, basic. There is no real payoff at the end and when we do see the guilty party, it certainly isn't much of a surprise.My biggest complaint is about Gugu Mbatha-Raw, a fine actress whose talents were wasted here on a part that plays no serious role in the movie. Her character almost didn't need to be included in the movie. Like I said, this movie could have easily been a two-part Law and Order episode. No wonder Daniel Craig bailed on this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good lawyer movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Whole Truth is about a lawyer played by Keanu Reeves that tries to make his client be free because according to him he did not did the murder. Keanu Reeves was good as always and the entire cast made serviceable performances for their roles, which is fine but i expected more from the actors. The story is actually what I liked most about the film and it was the thing that kept it afloat. It was a realistic story that made sense and i did actually give a crap about what was going on. The worst part of this film is a secondary character that is given a weak backstory and it is by far the most uninteresting character in the whole film. The courtroom scenes were the best things of the film, but when it steps aside of the courtroom scenes, it derails the whole film for me. The twist is really unexpected and i did not knew nothing about, making the experience even better. 7/10</fullReview>
