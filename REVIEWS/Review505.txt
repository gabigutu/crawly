		<shortDescription>An unparalleled cinematic masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Continuing in the tradition of classic films such as 'The Godfather' and 'Apocalypse Now', director Steven Brill has added his name to the short list of truly great directors with his sweeping masterpiece 'Heavy Weights'. In arguably his finest performance to date, Aaron Schwartz plays Jerry Garner, a young man who is forced to attend a summer camp against his will. Upon arriving at the camp, Jerry is befriended by Roy (Kenan Thompson) and Josh (Shaun Weiss). Together they challenge the the tyrannic rule of manic camp counselor Tony Perkis (Ben Stiller) while overcoming their own personal insecurities to have the best summer of their lives. Thompson and Weiss both deliver Oscar-worthy performances, and Ben Still is at his best as the fitness-crazed camp counselor who must whip the campers into shape. Brill is truly at his best here, weaving an intricate tale full of mystery, suspense and deception, while capturing the essence of the human spirit and the hope and perseverance of children. This is a must have for any true fan of film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Greatest movie of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the best movie ever. I have watched it 1192 times. Ben Stiller's performance is excellent and the kids, although amateur, provide many, many, many laughs. This is a great movie to sit back and watch when you feel like using no brain power. The comedy is completely mindless and hilarious. Watching a group of obese children being "torchered" by a diet-obsessed ex-heavyweight is a great premise for a movie. it has all the elements of a good movie: you laugh, you celebrate, and maybe, (if you're extremely sensitive) cry. I don't know how you can't absolutely love this movie. My praises for this movie know almost no bounds. This is just a great movie. Well, I'm going to go achieve 1193!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Heavyweights is the story of a group of kids who with the help of their counselor go on a mission to take back their fat camp from a crazy man who has never interacted with kids before (played by Ben Stiller) who is intend on making it into a money making informercial. I first saw this as a child, and absolutely loved it. I must have watched it again on at least 5 other occassions. Recently I was in the video store and came across a copy of it for sale. After convincing my friend to buy it , we went back to his house and popped it into the VCR. I wondered if the film would hold up after all these years. Did it? Absolutely! In fact I may have gotten bigger laughs this time around. I do not understand why this film has a 5.1 rating, after reminding this movie to my friends they all recalled loving it, and everyone I recently watched it with loved it. Ben Stiller's character is hillarious, and the rest of the cast is great. Besides Ben, Kenan Thompson is the only other actor in this who went on to become somewhat of a star, which is suprising because all the kids give great performances. Tom Mcgowan, the man who plays Pat, seemed to be chosen for the role because Chris Farley passed on it, and John Candy died, but he gives a great performance.I know it sounds cliche, but Heavyweights is truly one of the few movies that people of all ages will love.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic summer camp movie from Disney</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's really too bad that summer camps aren't as prevalent in today's society as they used to be. It was a way for kids to get away for a few months every summer. It was a chance to be on your own (away from parents anyway), visit a place that you would otherwise never see, have what may be the most important experiences of your childhood, and make friends that you would truly never forget. Kids just do not get that today. The only way they can really experience the magic of summer camp is in the movies. Unfortunately there are not many movies that really show that experience. Meatballs (1979, with Bill Murray) may very well be the best example, and Indian Summer (1996) shows how those friendships last when a group of 30 year old former campers reunite at the summer camp of their youth. But here with Heavyweights, we have another great, if not to realistic portrayal of the summer camp experience. Camp Hope is a camp that caters strictly to fat kids. It's where they go to lose weight, and make friends with other kids that may also be considered outcasts back home because of their weight. But in fat camp, all kids are equal. At least until the kind owners of the camp, The Pushkins, are forced to sell the camp to a villainous fitness guru wannabe, played with demonic zeal by Ben Stiller. It is, in fact, a performance Stiller would virtually copy for the movie Dodgeball. He attempts to force the kids to lose weight through, shall we say, questionable methods in order to create a weight loss infomercial. But the kids, rebel, take over the camp, and have summer their way. There are many classic moments, such as the kids "downloading" their stash of candies and snacks in various hiding places, Ben Stiller's interrogation of kids that are actually gaining weight, a competition with the jocks from Camp MVP across the lake, and many more. There's also scenes showing that the kids can be anything they want if they just apply themselves. Such as a dance with the girls from across the lake. At first everyone just stands around. But when the boys start dancing, the girls join in, and success is in the air, until Stiller shows up to degrade the boys again. Sure this movie is by the numbers, but it's a fun ride, with great characters, beautiful scenery, and a villain who couldn't be more over the top. Epitomized by the scene where Stiller somersaults from a second story window, hits the floor, quietly says to himself "Ouch", and whips his head into a full villain "Nobody's gonna stop me" speech. Great family movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A comedy precursor for the next decade</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite being a child of the '90s, somehow I missed "Heavyweights" entirely. Considering the similarities it shares with "The Mighty Ducks" movies such as actors Kenan Thompson and Shaun Weiss, I'm almost embarrassed. Regardless, there's still plenty to appreciate about "Heavyweights" 15 years later in spite of its silliness -- and it's more than just a joke about the ineptitude of the Buffalo Bills.For one, it was written and directed by Judd Apatow, who has a majority hold on the comedies of the last decade and for two, it marks one of Ben Stiller's first prominent roles as fitness wack-job Tony Perkis, who takes over a once-adored fat camp and harasses the kids.Good thing "Heavyweights" was made then or it may never have surfaced, seeing as the age of political correctness and weight sensitivity has befallen us. The film is not cruel at all in its depiction of overweight campers, so parents surfing around for slightly older kid films and coming across this one shouldn't be concerned about that factor, but there's no doubt that such a concept would be hard to get off the ground, especially at Disney, in the 21st Century.Co-written by Apatow and Steven Brill, writer of "The Mighty Ducks" films, it was as if the two conspired to plant a seed for a type of humor that kids my age at the time would come to identify as their own as they entered the PG-13 and R-rated age. Tony Perkis, for example, is the spitting character image of Stiller's White Goodman from "Dodgeball" and yet to me he is just as amusing doing his patented whispery intimidating voice now despite my countless repeated viewings of "Dodgeball."There's also a classic overnight camp comedy sense of humor in "Heavyweights" like the kids getting beat in sports by their rival camp, an awkward dance mixer with a normal girls camp and when the kids unload the candy stashes they've snuck in camp into secret compartments -- as well as the run-of-the-mill fart jokes. Characters such as Tony's hysterical right-hand European man Lars, however, were way ahead of their time."Heavyweights" is pretty immature and excludes girls (because fat girls would be too taboo for the '90s). Its typical camp movie plot as well as its "overthrow-the-bad-guy" story arch - - which ruled the '90s -- come off as stale. But ignore those distractions and "Heavyweights" is a funny, quotable movie with some classic scenes, which is all a kid (or someone trying to go back and grab some nostalgia) really wants.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film is great, I don't need to write another review of the synopsis as there are so many below, but if you have any sense of humour at all you'll like this movie. If you're a dried up 60 year old prune reminiscing about the good old days of black and white cinema when you could see a film + popcorn for a shilling and sixpence, you'll hate it. Great for kids, enough stupid stuff to keep them entertained, Fantastic for teenagers/people in their 20s, enough sick/dry humour to satisfy and make you think 'holy crap can they say that in a DISNEY film????', and older middle aged people with a sense of humour will see its quirky side too.I just have one question, at one point with the seymour butts joke, does anyone know what josh actually says, as his joke is totally out of sync with his lip movements.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Camp Hope is a summer camp for fat kids, all of the kids at Camp Hope have a weight problem. It is the one place they can go without feeling different. But when the previous owners declare bankruptcy, the camp is purchased by an obnoxious fitness freak Tony Perkis (Ben Stiller) who becomes obsessed with changing his chubby charges into budding body builders. He immediately begins serving them low calorie foods and subjecting them to rigorous exercises (ex. 20 mile hike). Part of his motivation is greed and he is in the process of writing a book, and filming an infomercial on weight loss. The boys at camp rebel the "Perkis System" and mayhem ensues. I liked Heavyweights it was pretty funny for a Disney film. Ben Stiller is hilarious as the freak Tony Perkis one of his better roles in my opinion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of The best Comedies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With Lines like "I'm Feeling Skinny Tony!", and "Kiss the ground jokerboy!"...you just cant go wrong with this film. Ben Stiller steals the show with probably his best comedy ever as a physco entrepenuer taking over a fat camp. This film was made in the mid 90's where terrible fashion and mullets were still around. Such as humongous t-shirts and t-shirts that says "mean people suck" This movies' humour is beyond that of 12 year old kids with references that they wouldnt understand.SMALL SCENE SPOILER For example, Tony Perkis goes to give this one fat black kid a hug, then he pats him down and finds a pez dispenser in his sock. Tony goes on to say "Hey, It looks like my mans PACKIN!, then he proceeds to unload that "clip" of pez and as it hits the floor it sounds like bullets hitting the floor. ITs in a class totally of its own.Rent the Movie. Who cares about the actual story and the moral message it brings. Just watch Tony Perkis and his sidekick Lars. Truly good humour....9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredibly Stupid</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was simply one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It was recommended by a now-former friend. The plot was clearly slapped together by three zombies from "The Walking Dead" (or a C- list Damon/Affleck non-sexual couple) and made about as much sense as Ron Paul ; the "we can do anything even though we're fat" message was ham-handed at best, and as blunt as Sarah Palin on a particularly stupid day; the dialog was wooden -- which make sense because so were the actors. I literally couldn't see the forest for the trees. Its the sort of movie that makes you pray for a forest fire, or for Jason Voorhees to show up and put a stop to this nonsense. That's the only ending that could have improved this movie: mass slaughter, starting with the writers.I'm stunned at how bad it is, in all honesty. I can't imagine how it got made. I really can't. The voice-over narration of the kid's letter home to grandma was filled with lines like, "Together, we can do anything!" and "We all love ourselves now" -- yet they feel that way after doing absolutely nothing to earn that confidence except promise to lead healthier lives after a night of binging. I laughed only because I can't believe that someone read the script and said yes. Avoid this movie. It's not an enjoyable mess, just a mess; on a brighter note, it is an epic triumph for writers and producers lacking talent, grace, and apparently basic intelligence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What's not to love about this movie. It's a classic 90's shenanigan comedy with the tubbies from The Mighty Ducks. They work so well together as a cast and their chemistry really shows. Although the movie's funny it doesn't start to get really good until about halfway through. It's rude, crude and childish with a carefree spirit...so moronic but you can't take it too seriously.I do agree that it's a poor example of glutinous behaviour but even a child can tell that this is a gross over exaggeration and nobody commends this sort of diet and laziness. In saying that it's funny and not necessary about food. It's about losers becoming winners and the clinically insane getting what they deserve. And who doesn't like to watch that.</fullReview>

This country is looking more and more like Nazi Germany before WW2, now everyone wants to control everything, jeez! Now to the movie. I don't understand one thing. Why is "Ben Stiller" being treated like a bad guy and the useless fat moronic kids as heroes? All I see is a man who wanted to help some lazy stupid kids, who will end up as losers in life, if they keep living that way. That way I mean treating candy as the best thing in life and being completely addicted to junk food and completely disgusted by any kind of sports activity. The main actor was nice and polite with them the whole movie, yet, he was supposed to be the bad guy. Those kids deserved some real fat loss treatment, so they learn some discipline.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A group of kids at a fat camp learn the camp is changing ownership and going from a place they loved to their own personal hell.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think that I could do this review simply by saying "Judd Apatow." Every thing this man writes ranges from good to great, so it does not surprise me that I enjoyed this movie so much. Comprised of some well known actors from The Mighty Ducks series, including, wait for it, Gooooldberg, these young stars (well, young at the time) put on quite the show. When Tony Perkins (Ben Stiller) buys Camp Hope none of the campers could have known just how bad things would become, but frankly, I enjoyed watching.This movie, which I deem viewable for all ages, is the type of light-hearted comedy that I loved in the 90&#x2032;s and still love today. All of the campers are funny in their own way, and they have memorable performances. To this day I still hear people shout, "Watch out for Salami Sam" when they jump into a pool. Ben Stiller's performance, which unfortunately was pretty much recycled years later in dodgeball, was at the time hilarious and unique. One of the most under-rated shinning stars of this move is Tom Hodges who plays Lars, a counselor at Tony's camp who is from "far away." The acting/writing combination, along with a bit of 90&#x2032;s nostalgia makes 'Heavy Weights' a great movie to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gerry Garner along with other chubby kids are sent to Camp Hope, a fat camp. The camp was owned by the kindly Bushkins but they went bankrupt. The camp is taken over by motivational wildman Tony Perkis (Ben Stiller) intend on making them skinnier to promote himself. Lars is his militaristic henchman. Tim (Paul Feig) and Pat Finley (Tom McGowan) are the gentle counselor holdovers from before. Julie (Leah Lail) is the pretty nurse. The kids has to battle Tony as they prepare for the Apache Relay against Camp MVP's jocks.Written by Judd Apatow and Steven Brill, this is a showcase for Ben Stiller to do a crazy character. He's working out stuff to be used in later characters and has some funny moments. The adult actors are OK but the kids are mostly duds. The supposed lead kid is weak. I think that's the main problem. I like the kids but they're not funny. Shaun Weiss and Kenan Thompson are the best of the kids. The jokes are just not there. There is an interesting idea of making fun of fat camp. The directions from Brill is limited.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Overweight high school student Aaron Schwartz (as Gerald "Gerry" Garner) thinks summer camp might be fun, but doesn't want to attend when he learns "Camp Hope" caters to portly adolescents. His parents make young Schwartz go anyway, hoping the experience will make him thinner. Initially, Schwartz finds it a fun place where fat kids smuggle in tons of candy. But quickly, the owners go bankrupt and oily fitness guru Ben Stiller (as Tony Perkis) takes over management. He immediately makes the boys camp a living hell...Flatulence, a four-letter-word, and Ben Stiller are used for laughs in this Disney production. There are ample overweight people in the cast, with whom weighty audience members can identity. The students are portrayed as fairly active, although it doesn't seem to benefit their health. Actual weight loss is not celebrated by these "Heavy Weights". The comedy team Stiller and Meara have a cameo as the camp's original owners; perhaps not coincidently, they are Ben Stiller's parents. Ben shows off nice hair and has a lot of exercise scenes.**** Heavy Weights (2/17/95) Steven Brill ~ Aaron Schwartz, Ben Stiller, Tom McGowan, Shaun Weiss</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unassuming "family movie" that provides plenty of laughs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Heavyweights" is a mid-90's Disney film about a fat camp taken over by the villainous fatboy-turned-success Tony Perkis. While the premise is not so novel, the execution is great and keeps you pretty entertained throughout.Some of the humor is dated, very 90's-specific. However, there is plenty of timeless, cross-generational humor, and Ben Stiller is absolutely at the top of his game. He would reprise this role many times again in his career: the guy with low self-esteem who becomes an overcompensating jerk. Tom McGowan, who plays a Camp Hope lifer, also plays a solid role and draws many laughs.Sure, it's another Disney story about underdog kids who end up conquering the odds... or something like that. But Stiller and McGowan are great, and the kids do a pretty admirable too. It's not a must-see movie, but you also won't feel like you wasted your time for having watched it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Heavy Weights is not a politically correct movie. I first saw this movie as a child on the Disney channel and thought it was hilarious.****SPOILERS********The movie is basically about fat boys in a fat camp and their crazy summer with psycho fitness slut Tony Perkis (Ben Stiller). Jerry is the leading fat boy. The film starts with him at his last day of school ready to enjoy a lazy summer. After he misses his bus and is almost attacked by a dog he comes home to find his parents are sending him to Fat Camp. Jerry is not pleased and screams at his Dr. Phil looking father "Your fatter than I am, you go to camp!" Jerry ultimately is forced to camp where he meets lovely fellow big boys, and realizes camp might not be so bad. They have go carts, "the Blob" and best of all no one picks on you because everyone is the fat kid. He makes many friends right away including a young Keenan Thompson.The movie really pokes fun of the mockery of fat children.1. The fat camps beloved owners (played by Ben Stillers real parents) have gone bankrupt and now new ownership has emerged in the form of former fat kid turned exercise Nazi Tony Perkis. This movie is where I first heard about Ben Stiller. He is great as the cruel Tony. He loves to embarrass his poor campers. At one point he cancels their lunch and simply tells them over the intercom "lunch has been canceled due to lack of hustle...Deal with it."CRUEL.2. The dance. This is another of Tony's sick twisted jokes and is hilarious. The boys have a dance with the girls camp and of course these girls are repulsed by the boys.3. Lars. This guy looks like one of the Gestapo. He is a counselor who has a thing for the camp nurse Julie. He is evil and perhaps his character is a mockery of a German Nazi. Lars is foreign and has an accent and marches around the camp with his Aryan looks blowing his whistle like a deranged fat hating Nazi.4. The baseball game. This is just downright unfair. The camp plays baseball against camp MVP, camp MVP is a SPORTS camp....Guess who won the game? 5. Food stealing. There cannot be a movie about fat camp without the stealing of food. Sounds funny and it is...after all no matter how many "glandular" or "hormonal" problems a person of generous girth has, ultimately the majority just ate and a lot...The boys go crazy when they learn the slop they have to eat and resort to desperate measures.6. Revenge. The boys are abused and downright sick of it. Their ultimate kidnapping of demonic Tony is hilarious. The scene at parents night when the parents see what their child is really going through is very funny! 6. The Apache Relay. The finale. This is where the camp again competes with camp MVP in order to win the Apache Relay.The apache relay is a serious of various obstacles that camp MVP always win..... The ending is really great.This movie certainly makes incredible fun of fat people, and not just fat people, but boys going through puberty. I found it hilarious than and still find it hilarious now. It may not appeal to anyone who does not like this sort of politically incorrect comedy, but for those who enjoy Ben Stiller or an occasional chubby joke may find this movie not only funny, but endearing. I would watch this with my brother and sister and we would laugh our heads off, but we were always rooting for the fat kids. Tony Perkis was the devil and we found the "capture" of him clever. Loved this movie.....may not be something for obese sensitive.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tom Hodges is a scene stealer in this atypical Dinsey comedy. (minor spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Heavyweights is a great family film, but not one that is ridiculously sentimental as most Dinsey family fare often tends to be.A group of boys sent to a fat camp for the summer are in for a rude awakening. Though fearful of what kind of physical rigor he might expect from 'fat camp' Gerry, somewhat of the main character here, he is surprised to find that it is mostly fun and games in the summer sun. But when the owners of the paradise (played by husband and wife, Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara) sell the camp to psycho fitness fanatic, Tony Perkis (Ben Stiller at his best), life at 'fat camp' becomes pure hell for the boys. Perkis, determined to exploit the boys as the posterchildren of success for his on-going Perkisizer infomercial, takes away from the boys everything that made camp great. For a while, the great times at 'fat camp' made the boys forget their being singled out as something to laugh at. But when sleazy Tony "I'm everybody's friend in front of the camera" Perkis goes too far in his sadistic ways to make Perkisizer a financial success, the boys (and some of the old camp counselors) get together for a bit of tasty revenge. Don't forget, that it's a Dinsey movie. It may not be as ridiculously sentimental as other family features, but there is always a moral to be learned, and most often, it deals with self-esteem. With the Perkins take over, the campers are stigmatized by their new camp counselor, and particularly by the neighboring camp (Camp MVP). In the course of dealing with Tony, they learn to appreciate themselves.Viewers who were young enough to enjoy Mighty Ducks and those family films of the early 90s will recognized many of the young actors in this feature. It is one of Kenan Thompson's (from All That) early roles, and he's often proven quite good in comedy. I would say this is probably the best comedy I've seen Stiller in, putting on that deep voice, and acting like an insane fitness guru (get a load of that hair and those workout outfits. However, Thomas Hodges, as the uptight Perkisizing camp counelor, Larrs, is the scene stealer in this movie. (I never get tired of the "you broke my camera" scene during the Perkizing reformation montage). He's my favorite character, indeed.It's good laughs all around, and one that I never get tired of. Being that Disney never seems to tire of airing it on television, it is also likely, too, that there is ample opportunity to catch it (at least as of this writing). So get out there and start Perkisizing!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was reading about Ben Stiller on IMDb discussion boards and plenty of people recommended Heavy Weights (1995) as one of his best comedy films. Oh, boy! This is one of the most disgusting and stupid films I've ever seen - the jokes were so lame (really, do people still laugh at fart jokes?! - Probably fat people do ...), Ben Stiller's character was pathetic rather than funny and the obese boys - well, they were too self-indulging, spoiled (and most of them - hm, ugly) to be appealing in any way. Instead of amusing I found the film dangerous - it promotes stuffing with junk food, encourages undisciplined behavior and on top of all - promulgates fat people as cleverer than thin and fit ones, while the truth is that junk food and lack of exercise is bad for brain development. Do not waist your time with this crap, life is too short, watch a better movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just caught this on TBS last night, and I was interested in how I would like it this time, since I remember my friends and I were laughing our heads off when we watched it in 6th grade. Well, apparently I've matured or something, because it wasn't all that funny. However, it still is an enjoyable movie, if only because the actors are having such a good time with their roles.I've never cared too much for Ben Stiller, but I have to admit he is hilarious here. He's much better as a maniacal villain than the repetitive, unfunny characters he's been playing ever since. And Tom McGowan, while not particularly funny, has an aura of charm that makes him instantly likable. He's a talented actor, and it's a shame he hasn't been in more movies.The kids are good, too, especially Kenan Thompson (who is impossible not to like no matter WHAT movie he's in) and Shaun Weiss. The movie itself consists a bunch of silly fat jokes and slapstick, and some rather shady morals, but with such a great, eager cast, you really can't complain about it. All in all, it's a fun movie that anyone can enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Enjoyable Camp Flick!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Heavyweights was a movie that will not teach you any lessons. All this movie will teach you to do is have the time of your life whenever you are released from school for the summer. However, I still think that the movie Camp Nowhere was a little bit better though.11 year old fat kid Jerry (Aaron Schwartz) finds out that his parents are sending him to Camp Hope for the summer. He gets excited by the idea at first until he discovers that it's a camp for fat children. After he is forced to go, he arrives and meets a ton of cool kids even though their fat also. He immediatley fits in the group and everyone is happy until the owners of the camp discover that they're being replaced by the psycho health nut Tony Perkis (Ben Stiller). Tony puts the boys through nothing but a living nightmare because he makes them work out 24/7 and doesn't let them eat anything good or let them have any fun. So the boys put their heads together and work on a plan to take down Tony and take the camp over themselves to have some FUN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I must say that this was one of Ben Stiller's very first movies and he did such a hilarious job with the character.Heavyweights is a very entertaining family comedy that will leave you laughing even while the credits are rolling.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Standard fare that is so-so but is amusing enough to watch with the kids</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a "hefty" child Gerry's parents decide to send him to a Fat Camp and, although initially shocked, the camp looks like a lot of fun and starts really well. However only a few days into the camp, the long-time owners are forced to sell to fitness freak and would-be guru Tony Perkis. Quickly the camp goes from being one of family fun to resembling more of a prison camp, with a tight regime and cruel ownership. Gradually, as Perkis' mental state deteriorates, the group decide to take a stand.With the Disney logo and the afternoon slot on television, I was ready for a rather childish tone to the film and I accepted it from the start. The plot is obvious and predictable throughout but really this is like complaining that water is wet, what is important that the film is fun for both kids and adults. In some ways it succeeds and the film is pretty enjoyable on a basic level even if it could have been better. The silly tone is quite fun even if it is all aimed at older children (7 ?11) and not adults, I was amused by it even if I didn't really get into it ? sharper material and more inventive and witty writing would have greatly improved it but it does what it does just about well enough to be worth watching.The cast reflect the material and is full of broad (in all senses) characters who are very much cookie-cutter in their development and really don't do much more than basic pratfalls and so on ? there are no real people here and the performances are average. The kids are all so-so and suit the material while the adults pretty much do the same stuff. I had reasonable hopes on the basis of Stiller and some of the cameos. Stiller plays a very toned down character that he would later do much better in Dodgeball; he is funny but you can't help feel that his material is a real limiter on what he can do ? most of his best stuff is more about his delivery than his material. Stiller snr does his usual stuff but is given far too little time to make an impression while Jeffrey Tambor was a surprise find.Overall a fairly standard film from Disney aimed at the older, pre-teen end of the kiddie market. The standard sense of humour, plot formula and material never really inspire and produce a film that is enjoyable enough on its own terms but could have been much better with a bit of effort, invention and wit put into the material. The cast are par for the course although the presence of Ben Stiller does help (although again he could have been so much better). Average stuff for pre-teens then but not without some value as amusing filler.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best movie of my childhood (spoilers ahead!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw this movie 6 years ago, I loved it in theaters, I loved it when I bought the VHS, and it was the first DVD that I ever bought! I watch this move as often as I can, because it is a true wonder to behold when it comes to movies about camp. You feel sorry for the poor kids as they are ridiculed and belittled by the sadistic Tony (played perfectly by Ben Stiller), and root for them as they exact there revenge. Yes, the ending is a bit clichéd (I still wish they had lost..it would go great with the movie's lessons). All in all, I believe this is a great movie for kids that love a silliness with a bit of seriousness.My rating: 10/10. SEE THIS MOVIE IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ben Stiller emerges from this nonsense relatively unscathed, but virtually no-one in the audience will be able to escape the offensive, paradoxical inanity of 'Heavyweights'?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Heavyweights School's out for the summer, and Gerry Garner (Aaron Schwartz, 'The Mighty Ducks') eagerly forecasts weeks of lazing around the house. That is, until his parents (Jeffrey Tambor and Nancy Ringham) inform him that they have signed him up for a holiday at Camp Hope, a "fat camp" that, unbeknownst to Gerry, is about to be bought out by mentally unhinged exercise guru Tony Perkis (Ben Stiller), and turned into a rigorous fitness facility for youths. Tony pumps the fun out of the whole summer, and, with his assistant Lars (Tom Hodges, 'Lucas'), punishes anybody who tries to break his totalitarian grip on the camp. Together with his new friends (including Kenan Thompson and Shaun Weiss) and the camp's original staff (including Tom McGowan and Leah Lail), Gerry must stop Tony's brutal regime, and take back the camp at all costs.Family films are usually simple, but it's somewhat confusing when said film wants the audience to sympathise with a certain group of people, while piling on the jokes at their expense. 'Heavyweights' squeezes onto the screen from Steven Brill (the writer behind the hit 'Mighty Ducks' franchise), who is calling the shots for the first time with this flaccid comedy. 'Heavyweights' boasts a ho-hum message of learning to accept people for who they are, and not what they may look like. And, this being a Disney film, Brill (co-writing here with Judd Apartow, "The Ben Stiller Show") is given the opportunity to bash the audience over the head with it.I accept and support the observations that Brill shares with the audience; after all, it could work wonders for the self-esteem of those ? both old and young ? who are sensitive about their shape. I'm sure others would too, and with 'Heavyweights', there's a perfect chance to address a problem in our schools, a problem that's becoming too widespread and serious to be swept under the carpet.But what does Brill do? Takes this potential and goes in completely the wrong direction, slapping a (un)funny face onto a very important issue. When Brill isn't messing around with crude toilet humour and lumbering slapstick, the crux of most of the gags is mainly poking fun at the fat kids (doesn't this happen enough in the classroom?), who are insultingly portrayed as mischievous, food-obsessed youngsters with a deep abhorrence of any kind of physical activity. There's even one riling scene where one of the youngsters is lured into helping Tony out of a sticky situation with the offer of a chocolate, and another where the kids perform a celebratory, almost ritualistic night-time dance around a bonfire as they cover themselves with fatty foods. Then, to counterbalance this, Brill lazily writes off the visiting kids from the other, "non-fat" summer camps as either mean or dumb (whereas the overweight children are the exact opposite ? if only real life were that simple!). The wit in Brill's script is foul enough to deter most people from enjoying it, but with tough-talking black kids, stiff-upper-lip Brits, burly Germans and homophobic-tinged jokes tacked on, virtually no-one in the audience will be able to escape the offensive, paradoxical inanity of 'Heavyweights'.The only performer to emerge from this nonsense relatively unscathed is Ben Stiller. A television star (and ex-"Saturday Night Live" cast member) making a shot at a film career, Stiller's performance as the muscular, neurotic Tony Perkis is quite irksome - and, unlike the rest of the film, in a good way. What a shame, then, that Brill didn't seem to realise this, as Perkis's often-uproarious descent into insanity is pushed to the backburner of the film far too many times. Also, Stiller's character dives so far into caricature along the way that the actor can barely keep the film up on his brawny shoulders. Stiller is an able comedian, but this unexpected detour into family film land just doesn't fit, particularly in the wake of his cult generation-X tribute, last February's 'Reality Bites'.~ 4/10 ~</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Big Guys with Big Hope</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've never been overweight for the record but I have been a geek/outsider, which made me a target for most scum in the schools and even I never had all the breaks in life. This film is another one of my childhood gems and it's one of my favorite films of all time because this film focuses not just on kids that are heavyweights but also are people that never had all the breaks like myself.I really like the story in itself which is sort of your tide turning/underdog story. The film is actually a bit dark as we see but personally that's part of why I love it this film, it's one of those family movies done right where nothing is watered down and what the kids even good staff members go though just makes you all the more makes you want them to win.The characters are great, I really love Tony Perkins, this is my favorite role from Ben Stiller and one of my favorite fictional villains. Tony is pretty much the ultimate fanboy of the self help, fitness and infomercial counterculture. He's taken cues from guys like Tony Robbins, Richard Simons, or any other guru you can think of but he is literally not his own person. And the guy of course is a fraking moron as he is trying to utilize a fitness methodology of what it means to be a great person and of course we see he's on the wrong track or should I say off track.He is just fraking hilarious, not just verbally but even physically like in one scene where he's going on a power jog, it's funny because of how ridiculous he's moving as if he's a kid just imitating the movement he sees on an exercise video. The Chipmuk campers are all great and unique in ways, even like the fact that a few of them are from the "Mighty Ducks" films which is cool since I like those films. Jerry is solid, he's a character that is just sort of the ordinary kid that just simply wants to have a good time. One thing I like about him is his desire to ride a go kart, simply because they look cool and he's never ridden one but most importantly finding out if this is something he's good at. Which is something I can emphasize with, whenever there is something new and different my way I have the urge to try it out and to me that just part of life, trying things out and finding out what your good at.Really like Josh, he's sort of the class clown of the group. He's got some good scenes and lines. One that was my favorite was when he was pulling every ones chain when he was pretending to be some sort of zombie, that I always chuckled to.The film I feel smartly satirizes on the self help and fitness counterculture. How most of the time that counterculture is teaching all the wrong things like the importance of image; instead of the right things like the importance of mental and physical health.But of course the film also has some good messages and in a strange way is a bit of a Christian film. One of the revolving themes is of course about hope, hence the title of their camp. We kind of see throughout most of the film the camp is not living up to that title as we see instead of being Camp Hope it's became Camp Hell. But it's always the dark times when hope is needed the most and we see in both the campers and even the good staff that they have kept hope despite how small alive and has grown.From one scene where there is a dance with these nice looking girls at first it's an Amish rave but then of course we start to see at first the good councilors dance to get it going and then of course every joins in gets comfortable having fun which of course puts a crimp on Tony's plan. But also we see that it's hope alone that motivates them to do what must be done, once Tony says a really crappy thing to Pat as Pat stood up for the campers I thought, "That's it, I can't take this crap anymore!" that of course crossed the line with the other campers and staff and we see there is a form of community as they all work together to do what must be done.In a way that moment we see the contrast parallel in both Camp Hope's program and Tony's. Camp Hope is a place that we see promotes not just good health and outlook on life but also community, some of their community doesn't all consist of people Heavyweight which is part of what Community is about, where it doesn't matter who you are or what your weight is, what matters is who you are on the inside.Tony's of course is one that what you project outside is what makes you feel good inside and also is aiming for everyone to be a Superman. But that's a bad philosophy because obsession with image is vanity which is always a fleeting thing and trying to be a superman is of course the impossible dream because no one can logically get there. But as we see there is a great amount of isolation with him as he really has no friends, he has henchmen but that's all they are they don't count as real friends. And to me that is part of why Tony is really the one that is weak and the Heavyweights are truly strong.Heavyweights is the right weight on entertainment.Rating: 4 stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gerry Garner lives is overweight. His parents decide to send him to Camp Hope, a camp for overweight boys. The camp is owned by kindly Harvey Bushkin and his equally kind wife Alice Bushkin. When the Bushkins file for bankruptcy the camp has to be sold, it is bought by Tony Perkis. Tony plans to force the campers to lose as much weight as they can, and he also intends to document the marathon shedding of weight and use it for an infomercial for his slenderising program. In the eyes of the campers, Tony has made Camp Hope a living hell. As Gerry and counsellor Pat Finley lead the efforts to overthrow Tony, the campers prepare for the Apache Relay against arch rival Camp MVP. The Apache Relay is a race in which Camp Hope has never defeated Camp MVP before.Although there is nothing new going on here, its your typical rush release Disney film that is like most of the junk he cast eat, fun while it lasts but leaves you feeling a little empty after a short while.The token children are there, as are the fat jokes, and of course the instructor who is a little too hard on the kids and has an accent which cannot be connected to any country and thus no upsetting anyone.Stiller plays Goodman before Dodgeball, and if you've seen a Ben Stiller movie, you pretty much know what to expect, he's funny, but predictable.So all in all, its a fun movie, but you will have a pressing sense of déj? Vu, as this has been done so many times before.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a very entertaining movie for my kids who had never seen Meatballs, that great late 70s flick with Bill Murry, his first I believe. I was only 9 when that came out and had not seen it in about 10 years when I saw Heavyweights, but almost immediately the comparisions come flowing -- you can't help but see them. Same movie as Meatballs, but worse. My (5 yr) son thought it was funny at times. But "Meatballs" is ripped off throughout. Ultimately Meatballs is the far better movie. Many scenes taken straight from Meatballs. Go cart scene is same as Rudy the Rabbit race at end. They chant the counselor name like they chanted "Spaz" in Meatballs. Stiller is great. And this movie is a good view. But, Meatballs holds up much better now that this movie is 15 years old.</fullReview>

This movie made me dream of going to a camp where EVERYONE was the fat kid.This is just a cute movie that does a great job of showing team work, self esteem, and believing in yourself.It also shows how often 'fat' kids are their own worse enemies...which I've lived first hand. And Toni Perkis JR is portrayed by one of my favorite actors Ben Stiller....is the perfect example of people who try to undersand what it's like for 'fat' kids, but have NO idea.</fullReview>

I think this movie is very good at keeping away from the standard Disney movie cliches, and I recommend you watch this at once!!! I would have never had seen this had it not been in the movie theatre I worked in when I was younger. Let me tell you, this movie is definitely one of my most pleasant memories of my stint at the theatre!! Ben Stiller plays a crazed camp counselor, in what I consider to be his best and funniest performance. He is very convincing as a paranoid/richard simmons-ish/body by jack-ish fitness tyrant who tries to train a bunch of unreceptive overweight kids at a fat camp. They of course rebel, and it plays out in a comedic formula that isn't standard disney fare. I'm not a big fan of Disney movies, but if they were all this good, I'd probably be one of those yahoo's walking around with a Mickey Mouse letterman jacket. A must see, for anyone at any age, or any body size!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favorite movie of all time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Heavyweights is a 1995 comedy released by Walt Disney Pictures and directed by Steven Brill, the creator of the also hilarious Mighty Ducks movie (which is another favorite of mine). It is about overweight kids who are sent to a camp run by a fitness fanatic named Tony Pekis (Ben Stiller from "Meet the Parents") who is out to make their summer a nightmare. I first saw this movie when it came on Disney Channel about 3 or 4 years ago and since then I have bought and watched this movie over 12 times and I plan to see it many, many more times because this movie is absolutely hilarious and I think it is a Classic movie. From the very beginning to the end credits where the Camp Hope song is sung (which will have you laughing even more) and where Perkis becomes a door-to-door salesman (which is also hilarious) Heavyweights is (if you have a sense of humor) a great movie which I love to quote. One of my many favorite quotes is when Josh, (Goldberg from The Mighty Ducks films) says to Perkis "I know whose candy it is, okay. The candy belongs to seymour butts." Then Perkis replies, confused "Seymour butts?" "Seymour butts?" "Who's seymour butts, huh who's seymour butts?" then Josh says "Nobodys seen more butts than you Uncle Tony!" If you haven't seen this movie yet, the next time you are in a video store, consider renting this one. You shouldn't and I hope you won't be disappointed. You will laugh harder than you probably ever have at a PG film. Rating: Over the scale! (if you've seen the movie you get my joke).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What I like about Ben Stiller's movies.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well I've seen this movie a lot of times and I like it because it's an inspiring movie to a lot of people. It makes kids think that they can be overweight if they're comfortable with it. If kids are comfortable with being over weight it shouldn't matter to other people. I also like this movie because Tony Perkis (Ben Stiller) shakes things up with the fact that he has a problem with kids being overweight. He probably had a problem as a child being fat. He most likely thinks that because he was fat at one point in time that he can connect with these kids. But he is lowering their self-esteem with the things that he says. You don't see that from Ben Stiller in most movies that Ben Stiller stars in. He's more of the guy that gets beat and his self-esteem gets lowered. For example, in the movie, Dodgeball; An Underdog Story he thinks he's the best person in the beginning, but then he gets best and he starts gaining weight again. I couldn't help but notice the fact that Ben Stiller stars in a lot of movies about weight or stuff about health. I was wondering if he was overweight as a child.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a movie about a group of fat kids at a fat camp run by a fanatical health freak played brilliantly by the genius that is Ben Stiller. If you thought he was funny in "There's Something About Mary", you'll die when you see "Heavyweights". Although it at first appears to be your everyday, average, cheesy Disney movie, "Heavyweights" is a very funny movie that, although it makes fun of fat kids, is not in any way offensive, because it is far too stupid to actually take offense at. However, the only way I would not recommend this movie to someone is if they have a big plug up their bum, and wouldn't know a good time if it jumped up and bit them. So, if you've got an hour and a half on your hands, and want to have a nice, easy, viewing experience, watch "Heavyweights".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like "Dodgeball," just stupid and silly enough to be entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not a great comedy nor is it even as funny or even as "Dodgeball." But Ben Stiller's character here is very similar to his character in "Dodgeball" and I view it as a continuation of the same general person -- an obsessive, delusional, insane fitness instructor.In "Heavy Weights" Stiller is the new instructor at a "fat kid camp" who at first appears to be quite normal and nice but, once the parents turn their backs, transforms into a vicious fitness guru bent on turning the fat kids into a bunch of slim, well-adjusted teenagers.This movie lacks the most basic intellectual intelligence and common sense -- Stiller's motivation is slight and what will he do to silence the children once they leave camp? Nevertheless it's quite a funny little film that doesn't attempt to be anything other than a simple family story.For a PG Disney movie this is entertaining enough to please older audiences and adult enough in its material in certain places to raise an eyebrow or two. The ending is way over-the-top, but then again so is Stiller -- and he's really the reason to watch this in the first place.</fullReview>

To truly appreciate how funny Stiller's performance is, you should watch "White Water Summer" and then watch "Heavyweights" it adds some much more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>fun but could have been better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jerry does not want to go to summer camp. Worse yet, they're sending him to 'fat camp.' But his parents insist. On the plane he meets one of the other kids, Roy (a standout character), and it looks like things are going to be better than he thought. The bus driver, Pat, who takes a group of boys to Camp Hope, is also the counselor for Jerry and Roy's cabin, and a cool guy who has been at the camp for many years. It's quite funny to watch the boys unload the candy they sneaked into camp and hide it.Things start out fun. Unfortunately, the beloved owners of the camp (Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara) sell the place to a fitness guru who is more than a little obsessed, seeing as how he once weighed 300 pounds but is now normal weight. New, tough counselors are brought in (Pat is reassigned within the camp and replaced with a man who talks like Arnold Schwarzenegger but is not nearly as good an actor). The candy must go, of course. The boys' lives are made miserable, and it gets worse when they can't meet their weight loss goals. Another problem: competitions with the other boys' camp, including an exciting one at movie's end. Early in the movie, though, in a baseball game the other team scores in the double digits while Camp Hope has zero. Then, in the second inning .... Pat and the pretty nurse Julie (possible romance here?) come up with a way to get rid of the new camp owner, but going through official channels would take too long. So the boys must take care of the situation themselves. This movie was a lot of fun but there were some parts I didn't care for that much. I personally didn't like Ben Stiller's outrageous performance as the dictatorial camp owner (the younger Stiller was later the man's father as well), but I'm sure lots of people will. As is usual for movies like this, the boys are quite inspiring in their efforts to solve their various problems.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a very funny movie. Ben Stiller's in it, so you know it's good. If you haven't seen this yet, check it out. The movie has some lame, childish parts, but overall it's very funny, and I think it sends a good message to kids. This is a hilarious movie, and I'm disappointed that it's been rated so low. Ben Stiller is god!! Yeah, yeah, go get 'em, tiger!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>BIG laughs!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is quite possibly one of the funniest, smartest movies I've seen in a long time. Heavyweights is underrated. Sure this is a few grossout jokes which I can always do without but I've seen much, much worse. For what this film is, I found it suprisingly well-acted and directed(The dance is great). This is not Ben Stiller's movie although he gives a delightfully over-the-top performance as Tony Perkis who ranks up there as one of the best cinematic baddies since Glenn Close in Fatal Attraction. The film's moral is somewhere along the lines of believe in yourself and you can overcome...blah blah blah. Standard stuff but the execution is superb. The film treats the subject matter of obesity very well making it seem like a disability and social barrier for the characters and brings us to the realization that "Who Cares?". Good stuff, clean cut fun. I'd recommend it to kids, it was made for them anyways, besides a lot of kid flicks nowadays are poorly done fart jokes or extremely violent. Heavyweights has few but well done fart jokes and there is no violence, just BIG fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This move would of been better if it weren't a Disney flick. I don't think it is offensive but to be taken as a joke and anyone else need to look at themselves before commenting about this film. Personally I'm more of a Tony Perkis than a fat Pat. I find it offensive that the instructor was labeled a crazy. Its because he was not the same. In fact I find this movie offensive to skinny people.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow. Just when you think Disney can't stoop any lower in the 'feelgood-family-fare' genre, along come "Heavyweights". In an age when health experts are advocating more exercise and a healthier lifestyle, Disney obviously preferred to take the low road on the matter. The movie trumpets a valuable message on self-esteem and acceptance of others, but at what price? Cheap laughs at the expense of fat people. And granted, while healthy folks come in all shapes and sizes, the sheer gluttony and excess in parts of this...thing...makes it downright disgusting. This is absolute rock bottom. And Ben Stiller, where's your pride?To quote Homer Simpson (a true expert on the subject): "That's a load of rich, creamery butter."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing great but still funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was a little surprised at Heavyweights. It was an actually very funny movie. Stupid, but funny. The characters are likable and Ben Stiller, who plays the work out obsessed manager of the camp, is at his best. Its also mean spirited to overweight kids but some kids that are bigger might feel OK after watching this film. And the kids in the film, which include Shaun Weiss, Kenan Thompson, and Aaron Schwarts, are charming, if not at times a little vulgar. But the film has no soul to it so, its not a failure, but its a pretty ordinary family film. Still, you'll wanna watch it for the funny jokes and fair acting by the kids. Its not a great movie, its not even a good movie, but its a good little time waster.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has one saving grace - Ben Stiller's performance as the messed up, under-achieving son of Western Pennsylvania's "Light Fixture King" attempting what looks like "yet another get rich quick scheme". His hyper-hyper spouting of new age jargon and motivational-speak is perfectly over-acted. Every moment he's on-screen is hilarious and hilariously frightening when one thinks that there are actually people out there who aren't very far off the character Stiller lampoons here. In any case, because of him, and have no doubt that the role of Tony Perkis could have easily been butchered by a less-talented actor, this film is worth watching - once. The too-funny introductory speech Stiller's character makes to the hapless campers is priceless and indicative of his entire performance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heavyweights is a HEAVY movie weighed Mindfully</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remember that this is a movie about kids who could stand to lose a few pounds around the midsection. It is a great movie about this matter, but not the most well acted movies by Ben Stiller, but certainly better than "The Cable Guy"(1996). Doesn't Ben's character in this film resemble the character in Fox's "Dodgeball"(2004) a little TOO much? The story line is funny, I will give it that, but does not have the pizazz that movies with Stiller have. What makes the film less desirable than what it should be is that Stiller's real parents, Jerry and Anne are also in this. All in all, I give it 7/10 rating. Good enough for a family film for kids.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Loved it! Very entertaining, very original. One of Ben Stillers funny movies. Looks like a kid show but is actually very funny for ages 9-17. Great actors, loved Lars! Nice to see him have a little bit of a comeback from Steel Magnolias. It keeps you glued to your seat and once you think its over it isn't. It starts off when Jerry Garner is sent to Camp Hope (Fat Camp) by his mother and father. While there he meets some friends including Roy (Kenan Thompson; Good Burger, Kenan and Kel, All that, etc..) and Josh (Shaun Weiss; Mighty Ducks). When the owners of Camp Hope, Harvy and Alice Bushkin announce that they are no longer the owners of Camp Hope. Unfortunately, the new owner, is nothing but a health nut with a twisted mind; Tony Perkis (Ben Stiller). It starts off when the kids have some weight gaining privilege's taken away, like their candy hiding spots or The Blob. From here, the campers decide to take a peek into Tony's bunk and find some of their letters written home, locked inside of a trunk. As they manage to escape, dangerous times await them. But when Tony takes them on a 20 mile hike up a mountain, the boys come up with a little plan of their own. I wont say much, but I will say that it includes the three B's: A Bare ass, a Booby trap, and a Big mess of trouble!</fullReview>

This is Ben Stiller's best film possibly and he is probably one of the funniest characters in film history too as Tony Perkins with the stud kind of accent. Going to Fat Camp, you know it's going to be a funny movie just by hearing it. There were a lot of good fat characters in it that made me laugh a lot. Also that Lars guy is so funny with his accent also. What happened to him anyways? He just disappeared in showing up in any more movies. But oh well, he still will be remembered.

		<fullReview>A movie that seeks to make being fat "okay" needs to be condemned. It's not okay. It's unhealthy. We should not glorify a bunch of fat asses with no aspirations for triumphing over the neighboring camp. They even have to cheat to win, so any way you look at it, this movie has no moral value, not even the tired "be yourself and you'll be great" crap they try to pull. Truly a waste of time to watch, even to see how bad it is. The only real talent in the movie is Ben Stiller who is cast as the hyperactive camp owner. He spends most of the movie being maligned for trying to improve the health of the campers, albeit in a manner that is somewhat abrasive. Of course, retribution comes when he is injured in a tiger pit and then tortured by an electrified containment cell, an act condoned by the camp nurse and two counselors. Truly, a movie our children should see: problems? Well, imprisonment and torture are great solutions.</fullReview>

The children are pouting way to much about dieting and exercise?? OH GOD, NO! Sits ups,jogging,eating salads and lean meat!!Give me a break, if I were Ben I'd put those kids in boot camp too. This movie is way too left minded, and way too sad. I wouldn't be surprised if all of those kids have a heart attack at 25. Should have listened to Ben, kiddies.And what really made me mad was when the obese kids were quizzed against the normal weight kids about math/science/history, and the normal weight kids didn't know anything. Disney should be ashamed for promoting obesity and insinuating that obese children are smarter than normal weight children.This is by far, the worst movie Disney has ever made.</fullReview>

"Heavy Weights" is worthless another story of cool kids taking on an evil adult (well, what else could it be, seeing as to how it comes from Disney?). To add insult to injury, this movie seems to be promoting obesity. They stack the whole thing with flatulence when there's nothing else to do and play everything so that we know exactly what's going to happen. Absolutely dreadful.

		<fullReview>I'd take very seriously the classification of "children movie", provided the children aren't too smart. This movie is terribly stupid in its main concepts (concepts? what a exaggeration). The plot fits in a nutshell: a bunch of overweight teens demonstrate that fit people are ignorant and psychopathic, and fight back. Depressive. As a movie, every good chance for good comedy is wasted. The supposed sadistic torturer (Ben Stiller, good in his part) is never taken seriously, the story moves on clumsily and without an order. Characters are superficial, the gags were old at the times of the Lumiere brothers... The whole is pathetic. 'nuff said.</fullReview>
