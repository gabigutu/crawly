		<shortDescription>I can't believe the shills in the comments here.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Great Documentary. Theater was packed here. I'm not a big fan of the time-line of corruption being all tied together (in a conspiracy fashion). But breaking off each story and examining them is super interesting. If there is one thing I learned the democratic party are professionals at covering their tracks and rewriting history.These other reviews are hilarious. You really think some guy read all of Dinesh's books and watched all his movies. THEN, comes on IMDb to attack his character in the review section of his new movie(a day before the movie's release)? Never forget Hillary's $10 million spent on social media companies to help control her image. Always look at a user's post history then laugh when you realize they are getting paid minimum wage to shill for Hillary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Expose of History.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It doesn't open wide until Jul 22, but 3 days prior there's already an enormous canyon between the critics (10%) and the audience (76%) on Rotten Tomatoes. What did we expect? The movie opens saying it was based on truth, but I think it's better to say that it's a documentation of suppressed history. I learned a lot and it confirmed a lot. One newbie for me is Ida B. Wells, one of the founders of the NAACP, who was a Republican and worked for a Republican newspaper in Chicago, documenting lynchings, working for women's suffrage, and was even thrown off a train for refusing to give up her seat on the first class ladies coach in 1884. (In a twist, she sued the RR but lost when her black lawyer sold out. Then she hired a white lawyer and won! But that was overturned by the no doubt all white, Tenn Supreme Court). Her home is a Chicago landmark, but till now she's a near nothing but a footnote to history, and an embarrassment to the Democrat Party.The high point for me was when D'Souza came through and revealed facts that showed Lyndon Johnson to be the corrupt, vulgar racist he always was and remained, and explained why Johnson did what he did. It is a very powerful sequence. And of course the details of Hillary's background are eye-openers if not stomach grinders.The actors, when used, are pretty cheesy, but otherwise it's a respectable production. The facts are there for all to see and take home to verify. Those already on the political right will appreciate the details and confirmation he provides, and it will certainly help tip the scales further away from Hillary by Independents.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I see a lot of critics and nay Sayers on these review trying to make it an us against them controversy. The reality is that it was a great piece of research work and backs everything with references and public record. Certainly worth watching if you are at all interested in All Lives Matter or campaign finance. Interesting detail about how she helped to prosecute Nixon. The commentary is a bit verbose and tends to repeat topics several times to get the point across but does little to add to the story. Taking news footage and showing what the right hand was doing while the left hand was hiding the cards was incredible. A must watch for all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Might make you look at the Democratic party in a different light</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are looking for a neutral political documentary then this isn't it. This movie is a no-holds-barred attack on the Democrat party and Hillary Clinton through dramatization.It's titled Hillary's America but that title is a little misleading. The movie focuses more on the Democratic party than it does on Hillary Clinton. It only starts delving specifically into Hillary in the last 35 minutes of the movie.This movie deals in absolutes. The Democrats are cast as absolute villains and the Republicans are portrayed as absolute angels. The movie tells us the Democratic party started off consisting mostly of slave owners but became con-artists and scammers after slavery ended to enslave people again through other means. The actor who played Lyndon B. Johnson was spot on. Also, the actress who portrayed young Hillary looked very much like her.I'm not going to vote for Hillary, the mediocre score i'm giving the movie just reflects how i thought of the movie in general. The reenactments and the dramatics were over the top. I would have been happy if it was just a straight documentary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I suggest you come and watch this movie! In a matter of 100 minutes, you will be see, hear and experience some amazing, closeted facts about the Clinton corruption machine and some of the dark secrets of the Democratic Party. Those secrets "the party" wants to keep hidden in their closet.****** Warning ******** This is not a movie for those who have already made up their minds about Hillary and she is your Presidential pick come hell or high water (those reviewers are listed here with a zero rating for this movie). Perhaps you also believe that Trump is everything the mass media would have you believe? If so, save your money and go watch back to bed after watching a dreamy Disney flick.However, if you seek the truth and have the fortitude to handle the truth, then do yourself and America a favor. Go see this movie tonight with five of your good friends who still aren't sure who they are going to vote for come November. Certainly see this movie BEFORE you go out and vote!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why is it that liberals are so intolerant and violent?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie depicts the reasoning behind why liberal democrats are so intolerant of conservatives. Liberals (Democrats) in America have become so radicalized that they resort to violence to force their message upon others. It's a case of do as I say not as I do. Their systematic approach to changing America into their image of America is in itself intolerant of other's views. They are ruining America by their closed minded actions. This movie objectively states the facts for you to see and allows you to make a judgment of the facts. This is a must see movie before it's too late to change course. My comments are not intended to be political instead they are intended to objectively review this must see movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Notice: I didn't like the movie so much that I actually put in my first review. Now, I've been informed multiple times that I'm a paid hillary shill. So, if this is your first response to anyone who disagrees with you, go see this movie. YOU WILL LOVE IT. It is full of every single bit of conspiracy theory you can imagine, all stitched together in a slick way to you don't notice the leaps in logic. It's perfect for you. GO SEE IT. Bring some Lube and a box of tissues.my actual review from someone who is "mostly" libertarian: This was like a complete dump of every fox news conspiracy theory and debunked tin-foil hat theory combined. Honestly, I thought I'd learn something, but it was a endless troll of, "Here's something true... and this.. and so therefore this... and oh, here's a little lie... and so if those are true then SHE IS THE DEVIL!!"ugh.don't waste your time. And certainly don't let this determine your political opinions. Try fact-check before you go get hammered with this nonsense.What I really think someone ought to do is to figure out who in the world paid for this thing. Obviously, it wasn't made to bring in a bunch of money, but the funding companies seem to be impossible to find on the internet.Look for actual problems and actual facts. There are quite enough to help you make your decision without this fake-documentary crap.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This just goes to show you what lengths the RNC will go to to shut down Hillary. I was a Bernie supporter and if the RNC had picked almost anyone but Trump I might have taken this more seriously. But both sides have used dirty tactics en-order to push their agenda on the American people. It's too bad that both parties have turned into the "It's my way or the highway" way of thinking. There use to be a time when the two parties worked together to meet somewhere in the middle and things actually got done. But with Trump as the RNC's choice, the only hope for the country is Hillary and this film is mostly BS and should be taken as such. But then it was made for people who have already made up their minds about Hillary since it won't sway anyone with half a brain.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Biased</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dinesh D'Souza is neither an investigative reporter, nor a historian. He is a mediocre filmmaker, whose films are as biased to the right as Michael Moore's films are biased to the left. Neither Moore nor D'Souza show a complete, accurate picture of the truth, only the filmmaker's biased opinion. Political Documentary Filmmakers shoot hundreds of hours of film, then edit down to a couple of hours of scenes which are aligned with their opinion. They show facts out of context, and fabricate things for entertainment purposes. If you already agree with right wing views, you will love this movie. If you agree with left wing views, you will hate it. If you have middle-of-the-road ideals, you'll just be disappointed. Either way, you don't need to waste valuable minutes of your life actually watching it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A truly awful far right propaganda piece masquerading as documentary who's only objective is to engage in character assassination of Hilary Clinton and the Democratic Party. The same filmmaker tried the same thing before with the equally awful "Obama's America", which impressed nobody other than rabid right-wingers. There's little to enthuse even conservative or mainstream republican film critics and viewers, who would prefer to spend time in a theatre watching something genuinely thought provoking about a complex personality and party.No different to the previous effort this will be applauded by the converted, which will jack up in user ratings but by nobody else.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'HILLARY'S America: THE SECRET HISTORY OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY': Zero Stars (Out of Five)The new propaganda documentary flick, from writer/director Dinesh D'Souza (the man who also brought us the 2012 hit '2016: OBAMA'S America'). D'Souza once again co-wrote and co-directed the movie, this time with Bruce Schooley; the two filmmakers also co-wrote and co-directed the 2014 exploitation documentary flick 'America: IMAGINE THE WORLD WITHOUT HER'. In this film, D'Souza and Schooley analyze what (they think) presidential nominee Hillary Clinton's true motives are; by also examining the history of the Democratic Party. Like 'OBAMA'S America', the film is yet another attempt to sway the upcoming presidential election. It's gotten almost unanimously negative reviews from critics; and it's scored an average rating of 1.5 out of 10, on the website Rotten Tomatoes! I agree; it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen.The film begins with D'Souza explaining how (he thinks) the U.S. government unfairly treated him, for his unlawful campaign donations (to a politician friend). D'Souza believes President Obama was seeking revenge, for his 2012 documentary film ('2016: OBAMA'S America'), by giving him a much harsher sentence than he deserved. D'Souza than goes on to explain that the Democratic Party has always had sinister motives, since it's conception, and Hillary Clinton is yet another villain of that party. Republicans are the true 'champions of justice and equality', according to this movie.Being a progressive Independent, I definitely don't agree with D'Souza's politics; but I'm also not a fan of Hillary Clinton (at all), or the Democratic Party either. Even putting all politics aside though, this film is just really poorly made. D'Souza is one of the worst filmmakers of recent times (he's also a horrible actor), but this movie actually makes 'OBAMA'S America' look somewhat aptly made! The film's 'talking points' are completely irrational, and the filmmakers often contradict themselves (throughout the entire movie). The narrative makes no sense either. The majority of the film is told through really poorly done (and extremely corny) reenactments; that are filled with atrocious acting, and unbearable melodrama. These scenes are also extremely cartoonish too (and ridiculously over-the-top); making the movie feel much more like a historical spoof, than a serious documentary film! The movie actually reminds me (a lot) of 'DRUNK HISTORY' (because of this); but it's also painfully boring. For a large chunk of the film's running time, I also wondered if D'Souza would ever bring Hillary Clinton into the story (he finally does, in the movie's final 30 minutes). I also wonder what D'Souza would have done, with the film, if Bernie Sanders had won the Democratic nomination. Would he have re-shot those portions of the movie, and re-titled the film 'Bernie's America'? What kind of possible 'sinister motives' could D'Souza have tried to attribute to Sanders, and how would it have fit with the rest of the movie's narrative (being that Bernie Sanders was always an Independent, before this election)? Worst of all, the film just left me feeling really dirty (like really nasty exploitation flicks often do); I felt like I needed to rush to take a shower, when it was finally over! This film definitely won't be swaying anyone's vote, that's for sure.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/WJl7HNQ4N_4</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Republican KKK is okay?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie tells us a great deal about the first 185 years of this country but almost nothing about the last 50.Most of the argument is guilt by association. President Andrew Jackson, founder of the Democratic Party, seized the lands of American Indians in the 1830's. Democratic President Andrew Johnson returned lands to slave holders after the Civil War. Democratic President Woodrow Wilson segregated government jobs in the 1910's. Democratic President Franklin Roosevelt agreed with racist Southern Democratic Congress members to restrict blacks' access to New Deal benefits in the 1930's. (No mention of the fact that he couldn't have passed the New Deal programs at all without support from those Southern Democrats, or that his wife Eleanor was a tireless advocate for blacks.) But now that the KKK supports Donald Trump, there's no need to mention that in the film. Guilt by association only counts against Democrats.D'Souza also implies that President Obama is in some sort of alliance with the authoritarian leader of Russia, Vladimir Putin. No mention of the fact that Trump and Putin have expressed admiration for each other.D'Souza poses as an impartial scholar of American history. Early in the film are obviously fictionalized scenes of him in a short jail term for illegal campaign contributions. In the film, there is a clear implication that D'Souza, as a harmless, scholarly man, doesn't deserve to be locked up with the "rough" characters he was in with. But this presents him with a clever angle for the film. He claims to have had a conversation with gang members in the halfway house who told him the way scams work. You lie to people to sell them life insurance and then murder them to collect on it. A gang member is supposed to have told him that the government is the most successful at scams.This conversation (which I doubt ever happened) gives D'Souza an opportunity to claim the Democratic Party is one big scam. It's always been about stealing from deserving people to give to undeserving people. It was that in the 1830's when it stole the Indians' lands; in the 1860's, when it took land black farmers had been rightfully given by Republican Abraham Lincoln; in the 1910's, when it took decent jobs from black government workers; and in the 1930's, when African Americans didn't get the same benefits whites got.But how does D'Souza take the story from there? Obviously blacks and other minorities now mainly support Democrats. How can he make the case that the theft is still going on? He uses two ploys to make the case. The first is to point out that more Republicans voted for civil rights legislation in 1964 than Democrats. This obviously glosses over the facts that Democrats in the South at that time were mainly segregationists and that the Republican Party was a lot more moderate then than it is now. However, 1964 Republican nominee Barry Goldwater opposed civil rights legislation. D'Souza also insinuates, based on no evidence I have seen, that President Lyndon Johnson was a closet racist.His other ploy is to make a false comparison between the South and the North. First, when blacks moved to the North, they created a "plantation culture." Blacks lived with other blacks and had businesses that mainly catered to other blacks. No mention of the fact that those were the only neighborhoods and businesses they could get.On the South, D'Souza claims that it didn't become Republican until it became "less racist." As a white person who's lived in the South for 11 years, I know that's false. While certainly not all Republicans in the South are racists, there is still a pattern of reduced opportunity for blacks in the South. For example, Alabama, where I live, is one of the few states that provide no funding for transit, which is disproportionately used by blacks. The attitude of white legislators seems to be "we gave them integration. That's all they have coming." As a result, there are a lot of low-income people forced to buy cars they can't afford.D'Souza's arguments are the most outrageously hypocritical I have seen.The film ends by depicting Hillary and Bill Clinton as unsavory characters. Hillary is the only one who's really interested in politics, and it's just for her personal aggrandizement. But she figured out early on that she could use her charismatic husband with an eye for other women to further her career. When women were victimized by Bill, Hillary defended him.One obvious question: if she's the only one who really cares about politics or public service, how come he ran for president? Now, I have no intention of arguing that the Clintons are without faults. Bill did have a serious problem with women, and it may be true that Hillary didn't recognize their victimization when she should have sometimes. It may be true that the Clinton Foundation isn't always above reproach. But how realistic is it to think that a couple involved in politics and public service for 40 years will never do anything wrong? Bill Clinton's weaknesses may in some ways go along with his strengths: he has awesome social skills, and perhaps when paired with power, that exposed him to temptations others did not face.Finally, I'd like to pose the question: how good is the alternative D'Souza supports, Donald Trump? The only thing that could possibly make him think Trump is better than Hillary Clinton is believing the nonsense he presents in this film. Too often people delude themselves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Conservative's America: The Secret Of An Awful Documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've probably seen a thousand or so documentaries, and this is quite possibly the worst I've ever seen. The only considerable competitors would be 2016: Obama's America and Imagine The World Without Her, two other films created by Indian immigrant Dinesh D'Souza. It is very clear to me that D'Souza knew stupid buck-toothed rednecks would pay for and praise anything that pandered to their pro-conservative credence, so D'Souza is a genius in a way. I truly do not think he believes all the nonsense in this documentary to be true. Told in flashback, D'Souza claims he walked into the Pentagon and discovered a Democratic room filled with whips, chains, and metal neck collars, as an tribute to the KKK. He also claims that LBJ was incredibly racist and secretly owned slaves while in office, on top of watching Birth Of A Nation once a night in his home theater. Anyone who thinks this is factual deserves to lose their minimum wage on an overpriced ticket for this movie.The movie is called "Hillary's America" yet Hillary doesn't become a prominent thing until the last 20 minutes. Instead, the film discusses the racist (?) acts in the Democratic party, using programs like Planned Parenthood to prove that Democrats are all racist, sexist, and homophobic. Trying to make your party sound better by using these antidotes is a poor move, because the only conservative's who'd believe and enjoy this would probably disagree with an anti-homophobe agenda. Oh well, D'Souza just wanted to make a quick buck and he got it. It still shocks me that something this atrocious and backyardian could cost $6 million, whereas 18-year-old Tyler Wright can make a documentary about his awful garage metal band or his high school football team for $250 and make it thousands of times more factual and interesting than this, or maybe a Mongolian documentary about the tribes that still reign there to this day. Go see those kinds of movies, because they take a certain intellect and raw passion. If I wanted someone to blindly bash a political affiliation and make clearly false claims about said party, I'd just go across town to pick a fight with a redneck who probably just got back from seeing this film in theaters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More Propaganda From Dinesh D'Souza</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILER ALERT: At the end of "Hillary's America," there are two full-scale orchestral and vocal renditions of "God Bless America" and "The Star-Spangled Banner." In the theater where I viewed the film, one patron stood up and extended her arms during those two songs. Another patron simply raised her arm in a salute that resembled those in Italy and Germany in the 1930s.The film begins with a retrospective of the eight months Dinesh D'Souza spent in a "community confinement center" for making an illegal political campaign contribution. The film provides no details on why D'Souza did not appeal the case all the way to the Republican friendly Supreme Court. After all, the thesis of the film is that the Republican Party has the greater tradition in America of being friendly to outcasts and marginalized groups who have been exploited, repressed, and harassed by the Democrats. And D'Souza clearly sees himself as one of the victims in the vast conspiracy of the DNP.Much of the film is a history lesson about such presidents as Andrew Jackson and Woodrow Wilson, who were indeed racists and, in the case of Jackson, was responsible for the tragic "Trail of Tears" relocation project of the Cherokee tribe in the 1830s. These details were accurately presented in the film and are important for all Americans to know about their past.Yet, there is a major flaw in D'Souza's understanding of the American political party system, which is in the process of constant change. The Republican Party of the time of Abraham Lincoln bears little resemblance to the Republican Party of 2016. Likewise, Jackson's Democratic Party is a far cry from the Democrats of today. D'Souza wants viewers to believe there is a direct connection between Lincoln and Reagan, Jackson and Wilson, and that the political parties have sustained the same ideology for over two hundred years. The superficial analogies D'Souza attempts to draw are simply not persuasive for anyone with even a rudimentary knowledge of American politics. Even in the early part of the twenty-first century, the two parties have changed in character. Quite simply, the entire premise of this film is erroneous.The section of the film that attacked the Clintons was also underdeveloped and unpersuasive. A troubling allegation was made about the ethics of the Clinton Foundation, particularly in the use of funds to provide relief to the earthquake victims of Haiti. But the film did not probe deeply into this topic. It raised the question that Hillary's lost e-mails might offer proof that millions of dollars were improperly used from Clinton Foundation fund for the crisis in Haiti. Yet D'Souza was unable to provide any concrete evidence of wrongdoing.While this film is pure propaganda, it is surprising that it could have generated a big budget and space in movie theaters for feature film presentations. It is obviously generating good box office revenue. But the reviews on this website do not suggest that viewers are looking at the film with a critical eye.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yikes, everyone. What is going on here? This is another hastily slapped together documentary by a filmmaker who in his previous film presented himself as knowing exactly what President Obama was subconsciously thinking/dreaming about his father, with absolutely no supporting evidence; just pure speculation and subjectivity. In several interviews when he went on his promotional tour, Dinesh D. was never able to even remotely defend the key points of his book/film, even when he had repeated opportunities to get his story straight. So now he's doing something similar: demonizing Ms. Clinton just as he tried to make everyone fear Obama's alleged ingrained anti-colonialism. Of course, you can say anything about anyone, doesn't mean it's true. Unless there is real evidence. Not conspiracy nonsense. Look, if you're willing to give this film 10 stars, you realize your review is vacuous since your putting it on par with classic films like the Shawshank Redemption and Goodfellas... Seriously? It's stuff like this that makes me sad and wonder if this country will ever get it together...</fullReview>

The ACTUAL truth is enough if the GOP would stop shooting themselves in the foot, not this crazy stuff people want to believe about her.Kasich would win in a landslide, but no, the GOP had to spend decades (thanks Gingrich) whipping up the crazy and stupid and this is what you get - Trump beating Kasich.Seriously, any previous Republican candidate would beat Hillary Clinton. The only two who would lose are Trump and Cruz, ironically the last two left standing after the crazies dominated the RNC.What a disappointment.Anyhow, back to the movie itself - absolute garbage.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst Movie I've Ever Watched</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a "documentary" about the "history" or the Democratic Party. The movie is called "Hillary's America" and it rarely mentions Hillary Clinton. The movie instead talks about how the Democrats are responsible for everything bad in America and that they are also a political party full of racists, despite the fact that the current president is African American. It blames Democrats for the death of Abraham Lincoln. This is simply nearly two hours of a convicted felon calling the audience racist for not being Republican. The director also blames the government for sending him to prison after he knowingly. and willingly broke the law. I did not finish watching this movie and I asked for a refund after walking out. I do not want to give my money to a man calling Democrats the Slavery party when the leader of the Ku Klux Klan is publicly endorsing the Republican candidate. If you are thinking about seeing this movie, don't. If you are smart you will stay far away from this film. I can already tell you that just five minutes of research will prove everything this movie says to be false. If you want to see made up history, watch Drunk History. That is at least a little enjoyable where as this movie is the complete opposite of enjoyment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just more right wing propaganda from a conservative fanatic and known criminal.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In January 2014, D'Souza was indicted by federal prosecutors for campaign finance law violations. In May 2014, D'Souza pleaded guilty to one felony count of making illegal contributions in the names of others. September 2014, the court sentenced D'Souza to five years probation, eight months in a halfway house (referred to as a "community confinement center") and a $30,000 fine, rejecting the prosecutor's recommendations of prison time. Or else he could have made a smash prison movie!On July 7, 2015, D'Souza circulated a photo-shopped image of Hillary Clinton, purporting that it showed her with a confederate flag in the background. The original image had no such flag. That was how he began to promote this piece of trash which should never be called a movie. In March 2016, it was announced that D'Souza would release a "movie" entitled Hillary's America: The Secret History of the Democratic Party on July 25, 2016, ahead of the 2016 U.S. presidential election. This is that. It is typical right-wing conspiracy nonsense that would cause most history teachers like myself to grind their teeth throughout the whole endeavor.A better movie would have been about his affair with a married woman, Denise Odie Joseph, while married himself to his first wife, Dixie Brubaker, which caused him to lose his position at King's College for immorality. He did not marry that mistress, however, but married instead Deborah Fancher, a conservative political activist and divorced mother of two. Pastor Rafael Cruz, father of Texas senator Ted Cruz, officiated. (Yes, the fellow Donald Trump accused of being involved in the assassination of JFK!) That would have been a much better conspiracy film than this tripe. However, I imagine he will make a fair pile of money marketing this to uneducated brainwashed misogynists. P.T. Barnum was obviously correct. A sucker is born every minute.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Garbage propaganda from a convicted felon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, the filmmaker here is a convicted felon: In May 2014, D'Souza pleaded guilty to one felony count of making illegal contributions in the names of others. D'Souza told the presiding judge, "I knew that causing a campaign contribution to be made in the name of another was wrong and something the law forbids. I deeply regret my conduct." Knowing this, why would anyone even take what this filmmaker has to say seriously? I watched this film out of curiosity, but even as a registered independent that voted for George W. Bush twice, I can't even stomach the lies this film spins. Fact check what this filmmaker claims after you watch the film, and see for yourself: Literally nothing he claims is true. That makes him worse than Michael Moore, the leftist "documentary" filmmaker that ought to have his license to direct revoked. Dinesh D'Souza is worse. I basically equated this film to one of those "God's Not Dead" narratives, and I wasn't the only one in the theater laughing at this movie when I saw it. If you "like" this film? You ought to have your head examined, because clearly you possess no critical-thinking skills of your own or any common sense in accepting objective fact over subjective truth. My only regret is the $5 I paid to see this film, which will probably end up being illegally donated to Drumpf's campaign.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most powerful delivery of the truth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>History, facts, logic, reason, and evidence are presented in this film through an objective lens. D'souza's abridged history lesson in this movie is a fair and accurate representation of America's political history, particularly the Democratic party and what truths about Hillary that have leaked to the public's view.From a visual production standpoint Hillary's America is top notch. The cinematography has its ups and downs but overall is very well done and keeps a serious and dramatic tone. The acting hits all the notes, never feeling cheesy or forced. The reenactments were believable and the exploration of history was compelling and the stock footage chilling. The pace between the various acts was great never feeling slow or dull.The writing was very well done and concise. My only criticism is that the conclusions drawn from the research could have been reiterated with a little bit more impact at times. But where the message counts the movie certainly delivers and relies on verifiable history, mainstream news coverage, and personal testimonies spoken by the people in question themselves.There is no "conspiratorial" speculation in this movie as critics claim (the same critics who give people like Michael Moore a free pass in this area). The bias in media and public education is clear as day as this obvious history has been swept under the rug and the wool pulled over everyone's eyes, even Democrats in denial. The Democratic establishment in media will do everything in their power to keep people from seeing this film. Any Democrat who plugs their ears calling this film propaganda are anti- intellectuals. This is a fair representation of history and is not meant to be deceiving, so by definition isn't propaganda. If you're an intellectual or just a plain decent American, go and see Hillary's America.</fullReview>

Liberal sycophants defame and abuse the context of this film, yet I've yet to hear anyone in the Democrat Party consistently and publicly deny most of what D'Souza puts forth.

In short I learned a lot from this very interesting and powerful movie. Dinesh D'Souza brings a fresh incisive and objective look at the US not unlike that of a modern de Tocqueville.

My current knowledge of Hillary and Bill's fiascoes in recent history are fresh in my mind, and I must say that I'm a bit taken back by her attitude towards serious offenses that she has committed, but I was careful to write down the facts concerning the Democratic Party because I'm always wary of political bias. No movie is completely objective, and this one is no exception, but the facts about the Democratic Party are spot on, from slavery to the founding of the Ku Klux Klan, to the attempt to block the 13th, 14th and 15th amendments. Those were only some of the more startling facts that I was able to write down. I will get the disk when it comes out and research the remaining information, but the dark history of the Democratic Party fits in perfectly with what is happening today with Hillary's deleting over 3000 emails, doing nothing about Benghazi and then blaming it on a video, and the missing funds that were allocated for charity, but instead went to the Clinton Foundation's offshore accounts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Excellent Documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, there's some things you have to think about.1. This is documentary meant to attack Hillary Clinton, and show the not-so-taught history of the Democratic Party.2. People are cry babies.3. This IS NOT a Trump advertisement. D'Souza briefly mentions Trump being attacked for certain things, but NEVER endorses him in any way.So don't listen to people who give it a 1 star just because they disagree with it, love Hillary, hate Trump, and refuse to learn history.I am rating this movie on how well it executes it's purpose (attacking Hillary, and show history of Democratic Party) and that is something it does very good at.No, the movie isn't a 2 hour rant about her emails, in fact, her doesn't touch on that area a whole lot. The first half of the movie, is nothing but pure history of the Democratic Party dating to Jackson. Now of course, I'm well informed in politics and I know that there was a "party swap", and I feared he would have overlooked that (in which case i would have given this movie a 5) but he didn't. He explains perfectly and uses evidence to show that the "party swap" is misunderstood, and actually strengthens his stance.But after the first half of the movie, he turns his focus to Hillary. Scandal after Scandal. All the millions the Clintons have obtained and how. He backs up all his claims with evidence. Footage. It's terrifying. But even through all the terrifying evidence, he does crack a joke every now and then.My one critique of the movie is it's very overly patriotic ending. I think the message of the movie would have stuck a little more if the movie just abruptly ended, letting all the terror sink in.I know I kept this review quite vague, but that's because you need to see it for yourself. Whether you like it or hate it, it's worth a watch.</fullReview>

The overall pace of the documentary is very good and constantly interesting. I'm glad he kept it under 2 hours, but if I had to add one more thing to his litany of damning evidence of the corruption of the democratic party, I would have included Madam Pelosi &amp; Mr. Reid and all of their shenanigans of the 2007 &amp; 2008 congress, (in which Hillary played a part) which allowed for the financial crisis of 2008. The same players that support Obama are all in for Hillary. They past laws that worsened an already bad situation, and then rescinded some of those regulations after Obama took office. What I found most riveting was how she uses her husband to grease the skids to make deals for other people that wind up being so lucrative to the Clintons. The "Play to get paid" is a level of corruption that is perfected by a woman who grew up in Chicago. A modern day Bonnie &amp; Clyde.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lest you think the Democrats or the Clintons were all sweetness and light</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a documentary not only about Hillary Clinton but also about the whole nearly 200 year history of the Democratic Party, during which time a lot of Democrats did and said things that from a modern perspective put them on the wrong side of history. Woven into this story is that of Dinesh D'Souza's federal conviction for exceeding the limit for campaign contributions to a political candidate. D'Souza asserts that his punishment was not only excessive but that it was orchestrated from the White House, which it may well have been. He then makes the point that his acquaintance with gang members gave him a unique perspective on the parallel between urban gangsters and the crew now working out of the white house.Then there is a long digression into the more sordid aspects of the history of the Democratic Party beginning with the cruelty of Andrew Jackson and his party in his treatment of indigenous peoples forced from their homes and of his own slaves. We move from this to the civil war, to the assassination of Lincoln, reconstruction, and the inherent racism of Woodrow Wilson and that of Lyndon Johnson. Planned Parenthood founder Margaret Sanger is revealed as promoting a form of eugenics and forced sterilization that the Nazis may have emulated. Franklin Roosevelt admired Mussolini early on in his ability in his own country to get things done without the messy business of dealing with a political opposition.Then he explores the back story of the Clintons, which is well worth remembering. Bill Clinton had a history of sexual misbehavior ranging from infidelity to sexual harassment with multiple women. That Hillary has countenanced this over the years seems not a little grotesque. Each time Clinton just denies everything and questions the meaning of "is". As troubling as this might be, he makes us entertain the various questionable financial transactions which suggest influence peddling and payoff on a grand scale. Her friendship with sleazy characters such as Saul Alinsky in the creepy political scene in Chicago is itself a bit jaw-dropping.In short it is a nauseating look into why Americans really should not put this pair back in the white house. I would only fault the film because it seems a bit unfocused. There are enough reasons not to vote for Clinton without resorting to the history of the Democratic Party.</fullReview>

I have seen a number of D'Souza's works and this is by far the best. It's high time that the self satisfied Democratic party with their 'moral high ground' face the facts of their origins ~ thinly veiled and persistent unto this day. The critics hate this film....gee, could they be Democrats? The only critic I care about it me. I think it's the only one anyone should care about ~ their own opinion. Professional reviews can be entertaining but art should stand on its own without any 'priesthood' to explain it for us. This is a masterwork of Art &amp; History which should not be missed. Much knee jerk bigotry toward the South, Republicans, et. al. so prevalent in American culture of the North in particular is addressed and placed into the bright light of documented historical fact. Many surprises and good flow to the narrative.</fullReview>

Whether it's been the recently leaked DNC emails or her Pay to Play with foreign countries while she was Secritary of State. The media simply doesn't report the truth and turns a blind eye. The liberal bias is clearly seen from critics of movies and TV shows as well. We rely on them to give a fair critique but more and more we see the opposite.

		<fullReview>As a longtime registered Democrat but an avowed intellectual, my thirst for information and perspective overruled my party affiliation so I decided to sit through this movie, twice. I was shocked and saddened the first time I saw it, I needed to see it again. The 2nd time I came out feeling like I'd learned a dirty little secret about my parents, so I decided to do my own fact checking, not using Mr. Desouza's references.I would unscientifically estimate 80% of the facts revealed in this documentary are true to the point of being fairly undisputed, as in verifiable public and congressional records. Just looking at one accurate fact regarding the how the Clinton Foundation manipulated the public to contribute to their Haitian relief fund and abandoning those Haitian folks who needed it most by keeping the lion's share of the contributions for themselves and to build a textile factory on the part of the island NOT affected by the quake as they enriched themselves and their crony friends was appalling, The Haitian folks in the U.S. who protested in vain against this exploitation of human misery was enough to raise the bile in me. Unfortunately there were other exploitations by the Clintons and of the party to which I have dutifully been a member of. Oh and Planned Parenthood, Margaret Sanger and their KKK affiliated racist agenda will likely burn in hell.After much jumping threw hoops I am finally an Independent. Honestly my fellow Dem friends hate me, with the exception of two, who actually saw the movie and fact checked it themselves. Nice to know there are still some people interested in seeking the truth even though it involves admitting to oneself I was wrong in supporting the party of my parents.

The Democrats have been lying to their modern members and minorities for a long time and this film breaks it all down and puts the information in historical context. Even the film maker starts out not knowing this history and it is only through investigation that the story unfolds. This was the first documentary film that I ever went to see in a theater, and it was well worth it. I enjoy documentaries, but I usually watch them on DVD or Netflix. This one is worth going to the theater to see. This film maker now holds three of the top ten spots for highest grossing documentaries and there is a good reason for that. This film is well made and the information is well presented. Don't believe the reviews that are politically motivated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truth!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is an eye-opener for those lulled into the false narrative that Democrats are "the party for minorities". While both Republican &amp; Democrat parties have their pros and cons, only the Republican party is blamed for racism. For many years the Democrat party has been trying to change history in order to gain voters and this movie sheds light on that truth. This movie also highlights some of the corruption that Hillary Clinton has engaged in. Aside from being insightful, this movie is also extremely engaging. I truly hope Democrats will watch this movie objectively but I know this will be very difficult since our 2 party system divides us against each other.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film 5 days ago, the theater had no banner on the Marquee for it, I asked the ticket guy why and his response was "Oh, it's too much trouble, I have to climb up there to do it" an obvious lie, because he has to do the same thing for every movie shown there. To those carefully watching what I experienced actually shows the film to be true and accurate, Democrats will stoop to anything,even corruption and mob like tactics to stop what they don't want people to see. The film is a very good documentary,I particularly liked the parts detailing Hillary's association with Saul Alinsky, and his connections with the Chicago Mob. go see it...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you actually watched this movie, and you tell people not to watch it, you might be a history denier.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Aggressively, Dinesh D'Souza has painted a very clear and reasonably undeniable picture of the history of the democratic party, from the Trail of tears all the way to the rise of the KKK to Margret Sanger's program for eugenics to cull minorities and invalids all the way to the woman who calls Sanger her personal hero. Hillary's America lays out the history of the party and helps draw the lines between history and today.The most upsetting issues for reviewers who dislike this film is that they have no counter rebuttal for D'Souza's claims, and it upsets them that they cannot counter the bold statements he's made.If you don't know or are unsure how to feel about the statement's D'Souza makes then do yourself a favor and go watch this film. We live in a inherently free society for now, and the beauty of it is that there was no censorship. If you disagree with the film, that is fine. Contrast this to people who vote it into oblivion, tell you to never watch it under any circumstances. These people are history deniers, and they are social and cultural marxists, and they want to censor not only D'Souza, but one day, when they get what they want from Dinesh, they will come for you.If you want to just check out a dissenting voice on this subject, tell the cultural marxists to shove it and exercise your freedom of speech.

"Hillary's America: The Secret History of the Democratic Party" is a must see movie if you seek the truth and are open-minded. Every minority group should see this movie to understand that they are simply puppets in the Democratic Party's agenda. Hard work and dedication went into the making of this film and you can see that. This movie leaves you wondering what else the Democrats have lied about. Well done D'Souza!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heavy handed, republican centered history, but interesting and worth seeing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The subhead ("the Secret History of the Democratic Party") is more apt description of the film than the heading ("Hillary's America"). It was 75% about the History of the Democrat Party, 20% about Bill and Hillary, and about 5% just filler, Apple Pie, Patriotism, and political propaganda. But I liked it. Worth seeing if your mind is open, and you want to see what Republicans think of Democrats who hypocritically call Republicans racists all the time. It covers a lot of the topics well, but high level (and fairly fast), so not a lot of room to give counter- factuals and fair time to both sides. Heavy handed or slow in some parts. So worth the money/time, especially if you're the type that will look some of the points up when you get home. Sadly, the people that should see it, won't watch it, or do the research afterwards to see how much is true. When given the choice between uncomfortable truths, or comfortable fictions, most people prefer the latter. Full review: http://igeek.com/3212</fullReview>

It's very obviously a pro-America movie that clearly points out the influences that formed Hillary's &amp; Barak's rise to power. Just as he did in the "America" movie last year, Dinesh points out the truth about the Democrats' early days regarding slavery and immigration. Andrew Jackson was a horrible president. He was a cruel slave owner, the founder of the democratic party and a sex addict. Hillary &amp; Barak idolized some of the most anti-American characters in world history. Some scenes are difficult to watch (not graphic) but historically accurate. For instance, the Ku Klux Klan was actually a pro-slavery army that was endorsed by the Dems. A lot of things Dinesh brings out will make your jaw drop. Watch it till the theater lights come on, there's a last scene after the credits.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>May contain a spoiler..... My wife and I just saw the movie yesterday in Bristol, Tennessee. The theater was unexpectedly full for a showing of a documentary and the audience applauded at the end. This is a must see historical documentary of the democratic party from Andrew Jackson and his horrific treatment of Indians and Blacks all the way through Woodrow Wilson and Saul Alinski's impact on Hillary Clinton and Obama. The documentary made it clear how Lincoln (Republican) freed the slaves and how the Democratic party has consistently kept Black America on the 'plantation' in one form or another. Specifically, now they are keeping them in the ghettos, on food stamps, section 8 housing, and just essentially on the government dole in order to ensure they continue voting for democratic candidates year after year. The democrats do not want poor blacks to get educated and earn a good living because they would no longer be beholden to the democrats to give them government assistance. Great documentary..... Everyone should see it.</fullReview>

FEC, 558 U.S. 310 (U.S. 2010).It's a shame that many in these pages have cited D'Souza's politically motivated campaign finance conviction as a disqualifying factor and an excuse for their utterly absurd low ratings. It is wonderful irony that D'Sousa was able to integrate his prison experience so artfully into his story.I have been following Clinton and Democrat scandals for decades. The film gave me some additional depth of understanding of many of the stories I knew and offered many others recent and past that help complete the ugly picture of Democrat and Clinton corruption.Many of my fellow enthusiasts gave the film 10 points - perhaps earnestly, perhaps to counter the trolls. I can unequivocally give it a firm 8.</fullReview>

However, upon watching this I was shocked to be introduced to confirm-able facts about the Clintons that I cannot forgive.

Would encourage everyone to see this film regardless of your political party, race, religion, or candidate preference. Very glad that D'Souza created this movie. You will likely walk out thinking and wanting to research more about both parties. Sad that the media and "professional critics" would deliberately give it such a low rating, you can tell how biased they are! Thankfully the audience reviews have been more insightful! I hope everyone, Republican, Democrat, and Independent/undecided alike will give this movie a fair shake.

This film lays out the bare facts about the party's creation and actions over the last 200 years. It's a blistering indictment and should make every Democrat question their party loyalty. I will not provide spoilers, but it is sufficient to say that viewers will learn of horrifying atrocities and criminality at the very heart of the party. As a non-Democrat, I had no idea of the breadth of the party's cruelty and hatred for the weakest and poorest among us, and their slavering lust for power and wealth at the expense of those who work hard and follow the rules. As we have recently seen, laws mean nothing to Democrats. In their view, laws are made to enrich themselves and destroy their enemies, not to enforce justice.

		<shortDescription>A frightening warning about what we can expect from a Hillary presidency</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This documentary does not deal with Hillary until towards the end of the movie. It is really a history of both the Republican and the DEmocratic party and how the flaws and benefits attributed to them in the eyes of the public have been woefully misrepresented and switched. It is the Republican party of Abraham Lincoln and those Republicans in the North who were abolishinists and who freed the slaves. The KKK were Democrats. Black people in the south were not allowed to own guns after being freed, that is how the KKK was able to dominate for so many years. To say that this movie has only one viewpoint is absolutely correct. However it is also fact filled and anyone is able to verify the truth of what Dineesh says. The facts are there for anyone to absorb and ponder, if Hillary is elected, America as we know it will no longer exist. It doesn't matter what attributes TRump has or doesn't have. It is important to keep the Clintons &amp; Democrats from that power, a negative power already in place. Dineesh compares the lives of blacks and other minorities as still being lived on "PLantations" in other words, the slums and crime riddled large cities of America, like Chicago and Baltimore and warns that we will all be living on "plantations" with a Clinton presidency. The audience viewing this movie with my husband and me were older people as we are. People who can remember the corruption, bigotry and mass murders of the second world war. We know it can happen here and it would not be because of a Trump presidency, no matter how the liberals would like the American public to believe that. Don't forget the Clintons and their allies have had a long time to put this in place.</fullReview>

Excellent and informative all around, and fact and history we all should know.His previous movies were also well researched, and while they might contain a lot of 'opinion', these opinions are always backed up with fact and research. This truly separates these documentary type films from so many other 'opinion' pieces we see today, which are all words without substance to back them up. Each movie gets better.

		<fullReview>If you have ever wondered what Bill and Hillary, and all Democrats/Liberals really think about minorities, just take a look at this movie. The writer, producer, and narrator of this movie is himself a minority. Just take a look at the comments the liberals make about him while giving the movie one star. The lowest, most vile, form of commentary. The movie itself seeks to open the eyes of the dumbed down voters to the truth about the Democrat Party. For instance, did you know that the Ku Klux Klan was started by the Democrat Party? The Klan has always been run by the Democrat Party. Were you aware that the racist Jim Crow laws from 1870's - 1960's were passed, promulgated, and enforced by members of the Democrat Party? Were you aware that all the African Americans lynched in the deep South were lynched by members of the Democrat Party? Which political party passed the racist laws (such as poll taxes and literacy tests) that were designed to stop African Americans from voting? Right, the Democrat Party. Were you aware that the party which opposed the 1964 Civil Rights Bill was the Democrat Party? Apparently African Americans do not know these facts since they support the Democrat Party by a 4-1 margin. Talk about moronic. Like the chickens voting for Colonel Sanders. This movie will open quite a few eyes by displaying the truth. For the rest of the racist Democrats, nothing will ever change their minds. Do yourself a favor and go see this movie.</fullReview>

This background will prove itself to be informative to almost anyone, especially those who received their formal education (no matter the level of attainment) in these last 50 or so years.A 9 out of 10 isn't promotional but was placed there to urge those who enjoy knowing about some of the unique roots of American politics and are not afraid to be exposed to the reasons for some of the political landscape (Establishment vs Outsider presidential primary season) we all find our country in today.Hillary's America: The Secret History of the Democratic Party will not disappoint ... even at full fare theater prices.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Powerful expose by a powerful filmmaker</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's no surprise that Rotten Tomatoes has this film at 5% yet the audience score is at 83%. I just came from watching the film today. It got rousing applause when the film ended. I only saw two people leave before the film was over and they left when the Star Spangled Banner was playing. I'm not sure why they would leave during that. The film was a poignant testimonial to how the Democrat Party jailed D'Souza on trumped up charges but also the racist history of the Democrat party. The history of extortion, theft, and then moving onto the next con was also on display. The film tells the awful truth that the Democrats do not want you to know. Go in with an open mind, come out with one determined never to vote for Democrats again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just want to say, I absolutely loved this movie, it really made me think as a black man how the democratic party really is, also a fun note is that Hillary Clinton the movie this is about upped up her company known as "correct the record" with 6 million us dollars, which is used to hire to spam / attack / humiliate / and protect her image at any cost. All in all, great movie the lighting is good, the sound is good, if you really hated this movie, at least give it a 5/10 as it completely follows through with great production valueI would vote 9/10, but I will give it 10/10 for the unfair bad reviews from paid people</fullReview>

At least somebody is saying it now.don't listen to the liberal journalists, who are downplaying the movie and saying anything to get people not to see it. The one thing they don't do is address the facts.It will take people who care more about the country than their own political reasoning. This movie is good for anybody who is open to thinking about the facts. I ask democrats who are open to the truth to look into the facts, but not from journalists and web searches. Check the facts in historical documents.Listen to what people in the movie are saying. Listen to Martin Luther King Jr's daughter. Don't you think she would know?Look into facts that can't be denied. Look into Hillary's thesis. If you really want to know who is telling the truth and who is lying, make a list of all the things that can't be fakes or lied about and see which way they fall. Then you'll know of your own accord.I've already looked into this. I'm just glad somebody finally put a documentary like this out.Go see it. Decide which topics are important to you. Dig into the records and see what facts can be found. Then decide for yourself.This country is too important to let people run it for their own gain. Our kids are too important to let that happen.See it. Investigate it. Judge it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film of truth hammered by the "critics" who are all liberals</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll let an intelligent human being see the film and make up their own mind, but for two salient points: First, the "critics" and "reviewers"on IMDb without a doubt belong to the world of almost 100% left wingers of the entertainment industry. Trying to get an objective review of anything to do with Hillary from out and out libs is impossible. It doesn't matter that every hit Hillary takes has been supported in writing, in the dozens of books that are out showing what a disgrace she is, have never - not once - been sued for slander, misrepresentation, or false testimony. NOT ONCE. That they ducked out of Hillary's way in the WH was quoted by several WH employees in several books. Her vicious and foul language appears on page after page of literally dozens of books. And the lib reviewers here, like all libs, say that "allegations" are not true. If you are going to review a film based upon its fitting your political mode or not, you should recuse yourself. Sounds like the ultra-left wing Vanity Fair at work. Money talks.Second, expecting an honest review free of personal political input from a person who is supposedly a viable, open, fair minded writer who supposedly has perspective in a movie such as this is about the same as American colleges today. The vast - well over 90% of American colleges and universities - are so far left that any student in them today fears to open his or her mouth with anything that smacks of center or god forbid Republican views. Since the faculties of most, if not all, of those institutions are out and out liberal democrats, the student who wants to get any sort of a recommendation for grad school learns not to open his or her mouth to challenge the overbearing liberal practice of teaching and putting down at every chance anything not liberal. For example, my alma mater (Bowdoin College) a couple years ago reported that 151 of the 156 faculty were liberals. It is pathetic to see reviewers do the same.Don't be afraid to see the truth. The reason it is not as well known as it could be ("why haven't I heard this before?") is very simple. If you think the entertainment world is left wing, what do you think the media is?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fact based description of the bait and switch done by the Media and textbook rewriters when discussing who the actual racists are in American politics. The Democratic Party, the party of Jackson, Woodrow Wilson, FDR, and Johnson. All of the aforementioned Presidents were KKK supporting racists that supported putting Indians on reservations, starting and maintaining the slave trade, and moving the slave trade to inner city ghettos. Southern Democrats gave us the Jim Crow laws. Perfect movie to understand how Democrats have successfully made Republicans, the ones that actually stopped slavery, into the bad guys. From Saul Alinsky to the morally depraved criminal Clintons, the movie provides much needed factual perspective on the history of the Democratic Party. For the unbrainwashed and open minded, it will be an epiphany.</fullReview>

Dinesh D'Souza has done a service to this country by making this film. I would encourage all Republicans, Democrats, &amp; Independents to see this film before they decide who they will be voting for in November. Most of us have already known for many years how corrupt the Clintons truly are and the many inexcusable scandals they have often been caught up in.

		<fullReview>Wife and I saw this film Friday night and we both enjoyed it. The history of the Democratic Party portion was interesting. One of the more intriguing parts is how the party of slavery became the savior of the black man in the 60's. I wish more time were devoted to explaining the "how" this switch occurred but that's only my personal interest. The movie helps to explain how our major cities, run by the Democratic Party for years, are in such dire condition. The production quality is what's to be expected with this budget, but it didn't detract from the message. I've read a bit about Hillary's background and this highlighted her association with Alinsky and how it shaped her views to this day. She's probably outpaced her mentor. I found the movie entertaining and the ending uplifting. Hopefully our country can survive through the next four and a half years, but if Hillary and the Democratic Party are in charge, I doubt it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the sad things of getting old is it gets hard for me to enjoy a movie. You've learned enough to know when you're being lied to. You get sick and tired of being sick and tired of being lied to . I rarely venture out to the movies now . This movie , however, is packed with so much truth I'm amazed it even got made. In our current climate of thieves and liars infesting Washington with their all too willing sycophants and fools willing to defend them it takes a brave and independently informed man to stand up to them and their endless looting. Dinesh D'Souza is living proof of that. In his words "The Empire does strike back". In spite of the selective prosecution designed to shut him up and intimate others into doing likewise D'Souza came back swinging and delivers a knock out blow.I thought I was well educated into all the evil and misdeeds that constitute the history of the Democratic party. This movie managed to enlighten even me to some things in which that rotten party had succeeded into fooling me with. It was a real eye opener to someone who already thought he had his eyes open. Not only that , it was very entertaining with high production values as well. Only the brain dead or insane could ever for for a Democrat after seeing this film. That or they are simply irredeemably evil. Don't be evil. Watch this movie.</fullReview>

Detractors will complain about this being some personal vendetta or another attempt by the rich white Republicans to tarnish the party of the people (even though D'Souza is Indian).This is more than just a documentary. Historical re-enactments and expert interviews detail the FACTS about the Democrat history and Hillary Clinton. I plead with everyone to at least give it a chance.Some people may claim this film is biased propaganda. Nobody should ever take one person's word on who to vote for, or accept just one film as fact just on its own merit. Watch it, take notes, do your own research and find that out for ourselves. An informed public is a corrupt politician's worst enemy. If we can't take a few hours and $10 out of our pocket to educate ourselves about our history and Constitution, then we have no business voting for anyone.

Whitewater, Rose Law Firm, Webster Hubbell, David Hale, Travelgate, Vince Foster, Ron Brown, the Menga Cartel, 75 other strange deaths, Paula Jones, Gennifer Flowers, Kathleen Willey, Juanita Broderick, Monica Lewinsky, and of course the Clinton Foundation, Benghazi, and the e-Mail scandal - the list is unbelievable. Just one of these scandals would have brought down ANY Republican politician, at ANY level. And yet the Democrats and the old media continue to act like there is absolutely nothing to see with regard to the Clintons. Incredible.No one is saying the Republicans are faultless.

		<shortDescription>Every Person of Color in the US Should See This Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having been raised a Democrat by Democratic parents and grandparents, I truly believed Democrats were on the moral side of history until I was about 50 years old. I had an illness in my 50s and had to stay home for 3 years. I wasn't going to watch soap operas all day, so I began to watch the news and as a hobby, fact checked the stories. This is when I discovered, to my horror, that almost everything I had been spoon fed about the Democratic Party was utter poppycock. Once your belief system is cracked wide open it is impossible to kid yourself. It took another 8 years before my husband finally saw the light. We fought so much about it that it was hard on the marriage, at times. We had to agree to disagree. I don't know what it was that changed him, after voting for Obama twice, but he swung around last year and tonight we went to the see this film together.To the history teacher who wrote that he or she believes this film to be untrue: nice try. These facts of history are immutable. The Repubican Party WAS formed to fight for abolition of slavery, Lincoln WAS a Republican, the Democrats WERE the Southerners and the Northerners who fought for slavery, the Jim Crow laws WERE enacted by Democrats, and on and on. Every person of color in the US should see this film about the truth so they can stop voting for the party that enslaved their ancestors and still enslaves them today with their lies.Now to discuss this specific film. The actors portraying the scenes were not necessarily the best, but I can forgive that because it wasn't supposed to be a film of dramatic fiction. This is a film about historical events, so its not the sort of venue for an Oscar worthy acting performance. If you are a conservative, then chances are you already know about the history of the Republican Party, so the scenes are familiar, but some are rousing and some are very sad. It is always sad to see scenes of slavery, whipping, lynchings and the subjugation of blacks - and this film is hard to watch, at times. I feel D'Sousa should have spent more time showing the history of the manipulation of immigrants and blacks who were set up to vote for Democrats in the late 1800s into the 1900s. I appreciated the history of Ida Wells, who was obviously a very brave woman.The Democratic Party have done so many harmful things to American society that it is difficult to encapsulate it all in a film, so you have to give D'Sousa a certain amount of artistic license to skip through the years. He couldn't possibly tell the tale of everything that has happened to bring us to the 2016 election, in terms of the deceit of the Democratic Party, so it makes the film choppy, at times.Of course, Democrats, not accustomed to actual fact checking, will disagree with the film, bringing down it's rating on IMDb, but it carries a message all should hear. If you are a person of color, then you should set aside the time to go see this film. Take a notepad and jot down the historical claims, then fact check them on the internet when you get home. In closing, I used to believe in the tenets of the modern Democratic Party as long as I drank and used drugs (29 yrs ago). When I got sober I slowly began to see things differently. Today I believe it shows RESPECT for people when one knows they can be self supporting through their own hard work - and that the Democratic Party is showing how little they respect poor people by believing they must be fed and burped by the system. See how that works? Its just the opposite of what I was raised to believe. The DNC are manipulating blacks in this election with BLM and more in order to get the black vote. Understood against the backdrop of history, the corruption is breathtaking.</fullReview>

With Hillary running for president, we need a truthful examination of her history and those she chooses to support, endorse, and run with. This is a case for black lives matter, this is a case for America to be great again. It is logical and I think D'Souza's best film yet. It flows the best and all the while, it does not compromise itself by endorsing anyone (Trump). It remains an indictment of Hillary and uncovers her sordid past. CHECK IT OUT!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw Dinesh D'souza's beautifully made documentary, Hillary's America, today, along with lots of other people. I enjoyed all of it--the lighter moments as well as the 'real' moments with prospects so serious it might be reason to avoid another Clinton White House. Experts in their fields share anecdotal proof and historical facts that reflect less than honorable Democratic Party intentions, and some of the Clinton scandals are discussed. An independent thinking African American woman researcher talks about the history of the people in the Democratic Party contrasted by the people in the Republican party (beginning with Lincoln, later assassinated by a Democrat), as well as an independent investigator of the Clinton Foundation (why didn't the people of Haiti get their donations?) In a couple of scenes, some of the more notorious Clinton scandals are noted on a bulletin board in the background. I was reminded of "Whitewater", like today's email scandal, it's a big one, and also still lingering is the role the Arkansas Mafia played in the Clinton's early success. Dinesh's explanation of why Hillary and Bill are suited to each other matches mine, and is the only one that really 'works' given all the extra-marital 'events'. Power. Politics. Social Engineering. Go see the movie, it's well done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Film. No doubt this will do well despite liberal critics.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Excellent Film really makes you think about how identity politics is at it's worse right now for democrats.Most of the claims made by the film are backed up by facts. MSM trying to spin it as conspiracy when it actuality it is about as close to the truth that many ever get. You don't have to look any further than the wikileaks that came out today proving that Hillary Colluded with the DNC to smear Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump. The opening was very powerful because it outlines some of the harshest truths of the democratic party that many people don't even know about or refuse to acknowledge. Till this day liberals still push the meme of the great switch that occurs of black voters to the democratic party for so called racism issues which has no evidence in reality.</fullReview>

This film captures the essence of a good movie with plenty of action, interesting scenes and blow your mind twists, and its historically true which ads to the intrigue.Grab a few friends and go see this BIG budget docu drama. Well Done!!For the insiders, its funny to watch the media push back with trashy reviews. To see the spin and downright lies some people in the media attempts to sell, as they dig their own graves, is pathetic. I am so inspired to see Americans waking up to the truth and this movie will be part of the movement. Keep an open mind whatever your affiliation and go see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>First Historical Documentary Founded on Facts About the Democratic Party</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1. All video documentaries compromise a subject. If you're a graduate of the public indoctrination centers, it's easy to discount a documentary that covers the Rest of the Story. h/t Paul Harvey.2. All video compromises a subject. By necessity, not everything can be covered. This plays into the hands of propagandists in both directions. The Left can cherry pick, and anyone who dares to resist will never be able to cover all the cherries - it's hard enough to cover agriculture without having to give the life-history of every cherry, peach, and avocado in the grove. Not to mention the grains, vegetables, and pork bellies - just as an example.3. Given these caveats, Dinesh and crew did an excellent job in presenting, and dramatizing the assigned topic: The Democrat party.How do you know? 4. Go back to your public indoctrination history books, if you have any, and look for the party affiliations. ... Most affiliations are not noted. The few party affiliations in the 'official' version of 'history' reverse history. Democrats are heroes. Republicans are villains. Heroes are Democrats. Villains are well ... nothing unless they can be tied to the narrative.5. Margaret Sanger - another review implies that Sanger's views were mainstream. No, they were not. Sanger's views - both her racist views, and her views on baby murder - have never represented the majority of Americans. Her views were mainstream all right - among Progressive leaders at the top, and among those who believed the lies at the bottom. Americans in the middle by and large - as now - did not hold such extreme views.How do you know? Just ask yourself how many of the people you know - including Democrat voters - believe everything spewed from the Established Media sources? And the few who do? What of them? Do they strike you as thoughtful, well educated citizens, or louts who haven't read a book since High School? 6. My adult children and I saw the film last night in Frisco, Texas. To see the film any earlier we would have had to attend one of the special, limited openings last week. Keep that in mind - the only people who attended those openings were guests and press. You can guess who didn't like it.Why would someone post a fake review? ... Duh.7. One of the trailers was a revision of the pro-Klan film - The Birth of a Nation. This racist screed was featured in Hillary's America because Woodrow Wilson (Democrat) screened it in the White House. The new version of the film retells the heroic story of Nat Turner's ill-fated slave revolt in 1831. Even assuming the film is not a propaganda hit piece - despite the October 2016 release date, giving it the same title as one of the most infamous - and racist - films of all time is agitprop. It is not a stretch to suggest the film could incite the murder of police officers - a decidedly perverse result given that the objective of the first film was to defend lynching and incite white supremacy.8. ... Having said all that. Will you like the film? Will you learn anything? Is it going to change minds? Will it move America in the right direction - towards freedom, prosperity, the rule of law, and tolerance? I doubt it. The fact is that to understand the film - and know that the facts selected for inclusion are representative of the Criminal Elite ... you have to actually know something. And just reading biographies or histories may not help since almost everything published in the last 50 years by the academic press only reflects one side - and that's Democrat's side.In my case, for example, my grandfather worked for a guy who worked for Lyndon Johnson when he was Governor of Texas. I would not suggest LBJ was the type of racist implied in the film, but he was a racist, and he was corrupt. I have eyewitness testimony - from my grandfather - to this fact. When my grandfather turned away from the Democrat party - when he hired black truck drivers. The Klan attacked. His business was torched. His home was vandalized. His car was shot up. Had he not been good friends with the county sheriff, things might have gotten much worse.Without such testimony, I might never have realized how to separate fact from fiction. I might have gone through life believing everything I was told in the public indoctrination center. Instead, I educated myself - and I learned that the whole history is far more colorful - and morally unclear - than the one offered by the Democrats.9. I gave Hillary's America a 10-star rating for its argument - not for its impact. The film is persuasive, and it offers strong visual illustrations to back up the points made by the dry interviews. But the film covers over 200 hundred years of history. Necessity forces it to compromise. Such comprises are entirely justified - because it is one lone flick trying to fix decades of distortion. If truth and lies shared the same playing field, the film might warrant the criticism of biting off more than it could chew (about six to ten times more). But that's not the case. Every topic cannot be given equal weight. Important topics were left out - and no I don't think any of them were exculpatory. More like gasoline. And exceptions were not covered. For those of us who have seen the Klan Party morph into the Fake-Rainbow-Tolerance Party, the film is a salve. But for those who don't know anything, I doubt they will learn anything.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A poignant historical view of the corruption and lies of the Democrat Party.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>D'Souza's documentary illustrates the truth of the Democrat Party. It analyzes their historical traditions, which totally contradict the founding fathers. Their greed and corruption is what I have found to be true of third world countries. Additionally, it erroneously claims to be, "The Worker's Party", but I know, as a successful person who is self-made, that this statement is false. Rather, it's the party of "minimum wage", cradle-to-grave, and high taxes unless one is willing to go along with the corruption they become a part of, many times innocently. Unfortunately, then it is too late. Now is time for the country to pull together, and take deep concern and responsibility for what happens in the future, hopefully, to "Make America Great Again".This movie is a must see... especially for Democrats.</fullReview>

Using the same calm, calculated, objective, and fact-based research on this film, D'Souza lays out the horrendous (and frightening) future that lay ahead for ALL - should Clinton (or Leftists) continue on the path that has already caused so much destruction, to so many.This is a MUST SEE movie for ALL interested parties, and for anyone who chooses to be informed.</fullReview>

Bill inherited a world free of the USSR (thank you President Reagan). Bill inherited a military that was rebuilt after the Vietnam debacle Democrats got us involved in, based on lies. Bill also inherited an economy in great shape. So, give him credit for not screwing it up. He balanced the budget by cutting the military. He should thank Reagan again for giving him a world free of the USSR. Now what has Obama &amp; Hillary done. 19 Trillion in debt. China &amp; Russia hacking State secrets. China doesn't need to invest in research, they just steal (F35 Stealth Fighter plans stolen by Chinese hackers!!).

I know they are facts because I took notes during the movie and then went home to fact check all the historical claims made in the movie. Don't listen to the Hollywood based critics. This movie is so informative and confirms what we have all suspected - the Democrats pander to minority groups only to get their votes not because they are truly trying to make things better for minorities.

		<shortDescription>Brilliantly Thought-provoking if somewhat flawed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Hillary's America" begins with Dinesh D'Souza going to prison for a campaign finance violation. Fellow inmates tell D'Souza they committed robbery or murder and ask what he did. "I gave a candidate more money than I was legally allowed to." The other inmates laugh their behinds off, unable to imagine that this is a real crime. One inmate ran a scam involving fraud and murder. "When you get exposed," he says, "deny, deny, deny. If you don't get arrested, move on to a new scam and start over."D'Souza wonders aloud whether there is a parallel in politics. The inmate believes that if anybody is running a scam in America, it must be the Republicans. The Democrats are for the little guy, right? D'Souza is unconvinced. He believes the Democratic Party machine put him in prison. As his lawyer points out, others who violate the same law routinely get a slap on the wrist and a fine. So D'Souza spends his time in prison reading about the Democratic Party's history. Although "Hillary's America" is an admittedly biased look at that history, the dirt does not have to be made up. D'Souza has the advantage of telling a story that, while familiar to American history buffs, will be fresh to many viewers precisely because it has so often been whitewashed heretofore. D'Souza is delighted to air the Democratic Party's dirty linen for them, including a dramatization of the well documented but conveniently forgotten White House screening of the pro-Ku Klux Klan movie "Birth of a Nation" by Democrat Woodrow Wilson. (A scene with great special effects.)The Democrats were, from the beginning, a coalition favoring slave owners. Even northern Democrats like Sen. Stephen Douglas of Illinois and President Franklin Pierce of New Hampshire, though themselves from non-slave states, actively looked out for the interests of the slave states. Their efforts to restore balance between free and slave states paradoxically destabilized that balance and led first to the rise of the Republican Party, opposed to the further spread of slavery, and then to the Civil War. After the Civil War, the Republicans championed the former slaves. As D'Souza points out, the 1964 Civil Rights Act?which passed because of strong Republican support?re-enforced the civil liberties already advanced by Republicans after the Civil War. Also during the post- Civil War era, the Ku Klux Klan became the militant arm of the southern Democratic Party, to restore racism through fraud and murder. The only thing D'Souza, a conservative, sweeps under the rug is something the Democrats don't necessarily want exposed, either: For much of its history, the Democratic Party was the conservative party. In the antebellum South, being conservative meant preserving slavery. Democrats were advocates of states' rights, small government, and constitutionalism (except when they violated these principles to protect slavery). Also, D'Souza rightly identifies the Klan as mainly Democratic but conveniently overlooks a brief, admittedly aberrant Republican Klan in Indiana during the 1920s. (Apparently attached to a particular politician, it went away as soon as he did.)Another strain in the history of the Democratic Party is Progressivism, which arose at the end of the nineteenth century and led to the central planning and social engineering that were advanced by Democratic presidents Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt. Many tenets of the modern Democratic Party have roots in Progressivism, which for decades couldn't easily be teased apart from racism. Planned Parenthood, considered by Democrats and even many Republicans (including Donald Trump) to be a laudable organization, arose from the branch of social engineering called eugenics, which had the distinctly racist aim of eliminating by any means necessary all people deemed to be inferior.If the current Democratic candidate for president were to concede that there are bad things in her party's past, she might, nevertheless, ask, "What difference at this point does it make?" As if to answer her question, D'Souza shows a video of Mrs. Clinton describing herself as an early twentieth century Progressive. Does she mean that? Apparently, but she could be mistaken in this self-description. Whatever else they were, Wilson and Roosevelt were patriotic nationalists who would have been offended by the anti-nationalism and overt socialism of many modern Democrats. (There were no American flags displayed at the 2016 Democratic Convention until its second night, an oversight that Wilson and Roosevelt would have taken amiss.)The early Progressives might have been troubled, too, by an influence on both Democratic President Barack Obama and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Obama not only read but taught from Saul Alinsky's book "Rules for Radicals". Mrs. Clinton knew Alinsky personally and considered him a mentor. Alinsky, a Chicago-based community organizer beloved by many Democratic activists, admittedly started as a petty street scammer. His amoral approach thrived on not only his opponents but even the nominal beneficiaries of his actions being ignorant of his real agenda. He becomes a perfect foil for D'Souza's thesis that the modern Democratic Party is a great scam. D'Souza builds a persuasive case that much of the Obama-Clinton methodology is based on Alinsky's scam-as-political-action approach.Throughout the movie, D'Souza asks, What if the mission of the Democratic Party is to steal America? What if the Progressive program has been to gradually lull Americans into the feel-good benefits of central planning and social engineering without their realizing that the price is their liberty? D'Souza would warn people while they can still make an informed choice, but is it too late? The plan to Fundamentally Transform America is already underway. D'Souza does not point out that the Democratic Party does not form a boundary around the only advocates of central planning. The Republican Party is on board, too. He also does not remind us that some of the impulses of the Democratic Party's legacy, as laid out in this film, might be just as alive in former Democrat Donald Trump, as they are in Hillary Clinton.</fullReview>

Most Democrats have a closed mind on subjects like those covered in the film and attribute efforts to spread such truth as partisan hogwash.Its simplistic style is like an old-fashioned educational film relating the history of the Democratic party from the founding of the republic up to the present, with D'Souza as the narrator. It is slightly overlong and if you got through sixth grade in a school with a priority on education, he is probably preaching to the choir.

The relationship between Alisky and Hillary is particularly well done. Pay attention to how the legal system in being used to stifle free speech in the US. Catalogs the long list of crimes committed by the Clinton's well. Showing all of history: not so good. Remember Andrew Jackson got rid of the Second Bank of the US (good thing).

		<fullReview>I have laughed my way through some deluded comments and reviews of D'Souza's latest (thankfully in the minority), including the first user review posted here. Accurate, objective, and based on sound research, they say? HOGWASH! I've now read two of D'Souza's books and this is the second film of his I've watched, and the ridiculousness of his one-sided propaganda is so painfully obvious that it really needs no commenting on. If rescripted fictional reenactments of Civil War-era scenes qualify as valid research to you or you think you'd enjoy sitting through about half an hour's worth of off-topic mumbojumbo deflecting and making excuses for his recent "FRAUD" indictment before even getting to the point, then by all means ... be my guest. What is perhaps more interesting here may be the comparisons made between D'Souza and a certain Michael Moore. I will fully admit that Moore is no less a propagandist than D'Souza. The difference, though, is that Moore comes across as much more humanistic and engaging (rather than aloof) in his assertions, he has a much better sense of humor, he is technically a superior filmmaker, and you won't find accounts of his criminality as you easily can with D'Souza: NO, I do not trust a source who led a wealthy young life as a privileged immigrant at Dartmouth (where he outed numerous gays in the newspaper he edited), has only been directly involved in government work for two years (under Reagan, no less) followed by years and years of crafting his venomous opinions at creepy think tanks like The Heritage Foundation), was fired as the head of the CATHOLIC King's College due to proved infidelity, karate-kicked his wife in the head before their divorce, and was found guilty of campaign fraud (and still under probation and performing weekly community service). Prison is really where this guy should be right now! NO, I don't recommend this garbage to anyone except the deluded and those who are so concerned with fairness and objectivity that they feel the need to see and hear both sides before passing judgment. Hey, at least my score of 1/10 gives this film more credit than the film's 1/100 metascore.</fullReview>

But if you have what GOD calls "FREEWILL" I wouldn't recommend this Docu-Slam piece by D'Souza. I even know some conservatives who thinks this guy is Cooky for Cocoa Puffs. "A Full Throttle Conspiracy THEORY" using different historical events with a FALSE story behind them." I'm surprised at the reviews on this board. So Trump is losing in the polls, now senator Hillary Clinton is a domestic terrorist?What a clich D'Souza is, anything to bash "OUR FUTURE (FIRST FEMALE) PRESIDENT!"Yet, for the paranoid, can't think for themselves, unrealistic, discriminatory, closed minded, uneducated, followers of the Dinesh D'Souza fan club; THIS FILM IS FOR YOU!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me start off by saying, I have actually watch most of Dinesh D'Souza's "documentaries" because they are all hilariously bad. So going in I had a feeling of what was to come, but somehow D'Souza found a way to make an even WORSE film than ever before! Hillary Clinton is the target of this.. I'm sorry I don't even feel like calling this a film anymore because it sullies the name of every other film made by doing so, so I'll call it a "dumpster fire" from here on out! Clinton is the target of this dumpster fire, and D'Souza doesn't pull any punches. Every wacko conspiracy theory is explored and presented as if it were facts, the lousy recreated scenes has the quality of a middle school production, and.. I'm not even gonna finish that sentence that's how bad it is.To anyone republican who hates Clinton, don't go see this movie! You might be tickled by it but this dumpster fire is just another one of D'Souza's attempt to steal your money by pandering to your anger. I don't know D'Souza personally, but I'm sure not even he has watched this because frankly it is unwatchable!</fullReview>
