		<shortDescription>#TeamNeither WWE RAW With Superheroes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>People says: an Avengers movie with 'emotional depth' and 'moral complexity', and now I have to question what planet they're living on. Seriously, WTF people!! if this is 'emotional depth' and 'moral complexity' then Marsellus Wallace is a bitch! When their operation to stop the theft of a biological weapon in Lagos goes explosively wrong leaving dozens of civilian casualties and themselves under scrutiny. It may be that I'm misremembering, but were there any civilian casualties in the past??? Didn't whole cities go up without anyone even wandering around dazed with a nosebleed? But the plot needs what the plot needs so now the Avengers have always blown up innocent people, which leads to 100 nations gathering together and saying: this must stop. And: you must all be brought under the control of the UN. While Iron Man is for it, Captain America, who is more Brexit, quickly goes rogue and becomes a fugitive. This could have then set the scene for, perhaps, saying something almost interesting about government control, military might and divided loyalties, but instead it results in all the superheroes choosing #TeamCap or #TeamIronMan? there are no takers for #TeamNeither, which would have been the sensible option WHY WHY they fight!! Come on!!! Captain America a rebel soldier???</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Everything that's awful about comic book movies nowadays.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By the end of this movie, I felt like my soul had left my body I was so bored. The things that are wrong with this movie are the things that are wrong with every recent comic book movie:- Poor writing and editing. The first two-thirds of the film is spent skipping around from character to character and location to location without developing even a semblance of a plot. - Way too many characters. Despite leaving the plot to stagnate in order to purportedly focus on the characters, the filmmakers still stuff so many people in here that everyone except the wonderful new Spider-Man gets the short shrift and becomes a one-note wonder with unclear motivation.- Political pretense. The movie superficially brings up questions about balancing personal convictions with accountability for your actions, but it doesn't say anything of substance about them.- Shaky cam. Nobody likes shaky cam. Why is anybody still using shaky cam?- Nothing that happens in the movie has any consequence on future films. You would think a film endlessly hyped as being a "civil war" would affect the relationships between the characters on opposite sides of the conflict. Despite Tony finding out Cap's boyfriend had killed his parents, and despite Tony almost killing Cap's boyfriend, Cap and Tony patch everything up at the end of the movie like nothing ever happened. The members of Cap's team escape incarceration. Nobody dies. This film could very well not exist, and it would not affect the MCU in any way.Two things I liked:- The new Spider-Man was funny and charming.- The airport fight scene was moderately entertaining.In short, this movie is for devoted Marvel fanboys only. For everyone else, it is pure torture. Avoid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overstuffed and Undercooked</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The WINTER SOLDIER is the best MCU film, but its sequel has a serious identity crisis. Captain America: Civil War wants to be great. But for the most part it isn't. The film is an overstuffed 2 and half hour film that has one too many ideas thrown into the mix. It is essential a cash grab of the BVS variety. But why can't people see this? Now this is a Captain America as the title suggests. But in the end a more fitting title would read: Bucky VS Ironman: Dawn of who's the Captain's Bestie. The reason I say this is the film felt disjointed to the point of it being a joke. It felt like two separate films weaved together to try and make a film that makes sense. But it didn't It's one half a Captain flick/ the other half a mini Avengers film. But they both drown each other. It's clear this is a film Marvel wanted to make, but why on earth rush into it? One film could never service this iconic plot line. It should have been gradual, and while we did see Cap and Tony tense up in Ultron, this is where a strain in their relationship should have been definite and it should have still been in effect at the beginning of this film.For the most part of the Airport sequence there was no real danger. It was a carefully orchestrated scene that showed these films are for young cinema-goers. Even when one character is looked to be written off "BAM" they are back, giving everyone some cheep laughs at the end of the film. Now from a writing and filmmaking point of view and dare I say it, this film has worse interconnecting scenes then The Amazing Spiderman 2. Re-shoots are obvious, editing is sub par, cinematography lacked style and was evident to be a "quick" point-and-shoot at the action affair. Such a disappointment. But yes this film has it's fun moments (the same can not be said for BVS). But they can't help a film tailored to a certain demographic that leaves out those looking for a film that doesn't kill a few braincell upon leaving the cinema. The laughs are hardly inspirational writing and forced, so forced.sidetone: ONLY SOME OF THEM HAVE SUPER POWERS, SO WHY DO THEY ALL RECOVER FROM HARD HITS AND KNOCKS? it's just makes the stakes so much lower and less respectable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Was decent.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>this movie is so riddled with plot holes, flaws, horrible cgi and horrible jokes its ridiculous the more i think about this film the worse it gets and initially i loved it but man some of the stuff in this film can just not be excused from the horrible villain, the weak plot and character motivations i could go on and on all day. after how great the winter soldier was i thought this next cap would be next level especially with the russos at the helm and wow did it let me down A lot. just not a good film at allokay all of zemos plans made no sense think about it how would zemos plan even work if falcon never told tony where they went? how and why was there a random camera in the middle of an isolated road in the tree line pointing directly across the road at more trees exactly where bucky killed tonys parents like come on? also bucky broke free of those restraints when he was getting interrogated by zemo why didn't he just cover his ears so he couldn't hear the trigger words? also how did zemo even get in there its a top secret government location not a nightclub a fake id isn't going to cut it the avengers and the government did no extra investigation into the sokovia accords bombing and just ordered a shoot to kill order off of a fake picture? . thats pretty weak for the avengers and the government. zemo is a flaw to me he is only used as a plot device no development what so ever and he is the key to everything happening he could've been great!! the cgi for spidey is horrible man but thats not a big deal to me but spidey ant man and hawk eye are so shoehorned in especially the 2 non avengers like think about it why are they even there? its just for the spectacle but makes no sense you're going to bring a brand new superhero who's 15 years old to a "war" (which it wasn't) and he didn't even need to be there. there's more and more i can keep going on about but they are all overshadowed and clouded by the action and jokes. it was a good film its just not as flawless as everyone is saying it has great action set pieces 10/10 but as a film story etc it isn't that good. i don't want to seem overcritical but thats how everyone was with BvS except i can explain their plot holes no one can explain mine yet&#xfeff;that being said I'm very excited for the black panther movie directed by coogler so that looks like its going to be great because the character has great potential that goes for spidey too they just need to fix his CGI it was horrible in this film and he is one of my favorite character in pop culture period so i hope they do him justice</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Captain America is only a stupid cowboy in this movie. Why does he not sign the regulation papers? He isn't a god like Thor or Superman. Who is Captain America to be above the Law? Superman or a American cowboy? Why did he not tell Iron Man what his best friend have done with H.Stark and his mother? Does he know how to talk with his friends like Tony? I think not. He only knows how to fight... like a perfect soldier...And what about the conflict? And the consequences? Will we see them? Or Captain is already a friend for Tony? He has given a cheap cellphone to Tony... so... the conflict doesn't matter...Only the action scenes are good...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Now this is a good superhero movie!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hi, I saw civil war and I come with good news; it's AWESOME! Im not gonna spoil one single thing, since this movie should be seen by only the two trailers you probably saw. Don't watch any tvspots after the second trailer or whatever! Im gonna touch a few aspects and rate them. Acting: Of course it's amazing. The characters we were waiting for were black panther and of course SPIDERMAN! Both were done amazing! Spiderman has a bigger role than I personally expected and it's done with grace. Love it. Black Panther was such a good character with great motivation why he's doing what he's doing. The acting per usual from the other characters were great! 10/10 Story: Now where another (let's leave it) unnamed superhero movie failed this year, and no I'm not talking about dead-pool.., was the story. Now this story is what I expected from the other unnamed superhero movie. I didn't know what side I wanted to be on; cap's or iron man's. I was so conflicted and even while they're fighting you don't know who to root for. The villain in this movie felt a bit, not really out of place, but unnecessary in my opinion. But Marvel always struggles to find a good fleshed out villain except for Loki &amp; kingpin in the series. 8/10 Action/Cinematography: O boy..If you're an action freak you will love this, if you're a comic book fan.. you're gonna LIVE these amazing action set pieces. The much anticipated airport scene is AMAZING. You've seen nothing, literally nothing of the amazing action that will bestow upon you guys. The airport scene is in complete imax and has a runtime of around 17 minutes. Just let that sink in! The Russo brothers know how to create great action and film it great as well. I can go on record and say this is by far the best superhero action scenes ever. 20/10. Verdict: Was it a perfect movie? No. But for me as a fan it came darn close. The only thing that bothered me were the villains, well actually one of the few that are in there. Was it better than... Batman v superman.. yes by far. I mean we're in a comic book movie year, so we might as well compare it. Batman v superman lacked in a lot of places and civil war just did it better. Just the conflict in ideologies made it so much more believable why the characters fought and because this whole story arc is happening now after 2 cross over movies, 3 iron movies and 2 cap movies.. the stakes are so incredibly high. I tried to compare dead-pool with it as well, but it's a different movie in terms of it being a solo movie and setting something up, instead of showing a conflict between good and good instead of good and evil. 9 out of 10! Near Perfect movie for the fans(9.5) and a good solid action film for the general movie go-ers(9)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Behold, the Übermensch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Superheroes may misunderstand and they make mistakes but, ultimately, they are morally incorruptible. If they find themselves on the wrong side of a fight it's because they've misunderstood the nature of the problem. However, when reality finally hits home we can rely on them to admit their error and go off to fight together in the name of Truth, Justice and the American Way. People who die are unavoidable collateral damage, superheroes are beyond reproach and we need them too much to limit their powers. The world is just too scary and too dangerous to shackle the mighty with red tape and bureaucracy. Superheroes are better than us mere mortals, not just more powerful but also more moral. They don't need to follow the same rules we do.After Winter Soldier I was under the (apparently mistaken) belief that Marvel's Capt. America franchise was criticising neoliberal America. There was all that stuff about the ends not justifying the means and about how politicians use terror to convince the population they need to be oppressed for their own good. How wrong could I be! Now I see that it's actually the opposite. It pretends to be anti-establishment but really it's just about justifying a sense of self-entitlement. Like Donald Trump, Capt. America criticises the State for oppressing people whilst simultaneously adhering to exactly the sort of high-handed moral superiority that inevitably leads to that oppression. He (I mean Capt. America) obviously skipped school on the day they taught the importance of checks-and-balances and why one of the central principles of US Democracy is that of the separation of powers.The message of this film is simple. If you believe you are right, then you can do whatever you want as long as it's in the name of *insert moral cause*. Anyone who tries to limit your personal crusade is either stupid, na?ve or oppressing you. Freedom from oppression means the freedom to act like you're better than other people, because, well, you ARE better than other people (go on, admit it, you're amongst friends here).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not terrible but still bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This review contains spoilers and my English is kinda bad.... so lets start: After seeing 8.5/10 my expectations were really high but after watching this movie i was so disappointed (probably the worst marvel film since first CA what is really ironic since CA 2 was one of the top three... ) Story: story is meh, nothing special, just CA and his buddy (with support of 1/2 avengers) against the world My PERSONAL problems with this film :1. Terrible villain again, didn't remember his name 20min after the movie ended, did pretty much nothing but showed some amazing prophet skills 2.So many stupid things like how did villain know iron man will come at the very end, how did he know nobody told iron man how his parents died, also the big fight at the airport was just too dumb, pretty much all mighty jean nm.2 and vision in the same fight where black widow and hawk eye should just really be hoping, praying and dodging some random explosions... this list could really go on and on 3.SO F***ING OVERCROWDED. Why the hell did ant-man join the fight? What is his motivation? How does random Nigerian prince have powers to fight CA and bucky ? HOW ??? Nobody but CA, Iron man and bucky had story behind them (pretty pathetic though),others were just useless guys fighting. At least they didn't ruin Hulk even more :-)4.Really ? Tony tried to kill his friend CA and bucky and then after being defeated he is f***ing cool with it? Best buddies again? 5.In iron man 3 tony was able to call 30 auto iron mans to fight for him, here he got challenged by a freaking falcon with his wings? Also at the airport he was unable to defeat CA and at the very end he almost rekt two of them ? ... Guess I'm back to stupid stuff...On the other side, good things:1.Spider-man - yea this kid with no story in movie at all was one of few good funny things about this movie 2.Cool fights right ?All in all , 4/10 (coz i love superheroes movies), 1/10 is to balance things...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When politicians and world leaders think that people like Captain America and Iron Man are running amok, they tell them they need to be regulated. tony Stark, Iron Man thinks it's necessary. While Steve Rogers, Captain America doesn't think so. That eventually splits their team, The Avengers. At a UN gathering where the regulations are being worked out, there's an explosion and some people are killed among them is the King of Wakanda. Investigation reveals that the bomb was planted by the Winter Soldier, who is Bucky Barnes, Captain Amerioca's friend during the war. Everyone is out to get Barnes and kill him if necessary but Steve wants to get to him first and help him. When he finds him he says he didn't plant the bomb, suddenly another person shows up who's out to get him dressed in black. When security forces catches up to them they are arrested and the one in black is revealed to be the son of the Wakandan King, T'Challa and he is the Black Panther the guardian of Wakanda. While in custody, a psychiatrist is sent to evaluate Bucky but suddenly the power goes out that's when he begins to say some words that have an effect on Bucky. He breaks out and Steve tries to get him. Believing that Bucky is innocent Steve sets out to find the man who got to him. Tony is told that because Steve helped Bucky he is now also wanted. He offers to bring him in so he asks War Machine ,and Black Widow to join him. He recruits someone to help him while Widow offers T'Challa to join them.

		<shortDescription>Are movie standards so low, that a movie like this one is considered to be a masterpiece?(minimal spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You might wonder at first why I rate this movie with 1. Read the whole review and then later you'll find out why. So, without further due let me tell you my opinion about this movie.The bad: I found very convenient that the main idea of the Avengers having to answer for their casualties right in this movie where the main theme is civil war or a war between friends as we see later in the movie. And it's very dull in my opinion that this idea is only exploited right now, and it's sole purpose is to serve the plot and make you believe the plot. But here's the problem: why wasn't this idea exploited in the previous movies, and why are the Avengers only now regret failing to save people(as you'll see in a scene at the beginning of this movie) but never shown any signs of remorse after failing to save thousands of people in Sarkovia? I'll tell ya, they were to busy saying one-liners. Again it's so predictable and dull, that only movies like Taken 2 or Transformers might have it. Next there are minor mistakes like a scene where a man is drown and as he hangs upside down his head is introduced into a vessel of water clearly his nose is above the water level, but then as he is left do drown, his body doesn't drop yet his nose is somehow under water just so he could, die(maybe cinema sins or ScreenRant might help here). Next, when Spider-man does an Empire Strikes back move on a giant ant-man, his web seems to never end although he circles him countless times, and so on, I could try to remember as many flaws like this ones, but that's not my point. What I'm trying to say is that this movie is more predictable than Batman v Superman was, but that movie had some twists and moments that I never expected and gave the feeling of watching a comic book movie, while this movie is more about a real life situation that would imply superheroes, but that's not a very accurate comic book adaptation but is rather a "what if there were superheroes in real life" situation, and quite honestly I don't know which side people are on... but whatever, moving on... The humor again was sometimes very badly placed in scenes where there was fighting to the death, I mean come on, as a real person in a real life situation(as this movie suggests) you wouldn't make jokes, would you? And last but not least, the 100+ nations gather way too easily. If it was a real world, things wouldn't be that simple. The good: Oh, yeah, you knew this was coming... Spider-man for me was like Batman in BvS, extremely well adapted from the comics. It took the best out of the two previous incarnations. It took the genius and nerd attitude from Tobey's Peter Parker while being funny and very talkative like Andrew Garfield's Spider-man was. I absolutely loved it and he made the movie worth seeing after all(can't wait for his solo movie). The action and the way movie was proceeding was good, as fast as BvS might say, but clearly the plot was made on the way, and the conflict wasn't very well developed, while neither BvS did a better job but in that case the plot started from things we already knew from Man of Steel while this one introduces new things and memories just to serve this movie's plot, while being no other clue of them appearing in other Marvel movies before this one. The fights were beyond awesome, very realistic and very real life street fight made like, unlike BvS where the fight scenes were more comic book style, but should either of these two different styles bother you? It's up to you to decide. The humor even though at times was badly placed, sometimes was very well placed in scenes that needed humor to make them memorable(and of course many of these were made by Spidey) At times it was very sentimental and very emotional, but I don't understand how critics see only these things and don't see the bad ones I wrote above. I hope some of you will agree with me, but remember this is a subjective opinion, although I tried to be as objective as I could.So, to wrap up this review, I'll say this: This movie is a strong addition to the Marvel universe, and typical for their style of movie making. I enjoyed it, even though I was offended to see that the critics are praising this movie so much, and reviewing BvS so badly, which in my opinion is not objective(since this is the role of critics, to objectively review a movie). So this is why I vote 1 for this movie, because it's rating here is hugely overrated, and IMDb seems to be on the side of critics(but I'll not enter in the way they calculate the rating).This movie's real rating should be around 7-8, probably the same like Age of Ultron, but until it gets there(which probably won't happen), I rate this movie with 1.So saying that this movie is a masterpiece is like saying Taken 2 is a good movie. Maybe this movie is a masterpiece, but only compared to a movie like Batman vs Robin, although there are movies like the Dark Knight trilogy and Watchmen that are comic book movies masterpieces. OK, I'm done now :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This may be the worst addition to the MCU yet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So Disneys: Marvels: Avengers: Captain America: Civil War was basically a pile of garbage. The fight scene with Spidey and Ant Man and the introduction of Black Panther were the only real redeeming factors.It failed as a movie and it failed as an adaptation of the comic series. One thing that really made me think that it failed as an adaptation is that while I sided with Stark in the comics, I can't help but to side with Captain America in the movie. If the adaptation was even vaguely faithful or decent my opinion should have stayed unchanged.But ignoring the original work, because the movie has to be judged on its own merits as well, it was pretty darn bad. The funeral scene was so cheesy, out of place and just bad that I actually briefly considered walking out. I couldn't believe I'd spent so much money to see this movie at the theatre.My opinion of this movie would probably be quite a bit better if they actually had the guts to kill off a single character in Civil War. When nobody is going to die and we all know it, all the drama and suspense are just instantly gone. It immediately goes from watching a tense battle sequence that could change the whole cinematic universe to a pretty light show.And the big climactic battle between Iron Man, Captain America and Bucky in Civil War was so dark you can't tell what's going on for half of the scene. That is a cardinal sin in film making. If you can't tell what the heck is happening, the scene is pointless and uninteresting.I obviously have a lot more gripes with this 250 million dollar mistake but I don't feel like writing an essay and nobody would read a review that long and detailed anyway. It would probably take longer for me to explain all of the issues I had with the film than it would for you to just watch it and decide for yourself, but I can't say I'd recommend doing that.This is perhaps the worst entry into the MCU, barring only The Incredible Hulk. This movie was so bad I'd even rank it under Thor 2 and Captain America: The First Avenger in the ever-growing list of Marvel missteps.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing Comedy/Adventure - Mediocre Superhero/Spy Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>CONTAINS SPOILERS CONTAINS SPOILERS CONTAINS SPOILERS What kind of movie was that,I couldn't stop laughing either due to jokes or sarcastically due to the ridiculousness of the scenario! In a way that was anticipated.The directors,the Russo brothers, have made some good comedy around.In fact I would say that if you really like 'Community' , you're going to love that movie,even a lead actor from Community plays there (small role) and you can sense the similarity to the humour But that wasn't enough.You also have Bilbo Baggins,the guy from Goodbye Lenin &amp; Marisa Tomei!In a superheroes movie about Civil War!!! Therein lies the problem of the movie.It's tone.It changes from serious to laughter in almost every scene,all the time As for the serious part,let's just pretend it's not there,then you can enjoy the movie! First of all it's not a Civil War,it's 12 guys fighting in a parking lot(or airport) and when the actors talk seriously,they have to wear sunglasses or behave like robots The fight scenes? Amazing but over the top The scenario? Cap seems constantly to convince Iron Man that he is either misinformed(Is Bucky terrorist) or overreacting(Did Bucky kill my parents) and that's why they fight!!! The evil guys? Zemo was totally lame and no nerve.Crossbone was decent The new good guys? Spiderman &amp; his aunt are out of space/time.It will make you wonder who made those choices if you know how these characters were depicted in previous movies..Spiderman is totally dis-likable , but hey he does make you laugh! Black Panther was awesome , but he was lame when he was showing his panther claws Matching to Comics: Hellll no!!! Captain America does not even die,no lead actor gets killed.Simply told,Disney shouldn't have called it Civil War On the positives as I said before,you laugh a lot,there is plenty action with lots of established superheroes As a movie it was worse than Avengers,worse than the previous 2 Captain America films,maybe a little bit better than the Age of Ultron,but for different reasons.And to mention the 2016 competition Bvs had its flaws, but it was much more serious and consistent.Civil War feels like the horror/comedy movies where you know in advance that you can't take it seriously in order to enjoy it! Disney craps all over Marvel again..</fullReview>

That should do the trick, and keep the sheep happy.The movie has no story, its conflict is superficial and borderline idiotic, even for the way the avengers split into two groups had no logic in it, and, of course, no explanation. They just really wanted to flex their muscles, and so they did, period.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I big let down.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So the year of the big Superhero movies started so well with Deadpool and Batman v Superman, two movies I enjoyed very much, both different from one another and I felt delivered on what they were meant to be.I was looking forward to Civil War a lot due to the love I have for Cap's previous movie, the Winter Solder. However, this film was a massive disappointment for me.The film starts off in Wakanda where the Avengers have tracked down terrorists, led by Crossbones and as a result of the confrontation between the two groups, part of a building gets blown up and people die, which all of a sudden is a big deal. Due to that the government wants the Avengers to be reigned in an be controlled solely by the government, which Tony Stark is for (following a brief encounter with the mother of a dead child thanks to the Avengers) and Steve Rogers is against.From there on, the film is mainly focused on Tony trying to get Steve to agree to the terms posed by the government, with no success until it all comes to a head once both Tony and Steve create their respective teams.Marvel took a serious storyline in Civil War and just didn't know how to handle it in my opinion. It felt like the Russo's were caught between making a darker movie about a serious issue and making a light hearted comic book movie. In the end, we got a standard Marvel movie. Nothing different or ground breaking about it whatsoever... and its taken 13 movies to get to this point. It feels like the Marvel films are standing still and cannot progress to the next level, maybe in fear of the backlash from fans if they changed the formula.What the movie does well is it showcases the arguments of both Toney and Steve well and you cant really pick a side of your own. However, we don't really get anywhere and by the time the famous airport scene comes about, you forget who's fighting for which team. Some heroes don't even know why they're there! It all felt very forced.The action was great and so where the debuts of Spider-Man and Black Panther , however the whole movie could have been done without Spider-Man. He added no value to the story. The film had its standard levels of humour and whilst some of the comedy was done well, it went into overdrive once we had the inclusion of Ant-Man and Spider-Man.The only part of the movie that was heart felt was the final scene between Cap, Iron Man and Bucky as you felt the heartbreak that Tony had at that moment - great acting from Robert Downey Jr. However, even that scene came about via coincidence, which was really the trend of this film.... everything that happened was coincidental, from Tony showing his younger self with his parents at the MIT presentation, to the video of Bucky killing Tony's parents.Civil War was the wrong title for this movie. It should've been called, 'A Minor Disagreement'. All in all, the movie felt pointless as nothing was achieved by the end. Everyone remained friends and the only casualty of the movie was the least cared about character in War Machine. The movie just felt like a stepping stone to Infinity War and the solo Spider-Man and Black Panther movies.No doubt that this will be praised by everyone and will make a ton of money, but as someone who appreciates movies, this one fell well short of the mark.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the worst Marvel films ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just saw it. Not gonna go in depth but incoherent plot with lack of motivations for a lot of the characters to even fight to begin with. Didn't like the actor who played Spider-Man, his jokes were bad and misplaced in the middle of action scenes. Spider-Man seemed like he was added in at the last possible moment of production as he seemed out of place. I mean Tony Stark shows up and just blindly follows Tony. Black Panther was alright but oh boy does his mind change fast but like Spider-Man, he was shoehorned in. Ant-Man dragged along to be beside Captain America, he just blindly follows Cap.Too many jokes in the middle of action scenes. Winter Soldier almost killed some of the Avengers but Captain Americas gay love for bucky blinds him from him. Captain America being so stubborn and showing his true colours as a terrible individual as he doesn't seem to care about anyone's safety. I thought Cap was suppose to be a leader but really, this movie only showed lack of leadership skills as he almost got everyone killed.The highly praised airport fight was not impressive. I'm not sure what people saw here. Zoomed-in action scenes, close up to the faces, lame jokes in between, Black Widow asking if were friends to Hawkeye, camera shaking. The heroes just scatter/disappear and end up on the raft?.Terrible pacing from one scene to the next. Captain America just having a casual talk with Spider-Man while they are fighting and you can see Evans laughing after he mentions that he's from Brooklyn ugh. So bad and so cheesy. Cap holding the helicopter ugh so cheesy.They say bucky is brainwashed but in some scenes, he seems to have it together but in other scenes, he don't. If he is brainwashed, why does Zemo need to activate him when he says the code?. After Zemo says the code, he almost killed some of the Avengers but later on, he fights alongside them?. And now he has it together or what?. Is he brainwashed or not, what's going on here?. Why is he back and forth on killing the Avengers and then working beside them?. Ugh so awful.Chris Evans wooden acting. Lack of facial expressions for the intense moments of the film. Captain Americas lame letter to Tony Stark.All these Marvel movies and they still can't make War Machine the true badass he is like in the comics. The character has been under utilized since Rhodes has put on the suit. They made him a laughing stock in Iron Man 2. The character has very little screen time in every other Marvel movie. Absolutely awful how they treated War Machine in this movie and previous movies. Terence Howard should be happy that he's not playing this character anymore. Disney/Marvel made him a joke.RDJ as Tony Stark/Iron Man is fantastic as always. No complaints here, his motivation for killing Bucky makes sense here. Captain America protecting bucky nope other then that they are friends from back in the day.A lot of the faults people give to BvS which are warranted is also in this movie Civil War. This is not even a Cap Movie, it's a Avenger movie. It's a overcrowded mess with too much going and too many shoe-horned characters and too many characters lacking any real motivation for even fighting each other.I could go on about why I think this is the worst Marvel film to date. I'm not sure what critics saw here. I rated it a 1 as a place holder and reserved judgement until I saw it. I finally saw it. I'm leaving it at a 1/10. An absolutely awful dreadful film that's only to please the fanboys and children.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another awful MCU movie; BvS is a much better movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1st, Civil War is basically a copy of BvS. A government building gets blown up by a bomb, killing a prominent government official. A villain manipulating heroes into fighting.2nd, too many characters just popping up without any reason at all and just shoehorned into the movie - Ant-Man/Giant Man - Black Panther - Hawkeye (was retired, now suddenly abandons the girlfriend and kids to come back and help a fugitive escape from the authorities) - The Annoying Spider-Kid (more annoying than Jar Jar Binks in The Phantom Menace; did more talking than fighting)3rd, after all the buildup about a disagreement over the issues of collateral damage and government oversight of the heroes, those issues were completely trivialized by a "big fight" that was nothing more than a friendly sparring contest with bad one-liners thrown in: "Are we still going to be friends after this?" "We haven't met before?" "Mr Stark. What do I do now?" "You have a METAL arm?" "I'm from Queens. I'm from Brooklyn."Was the "Civil War" supposed to be a real fight for something they believed in, or just a "Joke-Off" to determine who could deliver the best jokes?4th, MCU fans had been saying for months that Captain America was justified in opposing government oversight of the heroes because he didn't want the Avengers to be controlled by HYDRA. But it wasn't HYDRA who requested the Sokovia accords. It was the United Nations.The Avengers had caused massive deaths and destruction so the United Nations wanted oversight of the Avengers. But Captain America didn't want the Avengers to be held responsible and have to answer to the people for the massive deaths and destruction that they caused.Captain America wanted the Avengers to be the supreme authority (exactly like Hitler, Stalin, and Saddam Hussein made themselves the supreme authority) to make decisions on what's best for the people instead of letting the elected representatives of the people make decisions on what's best for the people (like the way a Democracy works). So basically, Captain America opposes Democracy and favors Tyranny.5th, plenty of plot holes and lazy, contrived writing. Tony Stark had called Secretary of State Ross to evacuate the airport prior to the big fight. So Ross knew before the big fight that the Captain America and the Bucky were planning to hijack a plane at that airport.So why didn't Ross just have military fighter jets hovering in the sky nearby in case they succeed in hijacking a plane? There's already a "shoot on sight" order for Bucky so if they succeed in hijacking a plane, then the military fighter jets can just fly in and either shoot at their plane to force them to land or shoot down their plane.Since Captain America and Bucky can't fly on their own, their powers are useless when they're inside a plane being fired upon by military fighter jets. And their plane wouldn't be able to evade military fighter jets. But the script needed Captain America and Bucky to escape so that it could set up the final fight between Iron Man and Captain America.Also, the 1st half of the movie is all about Tony Stark trying to get all the Avengers to sign the Sokovia Accords, which state that the Avengers would operate only when approved by a UN panel. Then in the 2nd half of the movie, Tony recruits Peter Parker to join his team even though Peter is a minor and wouldn't be able to sign a legal document and thus wouldn't be approved by the UN panel to operate under the Sokovia Accords.Another egregious error is that the whole movie set up Bucky as the killer of Iron Man's parents, thus setting up the main conflict in the movie, but why would there be video footage of their accident on some random back road in 1991? And how did whomever filmed the video footage know to place the camera at that EXACT spot where their car crashed, and not a mile ahead or a mile behind where the car crashed?If there was video footage, then wouldn't Iron Man or Jarvis or even Ultron have stumbled across it by now? Tony hacked classified government networks in seconds in Iron Man 2, hacked Shield in The Avengers and has apparently been watching Peter Parker on a regular basis. Seems like he would have found video footage of his parents' deaths a long time ago.And better yet, how could the coroner rule their deaths an accident when the ligature marks around Maria Stark's neck and the fist imprints in Howard Stark's face would have been immediately evident in the autopsy? Was the coroner just incompetent?Also, Tony Stark believed his parents died in an accident and never suspected foul play at all. So how did Zemo know that their "accident" from 25 years ago was actually foul play? How did Zemo know there was video footage from 25 years ago of Tony's parents being murdered and how did Zemo find that footage when Tony never knew about or found that same footage?Tony Stark was more angry at Steve Rogers because Steve knew but didn't tell him. So how did Zemo know that Steve knew the "accident" 25 years ago was actually foul play?Those are massive pills we're asked to swallow that exist only because they conveniently set up the final conflict between Iron Man and Captain America. Now that's some mighty contrived writing.6th, another forgettable MCU villain. Zemo was about as invisible in Civil War as Luke Skywalker was in The Force Awakens.7th, critics and haters of BvS complained about how Lex knew Superman is Clark Kent and how Superman knew Batman is Bruce Wayne, but there was no explanation at all for how Tony Stark knew Spider-Man is a high school kid in Queens.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would like to give maximum 3 stars for this movie. But as a superhero movie's fan, i have given 5 out of 10. Whatever, I created IMDb account only for rating &amp; sharing my views about this movie..I am not a reviewer! So please read if you like to.Nothing specials! Simple story line.. This movie should be Avengers 2.5 (!) But unfortunately, it keeps the title - Captain America!! There was no need of Iron Man..I haven't seen Iron Man's Ass is kicked by someone in any movie before! But this shitty movie has given me the opportunity to watch that. Directors was focusing only on Cap &amp; Buck! Other characters was just for show off i must say. However, My expectations from this movie was more than any superhero movies! But it has made me totally disappointed!That's all i was meant to say! Don't here me, go watch yourself.. I don't know how this movie got 8.5/10! I am confused. Bye</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I honestly can't express the amount of awesome in this movie. This is how you make movies let alone comic books movies.The story has been well thought out and and follows effectively. The characters and their motivations are well developed. Although a direct comparison between Batman V superman and this movie cannot be made, certain aspects can. For instance in BVS the new character introductions seemed rushed, however in CW the whole movie flowed really well. Age of Ultron was a bit of a let down it wasn't anything different from the previous Avengers movie. CW however was a definite step up the fight scenes themselves were astounding. This is definitely a movie I will be watching several times in the cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marvel Outdo Themselves... Again!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm going to be honest in saying that over the past few months, I've slowly become bored with the constant superhero releases, the current box office seems rife with them, not that that's a bad thing, it's just a tad repetitive. However 'Civil War' is just something truly different. Taking the same approach as 'Winter Soldier', 'Civil War' goes down the political thriller route, throwing a story of espionage and twists within the superhero context, and of course, bringing in as many superheroes as possible to make it one civil war worth watching! The inclusion of Spider-Man, Ant-Man and Black Panther made for a nice change to the Avengers' typical lineup. 'Civil War' is arguably the most mature and concrete picture to have yet emerged from the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and is, in my opinion, their strongest film to date, which provides a sheer sense of hope for 'Infinity War' (or whatever they end up calling it).</fullReview>

Its entertaining but it lack real tension.I would love if they at some point grow a pair and lets say goo-die tush Capatain A kill Iron man in the end. That I would have felt and it would create great ripples in future movies.However, its still a great ride and I got what I paid for.

		<fullReview>Civil war, one of the most anticipating movies of the MCU and one of the best movies of the MCU stars the Avengers that we all know and love along with the addition of two new Avengers, Which are Spiderman and BLack Panther played by Tom Holland and Chadwick Bosman. This film puts the Avengers in a bad position when scarlet witch makes a mistake that kills people and begins a conflict between the U.N. and the Avengers which forces the avengers to sign with the governments of the world or go into retirement. which then causes Cap and Iron man to conflict over what course of action the avengers should take in signing the Sikovia accords. That is until Bucky is framed for a bombing that kills Black pathers father the king of wakanda. He was framed by a man named Zemo who is mad at the Avengers for the accidental death of his family in New York (Avengers 1) and he plans on turning the avengers against each other because some of the most powerful people have tried to take them on in a fight but no one has successfully defeated them. and a big part of his plan is revealing who killed Tonys parents. it is revealed that Buck killed his parents while under mind control and steals a serum to create more winter soldiers to take over the world. but Zemo only uses that as bait so that he can get Iron man to fight Cap again. after the final fight Panther arrests Zemo and Caps side runs away and create the secret avengers. in my opinion this movie was great except that no one died. i thought they would have killed cap which would have made the movie much darker and would have made this movie more memorable</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A well balanced blend of action, humor and emotional depth!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So write of the bat, this is great movie. Not just in terms of being a comic book movie but just a movie. It is a well balanced combination of action and humor all the while hitting all the right emotional beats. It manages to introduce two new amazing characters in a very short amount of time but neither feels rushed or forced. This movie seems to be getting a lot of flake for the 'near obsession level of devotion',as one reviewer put it, that Steve rogers shows for bucky. And I couldn't disagree more, Steve and bucky are like brothers so as anyone with siblings knows just how deep that emotional bond runs. Steve might not agree with everything bucky does or how he does it but at the end of the day YOU are allowed to be mad at your siblings or disagree with them but if someone else does it then you have their backs. It is the basic code of sibling hood, aside from 'don't tell mom the stupid stuff I did'. Besides since the Avengers we have seen how out-place Cap really feels in this world ( the I understand that moments or the little book of look stuff up or pretty much any conversation he has with black widow in the first half of Winter soldier). So it makes perfect sense for him to latch on the last remaining link he has of his previous life especially since (SPOILERS) Peggy Carter is now dead. Definitely watch this movie, even if your not a comic book fan, it will still leave you immensely entertained.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best action of any comic movie yet.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is so much that is awesome about this movie it's hard to know where to begin so I won't get into any plot details and just talk about why I love it so much. Firstly I must say I was never a fan of Chris Evans until the first Captain America came out and after seeing how perfect he was in that role (more so than RDJ as Iron Man IMO) he is now one of my favorite actors and it's just an absolute joy watching him play Cap.Captain America always has the best moves, his combat style seems so smooth and brutal but somehow more grounded than any of the other heroes, it's just awesome to watch. Whoever is in charge of the fight choreography in the Cap movies is incredible, there were so many fist pump moments but that one scene with the helicopter I got goosebumps and I had to stop and take a moment to think about how incredibly awesome Cap really is.The story like in previous Cap movies is again excellent and has quite a bit of depth when you think about the general underlying issue that the team are dealing with, also somehow all these supporting actors seem to be doing a much better job at playing their characters which i'm guessing is down to the excellent script and story in the Cap movies. There are a couple of show stealers in the form of Ant-Man and Spider-Man (who had to be one of the biggest surprises and highlights of the whole film). I thought Toby Maguire was good but this new guy's wise cracking is so on point I can't see it being any more perfect, they also did an incredible job showcasing Spidey's moves and abilities, you see Spidey was the only comic I was interested in when I was young because he always seemed to scrape through fights by the skin of his teeth with his incredible acrobatics and quick thinking and they really seemed to have perfected that in this film.Paul Rudd (who for some reason i've had some weird man crush on for a while) is only in it for a short while but trust me when I say he plays a much larger role in the events of the movie. There was also an awesome little scene where Cap is finally rewarded and the hilarity and awesomeness of it has to make it my fave part of the whole film (another huge fist pump moment especially if you've been following Cap's endeavours off the battlefield lol). The balance of humour, seriousness and general tone of the Cap series is some incredible work guys, you've absolutely nailed it.The two and half hours went by so fast and it was an absolute joy from start to finish, with all the other comic book movies getting worse with each iteration the Captain America movies just seem to be getting better. I don't know how you are doing it and how these movies are far and away superior in every aspect to all the other comic movies but excellent work to everyone involved, and thank you for the wonderful time I had watching this. In this day and age this IMO is Hollywood blockbusters at it's peak. Go CAP!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A poor film unless you just like lots of things happening &amp; effects</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It HAS got superheroes. It has got non-stop action. It has got special effects. If you like only those, you'll love this film. If you like story that makes sense and is not too contrived, some moral point to a film, and the original comics, you won't. Best not to watch it.This should actually have been called an Iron Man film, or an Avengers film because a) its mostly about those and b) it ruins the half-decent Cap. America franchise. In addition, all these superhero films are becoming the same. This could have been an X-Men film, there's little difference.The moral point they tried to make was about who should wield massive power. Sadly, this point was lost in all the contrivances and out of character hero behaviour. They were like a bunch of teenagers having a gang fight in the school playground. The villain story was also far-fetched and highly contrived, and forgettable. Also, sometimes in the film I didn't know who side characters were, but felt I needed to.Finally, they introduced Spiderman &amp; Black Panther. As a boy my favourite hero was Spiderman. I really didn't care for Iron Man (a guy in a magic suit) or Captain America (a guy that threw a shield for American propaganda - yes' even as a boy I thought that). I haven't liked previous Spiderman films (I didn't hate them). I liked everything about this new Spiderman except for the fact that he's around 13 yrs old and his aunt is about 40. Call me picky, but thats just not Spiderman. Did they really stoop to this just to rope in younger film goers? I liked the Black Panther story-line and the acting, however, his in-costume movements &amp; behaviour were not Panther-like. Another indication that this is just a formulaic offering for a quick buck. There's no love of comic genre here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hastily assembled movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hi,I would like to start with the past. Specifically, winter soldier, the previous movie. Now that movie was focused. It had established an identity, which in my mind felt like espionage/action movie. Directorship was great and in my opinion extremely underrated. This comes in its own light due to the inevitable comparing between the two of these movies. In this movie to start with, combat scenes are poorly assembled. Directorship is terrible, very shaky camera, bad angles, constant switching between cameras, unnecessary dark lighting. Recent contrast to compare? Dead pool. They have the means to create a great combat scene where you don't need to replay everything 2-3 times to see what's happening and get a gratifying feeling and appreciation of the art in it. Let me give you another example... Jumps. I mean the heroic intro jump from a building or some other height. The "bad-ass" intro. They've cut all jumps and change camera at landing, they didn't even bother to CGI it. The manner that this happened didn't feel neither artistic, or purposeful, just hastily assembled.As a fellow reviewer commented, plot holes everywhere. I am not going into specifics but you couldn't get they why. It's like after they had filmed the movie, someone changed the script. Lastly, i just want to point out, that i am the kind of man with an obsession. Meaning i like the franchise immensely and i will try to cut corners and justify everything they dish out at me, and I've defended every movie of the universe from day 1, either good or bad (there wasn't any movie in the franchise till now that was not at least decent and with good standards anyway), with the same zeal.I have never written a review in the past, but i was so offended by this movie and so frustrated to see such high ratings, just because its captain America/avengers and the names of the cast, that i had to resort here, to warn people and hope that someone in the marvel franchise is looking out.Don't get me wrong, I've never even bothered with reading the original comics. I couldn't care less about how the lore might defer from comics. It was outright insulting to the viewers and just a money-hoarding movie. To justify this, simply compare the excellence of every past movie coming from this marvel universe with Captain America Civil War. The difference is immense, humongous, monstrous, enormous, it's a gap that cannot be leapt.I'm really really sorry and sad about this, it will be the first movie of those that i will re-watch only once at home simply to get all the facts and lore to be up-to-date for the next ones.Needless to say that 1 hour after watching it at the cinema, i'm still dizzy, literally dizzy and sick in my stomach from the bad lightning and the darn earthquake camera...Overall, I totally understand that after a certain point, when the script and subsequently, the universe, has expanded so much, there will be some gaps. But fans would rather wait for a movie to be completed first, properly than have movies just roll out fast. This movie by my simple amateur gut feeling and estimation, should at least have a development/shooting time of 2 to 3 years. The feeling we got in the cinema, was that it was rolled out in 6 months.With all the honesty, positive aura and hope, i wrote this review, praying, making an ode to the creators and executives to climb back this steep path, come back to "light".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would give it 0/10 But had to settle for the lowest which was 1/10. This movie is as inconsistent as it is poorly written. Black Widow survives being thrown in a armored truck with a grenade, not to mention no one even bothers to shoot at her. The scene where Scarlett Which blows up part of a building was ridiculous, out of all the places she could've chosen to throw the bomb it was at the one tall building in the area. Captain America freezes due to hearing the name Bucky and even says that. The scene where Black Panthers Dad dies is ridiculous given that Black Panther should've been killed in the blast, not to mention how was that part of the building the only part that suffered the most damage? I guess they didn't want to kill off Black Widow. The explosion would've leveled the lower floors thus resulting in the higher floors crumbling. Not just that one room being majorly affected. Tony Stark is the only one in this that makes sense. Everyone complains about Tony and says he's the bad guy and will stab you in the back, when they are the one's who broke the law and have a cry about it. Scarlett Witch being "rescued" by Hawkeye was completely ridiculous, she has a guilt trip about killing people and she snaps out of it just because she is told to get up off her ass. Not to mention Tony just grows a conscious after a few years of all these other people dying but changes his tune after talking to a Mother. Jokes are forced.Lets not forget how bad the reasoning for their fighting is. Captain America especially, Bucky being a trained killer, who would be out in public and he thinks it's a good idea to break him out and beat up the German police. Also the part where black Widow goes off at Tony for things getting out of hand and that Captain America will always be on the run and she let Captain America go. This is why the Avengers can't have nice things.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marvel have lost the plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a big comic, superhero and film fan I was really excited for this film.Oh dear.It's a mess.The first 30 minutes is boring, nearly left at that point. Baron Zemo is a terrible villain, is less than one dimensional with the on screen presence of a bag of rice.So Tony and Steve has a political disagreement... no problem thinks Tony, I can sort this out by blasting my best friend in the face with high powered explosives! Why exactly were Ant Man and Spider-Man joining the fight? Fun as a Spider-Man's scene was it was a lame introduction and nothing more than Marvel screaming "LOOK! WE HAVE SPIDER-MAN!" And if the Avengers are having this debate surely Jenny, a.k.a She-Hulk, would be there being as she is a lawyer. Oh yes, can't have too many female characters unbalancing the precious testosterone driven MCU.I don't know about this being Captain America 3, it was more like Winter Soldier 2, a character I'm not keen of to begin with, so it was annoying to have this character take up yet another film.The final fight between Cap &amp; Tony also made no sense. Tony knows Bucky was under mind control and not a murderer yet he still goes off on one, rounding off a truly badly written story.And now the Avengers are no more. Oh great, now the next film will have to spend half an hour bringing them all together again.Overall it was a huge let down. So much so it really has tainted the whole Marvel universe for me. Oh well I guess I could read the comics... wait... Thor is a woman, Iron Man is a girl and Bruce Banner is dead... Marvel have lost the plot in a BIG way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie on opening night, I'm a huge nerd with superhero anything. From the last two CA movies I expected high and this kicked my butt when it comes to my expectations, in a good way. I was expecting the normal heroes that are in the movies of late, and we got more. I tried not to spoil it for myself and watch all of the trailers so I was shocked when --------------*MINOR SPOILER* ------------------- the panther, ant-man and spider-man decided to show. The acting and casting is excellent. The story was great, and the music was bound to be stuck in your head for the night. While the lines were a little cheesy, like in pretty much every comic, the movie was overall very good and worth a watch. I would say 10+ but you can check out the parents guide for further info on whether your kid should see this.

		<shortDescription>The Russo brothers did it again!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow, "Captain America: Civil War" is amazing. It lives up to the hype (91% Rotten Tomatoes, 8.5 IMDb). I loves that it takes time to develop the characters. Even though there are like 50 super heroes, each one is given a scene to give them a place. More drama than super hero movie. Very smart dialogue, cinematography, action scenes. There are stakes on both sides of the fight. I was geeking out over some of the character interactions we got to see. It's almost like one of those great season 3 or 4 episodes of GoT (with the number of characters). Really, the Russo brothers directed "You, Me, and Dupree?." How.9/10 or 10/10. I'll have to see it again to confirm. My ranking of the 13 MCU movies right now: 1. Captain America: Civil War Perhaps I'll cool down on my love for this movie... or I just love the Russo brothers' direction style. 2. Captain America: The Winter Soldier 3. The Avengers. So much fun. 4. Guardians of the Galaxy. Forget about the great fun of action scenes and characters, but the dialogue alone is perfect. Feels like I'm watching an episode of "Archer" or "Arrested Development." 5. Thor. Very underrated. The cinematography is great by Kenneth Branagh (director). Best part is of course the Loki story. By far the best developing of a MCU villain. 6. Iron Man This is where it gets hard for me. Downey Jr has so much swag in this movie. Great introduction, but I feel like it stole so much from "Batman Begins." Jeff Bridges is also a very poor villain IMO. 7. The Avengers: Age of Ultron A fun, good movie. I expected more, but it was still good. 8. Captain America: The First Avenger. Good introduction to Cap, but it has the overall Joe Johnston (director) middling director feel to it. 9. Ant Man. The "Ok, it was good. Not great, not bad... just good." 10. Iron Man 3. The Mandarin twist still pisses me off. Also, the Iron Man suits are all of a sudden plastic junk? 11. The Incredible Hulk. I remember REALLY liking the first 1/3 of the movie + Norton is good. 12. Thor 2. The Loki drama is fun, but Malekith is the most flat villain you'll ever see. Typical/ boring plot. 13. Iron Man 2. Downey Jr is great, but poor plot and villain (Ivan Vanko).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Superhero Movie of the Year.. yet!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hey everyone! ("spider-man voice")This is by far the best superhero movie yet. I put the word "yet" at the end of the sentence, because i'm still waiting and looking forward to "Suicide Squad" and other superhero movie that hasn't been released yet. Although i'm a DC and a marvel fan, This movie is the one i enjoyed the most.The movie starts off nicely, building the scenes for the main event. The character's are well put together, Tom Holland as spider-man is as great a spider-man is in the comic book and black panther is also good. The CGI is also great, i really can't add any insight on this cause i've been sucked into the movie and hardly any focus on it. Although the villain is not that good, it hasn't affected the movie overall. The actions are great, the best action scene that i've seen in a movie 10/10. The airport scene is the most spectacular thing that happened, you're always at the edge of your sit. The plot is great, there's this clip that will horrendously trigger something at the end.This is really a great sequel to the Captain America franchise, or maybe the best marvel superhero movie to date.I'd give this MOVIE a rating of 9/10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best comic book movies ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Captain America: Civil War, directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, is the thirteenth installment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), and a sequel to 2014s Captain America: The Winter Soldier, also directed by the Russo's. The culmination of previous films had led up to this movie, and I had high expectations, especially after seeing the Russo's take on Captain America in the Winter Soldier. And this movie definitely didn't disappoint.After an incident in Lagos, Nigeria causes collateral damage, the United Nations introduce the Sokovia Accords, an agreement which states that the Avengers will no longer be a private organisation operating under their own jurisdiction, but will be regulated and overseen by a UN panel, who will then decide when and where the team can operate. Tony Stark a.k.a Iron Man, still guilty over his creation of Ultron and nearly bringing the destruction of the world, agrees with the Accords, while Steve Rogers a.k.a Captain America, still not believing in government control in the modern day, disagrees. This causes friction, not only between Tony and Steve, but the entire Avengers team. It is only when the Winter Soldier a.k.a Bucky Barnes comes into the frame that the conflict between the two opposing parties begins to escalate. The cast is quite astounding, and the acting was great, especially by Robert Downey Jr. The action was some of the best I've seen in the MCU, and the center of that was the Airport Scene, were every hero lined up to fight each other. This action sequence is amazing as you see every character able to show off his/hers abilities, even if there were twelve heroes facing off, and it also pitched in some great references to other movies. I especially loved the Empires Strikes Back reference by Spider-Man. The last fight between the big three was more emotional and intense, as Zemo reveals to Stark about the Winter Soldier's most prominent kill: his parents. This then infuses the chilling fight, were no one comes on top in the end. What made it more compelling were some of lines given by Iron Man and Captain America, such as the Captain telling Stark that the Winter Soldier is his friend and Tony comes with the reply, 'so was I'. Or when the Cap makes a reference to the first movie when he goes, 'I could do this all day'. Everything put into this scene made it all the more captivating.Despite some criticism, I liked the main villain in the movie, Zemo. He's not the archetypal kind of villain you see in typical superhero movie, and I liked how the writers went in that direction. His character gave it a nice edge to the story, despite his plan relying on lucky coincidences and certain things to happen. The Russo's did an amazing job in introducing the two new characters in the franchise, Black Panther and Spider-Man. I was happy they didn't do a full recount of Spider-Man's origins as they have done in so many other movies, and enjoyed Tom Holland's performance of the crime-fighting spider. His talk with Tony Stark was probably one of the best scripted conversations in the movie. And Black Panther was amazing!! His character has so many things going, and I can't wait for his solo film in 2018. Chadwick Boseman's performance of the character was really good, one of the best in the movie, and I liked his approach to the role.Both opposing arguments had minor flaws, which made it all the lot harder to pick a side, even when I left the theater. The overall plot is great and the writers did amazingly well to adapt a popular comic book story line. I liked the music, and the directing and production was top notch as usual from Marvel. It shows how far they have come since 2008 with Iron Man. It's even better when they make a movie with so many characters into one, if not the greatest superhero movie of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A War of Super-Dilemmas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really have mixed feelings about this movie. I love the Marvel franchise and the heroes created in the comics. In this movie the acting, cinematography, action, and special effects were all top notch. Given the super-serious tone of the movie Ant Man and Spider- Man provide much needed comic relief. At any rate, it's the concept of a "civil war" between the good guys that bothered me. The movie presents four serious dilemmas for our heroes, none of which are resolved.The first dilemma is responsibility. Who is responsible for what the military calls "collateral damage," unintended destruction of life and property? Thaddeus Ross, now U.S. Secretary of State, blames the Avengers (the good guys) for what went down in the previous Marvel movies. Excuse me, but wasn't he in the military and wasn't he responsible for a lot of collateral damage by trying to capture and manipulate the Hulk?I waited for somebody in the meeting with Ross to raise his (or her) hand and say, "Uh, wait a minute, just who started those events that required us to respond. We didn't attack any of those cities." The truth is that innocent people get killed in wars and it's a horrible tragedy. The MCU depicts super-villains who make super messes. In all the previous movies the super-heroes are depicted as trying to minimize loss of life. So, how are they responsible for the collateral damage?The second dilemma is practical. Where do the Avengers fit as an organization and to whom are they accountable? The Avengers have no designated leader. Nick Fury went into exile and S.H.I.E.L.D. fell apart. The Avengers do need a chain of command. The simple solution would have been to appoint a new director of the Avengers, and the Avengers placed within the U.S. Department of Defense answerable to the Secretary of Defense. Steve Rogers would have been the ideal choice, because he understands military strategy and tactics.The third dilemma is political. Ross informs the Avengers that a United Nations panel will supervise them in the future. The concept reflects the evolution of oversight in the comics from initially being an American covert organization to becoming an agency of the United Nations comparable to U.N.C.L.E. For the most part the comics and film/television versions depict American control. As to the oversight proposal, what gives the United Nations the right to assume authority over an organization of enhanced warriors based in the United States? Moreover, government oversight would not have prevented the tragedies depicted in the previous Marvel movies. Just imagine a circumstance of any law enforcement agency (city, state, nation) having to get permission from a external civilian bureaucracy before responding to a crime or a threat. Micromanaging by bureaucrats greatly reduces the effectiveness of responding agencies.The fourth dilemma is moral. This dilemma is the most interesting, but it's not presented until late in the movie when Tony Stark learns that his parents had been killed by Bucky Barnes. Of course, at the time Bucky was just a mind-numbed robot, but that fact is irrelevant to Stark, who has conveniently forgotten that he created Ultron after being mind-controlled by Wanda Maximoff (before she joined the Avengers). There is no question that Bucky did commit murder. So, Stark, previously in favor of government oversight (=justice by the courts), makes a personal exception to kill Bucky in revenge. Bucky is also a friend of Steve Rogers who defends him against Stark's assault. This dilemma is one commonly played out in American courts when a person on trial for murder pleads not guilty by reason of insanity or some form of "diminished capacity." The ending of the film is especially poignant with Rogers leaving his shield behind, after Stark reminds him who made it. It would seem by this act the relationship between Stark and Rogers would be irreconcilable.In addition to the dilemmas, there are some serious logical problems with this plot. First, the title. How does combat by a few individuals constitute a war? How do you have a civil war where none of the super-hero combatants get killed? Since when does the U.S. Secretary of State have police powers and oversee a Super-Max prison, a Marvel version of Gitmo? How is it that Avengers who refused to sign were imprisoned without formal charges and without trial? How did Rogers manage to free his comrades from prison? He is only seen to be by himself.So now the Marvel brain trust has exiled the Captain America crew with Barnes in a cryogenic chamber. One can only imagine what convoluted set of circumstances have to happen to drop the criminal charges (whatever they were) and rejoin the Avengers. Oh, I know. The politicians will realize they need the criminal Avengers to save their asses from an alien threat. It's like The Dirty Dozen ("Oh God! I loved that movie."). "We'll wipe the slate clean if you take care of the alien threat," and in the fine print "providing there's no collateral damage. If the aliens cause it you're still responsible."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Captain America: Civil War was AMAZING!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>NO SPOILERS HERE... I watched the film on the 29th of April, Sadly only in 2D ;( so I cannot comment on 3D and what it looked like and if it's worth seeing in 3D.But...What I can comment on is how AWESOME this film actually was; by writing this review and breaking it down into small, tasty, bite-size chunks for you.The StoryMarvel films have hit a wall recently when it comes to story lines they just haven't been as 'well-done' as other Marvel films like Iron-Man and Avengers Assemble. Green Lantern was a letdown even though the amazing Ryan Reynolds was Green Lantern, also Deadpool could have been so much better all the elements of an amazing film were there: amazing actors, great fight scenes, there just could have been more to the film, the story was so simplistic. But Captain America: Civil War's storyline was so perfect it brought in all the elements of a great film in and they bounced of this amazing storyline that tore people between Cap and Iron- Man. It's so difficult to pick a side, and that's what makes it so great you are constantly changing from one team to the other and when they fight each other you're so torn between the two teams you can't decide and then you just don't want anyone to die are be seriously harmed and if any of them do it's a huge shock. The story easily gets a 9/10.The Acting The acting was amazing, the emotions run high in the film and the actors killed it, the emotional scenes hit you right in the feels. Shut out to Robert Downey JR who was amazing in the film. But we all know who we really wanted to see... SPIDER-MAN and BLACK PANTHER. Tom Holland for me is the best Spider-Man so far, he is a real Spider-Man I love how Marvel have decided to actually use a teenager to play a high school kid and not a 20 year old actor to play a high school kid, Spider-Man stole the lime light in the film with his humour, fighting abilities and that fine new suit! Black Panther didn't have many lines, but when does Black Panther need to talk as soon as you see him you know it's about to go down, and that vibranium suit was just Purrfect. The acting was a solid 9/10.The Action ScenesWOW... just... WOW they were visually stunning and so well done in all aspects, the main fighting scene in the airport lasted nearly 20 minutes of pure actions, every character was shown and used to full effect, Spider-Man kicked ass left, right and on the ceiling. Ant-Man was actually useful and was so well used. Scarlet Witch was ridicules in the fight scene she was a titan she protected everyone and was like a brick wall full of cars she controlled with her mind. You would think nothing could top off that fight scene in the airport, you would be wrong... very wrong... but no spoilers :D. The action scenes smashed a 10/10 perfect score.The ConclusionThe film destroys a 9/10 more a 9.9/10 the film was stunning in every way. I would recommend going to see this film as soon as you can and then go and see it again. The film took three different film series The Avengers, Iron-Man and Captain America and combined them and just... well played Marvel... well play, you have made the best superhero film so far by a solid 400 miles. I really hope upcoming Marvel titles like Doctor Strange, Spider-Man: Homecoming, Thor: Ragnarok and the upcoming Avengers: Infinity War films with most of the characters from Captain America: Civil War going to be in the film, will hopefully be as amazing as Captain America: Civil War is.GO...AND...SEE...THIS...FILM!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Civil War was about a family being torn apart, and this movie gives you that, AMAZING</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's make it clear here that I'm not biased with either Marvel or DC, I enjoy both and I gave Batman v Superman the benefit of the doubt. You can read more of my thoughts on my review of the film. I'm a huge fan of DC and felt that the movie suffered many problems with it's story and character development. That's where Marvel has the upper hand for many years now, by setting up all these movies and stories we get well developed and likable characters that we already identify with. Once you get to a movie like Civil War, you've laid out the groundwork for an epic movie. Sure Marvel doesn't follow their story lines exactly like the comic but it approaches it in a very respectful way. The thing that always stuck out to me about Civil War in the comics was how personal the fight felt. The characters were all part of a team and were like a family, they loved each other and cared about one another. It felt like a realistic take on what really happens when you argue with the people you love, you see things one way, but they see it differently, and you both struggle to find a middle ground. This element I was pleased to see made it into the film, the motivations were different than the comic but the intentions still felt the same to me. We've seen the Avengers grow together as a team and as a family, but now we see them forced into this situation nobody wants to be in. These characters that were friends, partners, brothers, get torn apart by different circumstances, and you really feel the weight of it all. Especially between Tony and Steve, the Russo's have talked about betrayal being a theme in the film and I can see what they mean, Tony and Steve have such great dynamic in it all I'd hate to give away what draws the line between them but it sank my heart into my stomach to see their friendship being shredded to pieces. The Russo brothers did a spectacular job with the Winter Soldier and this film is no exception. The action was just phenomenal, every set piece was timed right, and the story didn't drag by any means. One of the strong points of the Russo's that me and a friend of mine agreed on was the fact that they have a good understanding of character arc, they added so many new characters in this movie, and they were used perfectly, each one had a shining moment. Black Panther and Spider-Man rocked it the most in my opinion, both are just a hoot to watch and I can't wait to see them star in their own solo films. I think many people were disappointed with Age of Ultron because it didn't really feel like anything new, or improve on what we've seen before, it was the first Avengers just a little bigger. This movie is what Age of Ultron should have been, emotional, conflicting, and epic in it's own way. I was worried this movie would be black and white, making Tony the antagonist and Steve the "good guy". I felt conflicted and didn't know who to side with, and you know the movie's done it's job when you don't even know who's right, and who's wrong. A 10/10 for me, and easily one of the best Marvel movies to date. I've only given Marvel a 10/10 for the first Iron Man, the first Avengers, The Winter Soldier, and Guardians. If you love their films, this one you'll easily love. Great way to start the summer and a perfect way to kick off phase 3!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is awesome. I enjoyed it very much and liked it a lot. At the beginning having just watched Batman v Superman I thought that the idea that the superhero should be held accountable for the consequences of their fights on innocent people to be similar to that of Batman v Superman but unlike Batman v Superman this movie developed and brings this dilemma to new level. The title civil war is made justice three times. First, when the war stays between humans and superhero (no aliens or infinity stones). Secondly, during the epic fight between all the avengers on the airport and finally between Tony and Steve (epic ending). The fight scenes are incredible, fast and just great. When Winter Solder steals a driving motorcycle and possesses it in the air that was one of the wow moments. Just as it was the one when Steve defeats Tony and gives up the shield. Characters are all well done, well developed and very complete. What made an impression on me and made me love Captain America was how is childhood friend was more important than anything and anyone. He was not ready to give up on him. He is the last connection to the world as he knew it, to the world he called home. And we saw how in age of ultron he struggled to find home in the current age. This did not allow him to give up on this last link to that world. Unlikely for superhero movies this movie made me think about real-life lessons. I liked how Captain America foresaw what it meant to sign a contract and I especially liked when he pointed out that they will lose freedom to people with agendas. This is something to think about. Storytelling: great done, it starts with action, slows down enough to develop the story that leads to the high point of the fight and then it has the surprise element that leads to the real and final fight. So an active intro, a strong active middle and an surprise elemented active and morally strong ending. Another thing I loved about this is the humour. The characters are all very sympathetic and humour is skilfully done in the right times and places. A very well done movie. Looking forward to other parts and the last two infinity stones to show up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's definitely NOT "The finest Marvel Film", but rather a strong addition to the MCU and a perfect way to kick off phase 3</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Captain America: Civil War" is Marvel's 13th entry into the MCU. And the critics LOVED it. They even claimed it to be "The finest Marvel film".Now what did I think about this movie from a casual movie-goer's experience? Well, I will say this. It's a pretty good action movie. But I do have some complaints about it that are worth mentioning. First of all, there is an unnecessary story-line/subplot in the movie that didn't pay off and it just seemed useless for the story (I won't say what it is because I don't like spoiling anything for you). Second of all, characters like Spider-Man, Ant-Man, and Hawkeye join the Airport fight scene for no real reason. There is no motivation behind these characters to be involved in the battle. They are simply shoehorned. And just before you call me a "BvS biased fanboy", Wonder Woman, Doomsday, and The members of The Justice League were also shoehorned in that movie and people over-reacted about it. On the other hand, however, they seem to shut their brains off when they watch a Marvel film, and even though these characters are shoehorned, they don't speak about it because they are the biggest hypocrites I've ever seen!Last complaint about the movie is the jokes. The Airport fight is intense, but the tone changes awkwardly from serious to childish during that fight. And this is a problem I had with recent MCU movies except for Iron-Man and CA2. There is no tension. Hardly any. Maybe the only guys who were serious during that fight were Iron-Man and Black Panther. The rest were throwing some cringe-worthy jokes like "We're still friends, right?".With that being said, Civil War still managed to impress the fan inside me. What I liked most about the movie is that it did stay true to the comics in some parts and there are some beautiful comic accurate scenes. Spider-Man was GREAT. His suit is comic accurate, his personality is comic accurate, his age is comic accurate, and Tom Holland kills it. He also played a bigger role than I expected. Spidey was simply Amazing. Also, Black Panther was a surprise. He does have a clear motivation and plays a good role in the movie and I couldn't be more excited for his solo film.And the action. OHHH BOY!, the action is very well done. Probably the best action sequences I've seen so far in a Marvel film. There was some Shaky cam here and there, but it wasn't a big deal anyways. Also, another aspect that I found interesting in the movie is that I didn't know who I was rooting for and I didn't know who to side with. The movie did an excellent job with this. Both characters have their beliefs and doubts about each other which makes me side with one character but then side to another character throughout the movie.And the villain, Baron Zemo is also something rather good and bad in the movie. The good is that Daniel Brühl killed it with his performance, and surprisingly he's the only villain in the MCU who managed to tear The Avengers apart. The thing that's bad though is that he's mostly a mystery in the movie. He doesn't appear much which eventually lead me to forget who the villain even was. He was OK to say the least.To sum it up, Is it "The finest Marvel film"? Certainly Not. But is it a good film? Yes. Is it fun? Of course. And it's more than worth your time and money. I recommend it. If you love the MCU you'll love this movie. If you're looking for a solid action film go see it. From a fan's perspective it's awesomely action-packed and fun. From a casual movie-goer's perspective I did feel that there were some typical issues with most of the MCU movies. Mainly, the overuse of jokes and lack of motivation for some characters.Side note: When I rate comic book movies I have two sides. Casual movie-goer &amp; Fan. By rating it as a casual movie-goer I give you my honest score. Which is the score I would give if I weren't familiar with the source material. By rating it as a fan I give bonus scores to the movie if there is some fan service, or because generally I love superhero movies and they are fun to watch.Casual movie-goer's experience: 7/10 (Good).Fan's experience: 8.5/10 (Great).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Steps up to the line of greatness, but doesn't cross</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've sat on my feelings of this film for a while. I've come to the conclusion that it's honestly not great. I love the Marvel franchise, but this film was a huge let down. Everything seems to fall apart half way through the airport battle. For a film putting a spotlight on superheroes causing carnage, the massive destruction of the airport seemed excessive. The final battle between Stark and Cap and Bucky was poorly set up. Stark attacks Bucky out of vengeance instead of having a conversation like this character is known to. This defies the point of the film. The final battle is about vengeance, not conflicting views of how the world works. Even the reason for the Sokovia Accords existing misses the point. The issue of the Avengers is that they violate sovereign boarders, determine their own enemies, and kill without answering to any authority; not that there are civilians killed (though this is also an issue). The characters also change inexplicably. Stark goes from rational man to homicidal lunatic in seconds. The Stark of previous films deeply cares and is incredibly analytical and intelligent, this Stark is a one-dimensional copy. Additionally Captain America acts like an idiot, assaulting a police force who are attempting to arrest a man they have good evidence is a mass murderer. His actions are so unbelievably righteous he is almost a parody of himself. The ending is easily the worst part of the film, Cap's letter removes any impact from the film. It doesn't matter that they just had several battles, everything is fine in Cap's world. The lack of a death annoyed me as well, thematically I felt a death was needed, and it's lack left the film feeling toothless. In the end I didn't hate this film, but I would solidly put it as one of my least favorite Marvel films and I sincerely fear for the future of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.</fullReview>

It had the worst villain i have ever seen and the spiderman was just a mockery of the original. If it wasn't for some good parts and the comedy evoked i would have not given it 2 out of 10. Honestly, if one ordinary man can lead all these superheroes in a wild goose chase and pit them against each other, then how where they good in the first place. But i have to give credit for antman who was portrayed better but the lack of hulk was imminent. I don't even understand how the villain was able to bring ironman and captain America together for a fight in the climax. I don't know why they didn't just pit the winter soldiers against them which was what everyone expected and i think would have been a better climax than this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally. Marvel movies grow up and tackle mature themes.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Following a series of battles and a fatal error in a Mission that saw much collateral damage, the world finally calls for regulation on the superhero team known as the Avengers. Facing an uncertain future, the avengers are split on ideological grounds with captain America aka Steve rogers opposing regulation and iron man aka Tony stark supporting it. What begins as arguments soon morphs into rivalry, then escalates into conflict and ultimately battles. Into this conflict comes The Black Panther, a superhero from Africa who is after Captain America's Friend the Winter Soldier for involvement in an assassination attempt. As opposing sides deal with this new development, a young man gifted with the powers of a spider is recruited into the fight.What comes across as amazing is the directors' way for tying all these plot threads together. You have the black panther situation, the growing differences between Tony and Steve, the overarching political debate on accountability, then you have Spiderman being reintroduced into the marvel cinematic universe. With all these characters and subplots, the film never lets us forget this this is primarily a Captain America movie. Steve Rogers is the main focus with Tony Stark as his foil. With a little thinking by the audience to connect the dots, the plot threads fall into place nicely and the stories fit along parallel themes. Our tale is fast paced, going from tense conversation to awesome action and back again.The tone is, finally, more serious and more grounded, a much welcome departure from the increasingly comedic tones of most marvel movies. There is a true sense that the stakes are high, and the potential for loss is great. The Russo brothers crafted a serious political thriller in CAPTAIN America WINTER SOLDIER, and now they up that ante in writing, characters and action. Though some of the fights have that "sped-up-in-post-production" look, it is grittier, more brutal and less "dance-like" than most of other marvel movies. The final battle between Tony and Steve stands out as the best marvel movie fight ever not only because of the perfectly shot scenes but in the emotional aspect as well. Conflicts are framed in a "no nonsense" approach, rather than the cartoon-like quip filled play battles of before. Not that there aren't quips but these are from characters defined as such in their original comics, namely Tom Holland's Spiderman.Easily the freshest aspect of the movie, Tom Holland embodies the youthful wall crawler that comic fans love. His introduction foregoes the usual overly long origin tale and gets him right into the action. Everything is perfect, the way he moves, the way he talks, his emotional journey through the movie that runs parallel to that of the Robert Downey jr's Tony stark and Chris Evan's Steve Rogers. Everyone brings their best to the roles both new and familiar, with the two veterans conveying the emotional anguish and turmoil of two brothers-in-arms forced to opposing sides.This movie's emotional weight relies heavily on continuity and would be more effective if one had been following these characters from their first movies, through avengers and marvel phase two, right up till now. Without the 8 or so preceding movies, it is difficult to get a grasp on Captain America's or Iron Man's differing ideologies and unresolved interpersonal tension. Their motivations seem propelled by stubbornness and ego which would seem shallow without their relational context as provided by past movies.Thankfully the magnificent chemistry between this cast who have co-starred together for so long, shines. Chris Evans, Robert Downey Jr. And the rest all truly become their characters, drawing the audience into this fantasy world where secret Organisations, spies, superheroes and people with powers co-exist. There are some ill timed comedy, especially those that come in the middle of intense scenes. It kills the drama and the serious mood. Thankfully, these are few and lesser in number than previous marvel movies.The big downside, especially as a fan of the comics, is how different this is from the original civil war miniseries. The original was a tragic tale of good intentions carried out in bad ways, it deconstructed super hero feuds, touched on politics, delved into the philosophical question of freedom or security; themes that resonate with the world deeply entrenched in the war on terror. The movie version downplays a lot of that. Message to marvel: if you are going to use a title, at least respect the source material. This does have a few fleeting similarities but all in all feel like a completely different story which had no business using the name of an existing one. The political themes, touching on the accountability of those in power, are present but never at the forefront. By the movie's end, it does not even feature within the climatic showdown. What could have been a physical and metafictional "fight" between two friends representing opposing sociopolitical ideologies suddenly descends into a weak excuse for revenge.As a whole this is a tremendous improvement in every aspect over previous marvel team up movie AVENGERS AGE OF ULTRON. Comic book movies will be hard pressed to match up to this standard set by CAPTAIN America CIVIL WAR. Yes there is ill placed humour, yes they kill a certain amount of the drama with cheap comedy and yes the relatively generic musical score by Henry Jackman seems wasted on such an epic. But the few flaws aside, this is finally the kind of movie that marvel should be making. One that takes its superheroes more seriously, tones down the jokes, and delves into deeper themes both social and political. More focus could have been given to those themes, but this is a very pleasing start to what I hope is the maturing of the marvel cinematic universe.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERSCaptain America Civil War didn't blow me away. It was a pity since I'd been so hyped up for it for nearly a year and... I don't know it just fell flat to me.See the thing with these kinds of superhero vs superhero films is that the point of conflict has to be a gray area where no party is in the write or wrong. It draws in the viewer and keeps them invested. Though I really love captain America I just really found myself not really getting where he was coming from. I just felt like what iron man was doing reasonable and couldn't fathom why people even took cap's side.And Wanda literally just set fire to an entire building and injured hundreds; why is everyone not regarding her as dangerous? And Bucky is dangerous!Trying to get them on their side was the worst idea ever.The only saving grace for this movie was Black Panther and Spiderman. This film could be summed up in one sentence: Tony gets angry because Steve considers Bucky a better friend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Captain America and the Falcon? and The Avengers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Released in 2016, "Captain America: Civil War" chronicles Cap (Chris Evans) leading an Avengers mission that results in the loss of many innocents. As a result, the Federal government and UN, represented by Everett K. Ross (Martin Freeman), want to take the reins of The Avengers. While Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and a few others reluctantly support this measure, Cap, Falcon (Anthony Mackie) and some others categorically oppose it, which naturally pits the team against one another. Meanwhile, villains like Zemo (Daniel Brühl), Crossbones (Frank Grillo) are on the loose, creating further problems.I'm a big fan of Steve Englehart's outstanding run on the comic in the '70s, which was the precursor to Mark Gruenwald's notable work 10-20 years later (his run lasted a whole decade!). What I loved about the comic was the relatively realistic tone, the interesting relevant issues and the fact that Cap &amp; Falcon were the perfect representation of the USA. You'll see these elements in "Captain America: Civil War." The occasional interludes with Cap's babe, Sharon Carter (Emily VanCamp), are reminiscent of the comic. Speaking of The Falcon, I like the way the writers took the basic concept and made him better; for instance, the way his wings deflect bullets and the nature of his 'pet falcon' Redwing.Since the plot ties into Cap's leadership in The Avengers we get numerous guest stars in addition to the ones already mentioned: Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen), The Vision (Paul Bettany), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and War Machine (Don Cheadle). As if that wasn't enough we also get Ant-Man (Paul Rudd), The Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and, believe it or not, freakin' Spider-Man (Tom Holland), with a glorified cameo of a hot Aunt May (Marisa Tomei), lol. How the movie can juggle all these characters and keep it from getting out of hand is uncanny.Lastly the core question of the titular 'civil war' is interesting and timely: Should the government usurp control over The Avenger's autonomy? Should this incredible team of superhumans become the pawns of the government? Captain America rightly says "No way." The movie runs 147 minutes and was shot in Puerto Rico, Atlanta, Germany, Iceland and Brazil.GRADE: A (8.5/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Summary - one guy punches another guy over misunderstanding</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really liked the first Captain America movie, I thought the story was strong, the writing was better than average Marvel, the acting was spot on.... this is not that movie. The story is terrible, like terrible terrible. So much could have been resolved with a simple 1 minute conversation between Captain America and Iron Man, a conversation that would have happened in any situation other than this movie. Aside from the terrible (have I used that word yet) shaky cam CGI that must make Transformer movie producers proud, the needless never-ending stream of Marvel characters is like watching the red carpet at some nonsense award show... yeah we get it, you love yourself. However, unlike an award show, there weren't any scantily clad beautiful people to watch to keep your attention, both myself and my girlfriend noticed that fact. Lots of pretty people, just as covered as women at a Bahrain beach. Somehow they managed to make Scarlett Johansson look average, that might deserve an award.So to summarize the entire movie, HUGE spoilers (kinda joking but sadly not really), imagine this exchange between Captain America (CA from here on) and Iron Man (IM respectively), imagine this in your special voice, I prefer Cartman from South Park:CA: Winter Soldier didn't kill anyone, he my friend IM: No he kill people, I see the video CA: Nah uhh, he my friend IM: I see the video, so I put on my suit and punch you now CA: No I punch you, and I get my other friends to punch you IM: No I punch you, and I get MY friends to punch you too... Time passes after the punches, and IM learns Winter soldier has killed his parents under the brainwashed control of Hydra long ago, and the following ensues.....IM: Winter Soldier killed my mommy and daddy CA: No he my friend, he not kill them, Hydra kill them IM: No I see the video, he killed themCA: NO! he MY FRIEND, he NOT killed them, Hydra kill them IM: NO! I see the video, I put on my suit and punch you now CA: I punch YOU now, I throw my special shield and break your suitTHE ENDYour welcome for saving your sanity and your money</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**So Many Spoilers** **Spoilers**Marvel made some great films like Guardians of the Galaxy,The Avengers,Iron Man,Winter Soldier and Ant-man but they also made some mediocre ones like Thor the Dark world,Iron man 2&amp;3 and The incredible Hulk and also the disappointing film Avengers:weak of Ultron .So "civil war" where do I need to put this? in the Great category of course.This by far Marvel's strongest film better than the Winter soldier,yeah I said it,Some people may prefer Winter soldier but for me is better than that.The Characters,They are all great,they where given enough time to shine especially spider-man, you won't be disappointed with Black Panther cause he is also great.The new Characters are great and I like to see them their upcoming films.Iron Man/Tony stark is amazing,it felt like Iron man 1,he regrets everything that he has done and that's why they need to put in check.Captain America is the same boy scout that you know and Chris Evans still nails it as the guy who dress up as a flag.And again the other Avengers where given the time to shine.The real villain Zemo is the first villain in the MCU that is just some guy who has a plan to tear the avengers apart and put some layers of the character but the villain is forgettable.I hope they use him and set him up as bigger threat in in some of the future marvel films cause he is not yet dead,he almost try to kill himself but Black Panther saved him. The action scenes are fantastic well some of the scenes felt too shaky but that was just one scene where Bucky,Black Panther and Captain America chase scene.The best fight for me was Cap vs. Iron man scene in the final action scene in the film,where Iron man founds the truth that The Winter Soldier killed his parents and Cap tries to save Bucky from Tony.The fight was amazing and I love to see it again.The second one was the Airport fight sequence,It was the best part of the film where the Superhero Vs superhero fight happened.The fight sequences where handled pretty well and they give emphasis of the heroes abilities and Spider-man's quips.Let me go on fanboying about spider-man,He is great and Tom Holland is the best Spider-man/Peter Parker better than the Tobey and Andrew's Version.He is given time and makes me smile when he appears in the airport fight sequence.He is also talkative and throw a lot of quips and I like it.My other favorite character,Ant-Man grows big like in the comics first time on screen.So the action sequences are great and the Russo Brothers really knows to do Action.The different ideologies between Cap and Iron man are handle well.the Sokovia Accords thing where they need to be under the eyes of the government and the Avengers id not anymore a private agency was handled well.The set-up of why Cap and Tony fight was handled greatly and they take time to emphasize their different ideologies.The 2nd major one was Bucky,Buck is huge in the conflict.He was framed by Zemo and make T'challa thinks that Bucky killed his father with a bomb while in the United Nations.The whole government think of that.Cap founds out about Zemo and wants to find him to know the truth and making them split in to two groups #Teamcap and #TeamIron man leading up to the airport fight,where they know where Zemo is heading and all of team cap was there to go with him but Team iron man founds them and the fight begins. Okay I am now explaining the plot but seriously it was handled greatly and make sense cause we know why they fight and why they where split.You will be confused of which side are you on cause both men are right in their respective ideologies.Marvel did a great job between the Punisher and Daredevil's ideologies and why not do a great one in "Civil War".So Captain America:Civil War is Marvel's strongest film with a plot that works,characters that we love emphasizes their abilities and powers and stay lovable. Action sequences that was fun to watch.It destroys Age of Ultron and is the best movie in the Cap's Trilogy.This is a fun summer movie.I recommend this.</fullReview>

The special effects/fights were good but you didn't really know who to root for... just didn't do it for me. Perhaps if there would have been some resolution to the conflict between Captain America and Tony Stark that might have rescued this movie for me. I'm sure they will make the next movie with Captain America swooping in to rescue Stark and or his beloved Pepper in order to bring him back into the Avenger fold. This just seemed like an unfinished piece of work. May this is the Empire Strikes back of the Avenger series. LOL</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Captain America: Civil Flaw</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Captain America: Civil FlawFlaw is the name. The plot is weak. Not enough motives for the Avengers to get divided and fight. The villain is weak. I am totally unconvinced that this version of Zemo can pull his little evil plan given so limited resources, so many uncertainties and so many uncontrollable factors in real life, unless he is a prophet. Maybe there is more depth in him, but I just don't see it.Flaws in characters.Pepper Potts - If Gwyneth Paltrow does not want to be part of the movie why mention Pepper Potts? Who cares about Pepper Potts cannot come to MIT? This is a total distraction with no sentimental element in the recipe. Same thing applies to previous Thor movies when Thor kept mentioning Jane Foster. Everyone knows Natalie Portman refuses to play that role. Drop it please. Stay focus!Vision is a god-like superhero. His power is way beyond any human superheroes. In the movie, he has little actions and plays a small role, such as nanny for example. In the airport fight scene, he disappeared from the screen for a very long time. It seems the scriptwriter does not know what to do with this role. Neither do I. I always think that creation of god-like character is a mistake. Stan, are you listening?Ironman - He was used to be funny, playful and humorous. A very lovable character. Not anymore. He is sad, unhappy and angry in Captain America : Civil Flaw. Previously, Ironman was always right and would do the right things before others realized. Not anymore. He is wrong, takes up wrong position and emotional in the movie. Ironman was used to be a playboy with a rebellious spirit in him. I really don't expect he could stand on government's position and gladly take orders from them. This movie has destroyed Ironman IMHO. Captain America - Captain was used to be a patriot. He is supposed to follow government's orders. Now he is the rebel. He should trade position with IronmanBlack Panther - Awesome cool looking superhero. Me and my daughter love him. But I just don't understand how come an underdeveloped country can produce a superhero like this. And is it true that anyone wearing a mask can fight? If so, I want one.Ant-man - Scott Lang looks tired. Did he eat breakfast? Ant-Man's costume has changed this year. Last year costume was better. Ant-man's secret trick in the airport fight was a good one. It was awesome.Spiderman - Successful character. Hey! The new Spiderman shines. Tom Holland is a lovable and convincing actor. In this life, Peter Parker, has an unusually beautiful aunt May Parker. Hurray for the audience! Looking forward to the new Spiderman 2017 movie. Also the classic costume looks great. I like it.I love superhero movies with good story. Only playing muscle is a bad idea.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exactly what you expect it to be **spoilers**</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Civil War did what Disney MCU do well to their usual standard. I took my daughter to see it as she's a big fan of the franchise and I'll go and watch anything comic book related. She loved it, I thought it was alright.As an MCU film it gives you some cool new characters, a conflict between the two main heroes and 1 exceptional action set piece. There's tons of humor and the action is bombastic so it's exactly what you expect from these films. If that's what you are into, you won't be disappointed. Spidey's cool, Black Panther's cool and Aunt May is hot.Now if I remove it from its franchise and view it as a film in itself it falls completely on its arse. The opening scene is shot with so much shaky cam and speeding up of frames that it looked like a benny hill sketch. Honestly, I wouldn't have been surprised if the Benny Hill theme started playing it was that silly. I also hated how badly they screwed over Cross Bones here. There was absolutely no need for that character to become Cross Bones and killing him off has wasted a potentially great villain for the punisher series. Maybe it's a merchandising thing, I don't know, but it seemed really stupid.The whole film was full of forced relationships. Considering they've had numerous films to get us to this point you'd think there would be some gravity to how these characters interact with each other, but it's nothing but smart arse comments and supposed emotional responses that make little sense; such as Steve smooching the Shield agent or the Wanda / Vision interactions which felt even more forced than the laughable scarjo / hulk relationship in AOU. They throw in war machine for no other reason than I guess to up the diversity quota and give us what is I imagine is supposed to be an emotional moment when the super intelligent android shoots him out of the sky. Seriously, why not kill him? Hes pointless in the MCU and it would have at least given us more of a reason for Stark to become psychotic at the end.Now, the airport fight ? it looks amazing and all of the heroes get their time to shine, each having a little set piece to show them off. It's exactly what you expect to see in a comic book movie and they do it well, but ruin it with consistent "banter". It's like the character fighting don't actually care about the violence they're inflicting on their supposed friends and colleagues and neither do the audience because there are no stakes here. That for me is a major issue with the MCU, and something that is massively highlighted in Civil War ? they approach this mega violence with such a glib attitude and an over concern about doing "cool stuff" that what is supposed to be a heart wrenching tense battle is instead turned into barrage of jokes as if none of the characters actually care that they're killing their friends. That, for me, is something the DCEU has gotten spot on so far ? the violence is abhorred in the franchise, always questioned and never glorified. Now I'm no vegan, but if you're going to try and make one of the main themes of your film the effect that superhero violence has on the world it is happening in, you should maybe not have your heroes joking about while gleefully destroying an international airport. The whole issue of collateral damage seemed incredibly forced here and was instantly forgotten in the third act and left completely unresolved.The final fight between Tony, Bucky and Cap felt unnecessary, and after the highs of the airport fight was sluggish and underwhelming. Tony acted like a moron, but I was impressed by how he was all of a sudden capable of fighting off two super soldiers at the same time. Power level consistency has always been an issue with the MCU and nothing has changed here. I might have missed something here too, but it seemed odd that it was just Tony going after Cap ? why didn't Vision go after him? Where did Spidey go? Did Tony just ditch a 15 year old kid in Germany? Anyway, had they not just dropped the whole "sign the accord" plot then maybe Tony might have had some company on his mission. And Cap ditching his shield ? so what? Tony blew up all of his suits at the end of IM3 and was seen there dicking about in a brand new one in the first scene of AoU. I fully expect the next cap film to start with him windmilling a new shield around with his dick. There are no stakes here, and therefore no tensions, and that makes it really boring unless you're just caught up in the visual spectacle of it all.I won't talk about the villain because there's not really anything to talk about. Boring, inexplicably funded and cast aside in favour of a final showdown between our two heroes.They gave pretty much the whole film away in the trailers too, so if you're expecting some cool action scenes that you haven't seen yet, don't.Finally, as a fan of the Civil War story in the comics, this is a massive let down. Its so far off that story that calling it civil war seems like a really cheap marketing move and it upsets me that we'll never see that story on film because they rushed to it here.Anyway ? TL;Dr ? it's a good MCU film. If you go in expecting something more, then it's your fault for being disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most epic superhero movies ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yesterday it was premiere and time for the second big superhero film this year, Captain America Civil War. I really like Captain America as a superhero, mostly due to his lack of over powerful strength. He is a soldier who during WWII, was subjected to experiments intended to make him a super soldier. The result was superhuman powers but nowhere near the likes of Superman or the Hulk. Frozen down and later awaken in present day earth, he struggles to adapt in modern society where everyone he has known or loved, is gone. In Civil War he is pinned against Iron Man. The government of the USA, forces the Avengers to sign a contract stating that they have to obey and work under supervision of the leaders of the world. Iron Man is convinced that it is the right thing to do while Captain claims that they will be forced to do things they don't want to.I really liked Captain America Civil War and I would say that it is one of Marvel's and overall among the best superhero films ever made. Forget Superman's or the Avenger films' extremely over powerful enemies that practically can erase the earth with a wind blow. Here it is brains before muscles and I like it. The film practically has more in common with James Bond and the Mission Impossible films, than with other superhero films. The spy theme is pretty constant throughout the film, with for example a hunt for a terrorist through several countries. There is also focus on terror acts which feels both modern and disturbing considering today's world situation. The other thing that the film does really well is balancing the characters. Civil War contains a lot of superheroes and it is at times hard to keep track on everyone. But with finesse and a prioritized focus, they choose which ones will run the story and which ones will figure as background characters. Very smart and thought-out. With most focus on Captain America and then Iron Man, they succeed much better than the previous Avenger films and most of all the latest Batman V Superman.The biggest question we all had before the film was, how will they put Captain America against Iron Man? Where Batman V Superman totally failed to motivate why those two giants would even fight each other, here they succeeded better from an even more difficult position because Captain America and Iron Man are friends that becomes enemies due to ideological and psychological differences. Overall the characters' actions are really well motivated. They have worked hard on giving every character a believable back story that drives them forward. Aside from the main conflicts and the superheroes, it is an incredibly well made film. The battle between the superheroes is so good looking and well choreographed that I can't think of an equal. Also the tempo and editing of the film works well towards it pretty long but still good runtime. The film constantly moves closer to the truth with small surprise moments and turning points along the way. It is perhaps necessary to have watched some of the other Marvel films before this one, but I still think that this works well on its own and that you should definitely take the chance to watch it in the cinemas because it is really exciting, good looking and well madeDavid Lindahl - www.filmografen.se</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After a disappointing "versus" movie we got a couple of months ago, Captain America: Civil War was clearly a remedy for that. The best thing about it was they've had a reason to fight and a reason to end it without a lame excuse like sharing the same mother's name. The story was simple, not about who's right or wrong, it was about what you believe in and how that would make you different from the others and the results of it sometimes not what you expected. Throughout the movie I couldn't decide which sides I would take because both team had valid reasons to defend their decision. The actors were really on top of their games. For me, the highlights were Elizabeth Olsen and Tom Holland (yes, he's a perfect Spider-Man). I also agree to some people who didn't like this version of Baron Zemo, but after watching the movie for second time, I think Zemo was a brilliant mastermind in creating the conflict between Avengers and I hope that he will appear in the future MCU films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is another great Captain America movie. It not only serves as a sequel to the Captain America: The Winter Soldier but it also does to Avengers 2: Age of Ultron. Kinda unique when you think about it. Obviously it doesn't follow the Civil War comics but Marvel still managed to make a great movie out of it. Even with many (or few) characters, it still worked and were all shown well in the movie. The characters too are very lovable. The action was again, awesome. The story was great also. It was hard for me to find some nitpicks in this movie but there are only two. It's not that complicated though. In conclusion, Captain America: Civil War is another great Marvel movie.

No one character was overpowered. Shot well too. The fight between Cap and Iron-Man was incredible too. Full of emotion. In-between the fighting was great. Everyone brought their a-game. Even in just the dialogue heavy scenes. Best. Film. Version. Of. Spider- Man. So. Far. Sony should give the film rights back solely to Marvel. The story was brilliant. Unlike the comic, but that's fine. It had heart and was captivating. Cap, Buck, Agent 13 and Falcon were brilliant. Iron- Man, Black Widow, Black Panther, and Spider-Man were brilliant. The others were too, but these really brought it. Cannot get over how good it was. Ticked all the boxes I had for this film. Even made a Star Wars reference. So good. Chris Evans, Robert Downey Jr., Scarlett Johansson, Chadwick Boseman and Tom Holland gave the best performances of the Marvel Cinematic Universe so far. It wasn't just a great Comic Book film. It was a brilliant film in general.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm literally writing this 30 minutes after I walked out of my local cinema, and I'm still shocked.After Dawn of Justice was... less than well received, it gave Marvel an amazing chance to leap even further ahead of DC in the "superhero war" and boy did they take that chance.I'm gonna jump straight in with a bold statement. Captain America: Civil War is in the Top 3 Superhero Movies of all time. Probably the best from the MCU, and given the likes of Winter Soldier and Guardians, that's quite a feat.So what was so great about it? The plot was extremely well structured, which should be a given but after the mess that was Dawn of Justice, it's refreshing to see such a well tied together story in a major superhero movie.The characters are all amazing, and there's a few surprises along the way too. As expected, Spider-Man hit it out of the park, as did Black Panther, but the star of the show (in my opinion, anyways) was Falcon. Every line he said was absolute gold, the stunts from him were all amazing, and while he was less than spectacular in Ant-Man, Age of Ultron and Winter Soldier, we're finally starting to see some great potential in a minor superhero, and if Steve Rogers is killed off in Infinity War, I can think of no-one better to carry on his legacy. Also, honourable mentions to Bucky Barnes, Hawkeye and Ant-Man, for also putting on a great show.Any negatives? The editing seemed a tad sloppy in places and in action scenes the camera shook a lot, but why even bother caring about minor details like that, when the movie all-around is exceptional.I can't see anything beating Civil War for film of the year in 2016, though I hope I'm wrong because I have high hopes for Suicide Squad.The future of Marvel movies looks to be in good hands!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More "The Breakup" than good comic book hero action</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Obviously, I am in the minority, judging by other ratings. However, this movie reminded me more of the rom/com that was neither romantic nor comedic, The Breakup, than an comic action movie.While the action scenes were fine, the plot had viewers sitting and watching their parents fight and screaming "good one Mom!" "Way to pound her Dad!" I mean, really, what are these characters supposed to be for viewers? HEROES. How does one enjoy watching one hero beat up, not a bad guy, but a good guy? Another character that is supposed to be your "hero".To borrow from an old phrase, with fans like that, what comic book hero needs enemies.And a bit of a spoiler alert, the ending is much like the resolution in The Breakup as well. An hour and 46 minutes to get that?! Obviously, I must be taking the roles of the comic book heroes too seriously. Much like Batman v. Superman, fans watching them bash EACH OTHER for a couple of hours seems to be good fun for many. To me, it just seems the writers have run out of good plot lines and have turned to eating their own tails, so to speak.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just saw the movie this morning with my roommate. I have heard great things about this movie and I thought that I was going to cry given how the Avengers are dividing over the issue of government oversight. I haven't picked a team and I don't think I will. I'm a mix, I guess.Anyway, back to the movie. Wow. Woo-hoo! This movie is a wild ride of action, effects and story. I haven't read any of the comics, but I have been following most Marvel movies, and this one did not disappoint in the least. Even though the story is more mature and brooding, there is also plenty of humorous moments, especially in Tom Holland's Spiderman.People, those fans were not kidding. This Spiderman flat out steals every scene that he's in with his humor, agility, nerdy persona and Tom Holland is the perfect choice to harbor Marvel's youngest superhero. He even looks a little like Toby Maguire. He was undoubtedly the best part of the movie, even though he didn't get much screen time. Totally looking forward to the new Spiderman movie due next year.Another huge highlight is the jealousy between Bucky and Falcon. Maybe jealousy isn't the right word, but these two do not exactly get along. Their moments together, though brief in number, are awfully hilarious as well.Wondering what's going to happen in the next movies to come. This one really helps set the field for what Infinity War will possibly bring in the future. Check out this movie. It's quite a ride</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A properly done versus movie. A great thriller movie. An amazing Marvel movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a showdown between arguably the 2 leaders in the Avengers, this movie doesn't disappoint (as I thought BvS did). You have many scenes that illustrate both sides of this conflict, the lawful and the rightful. Captain America and Iron Man are not opposite personalities. They just have different definitions of justice and protecting the world. The movie refuses to pick a side: it will push the viewers to pick one purely on emotion.As a solo movie and a sequel of "Winter Soldier", this movie continues to have a "spy" feeling. It's not an epic showdown a la Avengers, it's more of a personal film focused in both Captain America and Iron Man. There's several twists of that kind. The action doesn't disappoint, however, the villain is forgettable.As a Marvel Movie, this maybe the best one yet. It loosely follows the comics but I think it made the right changes almost every time. It has an incredible number of characters and yet it almost never feels overcrowded (Amazing Spider Man 2, Avengers 2) and it never feels like it has less substance than visual appealing (BvS). Every character is used correctly, and you can almost feel inside a comic book (Also, Spidey was very good)Greaat job, Marvel. And also the Russo brothers. Avengers 3 is in good hands.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A thoroughly entertaining movie from start to finish with exhilarating action sequences and intriguing personal motivations that gives gravitas to the comic book movie genre.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Digression : I saw this film at Trinoma in Cinema 5. I was excited to be going in early for the trailers but my excitement turned into disappointment when they dedicated the majority of the screen time for trailers to advertisements. Since this film is property of Walt Disney Studios, the trailers that show up are also upcoming projects of Disney. While this is a brilliant marketing strategy for Disney, it is also a cruel one for the other studios especially the indie ones. This will hurt the other studios' box office numbers and potentially ruin the success of indie films. I hope in the near future Disney Studios would give way to the other studios for the betterment of the film industry. But we all know that wont happen anytime soon. On with the review! When the world divides their opinions about the future operations of the world's greatest heroes, Steve Rogers and Tony Stark's political opinions clash causing the divide of the Avengers. Let me start by saying that the action, drama and comedy in this film are well balanced and well executed which crafts a smooth and seamless story line. This is the amazing work that the Russo Brothers are capable of. The implementation of comedy for a movie like this was needed to be executed carefully and they managed to pull it off. While the tension builds between Captain America and Iron Man, we get to deeply explore their character motivations and beliefs throughout the movie. With the previous heroic acts that Tony Stark had, we are now met with a guilty and troubled character. His matured character arc was interesting to dissect because we see him constantly trying to contain each member of the Avengers and take responsibility for their actions while handling the diplomatic relations and internal heartbreak that was caused by Pepper Potts. On the opposite corner, we have Steve Rogers who is fighting for his beliefs even if he has to go against the law just to protect his long time friend Bucky. These character depths add emotional weight to the story which leads us to have more difficulty on which team to root for as both sides have been well developed. The new heroes that are introduced to us in this movie are Black Panther and Spider-Man. They were given enough screen time and their performances were amazing. I'm surprised that Black Panther was given a lot of screen time considering that the audience isn't familiar with his background. Spider-Man was a strong element in this film. The scenes he's in provide comedic relief, but his CGI suit looked very unrealistic and half-baked. One nitpick I have for this movie is that when we are transported to a different place or another time line, there are these huge, white texts that pop out of the screen. It didn't ruin the whole movie for me but it was a bit distracting. The action scenes in here are amazing. The way team members capitalize on their abilities by working together and mixing up their offenses is a spectacle to behold. Each battle is intense and the final battle between Captain America and Iron Man will send shivers down your spine and that freeze frame during their final battle will make your jaw drop. Final thoughts : Comic book readers might not appreciate it that much because the film differs itself a little. What comic book readers should understand here is that the MCU(Marvel Cinematic Universe) is riding on the momentum and the world they created. Films are harder to produce and it takes a lot of time and patience to set up character backgrounds. In the end this is the closest adaptation we will get and it was a damn great effort. This was a very entertaining movie with interesting layers and deep character motivations. The audience that i saw it with even clapped because of sheer enjoyment and I left the cinema with a huge smile on my face I give Captain America : Civil War a 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>See this film! An unbiased review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Outstanding film. And no I'm not some bias Marvel fan with a grudge against DC and yes I actually did read the Civil War comic book series.This ends, what is right now the best comic book trilogy. That's right! Better than Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy. Remember this is comic book based films. I would not call this the best trilogy in cinema.I personally can't believe it. I never thought Captain America would take the lead in Superhero films but he has. I never liked Chris Evans casting in this series, but he has turned out to be a great Steve Rodgers.It is action packed and for the whole family. Be warned! It does have a grounded tone similar to Winter Soldier. There is humor but a lot of tense, emotional scenes that continue throughout the film.The film really is about emotion. It's about devastation, and loss. So do not go in thinking it's a slap stick gag fest full of one liners.Spiderman? Awesome! To my die-hard comic book readers, Disney and the Russo Brothers have NOT let you down.Black Panther? Great. Not quite the comic book version, but a well adapted character to say the least. If you heard he shines in this, believe it.Scarlet Witch? Much improved from AOU. Ms. Olsen is gorgeous and steals part of the show with Black Panther.Is it Avengers 2.0 or a Captain America film? A Captain America film.So my first spoiler alert is you do not see the entire team throughout the film. It sets up and finishes small details about important characters like Wanda, Black Widow and Vision, but you will not see much of them. This film is all about Captain America and his best friend Bucky Barnes and their story and how Tony ties into their history.So, no, it is nothing like Batman v Superman. This is not some manufactured relationship that occurs out of the blue and (spoiler) these guys don't battle because they would enjoy pummeling each other, or are unable to speak in a complete sentence.The reason behind that epic battle scene is not what you think.Speaking of that epic battle scene: Is it the best in cinema history? No.Is it the best in comic book film adaptation history? Absolutely!It's the characters you grew up with going toe-to-toe. Now is it canon to the books? Still a no on that one. As many of you know, who read the comics, these characters are severely powered down, and in some cases dumb down. However, you will not be disappointed at all.Enough with the praise, time to get to the not so great elements.Baron Zemo? Not great at all. (Major spoiler Alert) He is forced into this and worse he is given a reason why he is attacking the Avengers. For once I would like a villain who is evil because he or she chooses to be. I get Thanos is supposed to be the ultimate evil(at least I hope he is) but the under developed non-costume wearing villains need to stop. I need more than some random White guy, wearing a designer suit.No offense.(Major Spoiler again) As you guys saw in the trailer Tony fights Bucky and Steve solo. The reason for this is one of those deviations I actually do not like. Very weak set up. A typical Hollywood tie-in.Black Widow is in this but kinda side-lined, but again, I warned that the focus is on Bucky and Steve, same as it was in the First Avenger.I usually don't like comic book films that deviate too far from the source but I did not like this comic book series at all. It was predicated on Steve overreacting and Tony going too far. So although some deviations I did not like(one mentioned above) I'm glad this film deviated from it's source, while still maintaining the core reason for government intervention.The film is very focused and centered on concluding Steve's story-line, while continuing the events that took place in Age of Ultron. Not only is it not over crowed, I wanted even more characters involved.Avengers 2012 will always be my favorite comic book film, along with The Dark Knight, but this is certainly now in my top five CBMs of all time. Outstanding!A must see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have just returned from seeing Civil War in the theatre, and I can hands down say that it is not only the best film of 2016 so far, but it is also one of the greatest movies of the last decade. I don't want to go into spoiler territory for this review, but all I can say is that you will enter the cinema as your adult self, and leave a child. I have never been so immersed and captivated by a superhero movie like this before, I felt like my 8 year old self once again.The chemistry between Evans (Captain America) and RDJ (Iron Man) is phenomenal, and although they are both the stars of the film as it were, the best performances of the movie come from Sebastian Stan (Bucky), Chadwick Boseman (Black Panther) and, much to everybody's delight, Tom Holland (Spiderman). When I first heard that Holland would be taking up the iconic role, I wasn't sure. I had grown up with Tobey Maguire as my Spiderman, and I thought that he would be irreplaceable for the rest of time. But Tom Holland knocked it out of the park, and he truly made the role his own during his short time on screen. I could go on forever about how good all of the performances were, honourable mentions must go to Daniel Bruhl (Zemo) and Paul Rudd (Ant-Man). Both of them, like Holland, exceeded my expectations. In fact, Ant-Man was dark horse of this movie, and just like Spiderman he provides some of the funniest moments of the movie. The reason I haven't rated it 10/10 is simply because there were some slightly cornier moments (e.g. although of I lover Renner's portrayal of Hawkeye, I felt as though his dialogue was ruining the intensity and the excitement of some scenes).Some may argue that there was too much action, but I thought that there was a perfect amount, the final fight scene will take your breath away. Trust me. I am so excited for both Infinity War and Spiderman: Homecoming that it is unreal. Marvel have put DC to shame with Civil War, and they should be extremely proud of themselves. I am very proud to call myself a Marvel fan after this truly incredible movie; it is a modern day masterpiece. Captain America: Civil War earns a very impressive 9/10. Performance of the movie: Chadwick Boseman (Black Panther)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A psychological super-hero movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yet another masterpiece from the Marvel film franchise. Some people went in the theaters being on either Team Cap or Team Iron Man, but by the end of the film, it's clear no one was sure which side to be on.The film presents events, people and confrontations that justifies each and every Avenger's motivations for choosing a side. They are all valid and understandable. Tony Stark wants to make amends for the damage he and his fellow Avengers have caused other people, worried that he won't be able to stop. Which leads him to sign over his suit to the government to control when they decide. Steve Rodgers, on the other hand, is distrustful of the government, which can be manipulated and corrupted by criminals, like the Hydra, and maintains that "the safest hands are still their own." After a series of disasters involving Steve's friend Bucky, the two camps get into a confrontation at an airport. This is one of THE best fight sequences ever, as we get to see all of the Avengers (plus two new faces, Black Panther and Spiderman) use their various and unique skills against each other.The psychological aspects, betrayal, friendship and revenge and lessons on morality make this a unique film - and with each Avenger given enough screen time.This is a blockbuster you do not want to miss!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film provides the breath of fresh air I needed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Captain America: The Winter Solider pitted the titular protagonist against an organisation bigger then himself, all whilst battling his own demons, particularly his best friend-turned assassin, Bucky. Civil War at its core follows this narrative, exploring the relationship between these two characters even further. After numerous, wide-scaled and deadly incidents, the US Government, and now Secretary of State, 'Thunderbolt' Ross introduces the Sokovia Accord-which aims to prevent the heroes from acing freely but rather work in accordance to rules and regulations of the Untied Nations. In this regard, Civil War retains the political driven narrative and themes of The Winter Solider, but makes it more personal. The characters have different viewpoints and conflicting ideologies, causing them to split apart and form their own sides. Tony Stark for example feels guilty after a confrontation with a mother leads to him realising the cost of his actions; helping him realise that he shouldn't be allowed to act on his free will. Steve Rodgers believes "that the safest hands are still our own" and refuses to sign his name and adhere to the Sokovia Accords. The film perfectly sets up their conflicting beliefs, providing depth to the reasons they fight. We know these characters and their relationships with one another, both of which combine to make an interesting plot.Now I have to address about one big talking point, the introduction of a new (yes a third!) Spiderman. And boy was it an introduction and a half! 19 year old Tom Holland perfectly portrays the characteristics of Spiderman we love; he is witty, inexperienced and most importantly, young. He is a breath of fresh air to this older team but also the character itself. The Amazing Spiderman trilogy nailed the chemistry between Peter and Gwen, but there was nothing special about those films that really stood out to me. I'm not going to lie, I was a bit hesitant at the casting of a younger Spiderman as well as the recent announcement of the title of the official film, 'Spiderman Homecoming', but seeing the way he was presented just got me so damn excited. There is no origin story for the character, but that's partly because its safe to assume that at this point, almost everyone knows his tragic upbringing and the way he gained his powers. He is a character who is fascinated by characters like Tony Stark and idealises him, we, the audience share his excitement. He seems identifiable, something Spiderman needs to be.Chadwick Boseman's Black Panther is a straight-faced hero but a pure bad-ass. I really enjoyed his cat-like agility and ninja-esque fighting style. His agenda was clear too and he is a likable character, but more character development is needed, especially in terms of establishing the vastly different country, known as Wakanda, he comes from.One issue I did have was the pacing. Now the film certainly makes the most of its two hours and seventeen minute run-time but I personally found the opening quarter to slow. Yes, it is broken up by sudden bursts of action, but for the most part it just felt too slow. I do have to stress that this was a personal opinion however. Daniel Brühl's antagonist, Zemo, is nothing spectacular, but fits in with the theme of responsibility and vengeance. Civil War does a good job of blurring the line between good and bad, right and wrong. You can argue that Steve Rodgers is wrong, but that Tony Stark is right and vice versa-but one thing is abundantly clear, this film did not necessarily need Zeemo in any way. I did enjoy the choice of locales, particularly with Germany featuring heavily, although perhaps slightly excessive and repetitively. The action was massive in scale and most definitely well choreographed. Speaking of which, the 15-minute IMAX fight was brilliant. It looked extremely cheesy as the two opposing sides sprinted (or flew) to each other in the trailer, but boy do the characters get their chance to shine. It just works, with the fight (the only exceptions being Hawkeye and Black Widow) being balanced. Spiderman just makes the scene however. This was hands down the best thing about the film for me.Now I absolutely loved Batman V Superman (I am sorry for bringing this film up, but it is an important point!), but one thing lacking in the film was the depth to establish the characters agendas. In Civil War, we (speaking in terms of the general audience) understand why they are fighting each other and it makes sense. Sure, it does feel slightly rushed and forced, but the Russo Brothers have used this idea effectively. This was a vital strong and one reason why I felt this film was good. I think another special aspect of this film was that, despite my initial worries, it's not an Avengers film. Yes it features these beloved characters, but it is a story about two friends in the face of adversary, caught up in a world they don't belong in, but have inadvertently become so deeply involved in.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was never a CA fan. I always thought Iron Man was so much better and was always fighting with my brother -he was addicted to CA. So when we found out CA 3 was CA v. IM we got really excited. We were speculating on who was gonna win and kick the other's ass. We had seen EVERY trailer, EVERY spoiler to this day yet none of that really spoiled the movie for us.Because it was un-freaking-believable, over the charts good. And, yeah, this is coming from someone who hates Cap America. It was well balanced, showcasing every hero's abilities giving them the time they needed on screen -no more, no less. The storyline kept going smoothly, having very small but clever cliffhangers between some scenes keeping us on the edge and I really have to congratulate the writers for that. Whoever says they did a crappy job with this movie they're just haters -don't listen to them.This movie is not an Avengers one. It's focused on CA and his struggle to do the right thing. You can't really hate him, or hate IM. They both had some points in their arguments. By the end of the movie, I felt sympathy and love for both of them -yeah, even CA. So the characters were not ruined as individuals at all. I really like their relationship, their chemistry and their friendship -which, by the end, I realized was quite deep.As for the debuts... BLACK PANTHER SLAYS!! He was skilled and strong and such a badass. I loved him and I'm so excited for his solo movie. SPIDER-MAN literally stole the show. We all know Peter is funny and goofy but that actor did a really good job portraying the character. He was a badass as well, but with a funny hint to it. IM and SM actually made a pretty funny duo. I'm so excited RDJ is set to play in the SM movie. And... CROSSBONES. Well, don't expect much from that douchebag. He's not much of a threat -he gets killed in the first 10' (oops! spoiler alert!).CAPTAIN America and his hero hair were working overtime to save the world while trying to save his best friend. IRON MAN was trying to reason with CA and get Bucky in prison while using some new awesome tech that had our jaws dropping (not just the glove). BLACK WIDOW was kicking a lot of asses and ANT MAN was surprisingly awesome (I didn't really liked his solo movie) and hilarious as expected. ALL THE OTHERS were awesome as well as their evolving powers.To sum up, it's a MUST WATCH. It was the BEST one in the Avengers/CA franchise. I can't wait for Infinity War 'cause it sets up a new world for the MCU.GO. SEE. THE DAMN MOVIE. NOWWWW!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The front-gate of marvel cinematic universe. Marvel gives an intense depiction how superheroes movie could be.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By far, this is the widest, deepest, most-detailed, and best- choreographed of marvel movies. In this movie, marvel distinctly send message that superhero genre is not on the fringe of degradation. It erase all the cynical and doubts feeling from people. Of course if we seek for the realism action, there are no such thing in superhero genre. In my opinion, a superhero genre needs to be rated in different perspective than a normal action film. Thats also happens for CGI. Still, civil war (which solely captain America franchise, not avengers or bigger context) is complete as a film. It consist of well-directed storytelling, good character performance (especially Downey), good jokes, and very good choreography (especially airport scene). Russo brothers did well to made choreography for captain America winter soldier and he did it again in civil war. This director develops in a nice way.Civil war got some good rating from metacritic. Its not a surprise, because to be honest this movie is good in such way even as superhero genre. Definitely, its not overrated or underrated, it is correctly rated. There are some strong-point that makes civil war is one kind of movie that given so many applause by audience at the end. First, i highlights the team work choreography. Even with so many character casted, there are no wasted superhero. Everybody takes their part precisely with an accurate duration given by the director. Each superhero contains their unique characterization so the character development is greatly well-done. Some funny, some charismatic, and some cool. One thing that prove this statement is at the airport fight. Intense, tough, and hilarious. The superhero combination was marvelous. The fights full of surprise and good choreography, everybody express their unique.The second was its balance. Russo successfully add good portion of jokes, intrigues, and their character development duration. Superhero genre also can be something that beautifully made if brewed by a right formula. Imagine if there are no spiderman, maybe there are no jokes or cool moments right. Russos brave enough to add spiderman and black panther even without their solo movie before and it gives a huge impact to the film itself. Yes, this movie keeps making surprise to audience as the duration goes on. This also one of the strong point of civil war.Third, civil war carried so much by the charisma of Robert Downey JR. We should give credit to this talented actor. To play the role as a superhero is not easy, because you need to be balanced between physical, imagination, and acting skill. You need to be agile in fighting scene, have a good body, and deliver good acting. Yet, you need great portion of imagination because superhero basically using CGI shots, so you need to imagine how the final editing could be from raw green screen shots. Thats why we never met such a good characterization of superhero before. But today, i found one person that truly pass it, yes the iron man by Downey. His acting skill always evolving since his three iron man movies. In civil war, Downeys performance was on the apex level. He successfully mastering the character of tony stark the iron man with rich-man gesture, intellectual person, and funny. The expression and charisma he had is so striking.Objectively, i can say Civil War was marvels best. This is how superhero genre movie could and should be. Maximizing their characters with a balance of storytelling and amazing superheroes teamwork choreography. Even a little bit too dragging, I truly recommend this movie.</fullReview>

However I'm seeing a ton of 9 and 10 star ratings for no reason and all I can say is if you honestly think this movie is that good you must have very low standards so in an attempt to try and balance things out I'm rating this a 1/10. Seriously, you people need to settle down with your superhero films, this is why the Dark Knight is at 9 when it should be at 8. If we keep going like this IMDb will soon stop being a viable source for contemporary film reviews. I mean 8.4? That's as high as A Clockwork Orange, Reservoir Dogs, and Requiem for a Dream, and those films are way better made and memorable than this popcorn movie. Grow up people.</fullReview>

It turns out I was entirely wrong about this franchise... I love it.

After seeing this I definitely will. To anyone else who thinks marvel is overrated, trust me, give this a shot. You will not be disappointed.

		<fullReview>Civil War is another great Marvel's movie. The way they make the combat between Captain America and Iron Man is like Batman vs. Superman, but it is not bad. Actually, this movie has so many fight scenes among superheroes that you don't care about the story.You may notice that Iron Man is not only 100% jokes at the movie and sometimes he is really angry. It is a good thing, because I usually like the humor in Marvel films, but sometimes they overcome a bit, and everyone knows Civil War is a movie that can be treated with more suspense.There is no doubt about that Spider Man was the most awaited character and yes, he is the best in the movie. Just a kid in the middle of grown people and he has to fight with them. A great surprise in the screens and he is present in almost half of the movie.As I said, the combat among superheroes is the best part of the movie. I am sure you have already thought in fights which involves superheroes vs. superheroes. In this movie, you watch great battles and you don't get tired of it because it is awesome to watch.I think it is not necessary to compare Civil War and Batman vs. Superman. They are different movies and you can undisturbedly enjoy both of them.Well, I highlighted the good parts of the movie and in general I liked it.To sum up, in my point of view, the story is not one of the best, but the fights exceed the story and transform the movie in a great job.I am anxious to watch next movies... Thank you guys to read my review and I hope you enjoy the movie.Bye, everybody. See you later!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Is Literally One Of The Best Action/Adventure Movie Ever Made! 10/10 Perfection.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The main theme centers on Cap's internal struggles and Cap's relationships with everyone from previous film. This is indeed a Captain America film and NOT Avengers 2.5. Everyone from Sam Wilson the Falcon to Bucky Barnes to Tony Stark plays a huge role but it's all in relation to Cap being the main focus. Even interaction with Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow and Clint Barton/Hawkeye are important. Previous films are paid off nicely and it's why even smaller roles are pivotal. This movie stands on its own, but it certainly respects its roots of everything that has made the MCU great. It not only respects it but it quite literally pays off a lot of it but in a natural and even a surprising way. It's not necessary to have sen previous films but it certainly adds to the remarkable depth and the impact of this movie.The film is really grounded in a believable world that supports the political thriller and psychological thriller aspect, and it's helped by the caliber of the cast involved.A core theme surrounding Cap is the idea that he once used to represent America and has now become alien to modern thoughts and values due to the passage of time and the events of the Winter Soldier movie. Seeing this level of emotional stakes of this hero's journey is rare and incredibly captivating.All the fighting is very visceral and believable. Early on it's amazing and when it comes to hero vs hero, it becomes even more so. This is no "scrimmage" or fake fight. The stakes are VERY real and very intense.This movie puts Cap through a lot and the audience is right there feeling everything with him. It's an incredible ride and one of the best movies that I have ever seen. Not just superhero films but movies in general. It really is that good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Superhero movies became even dumber and more shallow than their comic book counterparts. This one is so stupid and naive that it should be labeled 'not for audience older than 7 years and with IQ higher than that of an average eggplant'. An exercise in political correctness, the script is written by a brain dead monkeys and directed by a dorky teenagers trapped in the bodies of grown men. To call the acting 'wooden' is an overestimate. Big budget has went into paying shills to write positive reviews and pump the film's score on this and every other major movie site alike. The honest score would be less than one. Hell, a minus (-) should be implemented for titles as disgraceful as this one. I'm deeply ashamed for ever laying my eyes on this humongous waste of time and money. If you have enjoyed this garbage then you're certified imbecile. If your kid has enjoyed it the poor little bastard is probably retarded of suffering some kind of serious brain injury. If you have paid to watch this, you should be legally forbidden to reproduce.</fullReview>

And i was super hyped to see how Black panther was gonna fit in, it was just more than expected. My Favorite Superhero is Batman, but this movie just beats everything I've seen in last 2-3 Years. If you go by having less expectations than BVS, You're gonna Enjoy every single second of this movie, coz from my past 2-3 years of movie experience, which was always less than what i was expecting. I mean just go and watch it god-damn, this is by far the best movie marvel has made i don't know what DC fans might say,(BTW I'm also a DC fan (BATMAN FAN) ) but whatever.

After boring us with scenes of saving people by loading them into shield helicarrier in Age of Ultron,they are still blaming the heroes?Wouldn't it have made sense blaming Tony Stark for creating Ultron?The plot holes in this movie is big enough to sink the titanic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Since it is increasingly important in these reviews to appeal to all readers, and not offend anyone, I am offering two reviews. Simply pick the one you like.1. Great Production Values, Two and a Half Hours of Action, Whats Not to Like? This, the shorter review, simply states the obvious. Marvel is getting progressively better at delivering action and most people today go to these films for the action, so this is win-win. Yeah. Everyone smile and wait for the next Marvel release. Have your wallets ready.2. As Marvel increasingly monopolizes the Superhero space, the themes get darker and darker.The early 1920s believe it or not were a lot like today. Everyone sensed a growing unease in the collective gestalt, so they compensated by more partying, less critical thinking, and going to more movies. Interestingly, movies both before and after the Great Depression offered pure escapist entertainment. You went to the movies to get anything BUT reality.A century later, that paradigm has shifted. Ever since the "graphic novels" started to tackle serious adult themes, there seems to be a race among superhero writers to see who can put his (her) hero through the most angst, and drag the audience along for the ride.I am not sure this is a good thing but I seem to be in the minority. I have seen a Spiderman movie where Spidey's main squeeze was killed because Spidey was a few seconds late. I have seen Superman movies where the main goal seems to be to discover how many buildings you can smash with Superman's head. And now, picking up on the same thread, I am seeing Avenger movies where governments -- these would be the same governments spying on your emails and trying to ban cash -- are trying to tell the "enhanced" humans what to do and not do.Now, the suits at the studio would argue this must be what the audience wants because they are making money. This reviewer would argue that when you have a monopoly on a product line that people want, they will see it regardless. Only one of us is right.In my view, the best superhero films are the ones that are the most humanistic. Superman comes out of a coma to be with the child he did not know he had. Iron Man rewards a boy who helped him when no one else would. Hulk drops out of an airplane not knowing if he will change or not, but he has to stop the bad guy and protect Betty.My attitude is, if I want adult themes that badly I don't need to go the theatre, I can simply try to renew my license or wait in a hospital emergency room. I "get" this is how they are making superhero films these days. I suggest that in a year or two someone will rediscover the older, more sentimental, story lines, the audience will love it, and people of the future will look back at the films of today and wonder, what were they smoking?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Winter Soldier has competition.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Winter Soldier has competition for being the best Marvel movie. There's no other way to say it: Civil War is phenomenal. Marvel continues the trend of upping the stakes by pinning our favorite heroes against each other: Captain America and Iron Man. There are a lot of other characters, so much so that it feels more like an Avengers movie than a solo movie, but the story is told in such a way that the spotlight is always on Cap and Bucky.Civil War is tonally different from Winter Soldier in that it's more bombastic in its storytelling. Again, there are a lot of Avengers in the movie (more than the freaking Avengers movie). While Winter Soldier was a relatively grounded, dark political thriller, Civil War is a louder, more colorful take on the political theme, and a much more personal one as well. This time it's a matter of morals and ethics, and it's amazing how the movie pulls off giving each side of the argument weight and credibility so you could argue about who's right and who's wrong all day. Steve wants to protect his best friend Bucky who was brainwashed by Hydra and is now a fugitive from the law. He doesn't trust any form of government faction. He saw how far up corruption goes and he's not willing to lose jurisdiction of the Avengers to yet another corrupt governmental body. Tony wants everyone to sign an agreement for the UN so they won't be seen as a threat by the world governments due to their track record of leaving behind messes and casualties. It's a terrific plot, very thrilling and character driven. At its core it's a very personal story between Steve and Tony. The other characters are written as complimentary pieces to one puzzle. It's not gratuitous at all. You understand everyone's ideologies - why they disagree with each other, why they're on the sides that they're on, why they're fighting for what they're fighting for - and they're each given enough screen time for us to care. And the action scenes are TWS level. Nothing quite beats the first confrontation between CA and WS, but the end of the second act of this movie has an action sequence that is absolutely mesmerizing. It's the civil war. Seeing all of these superheros go against each other is exhilarating, and their interactions are hysterical, especially since a lot of them are meeting each other for the first time.The new characters are excellent - Black Panther makes a hell of an impression as a sophisticated Wakandan diplomat, and Spider-Man is easily the best live action interpretation of the character; major props to Tom Holland for sounding exactly how you'd expect Spider-Man to sound like. It's an absolute joy to watch. One aspect of Civil War I find especially fascinating is the use of its villain, Zemo. You have no idea what he's plotting for a good chunk of the movie. He shows up intermittently as the first couple of acts are playing out doing cryptic stuff vaguely involving Hydra, and finally the third act converges on Zemo and why he's doing what he's doing, and it's about the simplest thing: vengeance. It's incredible to watch this ordinary man - no powers or abilities - just a smart, patient man, have a conceivable shot at destroying the Avengers. And the actor is excellent too. It's a nice change of pace from the invincible demigods and dull dark elves we've been getting in previous installments.Civil War is an expertly made film all around. The acting is top notch as always, the directing and the writing are masterful, I can go on and on. It's a political, personal, and powerfully conveyed story with tons of popcorn blockbuster appeal, rivaled only by The Winter Soldier in the MCU. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

The true answer is that you get high quality entertainment big bombastic explosions, epic fights and of course Mr.Badass Tony Stark alias Iron Man and that's the whole 148 Minutes. That's why the Movie is awesome.And here's why it's not my favorite Marvel movie. The very simple reason is that there are better ones (Avengers 1-2, Iron Man 1-2,the old Spider-Man movie so) and they are simply too good.But I'm exited about the next Captain America story.And I want more about this emotional marvel setting.

		<fullReview>'CAPTAIN America: CIVIL WAR': Five Stars (Out of Five)The third installment in Marvel Studios' 'CAPTAIN America' film franchise. The sequel also features many other superhero characters from the 'Marvel Cinematic Universe' (especially the 'AVENGERS' films), and the story deals with Captain America taking on Iron Man; in order to protect his friend Bucky Barnes. The movie stars Chris Evans (reprising the title role) and it costars Robert Downey Jr. (as Iron Man), Sebastian Stan (as Bucky, AKA The Winter Soldier), Anthony Mackie, Don Cheadle, Chadwick Boseman, Daniel Bruhl, Scarlett Johansson, Paul Bettany, Elizabeth Olsen, Jeremy Renner, Emily Van Camp, William Hurt, Paul Rudd, Tom Holland, Frank Grillo, Marisa Tomei and Martin Freeman. The film also introduces the classic comic book characters Spider-Man and Black Panther (Holland and Boseman), in their Marvel Cinematic Universe feature film debuts. Anthony and Joe Russo returned to direct the movie (they also helmed 'CAPTAIN America: WINTER SOLDIER') and Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely returned to write the script (they also wrote 'WINTER SOLDIER' and co-wrote 'THOR: THE DARK WORLD'). It's received rave reviews from critics and fans alike, and it's (of course) a huge hit at the Box Office. I loved it as well.Due to the large number of civilian deaths, as a result of The Avengers' battles with various super-villains (over the years), the United Nations wants to form an international governing body, to control the superheroes' actions. Captain America (Evans) is against it, since he thinks they have better judgment than corrupt government officials, whereas Iron Man (Downey Jr.) supports the supervision (due to guilt over creating Ultron, and other tragedies he's responsible for). Other Avengers divide in the conflict, forming two different factions. At the same time Bucky Barnes (Stan) is framed for a bombing in Vienna (which kills a Wakanda King). Captain America wants to protect his friend, while government officials want to kill him. A civil war between the superheroes erupts. This film gets everything right that 'BATMAN V SUPERMAN' did (one of my other favorite movies this year); it's very dark, dramatic and full of rich character development (all things 'AVENGERS: AGE OF ULTRON' got wrong). The plot is involving and the action actually serves the story; rather than vice versa! The action scenes are also really cleverly done, and exciting; something increasingly hard to pull off, in modern blockbusters. Downey Jr. actually gives a really good performance again (and he doesn't deliver any horrible jokes, for a change). It's also interesting to see his character as the antagonist; I know he was more of a villain in the comic book, but I think it was smarter for the filmmakers to make the drama (in the film) more nuanced. The movie's politics are also timely and complex. It's just a grade A film all around; I think it's my second favorite Marvel Studios film (after 'GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY'). It's one flaw is that they got Spider- Man wrong though; they made some major changes to the source material, that any fan should be mad about. I think his character is the worst of the three movie adaptations (and he deserves his own freaking movie to debut in, he's not second banana to 'THE AVENGERS')! Overall the film is fantastic though.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nuGIEoCGrtw</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Captain America: Civil War (2016): Dir: Anthony Russo, Joe Russo / Cast: Chris Evans, Robert Downey Jr, Scarlett Johansson, Sebastian Stan, Chadwick Boseman: What happens when evil penetrates so effectively that good fight against good? That is the centrepiece of this action superhero film when an assortment of superheros are pitted against each other in a clash battle with one person pulling the strings. The Avengers are in trouble when an opening mission results in massive casualties and authorities want to put a leash on them. Chris Evans once again plays Steve Rogers who is Captain America and his dilemma involves his friend Bucky Barnes, the Winter Soldier that places him at odds with members of the Avengers. Robert Downey Jr is again the sarcasm leadership of Tony Stark who is Iron Man who may have to engage in a conflict that he prefers to avoid. Scarlett Johansson is fetching as Black Widow who is caught within the conflict that threatens to tear the Avengers apart. Sebastian Stan as Barnes is targeted with some mind warp that controls him and has him committing crimes. Rogers knows that he is being controlled but that doesn't prevent Barnes from being targeted by the Avengers. Chadwick Boseman makes a great impression as Black Panther who is out to avenge the death of his father and sees Barnes as the guilty. Directors Anthony and Joe Russo not only create the best Captain America film but also a visually explosive masterpiece that presents a theme of the consequences when corruption corrodes character causing good virtue to become poisoned.

		<shortDescription>Too good not to write a review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a comic book fan, reading Civil War was awesome. I am not a purist, I don't believe that they should be exactly like they are in the comic books. That being said, Civil War the comic had a great deal of characters and story. I was worried on how they can could do the movie with losing the great story telling of the actual civil war. While the movie was not really like the comic book story, they still managed to make a great Civil War Movie. And they kept the strong points, action and some of the main characters like Spider- man, Iron man and Captain America all in good form. The action was excellent, copying that same gritty, back and forth special forces fighting that they managed to bring to life in Winter Soldier. Team up scenes, unexpected powers and just coolness of their abilities soared throughout the screen with so many different awe factors. The story it self is believable, they make it a pretty decent reason why one hero would choose this side and the other would choose the other. And other characters that would be in turmoil no matter what they chose. To me when a movie is 3 hours and it seems like 30 minutes, you have a good flick. There was so much to like about it. The humor, was well timed and just flat out great. I heard a lot of people saying Black Panter and Spiderman where awesome, but Paul Rudd as Ant Man was amazing too. So do yourself a favor and treat yourself to an Epic movie that actually lives up to the Hype. Its hard not to like this movie and I'm sure some will, but to me I was in my element and so excited at the end of it all. Enjoy.</fullReview>

You will know why after watching the movie. Story was good. Humor was great. The "Main Villain" was great too(many might disagree). Even the end credit scene was great!

		<shortDescription>The best film in the MCU</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Way back when this film was announced in 2014 I was both exited an worried. Worried that the film would be one sided and that Iron Man would be painted as a villain. Well that worry was ill founded. Captain America Civil War is the BEST movie in the MCU. Anthony Mackie said the acting in this film is on point, and it truly is. All the actors pull off amazing performances. Although everyone was amazing RDJ killed it again as Iron Man amazing performance. Now Tom Holland as Spiderman, sorry for the cheesy pun but he was AMAZING. I was grinning ear to ear every moment he was on screen, he truly is the best Spiderman. And Black Panther as well brilliant, amazing performance from Chadwick Boseman. The action is brilliant! The airport scene was the best scene amazing action. Spiderman was running his mouth through the entire fight typical Spidey. The story was brilliant as well. Both Iron Man and Cap are given good justifications as to why they are fighting. Now the movie isn't without it's problems (but what movie is?) Baron Zemo. I really didn't like this, Marvel villains are typically weak characters but this Zemo is a sympathetic villain. Zemo should be true evil for the sake of it not out of sympathy. Another thing is that nobody dies! In all of the Marvel movies characters rarely die and you don't really feel the stakes were high. Here they should have been higher than ever and this should have been shown by somebody biting the dust. I would of liked to see more Spiderman but I realise they got the wall crawler late in the game. I was worried about the ending but it was done very well. If your'3 worried about this being too bias for Cap as I was don't be, despite the name this is really an Avengers film and is truly the best film in the MCU. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK to start I loved the beginning some people thought the beginning sucked but I loved it! The action was insane but little did I know better was coming. I saw it with my friend and he said after the action scene it was a little boring, lucky that I thought it was the opposite they intruduced characters really well and let the story flow building up the tension for the sides to be spilt Hawkeye had a great entrance against vision and the directors did it well with scarlet witch her character is one of the most interesting, she is very scared of whether powers can do. At the start of the film I was team cap I am still that team. Next for one of the best action secuances ever! The airport scene intruduced Spider-Man and he rocked it black panther also did very well I think they are some of the best characters. Antman was also amazing at the airport battle scene he turned into giant man. I did not see that coming! But to handle all these characters on screen is amazing the action was over the top and the final battle was all about iron man's parents he wanted revenge. But it ended out with both of them going at each other's necks and finally captain America won but it really dosn't set things up for another film? Maybe I just didn't spot it but the end credit scenes set up for 2 films. Overall AMAZING film</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Honestly, I am a fan of the MCU. With the exception of Iron Man 2, I have liked all the movies. Thor 2 and Iron Man 3 had good emotional/character beats respectively, but they both had missteps. Also, Age of Ultron could have been better. I am also a huge fan of Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy, and I like Man of Steel quite a bit. Honestly, I felt like BvS had some faults, but it was enjoyable.I say these things to establish myself as an impartial judge. I wasn't going to write a review for this movie until I looked at the reviews. Everyone who has written a negative review for Civil War has either: 1. Mentioned that BvS was a superior movie, which it wasn't. I'm sorry, I wanted it to be better too. or2. Misspelled every other word or had no idea how to form a coherent sentence. Which leads me to believe that people are either downvoting Civil War because they love DC or because they're plain stupid and can't follow the plot. Look, if you want to leave a review for BvS, do it on the BvS page. This movie was awesome. I didn't even need Zemo to have his "my family died" motivation, he was an excellent, convincing villain. He could have just hated the avengers for all the damage they caused and wanted them disbanded. Chadwick Boseman was incredible. INCREDIBLE. Totally awesome. I loved Giant-Man's debut and the entire airport fight scene, it was fun and light-hearted in a way that Age of Ultron attempted but overshot, making AOU a little bit cringeworthy at times (who cracks a joke with their dying breath?) The scene added a needed break from the gravity of the rest of the movie, granting it the balance that both AOU and BvS overshot in their respective directions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than Age of Ultron, But Not What I Was Expecting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a year with quite a few Superhero movies coming out, I'm surprised to see that this movie gets all the love. I went in the movie theater expecting so much, and came out feeling disappointed. Although I do believe this movie is better than Age of Ultron (that one was pretty terrible), Captain America: Civil War was not much better. I'm starting to feel that Marvel can't do anything different. These movies don't take risks (like the comics actually do), and they still don't have a great villain in this film. Marvel in general just has terrible villains, and Zemo in this film was no exception. There was nothing villainous about him, and he was just so bland. The fight scenes were okay, but not as epic as they could've been. This movie was so hyped, and all I heard was that it was so amazing, and that it is the best comic book movie ever, but after seeing the film I know that isn't true. Marvel movies are starting to get stale, and uninteresting. Also, why isn't this called Avengers: Civil War? There is no way this movie can be a Captain America movie. It seems like the people at Marvel are just trying to sell Captain America, because I cannot see how they could even call this Captain America: Civil War. At least Spiderman was cool, but he had a very tiny part, smaller than I expected. He was one of the main guys in the comics, but not in this film. But as we all know, Marvel doesn't stay true to the source material, and in this movie's case, that is very true. This didn't even have the same storyline as the comics!Overall, this movie was just okay. I found that it had slow pacing, which made it kind of boring, and had characters making illogical decisions (especially from Zemo). To me, this is definitely not the best superhero movie ever, or even of the year. I hope that the MCU can release films that actually have more substance, and with better villains. I don't know how much longer I can take the Marvel formula. Their next movie has got to be different, otherwise I may not ever go see their films again.</fullReview>

Loud noises (crashes and explosions) and the destruction of cars, doors and buildings.Luke Evans had center stage and he has zero 'magnetism'. Did not make a good case for his side of the debate. Downing looked tired. The Bucky character was okay.Plot was paper thin. It is logical that the human world would want to rein in the superheroes after they conduct epic battles in population centers. But, the humanism is overridden by the violence and the negative motivations.My conclusion is that this movie was made solely for teens. For adult fare, look elsewhere.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extremely Overrated Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start by saying that this movie is extremely overrated. It is funny how they got scared after Marvel Fanboys steamrolled Man of Steel for killing all those people, and in this movie, they had to make stupid comments and messages to each other that the location is empty/being evacuated before the fight takes place.Also, basically Bucky can murder every person on the planet but Captain America (with his sky high moral values), thinks it is OK, because it is Bucky. It is to a point where it gets ridiculous how funny their bromance is. Captain is OK to fight with everyone for Bucky despite his mass genocide.Spiderman was OK, but his constant talking was annoying (specially since he wasn't saying much at home and all of a sudden, during a fight, he wants to say everything). What I don't understand is how these characters are talking/making cheesy jokes, while fighting for their lives.And finally, after all the fiasco of a movie, not a single Avenger died! Not one! If you look at the amount of fighting this movie had, someone should've died.Overall, the movie sucked. I slept twice in the theatre and didn't feel like I was missing much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A real compromise between ......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't think I am going to talk about a compromise between the Iron Man and Captain America. But the compromise by each of the viewers of this movie to its director, camera man and script writer, for testing the patience with their not at all promising job.Script.. New style scripting makes sure that, 90% of the viewers will never understand what's going on the screen. Direction... I don't think the director has taken this movie seriously with some proper home work, except a few graphic works here and there and dragging scenes. Camera Man - Its pretty clear in the scenes that, the camera man was over excited about the action scenes, or he him self was cutting vegetables keeping camera in one hand. Camera movement was faster than the speed at which the cars in the scenes move around... viewers needs to strain the eyes to understand what is going on.. Poor camera handling at all.After all, those who want to loose money in big screen and those who wants to sleep in theater, its a nice choice.I am wondering, how come this movie has a big rating of 8.5 in IMDb? Bogus !!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We are so used to Marvel churning out a blockbluster in each of the many universes under its realm on a yearly basis that somehow we flock to watch them even when previous films in the series were not exactly inspiring. Such was the case with this movie. As visual entertainment went, it was mediocre among its genre. Marvel fans, however, would be disappointed as the crux that led to the divergence of the Avengers ? the Superhuman Registration Act ? did not even appear in the entire movie. The building-up of the tension was flimsy; Captain America's tie and loyalty to Bucky was unexplained, the reasons for recruits joining Cap's team were unclear (why would Hawkeye give up his domestic bliss to fight as an outlaw? How did they get Ant-man to join their cause?) and it appeared as if the whole point was to have two resultant teams with balanced numbers. Vision seemed somewhat weak ? yes fans would know his attraction to the Scarlet Witch later ? but wasn't it a little early to have him reduced to total putty whenever Wanda was involved? Black Widow did not appear to be the kind who would submit to supervision, and instead of outlining her inner struggle which ended up in her letting Cap and Bucky board the plane, now it was as Iron Man described ? she acted like a "double spy" with no reason whatsoever. Some of the comic reliefs we liked ? Cap flexing his biceps and using the helicopter as his personal gym trainer, Bucky and the Falcon gawking like a couple of schoolboys as Cap kissed his old flame's niece (anyone besides me feeling creepy here?), the verbal diarrohea of the teenage Spider-Man, etc. And after all that ado, we ended up with Avengers team A and team B ? one to conduct UN-sanctioned missions and the other to have a free rein while keeping contact with each other? Would anyone remind me why we went through all that two and a half hours for?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is astoundingly terrible. The first 45 minutes of the film feel like bad long exposition and yet nothing really happens, a mutant appears in some random scene and they are recruited by either Apocalypse or the X-Men. The writing is all over the place and we don't get to know the characters, they're simply put there.Because Bryan Singer is in love wit Stryker of course we get to see the Weapon X program (again!) and of course, Wolverine because why not.As for the characters: Buck barely does anything in the whole movie, Baron Zemo is yet again another one note MCU villain, Iron Man phoned it in with his cheesy jokes and ScarJo was NOT Black widow at all, as expected she played HERSELF.Finally, the big battle comes and nothing really happened, the world is being destroyed and the governments sit quiet.Like where the heck is Nick Fury and Maria hill? Tired of mcu movies LOLOLSPOILER ALERT!At the end they all kiss and make up and it's hardly a Civil War. True comic fans will hate this as it does not follow it's source material just like Fant4stic.This movie has NO SOUL whatsoever, boring, badly acted, awful written, the worst movie of the year so far. PS Disney should sell this to FOX so we can get a REAL COMIC book movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Marvel wants its cake and eat it too. So they not only NOT kill off extra needless characters they actually introduce new ones. For one purpose, the rope in another demographic. C'mon...Black Panther? He has the same skill as Black Widow, except he's really black. And a prince/king and a martyr for angry militant African country. Hey, knuckleheads, it originated in Oakland, California. Oh right, semantics. Wow are audiences dumb. Oh it's not THAT Black Panther movement, but they act militant like THAT Black Panther movement. Puke.Also the relationship between Bucky and Captain America...really? Most of us wouldn't help our friends move. This yontz protects him AFTER he finds out parents (not telling who) are murdered. Is there a grey area? Not really. Cap. Am. is supposedly a man of high moral character who values the justice system over friendship. Right.This movie is proof society is lowering its standards of common sense. Not that I hate this film. It's fun whenever Rudd as Ant-Man gets involved. And the new Spiderman gives me hope. Marisa Tomei as Aunt May...gimme a break. There are no stakes in this movie. It's the worst part of Marvel stuff. It's for kids. If you approach as such, enjoy!Well, gotta try EVERYTHING.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seriously rating 8.3? This is meant to be one of the best movies of all times? I was really bored to death! Endless fighting scenes with nothing that we haven't already seen a zillion times: PIM-PUM-PAM superhero falls but then stands up and fights back PIM-PUM-PAM and the other superhero falls down. There are no fresh ideas, not even the slight effort to show something a minimum original or new. The plot is all but credible, full of ridiculous dialogues and impossible to believe behaviors. And when you don't have ideas you have to fill the void with a lot of superheroes - so many that you will lose yourself and ask why FART-MAN didn't turn up for a go! From a technical point the fighting scenes are also of very poor quality - it looks like many frames are missing from the shooting and these scenes do not come out smooth and are quite disturbing for the eye (looks like a 1970's camera was used).</fullReview>

Even though it is named as captain America, it is a sequel to ultron, and director has possibly thought by the inclusion of all super heroes, the film would be a success, then guess he should be thinking again.. This movie is all about vengeance, don't wanna put any spoilers of course, and lastly they spoke about friendship, which means the climax should have been unnecessary if they really took friendship into consideration. Vengeance, glamorous fights, super heroes, without any story is what i will say.. Best part is spider-man's comedy, and apart from that, this movie is totally a waste of time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Captain America V Iron Man: it's extremely well realized and proves to be entertainment at it's best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Captain America Civil WarMarvel knows how to please audiences and after seeing how Warner Bros. largely failed to please the general public with Batman and Superman's first big-screen debut together, audiences are going to question if with Civil War, (which is essentially "Captain America v Iron Man") will it really be worth investing time and money into another hero-on-hero mega-budget superhero flick. Well, this is Marvel's answer to DC's failed attempt, and they know these characters, we've seen most of them around in a few movies now over the past 8 years or so, (some of them more recent and some of them for the first time in this film's cinematic universe). And I truly believe the film is a triumph. Unlike the last Avengers film, there are not really any subplots that don't serve as an important piece to the overall story, directors Joe and Anthony Russo did a great job weaving action scene and character-driven scene together to drive the story forward in 2014's Captain America the Winter Soldier, and they do the same here. What makes this even more impressive is that they are handling roughly twice the amount of characters than what Winter Soldier had, but they do it as near-perfect as you could expect from a big-budget, studio-produced blockbuster these days. Though it had it's strong aspects, Star Wars the Force Awakens was a big money maker for Disney, but as a film, it left much to be desired. This film surprised and impressed me, more than any big budget film in the past 12 months save for Mad Max. It was better than Ant-man. Better than Age of Ultron. It was better than Furious 7, Jurassic World, Force Awakens, Batman v Superman and even Jungle Book which I also was impressed with. The film doesn't take any huge risks and does play it fairly safe to being what we've come to expect from Marvel, but it knows what the formula for success at Marvel is and it works with it. It knows how to still be impressive and wholly satisfying while still playing things fairly safe. Marvel, they takes risks with certain movies, and being that this is called "Civil War" which is based on a Marvel comic where major characters DO die, the movie doesn't quite follow that and is really more like a "Civil Dispute". And then there are moments where Tony is acting like he and Steve used to be friends even though earlier in the film he explains to Cap how his father always talked highly about him to Tony and that he just wanted to punch him in his perfect teeth. There are moments where this built-up rage shines through Downey Jr's performance as Stark, after he finds out a truth regarding his parents, that shows Robert actually put a lot of care into this character, more than we've ever seen from him since Iron Man 1. Lately it has felt like he's been phoning in his performances, but not here. Here he really acts the hell out of what the script asks of him, and counter's Chris Evans' strongest performance of Captain America to date, too. Lots of other big players here, Jeremy Renner, Scarlett Johansson, Paul Bettany, Elizabeth Olsen, Sebastian Stan, Paul Rudd, Anthony Mackie, and Daniel Bruhl gives a strong performance as a villain character who isn't given the most fleshing out or devotion to, but he serves the story well enough and it will be interesting to see if he gets any future roles down the line.If you're a fan of Spiderman, well the studio finally worked a deal out with Sony that allows them to use Spiderman in their shared cinematic universe and he is a very well introduced character played by young actor Tom Holland who probably does the best job as this character we have seen on screen yet, he fits in very well and plays off the other actors very well and proves to be quite a visual spectacle in the film's second act. He gets his own film next year and I look forward to seeing how it turns out, as this film introduced the character properly, and you could tell the directors had a full understanding of what makes this character so great. Overall, if you're looking for a superhero universe to stay committed to and always have faith in, I'd say just stick with Marvel because they know what they're doing and everything are building up to is unlikely to disappoint given the rate they are going now, but I guess we shall see you until then I would definitely recommend this film 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun but not recommended for smart movie watcher and comic geek</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm never wrote any review before, but I think I should make a clarification for this one.First of all I love the action, the casting, and of course Robert Downey Jr. Shows us how talented he is . But I think the biggest hole in this movie is the story. imagine you're passenger and you watch them fighting at the airport, they're over powered people, flying robots, public figures , and a giant, isn't it funny ? Will you see it as a serious incident or thinking that this is a high school theater ?, Fighting in a wide empty space when you're only about 6vs6 is so stupid, those silly people who likes this movie doesn't know anything about civil war comic. And so shame marvel doesn't kill capt just like in the comic. This is why I think civil war is such a kid movie because the story isn't deep and complicated enough. I think every marvel geek would be unsatisfied with this version of civil war, the civil war comic issue is so deep and have so many of character, it makes the civil war looks more "civil" war , not the "few of grown up people" war. But imagine if they had a secret identity and the government makes a rule where the superheroes have to take off their mask, isn't it more complicated because everyone has a family and none of us wanted if family get involved into our problem. The government and people in this movie also looks like stupid people, they think the superhero is the reason to all of the incident, then it means that they're not respecting a hero and would rather die because of the villain than getting their houses damaged . I wish marvel could make another great movie like the first avengers movie in the future. Thanks</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to be honest: I am in general no big fan of superhero movies, but there are some exceptions. This movie, however, was not such an exception.The movie seems to want to impress by pouring cans of superheroes at you and make them fight. Wow, I have never seen that before.There was some sort of story line, but the basic premise is that you can't trust the UN, because superheroes themselves know better what's good for the world. Oh, the arrogance!Because of the surplus of superheroes, I couldn't figure out which one(s) I was supposed to sympathize with. That they were all as thin as cardboard characters didn't help much either.Perhaps if you're a comic book fan this movie contains some references to "canon" material (?), but for the otherwise uninformed viewer, there is not much entertainment value in it.</fullReview>

I'm not saying they should like remove this movie completely just don't make it the first thing to show when your researching the Civil War.

		<shortDescription>Very overrated.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see Captain America: Civil War on Monday night and it was no where near what I was expecting. I was expecting the Bourne Ultimatum of Marvel/Captain America movies and got the Bourne Legacy of Marvel movies (both staring Jeremy Renner). However, I do have a tendency (especially with Marvel films) to watch a film for the first time and not care much for it and then watch it a second time and love it. The problems with this film come entirely from the story - everything else is great.Let's start with the opening scene (after the 1991 Winter Soldier scene) where Cap and Falcon and Black Widow and Scarlet Witch go up against Frank Grillo as Crossbones (who I thought was terribly underused) trying to steal a biological weapon. This scene was amazing!! The action was amazing and the way the team worked together was great. But then Scarlet Witch accidentally throws exploding Frank Grillo into a building and kills about 11 people and this serves as the motivation for the film. Umm what? A third rate villain dies and takes 11 or so faceless civilians with him and this serves as the motivation for the Avengers facing off against each other. That does not seem right to me. If the plot twist of Tony's parents being the victims of Bucky's mission at the beginning (my personal favourite scene of the film) came at the beginning and that was Tony's motivation for going against Cap's team and Daniel Bruhl's character was messing with Buck at the same time, then I could have ran with that.I also had a problem with the pacing of this film, for one thing it was much too long and was totally dragged out. After the first action sequence we had to wait what felt like ages for another one and when the king of Wakanda was killed (another great scene) and spawned Black Panther I thought we were going to get to see Black Widow face whoever was responsible for the bombing on her own and I was looking forward to it and then the scene ended and I was left hanging.Another problem I had with the film was that the whole story was about how the Avengers were killing innocent people whenever they did anything yet later in the film when they face off against each other at a seemingly empty airport there is absolutely no destruction or collateral damage! I am not saying we need Man Of Steel level collateral damage but a little bit would've been nice.Not only this, but Daniel Bruhl's character was very underdeveloped for someone who has such an impact on the course of the film - his motivation is barely explored at all and there was absolutely no need for his attempted suicide scene at the end and it was even more annoying to see him stopped by Black Panther for no reason. And now onto my biggest problem with this film: neither side wins!! WHY?! They obviously were not going to follow the comics and kill of Cap but a side winning instead of leaving us on a cliffhanger would have been nice.So overall, this film was too long, poorly paced, pointless and completely unemotional. But to be fair, when I watch it again when I buy the blu ray I will probably like it. But for now, this is how I stand.</fullReview>

They tried to introduce the themes and ideas at the start of the movie but just left it there and did not develop on them, reducing that effort into just a big fight scene between two groups of super-humans. The character Black Panther was not even introduced properly in the movie, he just suddenly appeared and fought the villain. Marvel could have done so much with the themes of responsibility and guilt and it had so much promise, but they just stuck to their usual bright lights and explosions that would keep kids entertained. I got bored halfway through the movie, sitting through the predictable story and all the explosions. I personally feel that this is worse than Age Of Ultron.</fullReview>

Never mind what the reviews say and what the journalists print, I've become more suspicious of "reviews" in this multi billion dollar industry. Especially after the negative reviews for the far superior Dawn of Justice over this "Civil War".I thought this was supposed to be a Captain America movie, not Iron Man 4 or an Avengers flick. There's too emphasis on trying to up the super hero count in this film to get paying customers into the cinema, oh look Spiderman's in it, lets go watch.Far too much comedy, we're dealing with super heroes here, which is serious sh*t, ha ha.....but unfortunately some people think a films great if it makes them laugh.So personally I still think the best Marvel films so far are, Thor, The Winter Soldier and Dead Pool (now this is sold as a comedy).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not nearly gay enough</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think the best way to start this review is by warning potential viewers not to be fooled by all the sexually charged promo pictures from this movie. Despite the obvious "will they, won't they" Tony and Steve have been engaging in over a few movies, this one doesn't finally take the further step. In fact, I would say the real love story is between Bucky and Steve, who share some really compelling shots during the movie, as the two friends/would-be lovers are reunited again. Sadly, this is all without resolution.I regret to say, that there isn't much in the way of plot either. CA3 tries to start up the so-called "civil war" using several different, completely disconnected threads, all of which feel quite pointless, and are hardly given enough discussion and thought process of the different people involved to really make you care about it. If you are expecting a thought provoking with philosophical ramifications Civil War storyline, I suggest you head to the comics.These two writers/directors received a lot of praise on their previous installment "The Winter Soldier" for their complex portrayal of women (most notably, Black Widow), including their importance on the plot. I'm afraid they will not receive such praise on this movie. Natasha was little more than a beautiful prop, given how she was completely pointless to the plot, and she's only allowed a few quips here and there, in addition to her fight scenes. Sharon Carter is there only to give a Plot Related Speech to push Steve to decide on which side he was going to be (Peggy Carter needed to be fridged for this purpose), and then share a very random kiss with him. Wanda was presented as a teenager kicking her shoes because she was "grounded". For some reason, with all the talk of Sekovia and its victims, she didn't think of mention that she lost her brother there too. Actually, the fact that she lost her twin brother only months before is not brought up at any point of the movie, and she's not even shown as being sad about it. It seems like a sort of "running joke" on media right now that women do not mourn their loved ones (I guess that's what the men who write them think "strong women" are?). Tony, on the other side, is given plenty of room for being devastated over the loss of a guy he never even met. This leads him to eff up for the? how many movies has he been in so far? Six? Well, for the sixth time.This movie was also highly expected for the introduction of two new characters. One of them turned out to be really compelling and promising. The actor somehow managed to make his character likable even at the point of the movie when he was being sort of annoying, and the brilliant turnaround he had at the end served to elevate him over most of his co-stars. As for the other one, I can't believe they will actually make a full length movie with him next year, which I will skip anyway. His introduction was also weird and felt forced. There was supposed to be humor, but it was only uncomfortable. It is worth pointing out that the supposed jokes in this movie failed 90% of the time, which at some point had you begging for them to just please stop.Arguably the best part of the movie was the fight scene at the airport (which plot wise was really pointless if you think about it), which did manage to display the abilities of all the characters involved in it and was delightful to watch. It does make you wonder, however, if the only part the writers were able to deliver was the fighting (which is practically a given if you think the amazing material they had to work with), maybe they should have given the job to someone with a more original vision and new ideas.We could say that among the mess that this movie turned out to be, some resolution to the obvious UST between Tony and Steve could have been a redeeming quality. Marvel however, still refuses to acknowledge that same-sex love exists, and will rather have Captain America share a very disturbing kiss with the niece of the 100 year old dead woman he was actually in love with. Which makes me consider, maybe this movie is not only not gay enough, it may be too heterosexual as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why did I go and see this film?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was torn between going to see this film and Angry Birds, I saw the IMDb + Rotten Tomatoes ratings and decided this might be an exception to the rule of terrible recent superhero films. Now I deeply regret my choice. No matter how bad Angry Birds was, it can't have been this bad...The action seemed oriented towards (and possibly directed by) 4 year olds mashing plastic dolls together. You never really feel that any of the characters are in any danger (with one exception later on), because they're all, well, superheroes, except that one guy with a bow and arrow, who might have been a superhero in the middle ages but seems hopelessly out of place in this futuristic battlefield.The portrayal of Africa was just stereotyped and ignorant, as expected, while the portrayal of America as selflessly struggling with the burden of protecting the rest of the world with the best possible intentions was contemptible. There were some fairly amusing parts, usually involving Captain America's biceps, but most of the jokes fell flat. There were a few attempts at emotional depth, which, for me at least, failed miserably. The action felt boring and repetitive, and lost its appeal within about 20 minutes of a 2 and a half hour film. The antagonist was completely underdeveloped; rather than the usual lack of backstory, this guy just suffered from having no particular skills that would allow him to stage a major plot against the omnipotent avengers. Now, I know I'm not the intended audience for this film (i.e over 10 years old, enjoy films with a bit of depth), but I enjoyed the (Bale) Batman trilogy and was maybe hoping that this film was in that kind of vein. Sadly, it wasn't. However, younger kids with a violent temperament, CGI fans and real Marvel obsessives might enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Downside: I wanted to leave the cinema after 1 hr to go study in the lobby (at 00:00) Upside: I've learnt a great deal from this movie and it hasn't even ended yet( since i am writing this from the theater and the film is still on, they're fighting-what a surprise). I've learnt that culture isn't always positive. American culture with all its heroes, all its need to save innocent lives is just a hypocrisy trying to mask the atrocities US has committed through history. At least I thought it is going to be enjoyable, you can never really hate every single part of the movie. I learnt the contrary too. Idiotic screen writing, I could guess what they were about to say. Not even the actors could save this piece of excrement. I tried to sleep through it at some point thinking the pain will go away. My boyfriend is a fan and though I could hear his unsatisfied, thirsty, clenched anger, he wanted to see what happens so I had to stay. The reason I couldn't sleep is the fact that my anger started kicking in more and more every time I heard someone talk. People actually laughed once for like 3 seconds at this very idiotic joke. Now i might have some anger issues but this movie made me go full animal. Also very long. I wish IMDb had the "attach photo" option so i could immortalize my face's disgusted look and share it with the world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's more of a Civil Battle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even though critics give it much higher ratings than "Batman vs Superman", it suffers from the same main failure - the source of the conflict is not well explored or explained. Sure, here it is done differently, with longer shots of people talking to each other. But, it doesn't work any better than a dozen times more shots of stuff happening in the same period of time as in Batman vs Superman.Also, there's not much war here, there's about one battle and a few fights. They're OK, but I do have a hard time getting excited about such things, it is all make-believe, so how can you say is it really any good? You can just say that there were some interesting new stuff - from Antman (let's just say that size _does_ matter) and Spiderman (who's fighting skills are, conveniently, based on "Star Wars" movies) and that there are no substantial inconsistencies.I liked "The Winter Soldier" better, because it had "its own thing". This feels more like an "Avengers on a slow day" (i.e. not trying to save the Earth) kind of thing. And, of course, "Winter Soldier" had Robert Redford.There's good stuff, too. Spiderman brings a lot of fun to the table. There's a great joke from Tony Stark about a particular part of Spiderman's mask, and there are other good jokes. The trigger for the final confrontation between Iron Man and Cap&amp;Bucky is well prepared and executed (if a little cheesy). You may feel that there is too much chasing around, but, it sure ain't boring. It is nice that a movie as silly as a superhero movie explores issues of revenge, ego, friendship &amp; loyalty and self-determination vs government control.Putting it all together, it's an OK watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yet another one boring and predictable superhero movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The new Marvel blockbuster "Captain America - Civil War" is precisely the kind of movie that we've all NOT been waiting for, namely - stodgy, packed with every superhero that that the directors Anthony and Joe Russo could get their hands on. What were the writers thinking when they included Natasha Romanoff, or the so called Black Widow in the script? Is she really a superhero? Or maybe being a double agent is considered as some kind of a super power?Why was it so cool to pick as many superheroes as they could and put them in the movie? This kind of philosophy does not add any positive points to the movie, even the opposite - it makes it look like a stage audition for teenagers possessing superpowers, which each one of the teens want to boast with. I went into the local cinema hall with the belief that this movie will not be like the others prior to it, namely the two Marvel's The Avengers and the two Captain Americas. Alas it did not meet my expectations. It happened to be just another predictable superhero- based movie with all its no-twists-and-turns and especially the trade mark of all movies of this type - the unique score that is present during the climax scenes, when your favorite superhero is looking into the wander, with his hands on his waist and saying some really inspirational words about the prior battle or the upcoming future (just like SAN ANDREAS). The ONLY suspense that I had to be kept in was when the Black Panther was on his way to remove his helmet.Sorry to say it, but this is yet another dull high-budget movie that is probably designed only for teens and kids that could stay all the 2 and a half hours watching a dozen superheroes fight with each other.</fullReview>

But it's without any surprise that i discovered Civil war.Don't misunderstand me, It's a great movie but the story is predictable (bad guy with a thirst of revenge, how original), the sequence of the story is interspersed and finally it's an other Marvel movie without surprise (same storyline has always).They should have follow the story of the comics and bring more character and depth (mostly for captain ! The story behind Tony Stark is touching and moving)fortunately, spidey, Black Panther and the Amazing Iron "Robert Downey Jr" man enhance the level of this movie.Special effects and battle scenes are amazing though.with all the hype, the media publicity etc I was expecting a stunning movie and I end up with a good action movie but banal</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie was decent. It was too funny. It shouldn't have been. Too many jokes during the fight distracted me the hell out the movie. Cheesy and lame jokes. This movie is so overrated. It deserves 5/10 at the least, but for me its a 1/10. There many similarities between BvS and Civil War. Everybody acted nicely, the pacing was decent too. The introduction of Spiderman was rushed and felt badly written. There are many continuity errors in certain scene. The actual 'Civil War' battle was too short. Like 6-7 minutes of the fight. The story is really boring with some action scenes added to it. The action scenes were bad. It had too many cuts. Lots of cuts for an action scene, it felt weird. And so much shaky cams. Couldn't see what was happening. Then there is another movie that was released few weeks ago named BvS which was so much better than this. This is one of the many disasters of Marvel. Avengers Assemble still stands as my favorite MCU movie. Watch Civil War once, but don't watch it again because you won't feel like watching again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Comedy saves an otherwise weak movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this in IMAX 3D, and my first advice would be to consider watching it in 2D. I don't know if it will help, but the version I saw was almost unbearable half of the movie due to lagging, choppy fight scenes. There is actually only one truly good fight scene in the whole movie, but it is sadly dragged out past its expiration date as well.The plot is a run of the mill thing that could be fully explained in about 1 minute, yet they drag it out for hours without adding new layers to it.The camera work ranges from terrible like in most close combat scenes to average for a high budget movie.The sound track is completely forgettable to the point that I can't remember if there was one.Acting however is good throughout the whole movie and you get what you expect from the characters.Where the movie really shines is in the comedy. Most of the characters aren't funny, but the ones who are (Tony Stark and a few surprises) give this movie a well needed injection boost in the middle of the movie that keeps me from dozing off after a really weak start.Should you see this movie? Yes if you are a real comic movie junkie, otherwise there is pretty much one thing you need to know to be able jump right to the next one, and it is easier to get that tidbit by googling than watching through the whole movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The idiocracy dictated by movie tickets</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This latest chapter in the never-ending "Disney Secure IP Investment" saga has the usual cartoon characters (such as Captain Return of Investment, Iron Rehab Man and Sony-Deal-Man) quickly moving and jumping through the screen to amuse millennials who are bored with their current smart phone for 150 minutes. This "film" adds up a new lineup of heartbreaking sell outs such as Martin Freeman, Daniel Bruhl and William Hurt, all whose their threshold between dignity and bank account have finally been crossed, joining previous familiar sell outs such as Paul Bettany, Scarlett Johansson and, inexplicably, Don Cheadle.The nonsensical, incomprehensible plot follows Formula 1 pilot Niki Lauda (Daniel Bruhl, reprising his role from "Rush") arranging an elaborate, over-the-top revenge scheme against the cartoon characters, forcing them to fight for our enjoyment, like a 21st century Mandingo fight for children, a plan only vaguely possible due to uncontrollable and unforseable events such as the United Nations resolution. Under a man-child prism of the world's politics, the script takes the cartoon characters to move between exposition scenes and action storyboards, all in the very awkward dichotomy of juvenile writing and over-expensive "film making".Any little enjoyment that can come from this movie requires accepting the dooming idiocracy that controls our world, economy, politics and fate; embrace your inner idiot and laugh at a giant cartoon character holding a small, tin-man character.How many insightful, meaningful and intelligent films we could have produced, under the realms of real talents, with this "film's" budget? How many excellent pieces of cinema, inspiring and motivating, touching and thought-provoking, could have been made if the masses preferred content over shiny objects? Ten? Twenty? Fifty? We may never know; we may only cry for the lost art that will never be.Watch it in the unnecessary headache-inducing half-assed-converted 3D.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Aren't you getting sick of seeing the same characters doing the same things? How many Marvel movies do we need this year? Maybe its just me but I'm getting bored seeing the the same old stuff.The first half of the this movie was extremely dull as they set up the premise for the civil war. You'll know exactly when it starts getting exciting. Its moment you saw in the previews when they introduce Spider-man. In fact, Spider-man was my favorite part of the movie and the only reason I didn't hate it. His lines are funny and his interaction with the other characters is very entertaining. Tom Holland will become your favorite Spiderman. The only other part of this movie that I found entertaining was the other new character Black Panther. Without these two new characters this movie would just be same old characters doing the same old stuff. Yes, Marvel has great characters and great actors to play those characters, but that doesn't mean I want to see a movie with them every other week. P.S. If you haven't seen all the other Captain America, Avengers, and Ironman movies you'll probably be lost. I believe all movies should be able to stand alone, even in a trilogy, but if you haven't seen those other movies you're not going to understand a lot of whats going on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Honest Review (No fanboyism.) of Captain America.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a movie that had an intriguing story, and since I own the Civil War comic, I was curious to see how this movie would play out. I had hoped it might right the wrongs made by Avengers 2: Age of Ultron. Well guys, I was wrong.No bias, completely honest. Captain America: Civil War is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.This entire film is nothing but rabbit trails, it is leading up to a film that never happens, Baron Zemo is one of the worst villains in a comic book movie to date (Next to Dr. Doom.) This movie is a complete cashgrab, the fight scenes look so fake, it has absolutely no emotional weight.The fight scenes have no stakes or consequences whatsoever. They are making quips every other second, and it's super cringeworthy. The Ant-Man stuff (No spoilers.) in the movie is so laughable, I could not take the fight serious whatsoever. The things in this movie that are supposed to make it feel epic, is total complete garbage. A lot of the characters come off whiny in this movie (Stark, Romanoff, Black Panther.). Black Panther, i will admit did have some cool moments, and he was one of my only positives of this. Movies are supposed to make you care, feel the heat of the battle, and feel the suspense of what's going on. I felt absolutely nothing for these characters, and the fact they kept deflating the movie with their stupid jokes made it even more difficult to feel the intensity of the battle.At least I felt it with Batman and Superman. That movie may have had a lot of problems, but I like it more because it was bold and I felt for Batman and Superman in the battle (Like the mother scene, it felt really emotional, but the movie kinda smothered the premise.) And every punch thrown in that movie, you felt it. Like the Warehouse scene, it felt real and I could feel the heat of the battle because every punch thrown could be felt. And with that movie, at least they had the balls to do bold things. This movie had no balls, let alone a spine.The main hero of the movie; Captain America, his reasons and logic to fight is completely stupid, and he was the most annoying character next to Stark.This is a Captain America movie, but I did not care for him. This was my issue with them doing Civil War with this movie, I knew they would not do that story justice, and it was a mistake from the beginning to include ALL the avengers. And regardless of whether you agree with me now, you probably will agree with this 2-3 years from now. Spider-Man, all I can say is, this guy will not shut up. I hated his suit and found him totally annoying (I liked Andrew Garfield more than Tom Holland.). Yes, I realize that's what he's like from the comics, but he comes off so over the top in this movie. At least Andrew Garfield balanced it to a point where he's not annoying, the movie just didn't do him justice (Both TASM and this.)Do not believe in the hype of this movie at all, cause you are being deceived (Like that moron Chris Stuckmann giving this movie an A+? What the heck is he smoking thinking that?) Don't buy into the lie about seeing it just because it's fun and entertaining. Cause your setting yourself up for disappointment.I'm going to give this movie a 3/10. I'm sorry Marvel fans, I just did not like it. As a matter of fact, I hated it. If you love or enjoy this movie, that's fine and I'm glad you guys enjoy it. But you have to acknowledge sooner or later that Marvel has no spine, and this fun and light tone is extremely cringeworthy and them smothering powerful stories is just wrong (Civil War was a total game changer in the comics, people died, consequences happened, this was no where near that.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Captain America: Civil War is not bad, but certainly overrated. It has several flaws and issues, few of them are: 1. Too much of shaky camera view. Why many action films want to be another Jason Bourne movie? 2. Is Zemo the villain a prophet? How does he estimate the arrival of Ironman and prepare a video for him? 3. Non-stop changes of establishing shots, especially the different country shots. Are they trying to sell tourism? 4. The cause of conflict is ambiguous 5. Why does the mastermind Zemo has to kill all other winter soldiers instead of making good use of them to fight Captain America? So what's the point to trap the superheroes in the secret base? If Ironman never arrived, what could he do as a non- superhero (so he must be a prophet)? Mastermind, seriously? 6. Common sense issue. If you want to kill the people at the state of hibernation, what you need to do is not to disturb them or kill them any other time. So Zemo the prophet has been spending so much time and effort to plan just to kill hibernated people and then commit suicide? Seriously.... 7. If Ironman never arrived, how does this Zemo fight against Captain America? What's his plan B? Clearly he must be a prophet.... 8. Another common sense issue. Enemy of your enemy can become your friend, what you got to do is to use brain. So what's the point to kill those hibernated winter soldiers? When you are killing the enemy of your enemy, you are helping your enemy. Mastermind huh.... 8. The quick changes of personality (or you can say "character development") for few characters are not making sense 9. The airport fighting sequel is fun to watch, but not epic or even realistic. Why? The main issue of Marvel films is they tend to avoid any violent shot which make the superhero fight look like kids' fights and unreal; in addition, when the cause of conflict is ambiguous, it is hard to establish epic fight scene. Why the fight sequel in Return of The King and Mad Max are great? Established motivation (do or die) and realism (blood were shed, any character could be killed) The best Marvel movie so far is none other than The Guardians of Galaxy; the best superhero movie to date? The Dark Knight.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When titans clash</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everything flows, everything changes. And the superhero movies are no exception. The times of characters whose human side resorted to a single facial expression are over, now the world wants to see heroes who are more human than godlike.Steve Rogers, a character I hardly knew before the new era Marvel films, is arguably the most prominent landmark of that switch. He started off as a human, whose humanity was his only strength, and remained a human even after having been turned into that super powerful machine called Captain America. Batman, Hulk or Iron Man are all fancy and stuff, but it's Captain America whose films make it one level deeper and one step further into blending the CGI action and the real drama of human relationships.Last two times these Cap's qualities were used to fight super villains. Now, when there seem to be no sinister forces on the horizon, Steve Rogers must face a new challenge, coming from within the very nature of the world he pledged to defend, and from the very league of extraordinary gentlemen he's teamed up with to do it. Of course, we are our own worst enemies, so there's nothing new. But when politics starts meddling in, there's no worst thing that couldn't get any worse.There's no point re-telling the events of CA:CW. However it's clear that Marvel really wanted to push every aspect of the film to the limit, even the smallest details. Because when even for the small episodic roles you cast such solid figures as Martin Freeman and Marisa Tomei, it's clear that you don't want to leave anything to chance. And since the action was always a selling point for the Marvel movies, one can be sure that CA:CW won't fail to deliver.Yet, while exploring the almost uncharted territories of the questions like whether humans should try to subdue a force that they can't control or whether a public consensus is worth casting aside your personal beliefs, this film treads a bit too carefully, unwilling to burn any bridges leading to the old unanimous days. The antagonism between Tony Stark's corporate ways and Steve Rogers' faith in individual freedom was clearly there from the very first meeting of the two guys, and The Age of Ultron has brought in Stark's overprotective and paranoid delusions. Yet, as the conflict unfolds in a more violent way, no side manages to move it past the point of no return, either by incapability or by unwillingness and forgiveness. Which, despite the fact that our superheroes don't shy away from publicly flashing their bruises and black eyes anymore, is a promise of a happy ending one bit too obvious to be compelling.CA:CW is without a doubt an excellent and gripping movie, and letting the second echelon of Avengers participate on par with Captain America and Iron Man was a pleasant refreshment which hopefully will lead to their characters having enough depth in the future. And of course thank you Marvel for introducing the new incarnation of Spider-Man, because even though we saw Tom Holland for just about ten minutes, he is already more natural and appealing as Spidey than Andrew Garfield was throughout both of his films.Yet despite a bit of green in the blue of his eyes, Captain America is still way too flawless, both outlook- and performance-wise. And no millions of dollars in school grants, political approval or traumatized past make Tony Stark's flaws genuinely appealing. So there might be a civil war going on, but when it doesn't induce an inner conflict in yourself, dividing you in half and making you guess which side is the good side, there's only so much engagement such war could provide.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A True Fan Service</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Civil war is a fan service. It did not beat around the bush to give us what we want. There is no sulking back stories anymore just action. However, any movie has to have plot holes, I can think of two. One is that Zemo's plan to isolate Ironman, Captain America and Winter soldier conveniently happened even though that plan could've gone south anytime. The apparent humor in that airport rumble suggests the possibility to end it with diplomacy. There is not enough animosity for them not to have a truce there and then but like I said Civil War is a fan service, so let them brawl and us cheer, who cares about the plot, right? But for the sake of argument let's say they made a truce and they all went into that place where Zemo planned to show Tony Stark that video, surely many of them would've stop Tony from going all out to kill someone and if that happened Zemo's plan would've been a total fail.Second thing that I miss in this movie is a common enemy wreaking havoc and them fighting it while saving lives, isn't that a necessary ingredient for a superhero movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No doubt ,the first Marvel superhero film of 2016 (second if you count Deadpool)is only Captain America:Civil war.Lovely creativity. Last year, I said that Avengers: Age of Ultron was the darkest and best Marvel film so far, however, after seeing Civil War, I think we have a new contender. It represents a dark and emotional chapter of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.By the way,After the Avengers fail to stop a terrorist plot in Nigeria, a superhero regulation act is set up by the United Nations that restricts the heroes from taking matters into their own hands. The team is divided over whether or not they should go along with this act or protest its restrictions. Captain America/Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) is strongly against it while Iron Man/Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) strongly supports it. This causes a major rift in the team and could possibly bring an end to the Avengers initiative altogether.I would like to say that So far, this is the darkest, most emotional and best acted film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.Age of UItron and gave the heroes a more solid reason to fight one another, unlike in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. Despite its darker tone, there were still some hilarious scenes of comic relief throughout the film, mainly from Ant-Man and Spider-Man. The new heroes were all great as well; Chadwick Boseman was bad-ass as T'Challa/Black Panther and newcomer Tom Holland was youthful and witty as Peter Parker/Spider-Man. I feel that it covered a lot more ground than Avengers. I would like to rate it 10/10. Just like with most other Marvel films, be sure to stay after the credits for two bonus scenes.Waiting for more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Really, there are only two types of reviews you'll see on this movie, as well as on X-Men Apocalypse and Batman v Superman: either you loved it to death or you just wish that it was never made. I have never followed the X-Men series, so I can't speak for that. I saw Batman v Superman expecting it to be terrible, but I came out thinking "well, it could have been MUCH worse." And I saw Civil War day 1 and loved it! Or at least, on day 1. It is now 2 months and 10 days later. And I've only ever seen this movie one time, on release day.The plot is a bit all over the place, but the jokes are spot on. The action is great, but the motives are lacking. There's good, and there's bad, like Batman v Superman (and just so we're clear here, I'm not a DC or Marvel fanboy. I just like superhero movies.)If you hated Batman v Superman, you'll probably despise this movie. If you loved Batman v Superman (first off what is wrong with you? That movie has bad qualities that are IMPOSSIBLE to overlook and you still love it?)... oops, I got sidetracked. Anyways, if you loved that movie (for some reason) you'll love this movie.You're probably wondering why I didn't put a rating on this one. Well, having only seen this movie once, on release day, 2 months and 10 days ago, I can't really rate this movie. I need to see it again in order to decide whether or not it was good. Or bad. I guess I'll find out in... hopefully 2 months.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a good movie not great in the slightest and no where near as bad as the MCU is normally.The good parts: They cutback on their cringy one-liners for this film and it really showed their characters came across as human beings and not comedians dressed in pretty costumes. Iron Man has probably the best performance along side Black Pantha who is now fave MCU character, stark really progressed for the first time since IM1 and i really hope they can keep this going but I'm doubtful :/. Black Pantha was phenomenal his standalone is going to be the first MCU movie i go see in the cinema since the first avengers his narrative and script were handled very well, he was a serious character bent on revenge and no amount of childish behavior from Captain America or his posy were going to diminish his powerful intimidating performance, but boy they try.Baron Zemo was a great villain! the first i have been interested in. I loved the portrayal of the character it was suchhh a shame how he only had 10 minutes or so of screen time. He remninded me of Lex from BVSLastly the final scene between Stark, Cap and Bucky surprised me it was handled professionally and a lot of emotion was put into the scene by IM and Zemo, Cap let it down again but it was easy to ignore his childish "i can go all day" comment after seeing the look on starks face.The truly bad parts: Spiderman!!... sucked, nothing good came from that character or the actors performance. This is a very iconic character probably marvels most well known and one of comic history's forefront hero's who has told some of the greatest narratives in the franchise and how does the MCU build up to his arrival into their cinematic universe... they don't, they simply have stark say oh yeah i know a kid who has been fighting crime unequipped and out of his depth for months now risking his life and i haven't approached him yet because their hasn't been a way i can use him to fulfill my own means.... truly awful story telling. Once the character has been quickly forced into the narrative similar to how Visions entrance, he is given 0 backstory it is all rushed over andwe quickly get Spiderman agreeing to fight the most famous of the savior of earth(Captain America) who stopped both an alien invasion and robot uprising(started by stark himself) bent on ending humanity simply because stark agreed to pay his college tuition :S so technically he was a mindless mercenary in this movie. The "Script writers" didn't feel like this character deserved full sentences he wasn't so much given a script rather a list of one-liners to run through while a badly lit &amp; animated CGI model jumped around on screen. He then vanished 5 minutes after being introduced leaving 0 impact on the narrative and all in all an irrelevant and easily forgotten out of place piece of the movie.The narrative was OK if you can overlook a lot of the plot holes it builds to a climactic ending and sort of delivers. The fact that Cap didn't sign the contract baffled me he has already signed an identical one back in WW2 and he fought hard to get that right only to turn it down after what 5 years active at most given a lot happened to him in that time but it felt very out of character especially when his sole motivation at the moment is bringing Bucky in alive and the government is asking him to join a team which they desperately need him in, that puts Cap in one hell of a bargaining position he can ask for almost anything such as il agree to sign if you let me lead the team in a mission to bring Bucky in alive. Think about it the government get Cap as the leader of their team which would in turn convince every superbeing to sign up in return for what the price of bringing in a tortured brain washed American soldier with detailed information on hydra agents and the inner workings to their operations.... the government would snap that deal up in a heartbeat but what does Cap do, he decides no I'm going to be awkward for everyone for no reason making more enemies and more difficult to save Bucky. On top of Caps stupid decision making the actors performances just leaves you with the impression he is bored of being an avenger and wants a team of his own and that the whole affair is rather amusing with this smug look on his face in every scene.My only other problem was the big fight scene with all the hero's this scene should be very tense and emotions should be running high but instead the entire thing is a joke theirs no atmosphere and any tension that has been built up for the main narrative such as the UN bombing and BP father being killed is undermined by the hero's acting like children play fighting the first chance they get. The scene is maneuvered from one couple fighting to the next by these quick interactions as they punch each other once then have an unfunny cringy oneliner each then we jump to the next for the same interaction it was awful. If you cutout everything Spiderman and watched the fight on mute then this film is fantastic! it just a shame that the comedian theme of the MCU managed to leak into this movie. BP represented my opinion perfectly during his interaction with Hawkeye the hero is attempting to be funny by saying "hey we haven't met yet my names clint" and panthas response is simply "I don't care" exactly how i feel about the MCUs fumbled attempts at comedy. I pray they reboot Spiderman</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Captain America: Civil War Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Captain America: Civil War serves as a sequel to Avengers: Age of Ultron and Captain America: The Winter Soldier. Its' main focus is on Steve Rogers choosing friendships between Bucky Barnes and Tony Stark essentially. It features a wide array of many of the heroes we've seen before as well as some new ones like Black Panther and Tom Holland's Spider-Man which was arguably single handedly the best part of the movie. Holland displayed a fresh and young portrayal of Peter Parker and his awe of the famous heroes such as Iron Man and Captain America as well as his charming performance as Spider-Man which easily blew previous Spider-Man's out of the water. This film is carried in part by the emotional side as seen in Rogers and Stark's strained friendship and secrets emerging as well as the action sequences that were very well choreographed and put together. There was a good balance of quirky comedic lines and punches and kicks to keep it entertaining and true to the Marvel persona. Overall, the movie is very engaging, funny, and thrilling.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Battle royal of the Marvel Cinematic Universe!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Russo duo has managed to handle this ensemble cast of superheroes and their personalities with a certain deftness of touch that has to be seen to be believed. Black Panther, Spiderman, Captain America, Black Widow, Winter Soldier... well, pretty much all of them put in some seriously convincing performances. Downey Jr's Stark-isms have been dialed down here, allowing us to get a glimpse of his real side, as being more than just a one-liner machine. But truth be told, it is Evans who steals the show.As for the action and cinematography, one word - amazing. The climax action sequence at the airport is something that might just leave you breathless. It is 17 minutes long (but you would be craving for more) and is straight up the stuff of legend. And no, entire cities and buildings need not be leveled to make a good group fight scene. Rogers' mistrust regarding new-world values (compared to the time he was from) is nicely explored. His unwillingness to compromise on his code is seen to great effect. There is darkness, there is depth, but the important thing is that the element of fun is also most definitely present. Oh and needless to say for Marvel-movies, do stay for the post-credits scene.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why this movie wasn't called the winter soldier part 2 blows my mind. The potential they had with the original civil war story was ruined by Disney/Marvel's lack of bravery to stray away from their formula. While what was delivered was the classic fun and entertaining it had nothing new and was poorly predictable which resulted in a feeling of disappointment and slight boredom at the end. I think this marks the beginning of Marvel's peek. Hopefully Dr. Strange will prove me wrong. However unless they change things up people are going to become too bored to keep watching. A good example is how people can only play pac-man so many times.</fullReview>

You just killed people and one scene that's all... 3- Actually have a plot.......

		<shortDescription>Entertaining but only as good as the standerded marval blockbuster formula will allow it to be.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No Spoilers section! Captain America: Civil War was just as good as it could be. Although one thing I think is worth mentioning is how this is more of an Avengers movie then a Caption America movie. This probably because it will make more money if it markets more characters, rater then just having a stand alone character.Some things that I thought were very good about the movie is the way they introduced Black Panther and Spider-Man. The action scenes were vastly improved from the previous two Captain America films. And although music is still incredibly formulated and by the books it is never displeasing to listen to. And what is probably this movies greatest achievement is just how entertaining it was in spite of its strategically calculated formula.My problems with this film stems from just how by the books it is. It is this problem alone that makes it impossible to be surprised by any superhero movies these days. It is all the more annoying when thee marketing builds the events happening as having dire consequences when there really aren't any. To go more in depth I'm going to spoil a bit of this film.Spoiler section So as you knew from the promotional material you probably knew that the Avengers split apart due to the problem of casualties in there many battles. When they show a video of this all I could think is that every time the Avengers have saved the world from being completely obliterated a few people died in stead of several billion. To which Iron-Man says we need to be put in check and so the Avengers are asked to sign a law that will prevent them from going were they need to go. This was annoying because almost everyone thought this idea was genus without looking at the bigger picture. This is even worse because Iron-Man is a massive hypocrite later in the movie when he latterly try's to kill the winter solider for is own viol ante justice. Also does any one else think that Iron-Man was a jerk not only in this through out the film. Notably when he goes to Peter Parkers house to manipulate him in to fighting for him.No Spoilers Section TwoIn conclusion I did think this movie was still good in spite of its flaws. I especially loved the way they developed Spider-Man, and I walked out wanting to know more about Black Panther. And although I thought Iron-Man was unlikable I still thought most of the characters were still likable. The airport battle was also memorable and the best part of this movie. If your a fan of Marvel you will like this movie. But if your getting sick of the formula then this movie will probably stop at good. And I'm giving this one a 6/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>could be better.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was entertaining and very watchable, but left me wanting more and not in a good way. I'm not usually one for wanting Hollywood to make more movies so they make more money, (ticked about the multi-Hobbits and things like that) but I feel this one should have been cut in two, given us a movie with a longer period to cause the break and a longer period to deal with it. It would have been really great if they could have had all their titles to work with, F4 and such. They should've split the two between Stark and Capt. and given us better perspectives of both.... and for crying out loud, the why... I mean don't get me wrong, they had better reasons than BvS, but there needed to be more meat to the cause of the divide. It seemed shallow and forced, too easy to make happen, like no one was trying not to make it happen. If I were losing my best friends/long time teammates, I would've fought harder to keep them together. While I do want more, I think with what they had, Spider-man and how they added him, could have been left out. It made the time with him cheesy and the suspension of disbelief more difficult to achieve. In a nutshell, holes.... it left you with and added holes and more... Okay, so I've ragged on it, but in truth, if you go in expecting another MCU movie with its comedy and action mix, you'll get it, and for that it gets a 6. However, if you go in wanting the depth of story that was in the books, you'll leave as disappointed as I was. 'nuff said.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>&#x200b;I rarely have high expectations for Marvel movies, but if it is a Captain America film I tend to set them a bit higher, along with the mostly positive reviews the film was receiving I had to go to the cinema to see it. It didn't disappoint me, but yet again it didn't WOW me. This was definitely Marvel's most ambitious attempt to date, bringing in a bit of a darker approach to the film, bringing out characters inner and deeper thoughts, this added a greater amount of value to the film as we got to see them as more 2 dimensional characters rather than the 1 sided action ones that we normally see in the Marvel movies. The humor was your normal Marvel type, witty and quirky, but I felt as though it was really inappropriate at times, especially when there was an important feud between two parties and one of the characters stops to insert a witty joke which really didn't fall into the flow of the film. Although it didn't affect the whole feel of the film it happened a couple of times and it was noticeable. So some of the time it was hard to differentiate the humor and emotion, which I feel Marvel haven't quite nailed on the head yet, the pacing of a film is important and this wasn't spot on.Onto the the new characters; Spiderman and Black Panther were great entries to the Avengers alliance, I feel as though Tom Holland is a perfect fit as Spiderman and I look forward to future films that he will be part of. The villain Baron Zemo is quite under cast I thought, the actor was great in where he appeared but Marvel's use of him being a threat as a villain was very underwhelming, once again it felt like there wasn't any real issue with the character, and we barely saw much screen time from him.The soundtrack wasn't terrific, as with most Marvel movies, it didn't fit where it should have. If Marvel had the orchestral pull of Hans Zimmer this would add a lot more value to the creation of their films. That being said, music doesn't necessarily always make a film, it was substantial in this one but wasn't enough to make me feel any more emotion or epicness during any scenes that were meant to make us feel that way.VERDICT:I liked this film mostly for its awesomeness factor, for what it was it was great, the new heroes and existing ones choosing their sides to go to war was cool and the actions scenes were exciting.But essentially this film was merely Superhero porn, there was so much substance in the fact that these heroes were fighting each other that we lost the point of the story altogether.I don't feel this was as good as The Winter Soldier, but it definitely entertained me right to the end, a worthy entry in the Marvel collection</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Marvel Movie Yet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not prone to hyperbole and I toss around perfect scores like they were lead balloons. But HOLY COW, THIS MOVIE IS AWESOME!!!! The action was great. The fight scene between the heroes that was teased in the trailers is so awesome. I wasn't in favor of the young Spider-Man because in the comic Civil War story line, he's the one who turns from one side to the other and I thought it would be less meaningful if it were a teenager who was manipulated, as opposed to a man in his 30s but considering everyone else is an adult, the young Spidey is a nice change. He has some really great dialogue with Tony Stark and Steve Rogers.There's a twist at the end of this movie that maybe some people will see coming but I didn't. It had me whispering "Oh no, oh no, oh no" into my hands. As opposed to Batman V. Superman (you know the comparisons are inevitable) where it's not clear why the heroes hate each other and are fighting, what makes this movie almost tragic is that you know that they don't hate each (in fact, there's a lot of dialogue that states how little these friends want to be fighting each other) but you understand why each hero feels he or she has to.Black Panther and Spider-Man are really awesome. I guess I could criticize how this movie really didn't set up how Black Panther is able to do what he does but on the other hand, BVS didn't set up Wonder Woman very well and she likewise was one of the best parts of that movie.Overall, I hope this movie brings in more money then BVS because it is near flawless. This is how you do a team-up movie, D.C. You give us a chance to get to know your characters, little by little, have them grow to like each other and THEN break them apart. You tried to skip to the end, without laying the groundwork and that's one of the main reasons your movie is inferior. I wanted to love BVS but I'm sorry, this is just the better movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Brilliant script with ups and downs in the rhythm</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Besides The First "The Avengers" movie, the first two Captain America films have been the only Marvel movies that I really fully enjoyed, I also liked the Iron Man trilogy, but always left me the feeling that they could have been much better. Civil War is probably the most ambitious project in the Marvel Universe reuniting many of the best characters of the comic books in one film ,adapting one of the most interesting comic sagas of the last years. Civil War has many virtues but also many defects, its greatest virtue is its very good and intelligent script that has a surprising final twist at the end that resolves the plot perfectly, but I did't enjoy the narrative structure in which the script was executed, with abrupt changes of rhythm that decreases the pace of the story. The three acts of the film feels like if they were three different movies and the action sequences in the first act of the film were awfully shot, with crazy camera movements that don't allow to see what is happening on the screen and even they made me feel dizzy but fortunately in the second and third act this seems to get better and luckily the battle between the Main Characters was shot in a more decent way . The tone of the film in the first act and the third are different than in second, the first act and the third have a very serious tone but the second act changes drastically, with more humour and adding many of the lame jokes that marvel use to put in their productions that luckily were funnier than in other movies. The film also introduces new characters of the Marvel universe, Black Panther, looks amazing, although that with all those stupid camera movements in the action scenes you can't distinguish between a punch or a kick or whatever they are doing during the fights Emoticono tongue and also introduces to the new Spiderman, who as Spiderman looks pretty good but as Peter Parker I think they choose an extremely young actor and Marisa Tomei (an actress that I love) playing a hot an extremely young Aunt May did't convince me neither . Awful action sequences,, very fun and enjoyable battle between the heroes of the Marvel universe, Awesome Black Panther, Downey Jr being awesome, Spiderkid and the hottest Aunt May that you could ever imagine Emoticono tongue and an excellent script with ups and downs in the rhythm of the story but above all, one of the most enjoyable films in the Marvel cinematic universe</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Captain America: Civil War - Movie Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even friends can be your biggest enemies.Captain America: Civil War is behind "Iron Man", "Winter Soldier", and "Guardians of the Galaxy" of being the best movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (Or MCU for short). The movie has it's flaws, but that doesn't stop me from liking it. I don't know about you, but the Captain America series are the only movies in the MCU that actually get better with it's squeals. The action, the effect's, the humor, the characters, and it's stunt work has improved from the first movie.What this movie dose so well is that it's really hard to pick a side, because both sides have a very good reason to be at each others throats. One minute I'm rooting for Tony, and the next I'm rooting for Cap. It's conflict like this that I couldn't decide for myself on who side I was on or who was right, but that's just the fun of it.Tom Holland as Spider-Man might be one of the best adaption of the character that we've had. Sony studios has made over five Spider-Man movies and the two actors who played Spider-Man (Maguire and Garfield), did their very best of what their got, but didn't quite capture the character that we know and love. But the Spider-Man in this movie has a screen time of 30 minutes or more, and Holland managed to capture the character so perfectly that it makes Sony studios look lousy. He was excellent in the role and I would go as far to say that he was a billion times better than Maguire and Garfield (In my opinion). I can't wait to see more of him in "Spider-Man: Homecoming" that's out next year.Speaking of good casting - Chadwick Boseman was pretty damn awesome as Black Panther. Boseman can basically play anything and I'm not kidding you when I say that, as he played Jackie Robinson, James Brown, and now Black Panther. Chadwick Boseman has some crazy talent and him as Black Panther was spot on casting. I'm looking forward to seeing his solo film coming out in 2018.If you thought the stunt work in "Winter Soldier" was outstanding, then wait until you see the stunt work in this movie, as it was just....INCREDIBLE! All the heavy praise belongs to the stunt team for this for doing the impossible.Now for the problems: Daniel Brühl is a boring villain. I honestly can't remember much about his character in the movie and that's because he was pretty forgettable. That came across a bit too harsh didn't it? It really sucks for me to say that, because Daniel Brühl is great actor and sometimes he can be the saving grace for a movie that's either good or bad. He wasn't awful or anything like that, it's just that I didn't find him treating at all.Martin Freeman is a great actor and I'm glad he's getting more meaty roles, but he doesn't do anything special or interesting in this movie. Yes, I know his character is probably going to developed more in the next movies, but my problem here is that he really felt out of place in this movie. At times the movie itself completely forgets about him, so every time he popped back up on screen I was like "Oh, Martin Freeman is in this movie, I totally forgot about that". But that's just me.The story was a bit meh and there was a little bit too much quick cut edits in the fight scenes that I couldn't get all that infested with. Now don't get me wrong, I like the airport fight and the Iron Man V Cap fight, because those scenes didn't have stupid quick cuts and I could easily see whats happening. I think it's the hand-to- hand combat fights that are too cutter for me to see what's going on. That's just my opinion.Overall: "Captain America: Civil War" lives up to the hype of being a great superhero movie and being a good movie on it's own. Marvel is having a great track record thus far- with the box office success, great reviews, and many upcoming spin offs. Civil War is most likely going to win every fan boys heart and it's not hard to see why.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best Marvel movie of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is hands down the best Marvel film to date. Expertly made by The Winter Soldier directors Anthony and Joe Russo, and featuring a complex and intriguing story combined with some astonishing action, Captain America: Civil War is a riveting, exciting, and most of all massively entertaining ride from start to finish.I'm going to start with what I loved most about this movie: the action. The Russo Brothers proved in The Winter Soldier that they can make some amazingly exciting action sequences, and they've upped their game here in Civil War. From the word go, this film is filled to the brim with intense and exciting action, filmed in a brilliantly sleek way that makes it all the more enjoyable to watch.There are at least four major action sequences (one of which is probably the best we've seen this century) in this movie, a fact that would normally condemn a film to being too explosive. Here, however, thanks to the longer running time, you get good and necessary breaks between those major set-pieces, meaning that when it's time to up the tempo, it feels so satisfying to watch.However, a great action movie is nothing without a good story. Fortunately, Civil War delivers stunningly on the storytelling front too. Despite being enjoyable to watch, Marvel's films have had a tendency over the last eight years to feel a little thin when it comes to genuine thrills and drama, and that's what makes Civil War stand out so much from the rest of the MCU.I won't deny that the film may be a little overlong, and a little overstuffed in the first act, but when the pieces gradually begin to come together, it makes for a thoroughly captivating watch. Civil War's premise puts the world's most powerful heroes at odds, and its story lives up to that perfectly.This isn't a civil dispute, this is a civil war, and at every moment, there's a really strong and serious emphasis on how high the stakes are. This is a film that matters. It's got emotional depth, political intrigue, and as many superheroes as you can imagine clashing in the most epic way, and that's something that we've not seen from a superhero movie in any way since The Dark Knight.Overall, Captain America: Civil War is a brilliant film. It's just as entertaining as you'd expect from Marvel, but with a heap of astonishing action sequences and a more serious, intelligent and high-stakes story, it makes for hugely riveting viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Have Full Faith in the Russo's Infinity War</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Civil War is the culmination of the last eight years of movies. It is a direct successor to both Winter Soldier and Age of Ultron, and references almost everything else. After the catastrophic losses of life in New York, Washington, and Sokovia, the UN calls for the Avengers to be put under political scrutiny. When the Wakandan King is killed by what appears to be the Winter Soldier, lines are drawn on both sides, with Iron Man supporting the need for supervision, while Captain America fears it'll just prevent them from doing what needs to be done.As far as stories go, Civil War is a lot more complex than simply pitting one hero against another. Everyone has their own loyalties, their own ideals, and their own perspective, and managing to not only resolve the Winter Soldier plot, but also make it an integral part of what could otherwise have been a much shallower movie deserves all the praise it can get. There's a lot going on, and yet no strand is left behind or underdeveloped, nor does the movie feel like a mess. Every sub- plot and character cameo makes sense and plays a part in the grander story.The current Avengers team isn't particularly large, especially when you factor in the absence of both Thor and Hulk, so both sides needed a little fleshing out. Black Panther gets his big debut here, but I'll resist calling it a cameo as, much like the Winter Soldier, he's an integral character with a sizeable role. He's not just there for the big clash, he's a major player from beginning to end. Black Widow, Falcon, Iron Man, Vision, and Scarlet Witch all make appearances as well, but all of them are fairly integral. At times (unsurprisingly) Civil War feels less like a Captain America movie, and more like another Avengers film. It reaches fever pitch when we get the hero-vs-hero clash at the airport, and each side gets some extra hands and surprises, including Ant-Man, Hawkeye, War Machine, and Spiderman himself. And yet, no character feels like dead weight. I now have full faith in the Russo brothers and their vision of Infinity War with sixty-something characters.What Civil War manages to do really well is make it all personal. The collateral damage the Avengers inflict actually means something to each of them. In that regard, it's a fairly emotionally-driven movie. Scarlet Witch feels guilty for her abilities, Captain America feels responsible for Winter Soldier, Iron Man feels supervision is exactly what they need. The bonus of this is that neither side comes out as the villain. There's no right or wrong, just opposing opinions.This becomes especially apparent with the main villain Colonel Zemo. Marvel have always struggled with villains, hitting gold only once with Loki (we honestly haven't seen enough of Thanos yet to judge). Crossbones makes a very minor villainous appearance, which I was a little disappointed in, but while Zemo isn't a revolutionary Marvel villain, he shows more depth and motivation than any Marvel antagonist before him. He's just a guy who lost his family and blames the Avengers, and yet the treatment of him here makes him an almost sympathetic character.As far as action goes, there's a lot of punch-ups. A lot of them. The vast majority of action is hand-to-hand combat, with superheroics thrown in every now and then. This is one of the many elements that made The Winter Soldier so enjoyable: It wasn't overly flamboyant. The Russo's have tapped into that again, but with more of them this time around, it can get a little tiresome. The exception being the airport clash, which is another punch-up, but with a bit more snazz to it. It's also pretty funny as well, especially thanks to the inclusions of the newbs Ant-Man and Spiderman. A lot of thought was put into that long sequence to make sure everyone got their moment, and it pays off big time.Civil War is definitely a worthy addition to the Marvel franchise, letting them show off everything they have, including some hints at what's yet to come. While it does embody some of the elements that made Winter Soldier so great, it unfortunately pales in comparison in my opinion, but not by much. There's a twist here as well, and even though it packs a punch, it doesn't pack quite as big a punch as Winter Soldier did. I'm still in disbelief that they managed to intertwine so many different plots and angles and make it all feel coherent and necessary though. I give Civil War a must-see 8/10, edging close to a 9. It was at least a better Avengers movie than Age of Ultron.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's Captain America versus Captain Business, as the Avengers tear each other apart while trying to figure out why the plot is so frustratingly aimless.As the Winter Soldier rears his ugly head again, Captain America is torn between old loyalties and an understandable desire to smack the **** out of Tony Stark. All your Marvel favourites are here: Micro Man, Psycho Girl, Archer Boy, Side Chick, Spank Machine, Inscrutable, the Flying Black, and Chadwick Boseman!With the Winter Soldier proving to be the weakest and least troublesome villain of all time (seriously, everyone in the entire movie gets a go at throwing him against the nearest wall?even the unaugmented humans with no superpowers) the Avengers must fight amongst themselves for two and a half hours in the hope of making their way to a post-credits scene.I rate Captain America: Civil War at 16.65 on the Haglee Scale, which works out as a desultory 5/10 on IMDb.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Please note spoilersI would like to thank D&amp;MCU for producing a very good comic book film. Over all this is a success. The character development (both on screen and off) is good to see and how the both teams work together as well as against each other. The airport fight is one of the best team/mass fight so far this year. The large subtitles that pop up over the different cities is every jarring and unneeded (standard size subtitles would have been suitable) The second extra scene was fun and in keeping with what they doing with the character, however personal I would have like to have seen something do with Doctor Strange.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As a summer blockbuster, this sequel delivers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>They're back! And then some.I highly advise you watch the two previous Avengers films in order to understand the story of this movie because the plot of this installment is a continuation in the story of Captain America: The Winter Soldier. This movie focuses on how leaders of several countries will establish a UN panel to oversee and control The Avengers after certain events from the previous films resulted public outrage over massive civilian casualties. Steve Rogers and Tony Starks disagree with the idea of government interference or political influence in their lives which causes a deep rift between allies Rogers and Starks. Based upon conversations between them both, I think Steve is a bit arrogant. He has a serious God complex whereas Tony developed a conscience and a sense of moral. The other superheroes choose which leader or political cause to follow. I'm not a huge fan of The Avengers, but I give credit where it's due. And this movie is truly one of those big budget star studded super hero action movies that combine all the awesomeness of every other moderately successful action movie except substitute regular men with genetically enhanced humans and super heroes. And by star studded, I mean the presence of many of your favorite superheroes from the MCEU of course. And this movie is a roller- coaster ride of spectacular chase sequences, depth- defying stunts from this team of superheroes as well as fantastic displays of super powers. Even Spiderman pulls out a few new tricks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Many issues, but a fun movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I said, this movie was a fun superhero movie, but unfortunately that's all it was. In this film, the MCU introduced a new hero that many comic fans were excited to see on the big screen- Black Panther. In the comics, he is a fully developed and interesting character, but in this film I didn't feel that from him. Sure, there were moments when I felt sympathy for him, but frankly, it felt like he was only there as a plot device, not as a character.My other issue is the lack of character development in anyone except Cap and Tony. We saw a lot of Scarlet Witch, but I don't feel like we learned anything from her, which is real shame because she is such a neat character and we still have a lot to learn from her. I also would've liked to see more Ant Man. He is also a complex character, but like Black Panther, he was just a plot device.If you're looking for a superhero movie with fights and explosions, then this movie is for you. If you're looking for character development and feeling from the characters, you will be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I read the Marvel comics when I was younger, but when the art and story deteriorated, I stopped buying them. This was over 40 years ago. I've seen a few of the movies, but while very popular, I found them childish and not well acted. This particular film was okay, I enjoyed watching it, but then, I had brought my grandson to it. I would not see another Marvel movie otherwise. The only good superhero movies ever made, the ones worthy of an adult viewer, were the Christopher Nolan Trilogy of Batman. Interestingly, I had never bothered with boring DC comics as a kid, but Nolan took an old idea and made it classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pls before reading this review this contains SPOILERS &amp; anything that is written here is just my opinion. Civil war is really a good superhero movie not the best but one of mcu's finest. What I had an issue with the movie is the villain. Zemo was a good villain but his plans worked out well because everything happened the way he wanted it to happen,conveniently working for the plot. Other than that what people say is that the movie is overloaded, guess wat guys that's how comic book movies work , in the comics we do have a lot of characters , studios try and reproduce it in the film and civil war has been successful in handling it. The movie showed us y each character took each side , the premise was really clear ( unlike bvs). both Steve and tony came up with really good points for their side, that is some good writing. Cgi was gud , Spiderman best part of the movie. In the end the movie was really entertaining, despite the plot holes, yes there is humour and lot of characters but u can still enjoy it. That is how marvel comics is and they try to reproduce it in the movie , if u don't like it don't spoil it for others, I am not on marvel side I like Dc too but some elements that works in civil war did not work in Bvs. But it is still a really good movie and people who gave -ve review about the movie are just bvs fan boys or someone who think comic book movies are sloppy and have no knowledge bout comics. So just enjoy the movie and lets wait for the next mcu movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the 1980s cartoon Spider-Man And His Amazing Friends, arch-fiend The Chameleon's master plan left something to be desired: "I will destroy your friendship ? get you to distrust, even dislike each other!" Flash-forward thirty years, and the same conflict anchors one of the most expensive movies ever made. Okay, so it's contextualized within more sociopolitical morality debates and Avengers than you can shake a shield at. Still, veteran Winter Soldier/Community directors Joe and Anthony Russo carefully keep hurt feelings the eye of the blockbuster storm. Their ability to effortlessly counterbalance the macro and micro levels of the conflict makes Captain America: Civil War a strong candidate for the most satisfying superhero film ever. It shrugs off clichés that had been threatening to bog the genre down, while reaffirming its core populist appeal with unprecedented nuance. Switching gears from the colourful din of Age of Ultron to the far more interesting Age of Accountability, Civil War neatly consolidates the politics of its comics source text into about as in-depth an interrogation of the ethics of unsanctioned vigilante justice as we're ever likely to get in a franchise blockbuster. Like Ultron, there's simply too much going on for Civil War to not have a 'bit-y,' episodic feel, which undercuts the sweeping feeling of exhilarating, euphoric rush many of the best Marvels deliver. Unlike Ultron, all these bits are actually good. Every character's dialogue breathes distinctly and organically, while their respective subplots are fastidiously orchestrated - with even inconsequential emotional beats unexpectedly coming crashing back as red herring climaxes later on. The Russos keep the moral naval-gazing concise but impactful, giving both sides of the debate a fair hearing, without backseat driving the viewer to taking a side. If anything, considering the 'Captain America' in the film's title, Rogers' steadfast conviction in individual autonomy has its fair share of holes poked in it, making it a genuinely even moral playing ground. And if the politics are motivated a touch over-conveniently at times (Rogers' resolution to keep fighting the good fight during a inspiring eulogy is one of the film's few stumbles of contrivance, while a non-sequitur kiss briefly flirts with the surreal unacceptability of 'Brutasha'), the Russos, in true Marvel fashion, are always ready with a quip or more stunning fight choreography to keep the melodrama at bay. Ah yes - let them fight. It's no exaggeration to say that Civil War showcases, hands down, the most spectacular superhero action combat we've seen yet. The opening anti-terrorist Avenging takedown of Frank Grillo (remember him?)'s tech-beefed Crossbones is itself pulse-pounding fun, exhilarating without overstaying its welcome. But let's face it: it's the hero vs. hero airport super-brawl you came for. You're not wrong to do so; the hype doesn't do it justice. Gone is the bland spectacle of mowing through faceless CGI blurs. Here, our combat is up-close, unprecedentedly intricate choreography, grounded in character, humour and Star Wars references, crunchy with moral ambiguity, and consistently topping itself with more and more 'Big Moments.' It's almost obnoxious how awesome this fight is. That said, it's the finale you'll really take away with you. An abrupt about-face from the bombastic fun of earlier, following a trail of twists and turns we genuinely don't anticipate (including a climax riffing on Se7en of all things...), Civil War's final fight is pared-down, viciously gritty, and microcosmically ties together the entire MCU thus far. It's also exhaustingly grim, which would be a buzzkill if it weren't so intimately emotionally truthful. Still, stay until the very end of the credits if your spirits need further bolstering. The film's real battle is deciding which character to cheer for the most. We get more time with relative newcomers - Elizabeth Olson and Paul Bettany adorably weave tender humour into contemplating godlike powers amongst mortals - but veterans like Scarlett Johansson and Don Cheadle find new wrinkles and punchlines to explore. If Sebastian Stan's Bucky verges on tiresome histrionics, he's easily redeemed when paired with the hilarious banter of Anthony Mackie. Meanwhile, the inhumanly charming Paul Rudd delivers an infinitely more satisfying Ant-Man mini-movie in fifteen minutes than his whole flaccid feature. As new blood, Daniel Brühl's Zemo wisely stays mostly behind the scenes, deftly delivering one of the franchise's most complex, troubling foes. Chadwick Boseman's slick, sombre Black Panther is breathlessly captivating, and the prospect of waiting two years for more of him is agony. But the winner might be Tom Holland's prolonged cameo as a certain prodigal web-head, whose chatty cheeriness was so perfect it reduced our theatre to delirious cheers of euphoria. Nonetheless, the film's greatest accomplishment is reinvigorating the MCU's two most beloved characters as relevant again. Robert Downey Jr.'s career-defining sassy Stark charisma had been imperceptibly threatening to dip into the quagmire of phoned-in indifference in his last few outings. Here he's back - vivaciously emotive and present, and owning a nuanced redemption arc that we actually buy like nobody's business. Conversely, Chris Evans traces Captain America's dogmatic, unwavering morality and gradual acceptance of his role as propaganda figurehead to darker places than you'd ever imagine, his strained conviction verging on the psychotic. The MCU has largely found its groove in refuting the genre's trends of claustrophobic darkness, but allowing Downey Jr. and Evans to dabble is morbidly fascinating and entirely truthful, and a reminder of just how talented they are. Civil War isn't as taut and punchy as Winter Soldier, or liable to pump you up as much as Guardians of the Galaxy or The Avengers. It's arguably better: the mature instalment needed to keep the genre in check, leaving us genuinely fascinated to see how the franchise proceeds. The fact that it's also furiously fun, and does justice to its dizzying excess of characters and content? Maybe, as Winter Soldier's Baron Strucker proclaimed, we really are in the 'age of miracles.' -9.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fantastic way to start Phase 3</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A rare thing just happened; 3 movies in a trilogy where all 3 are good. But the Captain America is a special one. This is a trilogy where the films keep getting better with each film. The first film directed by Joe Johnson was a good film, then everything changed when the Russo Bros. stepped in to direct its sequel. It was unlike any movie in the MCU, with a much more serious tone and a political thriller sub-genre. Now the Russo Bros. return to direct the third Captain America film, and the thirteenth film in the MCU, and adding the Avengers to the mix, minus Thor and Hulk.This film takes place right after The Winter Solider and Age of Ultron. Captain America (played once again by Chris Evans) is still leading the Avengers, and even have some new recruits like Falcon (Anthony Mackie) and Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen). Things start to heat up when suddenly the Avengers divide over political differences. Where the Avengers have to sign what is called the Sokovia Accords, a registration act that will control what the Avengers. On one side, Iron Man is pro-registration, on the other Captain America is anti-registration. Thus the Avengers are now divided where also Captain America continues to search for his longtime friend, Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan). One I love about this the most is yes, it does happen to star most of the Avengers, but the Russo Bros. do an excellent job of still making it Cap's story. The Avengers are in it, but Captain America is front and center in this movie. The film is also really emotional, especially in the end. After something truly horrible is revealed to Cap and Tony, the movie plays with our minds and suddenly, you are no longer on Team Cap or Team Iron Man, but instead, just wish to see them stop fighting, and that's what I truly love about this film. It's not biased towards the other side. Both sides have right agendas and wrong agendasOur favorite Avengers are here too, including Iron Man, Black Widow, Falcon, and Ant-Man just to name a few. However, this movie does introduce us to brand new characters. Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) is the young prince of Wakanda who wants revenge on the Winter Soldier. Baron Zemo (Daniel Brühl) is our main antagonist in this movie, whose plan is for the Avengers to kill each other, and have them fall. And introducing our favorite web-slinger to the MCU, young Peter Parker (this time, played by Tom Holland), an intelligent high school student who lives with his aunt and stops crime in New York as Spider-Man. While we've seen these characters in multiple movies now, they've really grown. Iron Man for example now blames himself for the mistakes he's done in the past movies, such as creating Ultron. Captain America is still the little guy from Brooklyn who cares much about his friends. The ones that stand out are the new characters. Chadwick Boseman nailed the part as Black Panther. From the first scene he was in costume, he just killed it. Tom Holland nailed the role as Spider-Man. Marvel finally got the character right, and I look forward to both of their movies coming soon. Another stand out is Paul Rudd as Ant-Man for his comedic presence. There is a scene where something big happens to Ant-Man that took me by surprise, and was the highlight of the movie. However the one that didn't stuck out from the rest was Baron Zemo. He's barely in it, but I'm sure he'll play a bigger role in future MCU movies.It seems that studios that own the rights to any comic book character can't seem to get that third film right. Spider-Man 3, X-Men 3, and to some degree, The Dark Knight Rises, have all been criticized for not living up to their first two films. Captain America: Civil War is that rare example where the 3rd film is the best in the trilogy. Great direction, great characters, and amazing visual effects makes this film a joy to watch. And don't forget the action here, it's incredible. The first scene in the movie makes me feel like I'm watching an action scene straight out of a Jason Bourne movie, and that airport fight between Team Cap and Team Iron Man might be one of the best fight scenes in a Marvel movie. As to where I place it in my top MCU movies, I list it at number 2 behind The Avengers. Had it not been for another weak villain, it might've topped The Avengers for me. However, the Russo Bros. delivered once again and passed the test with their Pre-Infinity War movie. I believe Infinity War is in good hands with the Russo Bros. and were worthy successors to Joss Whedon. I very much look forward to rest of Phase 3.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cap deserves his own movie, not Avengers 3</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will say this, "Civil War" is certainly a step up from "Ultron". It's still the same sort of bloated showroom floor for next year's big Marvel movies, and I never liked the central warring factions plot line, but it does at least have more enjoyable bells and whistles. I wasn't expecting to like the big fight at the airport. It's a noisy mess, but it's also where the movie seems to come to life, with Ant Man and Spider-Man especially. Their humor is what makes this tick, and the sad part is that it's so short-lived. It's the little things like this that get lost in the big showdowns and Marvel movie infrastructure.But the Civil War idea is so damn stupid, and really only exists to thoroughly divide our heroes along ideological lines. I dunno, Stark just seems too insubordinate to fall in with the UN, and his motivations (not to mention the big reveal about is SPOILERS) just seem unbelievably contrived.That said, it does end pretty well, an unlikely ray of hope manages to break through. But the question of where these characters go from here is left a mystery. I'm just not looking forward to watching the Black Panther movie for an effective closure.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but suffers from being massively over-hyped</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't get me wrong, I very much enjoyed this movie, but it certainly did not live up to it's 90% ratings, which honestly just seem to be spite ratings toward the critically bashed Batman Vs. Superman, which was very similar in plot, similar is kind of an understatement, just with a different tone (campy, Wagnerianly epic, and just downright weird). I love the Marvel movies, but the formula is getting a bit weary. The Avengers is perhaps one of the most balanced and best, the original Captain America and Thor were completely fun homages to their source material, Ant Man was surprisingly unique and refreshingly fun. Age of Ultron was godawful and more deserving of 20% scores than BVS.The rest are good but fall into the sequel bin, this one is close to being bin material, but is saved by the most deservedly hyped element, the airport battle. But unfortunately, the rest of the movie seems like two hours of filler. I love the characters, so I enjoyed the ride, but because I know the characters so well, I kind of questioned everything and came up with a lot of pros and cons, I'm so torn on this one, I think a pros and cons list will do best. PROS As previously mentioned, the main hangar battle is perhaps the best superhero fight since The original Avengers. Amazing in IMAX. Ant man, is great, Paul Rudd lends a laid back spirit that the plot heavy character heavy movie desperately needs. Spider-Man is fun, but honestly, there's been so many Spider-Mans at this point, it seems a bit odd, but I do like how young he is, it's a new concept for film Spider-Man. The final battle is amazing but kind of underplayed, which leads me to my first and biggest CON The last epic battle between the two protagonists is not even in the IMAX format!??! It's like after the hangar battle (which is more like playful sparring), they just stopped giving a crap, I could have lived without the initial Africa James Bondsy intro action sequence in IMAX but I know they have to have their beginning IMAX sequence.But really, without the awe of the grand scale effect, the last battle left me wondering about the spotty details of the last reveal and the horrible lame ass unnecessary villain, which leads us to Zemo... wtf, so many ridiculous plot holes, google them if you're curious but wow... Just wow. Number one, his diabolical plan is exactly the same as the also underwhelming Lex Luther in BVS... Like framing a super hero for a blowing up a government building and all just to start a fight.... Honestly, for anyone who watches Agents Of Shield, you're sitting there wondering why the Avengers are farting around with each other when Hive is on the loose. Last Con The necessary but cringeworthy spillover from the god awful Age of Ultron. The Scarlet a Witch holds up well but Vision is just as stupid as he was before. Thank God only one embarrassed mention of the awkward Hulk/Black Widow romance is mentioned. Hawkeyes once again abandons his wife/girlfriend whatever with a bunch of kids out in the middle of nowhere to avenge something or rather while hanging out with his best friend, the Black Widow. And as with all Iron Man involved movies, the inevitable Robert Downey Jr. wannabe tear jerker I'm so concerned speech, eh, why couldn't the last scene have been in IMAX format... Tsk, tsk.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It feels weird being lost in a sea of 9's and 10's, doesn't it?You can feel comic-book movies struggling to grow up, slowly and awkwardly. Problem is, they don't really want to ? and it's not at all clear that growing up is good for business. It's there as a rebuke against the whole notion of a band of immature people ? mostly young, unformed individuals with no gifts save for combat and destruction ? holding sway over the lives of everyone else on the planet.So "Captain America" is a curious case. More convincingly than "Batman v Superman," it suggests that people born with special powers aren't best equipped to know how to use them. In "Batman v Superman," the argument was subverted by the fact that Superman is such a moral exemplar that it's hard to imagine those powers in safer hands."Captain America: Civil War" goes as far as it can in illustrating the complicated problems posed by these individuals. And in the process, it ties itself up into a knot it can't untangle. You can't have an Avengers movie that argues that the world would be better without the Avengers, after all. So in the last 30 minutes of this long movie, the filmmakers cut the knot. They pretend that the Avengers are a great thing after all, and they count on our not noticing the disingenuousness. Most of us won't.Those of us who do see it will recognize the Avengers not as heroic, but as a metaphor for solipsism run rampant. They represent a cast of mind in which the self and the self's unique powers are everything, and no one else really matters or exists. In an era in which we are all our very own superhero, no wonder superheroes are objects of worship. They provide a socially acceptable cover for worship of the self.So as a work of thought, "Civil War" is compromised, but at least there are thoughts to compromise. As an action film, it has its moments, but aside from the big opening sequence ? in which the entire gang goes after terrorists ? the action scenes are flat. They're flat for a simple reason: no suspense. For example, if there's a fight between Spider-Man (Tom Holland) and Captain America, you know neither will get killed. Moreover, no matter where you stand on the treaty, there's not much of a rooting interest. Though a part of me would love to see all the superheroes kill each other ? it would be good for the world within the movie, and it wouldn't hurt the art of film, either ? it's hard to root against the good guys.Not only does the flabbergasting lack of wide shots completely diminish the scale of the fight ? it's like the Russo brothers forgot half of their lenses at homes ? but it also limits the action to one plane at a time. It doesn't help that the factions feel so arbitrarily determined. Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) gets to have a handful of great moments, but not even he seems to know why he's trying to make life difficult for Tony Stark.It's hard to believe that Tony Stark is being eaten up by something that happened in a different movie if you can't connect two things that happen in the same scene. It's all just empty talk, and "Civil War" becomes a civic lesson that's punctuated by one-liners and explosions. The bigger these movies become, the smaller they feel. The more aggressively they reach for greatness, the more clearly they prove that its beyond their grasp. Marvel movies don't get much better than this. The trouble is, they don't want to.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Captain America : Civil War was much better than anyone expected to be. After the semi disappointment of Age of Ultron which didn't have much of a point and a fairly underwhelming cast of new characters, Civil War actually delivers a strong Avengers movie: there have never been that many superheroes on screen and the Civil War plot - though quite different to the comic book version - provides a good premise for the conflict.The brothers Russo deliver a similar joy to the first Avengers with the superhero fighting each other scenes. Actually the action scenes in general are great (like they were in Winter Soldier), action packed and fast paced. Great stuff for the fan-boys that wanted that.The new characters, namely Black Panther and Spider-Man are absolutely fantastic. Of course Spider-Man is more exciting - great costume! great quips! he's so young he feels like the 1960s' version! - but Black Panther shouldn't be short changed: he's elegant and charismatic - not unlike Captain America.But two things bring the movie down a little: the pacing. The plot is complex (too complex for a superhero flick?) so you get a lot of exposition and "talking head scenes"... your mileage may vary but don't expect non stop action for 2hours; this is not it. And then there is the end... no spoilers, but it's quick and a little "under the rug".Oh and yes, one thing: it's not technically a Civil War, it's a 2 hour battle! Other than that, fun fun movie with a clear focus on Captain America, and a lot of cool shots for the fan-boys in the audience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Captain America: Civil War Review 2016 - the year of shitty election movies; this goes a step further, however: it's an embodiment of almost everything that's wrong with a majority of big-budget blockbusters.The movie gets going with an explosive action sequence with god knows how many cuts per second. It was like the polar opposite of just about every scene in Alfonso Cuarón's children of men. These cuts are designed to cover up the fact that the stunt team are a bunch of amateurs. But forget the action sequence: it's the aftermath that matters, all the civilians these so-called 'heroes' have wasted.And so begins a film that completely bashes its audience over the head with its blatant political messages. Now of course, with a movie like this, there's got to be some sort of third party involved; a definite villain (because apparently subjective interpretation is bad). This particular mastermind was only really there, however, to bash us further over the head with the film's themes. Needless to say, their motive was incredibly predictable, and they made the third act of this movie a slog.With a film this ridiculous, the filmmakers have to find ways to show the audience that they're not supposed to take it too seriously. The way they do this is they insert a ton of really awkward punchlines. What they really need to understand is that there's this thing called nuance and, say, tweaking the color palette, would qualify as it. Unfortunately, there are still corny-ass scenes in the film, particularly ones that involve iron man (Robert Downey Jr.).147 minutes of patronizing, pandering garbage! 3/10</fullReview>

I haven't watched Antman yet but after seeing this I think I might have to see what I'm missing. I hated Tony Stark/ Iron Man in this film but I guess that was the point. I loved Hawkeye/Jeremy Renner and Chris Evans. I didn't pay too much attention to the special effects so I can't comment on them too much like other critics can but the plot was a little boring and didn't seem like it could stand alone to well. It reminded me of the boring scenes that you fast forward to get to the end of a series so that can't be good news.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Captain America Civil War runs out of ideas early on. This is a an action film that promises a full on civil war between the Marvel stable of action hero's but what you get instead, could best be described as a "bit of a dust up". The result is a action film that never really goes anywhere. Its sort of "OK" but like so many films in this genre, its real shortcoming is a lack of imagination and a slavish adherence to a formula that's been done to death. In short, whilst this film is not utterly boring, its hardly interesting either. Its a deeply superficial watch, that relies on eye candy, a little well scripted but predictable action and a few special effect "novelties" to carry it. Five out of ten from me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More busy than exciting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An operation in Lagos, Nigeria to stop the theft of a virus turns deadly and there's a lot of collateral damage. As a result, the UN drafts a plan to put super-heroes under international control. Iron Man buys in, Captain America doesn't, setting the stage for the Civil War within the Avengers. First off, blaming the Avengers for the damage to New York (caused by Loki and his alien allies) and Washington (caused by Hydra) is just plain stupid, like blaming the RAF for the damage to London during the Blitz. Anyway, as the accords are about to be signed, a terrorist bomb demolishes the building where the meeting is being held. Captain America and his allies go after the villain, and Iron Man and his allies try to take them down. Because the UN would totally not care about stopping whoever tried to blow up their meeting.The bad guy is Baron (Colonel in this film) Zemo, whose family was killed in the battle with Ultron. We learn that Cap's friend Bucky was engineered by the Soviets into the Winter Soldier, and could be activated by reciting a list of code words (see AI and Telefon for other examples). There are five more just like him, stored safely in an Arctic stronghold.So there are battles with all the Marvel characters, including Ant- Man and Spider-Man. Leipzig airport gets trashed, although since the previous action took place in Berlin, I'm still puzzled how they ended up in Leipzig. Bucky gets captured, then sprung by Zemo. (Never answered, what DEactivates Bucky?) It's confusing as heck, trying to keep straight who's fighting whom, or what exactly they're fighting for.We finally end up at the Arctic stronghold where the other Winter Soldiers are stored. Zemo violates the First Rule of Movies, which is, you never, ever kill off prime villains. These people, according to Bucky, "speak thirty languages and can take down a country overnight." So after waiting impatiently for them to be reactivated and pose a formidable enough threat to reunite the Avengers, or at least furnish a basis for the next film, Zemo shoots them in their sleep, saying one Winter Soldier is too many. Despite seeing for himself that there really had been a threat from Zemo, Iron Man is consumed by rage upon learning that Bucky (as Winter Soldier) had killed his parents, and attacks Captain America because reasons.One person free-lancing through all this is the new character Black Panther, son of an African chief killed in the UN attack. Black Panther, a role handed down for centuries, had been his people's guardian, though I did wonder how people in Africa centuries ago made super-hero suits. Black Panther captures Zemo, proclaims that the others may be overcome by their desire for vengeance, but he is through, and prevents him from killing himself. We end up with Zemo in a cell that presents serious Eighth Amendment problems, Captain America's allies about to be sprung, and Bucky in cold storage in Black Panther's secret African lair until they can figure out how to undo his malware.Not only are the fights busy and confusing and mostly pointless, but the best element of all, having a rival, evil set of Avengers, is thrown away. Will Marvel salvage them? Maybe they also have super- healing so their brains can recover from being shot. Maybe Zemo's allies will come up with some way to clone them or fix them. Maybe there's another batch somewhere. But a conflict with these villains would be way more interesting than the set-piece battles in this film. Though I really did like Black Panther.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Unbearable Heaviness of Being A Superhero</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A long time ago, when many of us were sleeping under a rock, a bunch of exceptionally gifted men and women banded together and started calling themselves The Avengers. The prime responsibility that they had taken upon their specially endowed bodies was to fight terror and crime, cutting across state boundaries, but especially the bad guys that originate from the bad country of Sokovia. In fulfillment of this responsibility, they perform tasks, which defy the laws of physics, explained to us by wise men like Newton and Einstein. There is this lady Superhero, who can conjure up heat and light by manipulating her fingers, much like a puppeteer is wont to do. Another Superhero can achieve instant communication and teleportation by tapping a contraption worn on his wrist. But not all of them are tech-savvy; there is a Superhero still using bow and arrow. And another one uses a designer shield. To cut a long story short, they use exquisite weapons and toys while performing their extraordinary feats to protect lesser mortals like us.It is not that The Avengers are always perfect; they do commit some silly mistakes sometimes. And one such mistake happened during their mission in Nigeria, leading to the death of some innocent people. It also resulted in United Nations waking up from their stupor and calls for bringing The Avengers under their purview. Some Superheroes, feeling guilty and tired, agree to submit themselves to UN control; others are outraged at their independence being compromised. There is a vertical split among The Avengers. The boss at UN gives the good guys 36 hours to bring around the bad guys. And fortuitously, it is also time for Halloween or some such festival. So they all don their best costumes and have a spectacular fight at Leipzig airport, crushing few planes in the process. The Shock and Awe at Leipzig does not resolve the stalemate. Fortunately for us, The Avengers have a good sense of humour, of the self-deprecating kind. Particularly witty, is the Spiderboy, a new recruit. But he is advised by the seniors to talk less and fight more. Meanwhile the mummified soldier in Sokovia, who is revived by some mumbo-jumbo, spills some secrets about the parents of one of The Avengers. This reunites the two factions in their fight against the common enemy. The emotions tend to get a bit overwhelming and also confusing. But hopefully there will be a sequel soon to throw more light on these weighty matters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Iron man vs Captain America: Dawn of nothing in particular but a very interesting movie that's way better than that other one.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seems that this spring-early summer has turned into a sort of 'pistols at dawn' between DC and Marvel. DC fired first but shot themselves in both feet and blew their noses off too for good measure. If only they had stuck to Miller's excellent template it would have worked beautifully but David 'hands of death' Goyer and Zack Snyder had to show off how clever they were...'Have to save...MARTHA!' 'Riddle me this...Dad beat me and God must die...Ding! Ding! Ding! Ding!' 'You won't ever make Holly Hunter drink P***!'So Marvel has basically already won it by default but fortunately their volley turned out not to be so bad. Not brilliant but good. Certainly better than 'Age of Ultron', a movie that was not so much birthed as miscarried. Seems they've learnt their lesson and this third Avengers movie (never mind the Captain America tag. It could just as easily be called Iron Man Civil War) matches the character interaction and big fight fun of the original with the darker 70s thriller vibe of 'Winter Soldier'.That movie was a good thriller but non existent as a superhero flick and was marred by yet another 'there is no terrorism out there its just the guys in charge trying to scare you into submission line' that seems to have become the default position for many before the sheetstorm sweeping the world right now, the mantra to shout out as you see no evil, hear no evil and speak no evil. There are politics here too but they are more balanced and a real dilemma is presented to which they thankfully do not offer a solution. That dilemma, can super powered individuals operate at their own discretion as judge jury and executioner or must there be government accountability?, is one that has powered many comic book masterpieces including the 1987 double whammy 'Watchmen' (which Snyder made into a great movie) and 'Dark Knight Returns' (which Snyder turned into a pile of sheet) It powers the conflict between the characters until more personal and visceral ones take over.The scene everybody really wants to see is the 'Burly Airport Brawl' where the two sides go at each other with all their skills in a noisy and surprising battle that is light-hearted and fun in a way the rest isn't. That could be a mini movie in itself and its worth waiting for. There are a few action scenes around including yet another African rundown, this time against the masked Cross-bones and his crew, and the spectacular 'down the stairwell' and 'Tunnel chase/Audi Q7 advert' scenes in Bucharest but like 'WS' the rest of it is mainly downtime, yet the tension never drops and we feel the pressure building on everyone.There isn't really a villain here as the two sides are providing the opposition. Someone helps stoke things up and he is Helmut Zemo played by the brilliant Daniel Bruhl. The film doesn't 'stick like glue' (HA!) to his comic book character and they are only using the name here. In fact it could be argued that Zemo isn't even a villain and he is ultimately deemed too pitiful to even kill by his opponents once they see who he is and why he has done what he has.Spiderman is finally brought into the MCU and takes his place as an Avenger after years of protest with his backstory already done off screen (God, would we want to see it AGAIN?) with Tom Holland as Peter Parker and Marisa 'still so hot' Tomei as the comically sexy Auntie May. Black Panther also makes his début and despite his costume looking a little goofy he fits in well as does the now properly realised Wakanda. Hope they will be as well used in their own movies. - Ant-man makes the appearance promised at the end of his standalone but he is there to take part in the 'Big Brawl' and doesn't do much after. Falcon, Scarlet Witch and Vision are all beefed up and given more time and character depth here while Black Widow sort of hangs around the edges and doesn't get very involved in things for once though she too is in the action. Excuses for why Gwyneth Paltrow doesn't appear continue and are getting more and more stretched. Just recast and have done with it please!Again, a summer blockbuster that is marketed at kids but is geared entirely at adults (after BvS and Zootopia) and will mean very little to younger audiences though the big fight will be sure to entertain.So a victory on points for Marvel but a well deserved one and definitely worth going to see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good slug fest, but too many plot holes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My first gripe 1) For the bad Guy's plan to work Tony Stark had to basically check his brain at the door for the entire movie. He is Iron man because of his ability to think through analyze situation. He does almost none of that in this movie.2) In a case of the baddest casting ever was Spiderboy and a super hot Aunt may in Marisa Tomei. This was by the worst interpretation of Spiderman I have ever seen. The character is just tossed in to be a part of the slug fest. Peter Parker apparently dumpster dives for computer parts and somehow develops his own spiderweb, but Tony Stark has to provide him with a suit because it looks terrible and he could not make one on his own? None of this is right or works.Please bring back Andrew Garfield and Sally Field.3) The winter Soldier which nobody seems to even be able to find crash's a car along what seems to be a public road at the exact point there is a video camera pointed at the car in the perfect placement ever and then he proceeds to kill the passenger, but shoots the camera out after he does all this.Worst secret mission ever and completely unbelievable scene 4) did I mention Tony Start could not use his brain at all during this one.5) Second part of why bad guys plan his ludicrous: Actually expects the avengers to kill each other. Beat each up yes, maybe in defense of their ideals, but they don't kill ANYBODY on purpose unless it's the bad guy/girl and he/she will not give up the fight or threatens to kill innocent people.6) 3rd part for bad guy's plan.. throws his best chance at getting revenge by killing the super soldiers he needs to achieve his goal. Come on, he could have let them beat each other up .. then release the super soldiers at that point.. while secretly having a plan to kill the remaining super soldiers.7) 4th part the bad guy seems to nobody. Even from his own telling, with no connections to anybody important... yet he seems to have resources that are way beyond his actual reach. Not enough back story to make this one believable.8) oh right Tony Start was unable use his brain</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Man oh man, these superhero movies don't thrill me at all. I fell asleep when I went to see Age of Ultron in downtown LA, Deadpool seemed like the worst movie I'd seen in ages and then there is this.It seemed like the exact same thing to me. Same plot devices, same structure, same plot twists, same characters, same dialogue, same action sequences. There was no freshness, not creativity at all. When the protagonists came face to face in the airport-scene, it seemed like a ballet. It seemed cool, but a little silly and very staged. This movie lacked urgency, it lacked sharp plotting and creative action set pieces.While watching the movie, I was thinking about whether there had been superhero movie that had that, superhero movies that were fresh and sharp. And I started reminiscing, while watching this movie, about movies like Xmen (2000), Spiderman (2002), Kick-Ass and The Avengers. Movies that had a sense or urgency, were fresh and sharp. Between them there are dozens of movies that are lazy and boring. And this is one of them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as much fun as it could have been.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a huge fan of the Marvel Universe...I must admit I had high hopes for Captain America Civil War...and I was disappointed. Not terribly disappointed,but slightly disappointed nonetheless. Reviewing this movie as simplistically as possible...this is a revenge movie, where everybody is angry at everybody else...and this anger...much of it misguided leads to all types of conflict, between all types of individuals, regardless of their lot in life. This isn't an Avengers Movie...but it really is an Avengers Movie...and I must admit, I like my Avengers movies, much larger, louder, and bolder. Maybe its the absence of the Hulk and Thor, which leads to a bit more subdued of a movie...and trust me they are missed. Yes, Ant Man and Spider Man show up for the festivities, but their presence hardly make up for the Green Guy's or Odin Son's absence (although Tony Stark does give the "Green Guy" a shout out). With that being said, however, I personally got a kick out of "new and improved" Spider-Man, now that he's been given the "Marvel Treatment", and I expect the upcoming standalone Spider Man Movie should be the best yet.As noted already, this entire movie is predicated on interpersonal conflict, and its this conflict which leads to two major battles between our superheroes. The first battle is a bit tongue and cheek, but the second battle is all business, and our heroes are truly intent on inflicting serious harm on each other. Not nearly as big or bad as its predecessors, Civil War is what it is...A study of the human and superhero psyche. Although it is an interesting endeavor, it is not a particularly exciting one. Marvel's crown jewel, The Infinity Wars (or whatever they're going to be entitled) are fast approaching...and the bad blood between our heroes, (spawned further by the events in Civil War), better be healed...and Thor and the Hulk better be planning on showing up...or Thanos and his Infinity Stones should have a cake-walk when defeating our heroes, and conquering the universe they are sworn to protect.</fullReview>

In 10 minutes i disagree whit this movie, the crossbones dead spoils the final, Steve rogers would not die in this movie.The Wanda accident reemplace the new mutant accident,and like superman vs Zod fight a lot of people die. Latter the government enter in accion for regulate the avengers actions to protect the humanity, a little bit like the auditions of batman vs superman. the disagreement of the avengers begins same in the previous films, but the captain discover a complot of the baron Zemo (or meaby is just a regular guy whit the same name of the captain American super villain), Daniel bruhl never is zemo in any aspect, and like lex luthor manipulate the heroes to fight between then, and yes, like Loki and ultron, but there is the difference Loki manipulate whit magic not whit terrorism, its a lot different, its a lot different movie, right? I expect the fight be really good and epic but was just funny, don't expect be cause spider-man destroy the scene glued whit gum between war machine and black widow. the effort of marvel to transform iron man in batman is so obvious whit the killing of your parents. the jokes and the last fight wasn't enough to correct the rest of the crap</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some Moments Were Good...Majority Was Bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was obviously one of the most anticipated movies of this year and of the comic book movie genre. As a comic book devotee, I was very excited for this movie. However, my excitement did not meet a good movie. Moments of this film were genuine and stirring such as all of Black Panther's scenes. However, most of this movie was tiring and some elements were not needed. I felt that the villain was not needed or could have been written into the story in a better way. Besides some of the shaky footage, the action was great. There were some intense fist fights and chase scenes that really grounded the movie. However, the main showdown between the two teams felt a bit brief. Besides the main characters and Black Panther, the rest of the characters were poorly written into the story. Everything felt a bit brief and too convenient like all Marvel Movies. I feel that the new Spider-Man will divide fans. His performance way OKAY. Nothing really special, but I guess we'll have to see more of him in Spider-Man Homecoming. I did not like his introduction. It felt too convenient and a bit rushed. In the entire first act, the movie failed to capture my attention. Again, there were some really great and intense moments, but overall the film failed me personally. There are emotional moments and moments you never thought would happen, but too much set up and time wasted ruined these moments for me. The special affects were mostly good except for Iron Man. When Tony Stark is wearing his suit with the helmet off, it is easy to see how poor and lazy the special affects division was in this movie. Overall, this movie had great moments but it did not sell me on the story. I still believe that the first Iron Man and the first Avengers (except for the ending) are better films than this. I am sad to say that this movie did not meet my excitement levels.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's an OK movie and not great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll just cut to the chase directly. I didn't like Civil War. I'm too filled up of the emotions after watching the movie, that i don't care about properly editing this post and make it look good.(SPOILER ALERT : spoilers ahead)Problem with Civil War is that the actual reason that they wanted to show that resulted in forming two groups among Avengers got sidelined. It started with registration act, which should've been the actual reason, but then it got lost somewhere. Captain America and Iron Man were fighting against each other because of The Winter Soldier, who's Captain's best friend. He got framed for an attack, and in order to save him, Captain America got against Shield and Iron Man. That's one fine reason, and I can understand why Falcon was supporting Captain, as he's always on his side.But then suddenly, Captain America's team recruited two new members - Hawkeye and Ant-Man. I don't understand what was driving them to fight with Captain America against Shield and Tony Stark. The reason of registration act was not mentioned again ever, and it became a revenge story for Tony stark to avenge his parents' death. Also, Spiderman's cameo is awesome and fun, but again he's just trusting Tony Stark and fighting against one of the most famous and disciplined hero - Captain America without any reason.What would have been better was to keep the registration act the focus of the movie and thus the two groups, as was in the comics story line. What's strange is there were people who didn't like the reason for which Superman fought Batman in Batman Vs Superman, i.e. because his mother was taken hostage, but then same set of people justify the reason of saving one's best friends from Shield as a valid reason.Well, i didn't like Civil War much, and i am really shocked that on the one hand this movie has a score of over 90% on rotten tomatoes, and on the other hand Batman Vs Superman: Dawn of justice is sitting at 26% rotten. Not even this, Civil war currently is in IMDb top 250 list (number 88).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A dark and emotional chapter of the Marvel Cinematic Universe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Captain America: Civil &#x34f;Wa&#x34f;r is the first Marvel superhero film of 2016 (second if you count Deadpool). Last year, I said that Avengers: Age of Ultron was the darkest and best Marvel film so far, however, after seeing Civil War, I think we have a new contender. It represents a dark and emotional chapter of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.After the Avengers fail to stop a terrorist plot in Nigeria, a superhero regulation act is set up by the United Nations that restricts the heroes from taking matters into their own hands. The team is divided over whether or not they should go along with this act or protest its restrictions. Captain America/Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) is strongly against it while Iron Man/Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) strongly supports it. This causes a major rift in the team and could possibly bring an end to the Avengers initiative altogether.So far, this is the darkest, most emotional and best acted film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I feel that it covered a lot more ground than Avengers: Age of UItron and gave the heroes a more solid reason to fight one another, unlike in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. Despite its darker tone, there were still some hilarious scenes of comic relief throughout the film, mainly from Ant-Man and Spider-Man. The new heroes were all great as well; Chadwick Boseman was bad-ass as T'Challa/Black Panther and newcomer Tom Holland was youthful and witty as Peter Parker/Spider-Man.I rate it 8.5/10. Just like with most other Marvel films, be sure to stay after the credits for two bonus scenes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most boring Marvel experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie feels like a Avengers rip off, but the boring kind. After the first avenger (that I really liked), the 2 sequels were just plain boring. The direction these movies took were nor fun (the trademark of the MCU) nor dark. These were just some kind of filler movies to take the characters to the next Avengers movie. So, as expected, Civil was did not feel like a Cap America movie, nor an Avengers movie. The conflict was stupid and if you saw the trailers, you knew what it was all about. The only good thing about this movie were Iron Man, Ant-man and Spider-man. The much hyped airport scene was useless for the story of the movie (we knew that they will not really hurt each other, common!). It could have been replaced with a good group therapy session, that would have better fitted the tone of the movie. Besides the special effects, this movie made me sleepy and I don't get all those good reviews from the critics, like we saw 2 different movies. I do not believe in conspiracy theories, but it seems like everything Marvel is considered gold by the critics, and DC is smashed. I refuse to believe there is such a conspiracy, but still... Just wait for the underdogs (Guardians, Ant-man) of the MCU to see the next good Marvel movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ill keep this review spoiler free. This is quite simply the second best mcu movie only surpassed by the first avengers and easily up there in the top 4 or 5 comic book movies. I put it up, dare i say, with the dark knight (though obviously not AS good). The fight scenes where exquisitely choreographed, it was funny where it fit well but serious when it needed to be. It had real emotion in parts (namely the final fight) and the acting was stunning.The villain was great and i really enjoyed how he used tactics and smarts to defeat the avengers rather than brute force and in a way he succeeded. Though the movie got a bit messy at parts, jumping between locations and characters, it all came together in act 3 and the plot was all tied up.One thing i would say is having watched the winter soldier as well as age of ultron prior to this movie will make the plot more tidy and easier to follow, making it even more enjoyable to watch.All in all, this is 100% worth a watch and its a superbly directed, well shot, well scripted, exhilarating film that is up there with marvels best as well as this genre of action super hero films best.(Btw i would give this about a 9 but since the overall IMDb rating is unfairly skewed because of haters i gave it a 10 as the overall score)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me be plain and simple. I didn't liked the movie much. First of all, it wasn't a captain America movie at all.This movie was more about the Iron man, Black panther ,the winter soldier, helmut zemo and the disintegration of the avengers.They were trying to keep the captain in the center of whatever is happening but the movie had more to do with the characters i mentioned before.Secondly, the plot holes were huge in the movie.- Why wasn't vision in lagos? - Spiderman was only included to show that marvel has acquired the rights to the character. -how can a camera be put in the jungle region just to capture the stark family death?The real problem with this movie was - it took the audience for granted. It was made on the belief that the people will lap it up ignoring the flaws.I am aware that there will be people who would not agree with me but that's fine by me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's no denying the visual effects in this film are outstanding. Not sure whether they will ever top some of the quality or the artful and dynamic editing that makes them so much fun. There's however, a hint of exhaustion here because walking in, I was thinking that we probably need a little break from "The Avengers". They're all over TV and this is the third Captain America in less than a decade, not bad if they were the only ones, but we had a few "X-Men", and there's "Batman".The film really comes to life with the introduction and reintroduction of some familiar faces, and some really interesting new blood. "Black Panther" approaches his hero with a primal force many lack. There's also plenty of fun in the new "Spiderman", a real teen who is full enthusiasm and energy, but who hasn't learned to understand his role. It's fun to watch fawn all over some of the people he considers his idols.The film itself is a little too long, and it has a good plot, but it's stretched too thin. Here's the tale of revenge that was done beautifully in "Star Trek" with Khan. There's the idea of an eye for an eye, revenge. Instead, we're treated to an endless number of scenes explaining why the whole thing happened. I was exhausted at the end of the movie and could wait a few years to see them again.Well, maybe it would be more fun if we see more of "Ant Man", "Spiderman", and "Black Panther", and there's always time for "Black Widow", but the moody and cerebral ones could take a little break and come back fresher in a decade or so.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extremely Underwhelming (6/10)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was really underwhelmed by this movie.I have to disagree with the popular opinion. I was so stoked for this one, especially because The Winter Soldier is my second most favourite Marvel film after Iron Man, but I was left disappointed.Spoilers up ahead!Firstly, let's make something clear, it really wasn't a WAR. For 85% of the length of the film, it was a disagreement. And when we finally see the big twist happen, it still wasn't a war, because there were just 3 people fighting. I wanted every hero to be at each other's throat, but sadly that wasn't the case.At the end of the movie, I was indifferent about which side to choose, because both were almost equally wrong. Iron Man's motivations for signing the accords didn't make sense. I mean, since the last 8 years he has been killing people and watching them die, and suddenly he meets one woman which instantaneously changes his mind. Like seriously? He created Ultron and even that didn't change his thought process, but after meeting a black woman for 30 seconds in a secluded hallway did.Cap even once didn't mention how Hydra crept up inside SHIELD, and that is the reason they shouldn't sign the accords. The political angle should have been more fleshed out and written more articulately. They just skimmed over most of the stuff.The only real players in the disagreement (not War) were Iron Man, Cap, Bucky and Black Panther. If you think about it, the movie would have been the same if you take away all the other characters apart from these four.Scarlet Witch annoyed the hell out of me. Why? She kept creeping up in the middle of the fights in the airport scene and throwing the members from Stark's team away. I couldn't enjoy a good hand-to-hand combat scene between any of the members because the annoying little witch had to meddle in every character's fight. Is it too much to ask for a good hand to hand combat scene like the one in Winter Soldier? Honestly, Scarlet Witch is a bit too powerful for the MCU, and she should have been the one to die in Age of Ultron. Her accent is even more off-putting in this one. Nothing against Olsen, it's not her fault her character was written this way.I actually ended up really disliking Cap by the end of this movie. He saw Bucky straight up brutally killing Tony's parents, and still he doesn't show any sympathy for Stark. His motivations were selfish which were clouding his judgement. For the whole film, he doesn't seem to realise that his best friend is a threat to humanity. A simple code can activate his prey instincts.The famous Airport scene that everyone was boasting about was also surprisingly underwhelming. For the first 2 minutes it was great to see some of my favourite superheroes fight each other, but it got boring pretty quickly. Why? Because there wasn't any tension. All of the characters apart from Black Panther were pulling their punches. It was a practice session than a real straight up fight. It really wasn't War. Black Widow had the time to make jokes in the middle of the fight too.And yeah, the movie was really predictable. Apart from the final twist, the movie played out exactly the way I had thought it would. I knew there would be an underwater prison, I knew how Black Panther would become a part of the conflict, I knew that either Bucky would be framed or manipulated to attack a major international organisation because it was all shown in the effing trailers.One thing universally agreed upon about this movie is that the villain was unnecessary and I concur. His plan was extremely complex and it played out the way it did only because the movie wanted to. But, for a change it was refreshing to see a human antagonist who uses his wit and intellect to defeat the heroes. He doesn't have a grandeur motive to destroy to world, and I really appreciated that. That still doesn't take away the face that he was inessential to the overall plot.The things I liked: The final fight between Cap, Bucky and Iron Man was really good. That was the point when the movie became enjoyable for me because the the tension escalated to a whole new level. The look of anguish and sorrow on Tony's face was intense. Sadly, it was too little, too late.I liked Black Panther. He's introduced as a straight up badass, and I liked that. His motives made sense. He was part of the conflict for personal reasons and had his own agenda and that's why his character was intriguing.Spider Man was so awesome. I was waiting to see a Peter Parker who looked and behaved like he was in high school. So that was splendid.Finally, it goes without saying but the actors have really grown into their roles over the course of several movies and each one of them give an amazing performance. Robert Downey Jr. and Chris Evans are just phenomenal in their portrayals. Even the new additions like Tom Holland and Chadwick Boseman are really good.My final verdict would be a 2.75/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Whose side are you on?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I read that the directors kept tweaking with the story until test audiences were split 50/50 on which side they were on. They said they wanted people to be so torn they were arguing in the parking lot! I like both characters and I can understand both sides but I definitely favor one. So here's my breakdown of why I side with who I do. THE INSANITY PLEA: Even if Bucky was insane and not responsible for his actions, he still needs to be kept from society. That's pretty much agreed in most cultures as to how you deal with an insane person that commits a crime like murdering a lot of people. Bucky needed to be removed from society till he can be healed of his conditioning and there was nothing wrong with trying to do that in a way that saved Bucky from potentially being shot at by soldiers that would probably just get killed themselves. I understand Captain American losing himself after the death of someone he loved and not caring about the rules when it comes to protecting his best friend, but he's still got to step back and look at the big picture. POLITICAL ANALYSIS: What Captain America essentially wants is a group of powerful super heroes with no oversight by the government and that can only be punished or held accountable by themselves. Yet even specters in Mass Effect had oversight. Realistically, this won't fly with a concerned public that has experienced repeated collateral damage and even the death of their loved ones at the hands of the Avengers. There's damning video evidence of not just the bad guys causing the destruction but by the team while in the heat of battle. Even super heroes are just individuals with flaws and capable of making mistakes. After the Ultron debacle Iron Man perhaps realizes more than anyone that all individuals are fallible and that no matter how noble their intentions are or how intelligent they are they could screw things up. GOVERNMENT CORRUPTION: Those who would argue leaving decisions up to multiple people dilutes power and weakens the effectiveness of leadership as well as the speed at which it can respond are correct, but what you get with that is less risk because of all of the checks and balances. I get why a person wouldn't trust the government but the fact that power brings with it corruption shouldn't mean that we give up and don't have any government whatsoever. PUBLIC OPINION: It is fair to say that you cannot have the Avengers running free with zero accountability and have the public comfortable. Not only that, but going along with the Accords shows remorse which is also something the public will need to see. Give the people a false sense of security and continue on. Any entity can only have no oversight when they have no mistakes and the Avengers have made too many mistakes. CONFLICT OF INTEREST: There's too much personal attachment and bias for the team to hold the team members accountable when they hurt people or make mistakes. Their feelings for each other and the hypocritical nature of chastising another for what they did would cause no consequences or punishments to ever be doled out. Maybe that's what some people want? I get that. I like everyone on the team. But at the same time you do have to have some sort of accountability. How do we get that? ON THE MOVIE ITSELF: I expected lots of action and some fluff but got more! The emotional and mental conflict was what drove the story and kept my attention, which never wavered throughout the entire 2.5 hour movie. From the huge fight scenes to Spider-Man cracking jokes to the heart wrenching betrayals that really go for the jugular it had something for everyone. I loved Civil War for being more serious and mature than previous Marvel films!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>very hyped up movie but decent flick tho</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>well to first start off, i really did watch this movie with a open mind and to be really honest i felt it dragged and IMO its not the best SHM ever.According to me BVS was way more better than this usual marvel flick.ill jump straight to the point.The opening action scenes were good and the initial story picked up pace and we were introduced to black panther,Bucky, and the registration act.Liked black panther's introduction and the movie wasted no time in bringing the avengers try sign the treaty.Liked Captain America and was actually rooting for him.everyone else was just how i expected them to be.But I did enjoy the first half,no denying in that. However in the second half then the movie lost its pace and felt bland.we are introduced to Spider man by tony and his hot aunt May!!(Merissa Tomei nice casting!!)i am still wondering how Tony recognized peter by viewing his videos even though he was wearing a costume and how he got to know where he kept his costume..lol?!!His CGI fights were good.. and then all of a sudden we go into the very hyped up airport scene.Ant man becomes Giant man!! and why was he very slow like he was in slow motion movie!!??funny..Dint like that.Liked Black Panther's stunts!!scene..overall its a long action sequence where everyone seems to be going nuts about it and trust me its definitely not the best action action sequence ever.i have seen waay better ones and this was just OK.Oh Vision wears pants and shirt..what was that!!Also felt Friday(AI system for Tony) a bit fake cos it had emotions and i personally preferred Jarvis but ya that's just my opinion.Music and background score Sucked.cinematography was good .No one dies in the movie.Again the Villain Zemo fails to be a lasting threat in the movie and i seriously feel Marvel lacks in villain department maybe except Loki. People have always compared this Movie to BVS and after watching this movie i can honestly and easily say BVS was hands down wayyy better looking movie.It had the 3 most iconic superheros and bad ass villains.see the difference between these 2 movies was that DC is doing something ballsy,have out of the box approach and have taken risks which i very much like .People nowadays want something different cos maybe they are used to the same formula-tic marvel movies.After viewing i dint feel any emotions that i went through after watching BVS. So ya the movie was just okay-ish and nothing great.if you ask me which i would choose between BVS and civil war , definitely BVS but also i did like this movie but felt it was over hyped and please its not the best CBM SH movie ever!! it was decent flick and that's about it!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Most Ridiculous and Contrived of the Whole Lot, but at least it was entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This particular Avengers movie was the most ridiculous and contrived of the whole lot but at least it was entertaining.Blame the Avengers for being the Avengers. A silly plot device that even a grade school student can poke holes in. How long are we going to have to endure this bad management of plot lines. The writing was good, the big picture just plain stupid.Avengers chases bad guys with stolen biological weapon. Bad guys have explosives. Bad guys detonate the explosives and peripheral loss of life occurs. Avengers take the blame.Lets take a closer look at this situation:1) Who funded the science required to make the biological weapon? 2) Who designed the biological weapon? 3) Who manufactured the biological weapon? 4) Who chose to store the biologic weapon? 5) Who chose not to destroy the biological weapon? 6) Who designed the explosive device? 7) Who manufactured the explosive device? 8) Who sold the explosive device without due diligence regarding the customer? 9) Who brought the explosive device to its exploding location 10) Who detonated the device?Answering the above questions it seems that the Avengers were at the end of a series of critical failures that point to every single aspect of government and industrial decision making and perhaps our very way of doing things.That the director forced them to take it all without even a decent rebuttal should go down in the Hall of Fame for greatest lost opportunity.This movie illustrates how mired we are in circular reality deficient, small thinking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Iron Man V Captain America - Doesn't matter if the whole country decides that something wrong is something right.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have no loyalty to anything other than to a high standard, and what I want out of a film, I have seen everything from DC and Marvel starting with Batman in 1989.After seeing Iron Man V Captain America: Dawn of Avenging (Civil War) I'm probably one of the few who not only appreciates but prefers the Batman V Superman film over the latest blatantly similarly themed Marvel hero VS hero film. It's not the first time critics have been wrong, or that fans emulated the responses of their beloved critics but it has revealed to me much insight into why they seem to sit on such opposite ends of the spectrum.I really wanted to like this film more than I did. First having seen Batman V Superman, and then as well as judging it upon its own merit Marvel's entry is everything you would expect (minus maybe Giant Man if you didn't see a trailer with that part in it at the time.) Its straightforward, vanilla, and palatable to general audiences. It reinforces liberal and conservative binary political stereotypes, as well as sanctioning the idea of submission to authoritarian government control. Visually it fits right in with the MCU and the rest of their almost completely forgettable scores.Nothing sums it up more than when Cap says "If we sign this, we surrender our right to choose"...."We may not be perfect but the safest hands are still our own" never mind that whole "no you move" eulogy speech. However, half The Avengers sign themselves away with the Sokovia Accords without skipping a beat, without question, without even genuine honest discussion among themselves, and rebellious Tony Stark is immediately on board, all because he is guilt tripped by one mother? No one ever speaks up and says "Hey how many more lives would have been lost if we hadn't intervened in NY, Sokovia(Stark's mess), and of course Nigeria?" Don't the Avengers exist to specifically bypass the limitations of governments to take care of threats they can't handle on their own? YES!! But no one mentions that, at all.Further displaying their wonderfully efficient 'team' dynamic everyone takes their side on the issue after a brief exchange of disagreements and goes off to do their own thing, eventually needing to recruit more people to fight their personal battle for them including a teenage Spider-man, a cool call for movie-goers to enjoy, but arguably another irresponsible call for Stark. What is even more ridiculous is that after realizing he was wrong about Bucky's involvement which sparked the whole thing, Tony still just takes all his pent up anger about his parent's death out on Captain America and Bucky, unrelentingly playing the part Zemo had set up for him, even after being made aware of it. In that case, maybe I do understand why Tony Stark is so willing to submit to control, after poor judgment calls like Ultron and his fit of rage he is more of a loose cannon than anyone else on the team, maybe even the absent Hulk.How could anyone trust these 100+ countries and their corrupt governments to properly manage and use the Avengers as their will? That's how another Vietnam or Afghanistan or Gaza strip, but worse, begins. How can anyone defend submission to government control in the U.S.(because they know what's best for us?)when the whole country is founded on the idea of choice, and rebellion against an oppressive government? So because a small percentage of the general public and governments especially, fear the power these individuals have they have to respond with their own flex of power? Yes of course there are going to be casualties, whether it be war, any kind of conflict or life in general. I personally would feel safer with the Avengers out there combating villains saving everyone they can, while still in full control and able to put governments in check when they too get out of line.DC's approach in BvS (without going into too much detail here) is darker, more symbolic and psychological, scratching at the surface, with an emphasis upon questioning ourselves, our beliefs, our perspective, our reality, with great analogical religious parallels. It is visually more arresting, and with a memorable score that enhances the on screen drama.I know this is sensationalized reality like any comic book story but while Civil War feeds us another easily digestible dose of colorful, one-liners, and fun packaged in what we've all come to expect from Marvel films, which is good. The other challenges established norms, and further invites us to delve into humanities dark psyche, which is better. Personally I will always prefer and find art more relevant when it challenges established thinking and power structures, versus those that mirror or reinforce them. "It doesn't matter what the press says...or the mob says. Doesn't matter if the whole country decides that something wrong is something right."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almost a perfect 10! Would actually give it a 9.5 if IMDb allowed half stars.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First things first: A movie that finally gets Spider-Man right!I was welling up with tears of joy over the Peter Parker/Spider-Man we're finally given in CA:CW. As a kid growing up reading comics, Spidey was without question my favorite superhero! Although Superman has become my favorite hero over the years, Spidey will always hold a near and dear place in my heart as the hero that built the foundation for this comic book nerd's love for the genre/medium.Throughout the Spidey movies up to this point, I could never quite place my finger on what it was about those iterations that left me feeling empty and disappointed. Yes, I could point my finger at specific things that irked me, such as Tobey Maguire sounding too whiny or Andrew Garfield coming off overly cocky and a bit too cynical. However, it wasn't until seeing Spidey in CA:CW that I was able to pinpoint exactly what it was that was missing! For me, CA:CW reminded me that in those renditions, what was missing was Peter Parker's innocence and humbleness, particularly his deep realization to his new- found responsibility, while staying grounded and connected to his past humility. This is something that the CA:CW script and Tom Holland nailed in this film!When CA:CW transitioned over to its first Spidey scene, the immediate thought that sprung to mind was, 'I hope this scene doesn't feel forced.'...which is exactly what it felt like...at first. Fortunately, the scene did exactly what it needed to dissolve those feelings. That scene was brilliantly done on so many levels (writing, directing, acting) to alleviate what the directors must have known was something they had to address in order for the scene to not feel contrived. That scene not only satisfied my concern(s), but won me over for the rest of the film.Furthermore, that scene with Spidey and the "Hey guys! Remember that really old movie...?" may have been my favorite line of the whole film! That line was pure genius! Not just because it was a fitting line for that part of the scene, or even because it's a shout out to the huge Star Wars fans out there (like me); it was genius because it once again magnifies Peter Parker's innocence, which is something Spider-Man comic book fans are so used to seeing. Amidst all of this action and violence, you are reminded that Peter Parker is just a kid! For me, this is what I feel was sooo missing from the previous movie versions of Spider-Man. It is clear to me why Marvel went the route of finding someone younger to play the role and it works beautifully!Next, the part with Ant Man shrinking and going inside of Stark's armor also alleviated concerns I had going into CA: CW. Concerns that a Cap team with Ant Man and Scarlet Witch would be too powerful and could easily overcome the other team; namely with Ant Man quickly taking out the Iron Man suit and leaving that team down one of it's big guns. This is a complaint I hoped they'd address...and they did. Once again, kudos to the writers and the Russo brothers for putting on their comic book nerd thinking-caps and realizing what needed to be addressed!I also love how CA: CW continuously leaves easter eggs/hints/hidden messages throughout such as Anthony Mackie (Falcon) using his wings as a shield or Vision's error in calculation during a scene with Wanda.All in all, without rambling on too much, I absolutely loved CA: CW! And this is coming from someone that wasn't a big fan of the Civil War comic book story arc simply because I never felt like it gave a good enough excuse for the two sides to be at odds worth fighting over. For me, however, the story in CA: CW does a much better job! In the film's adaptation of CW, I could appreciate and get behind each character's motivation (even though Hawkeye's may have been one that wasn't really well explained, thought out or justified).For me, CA: CW exceeded my expectations. Story-wise the movie was great; action scenes were mostly amazing (aside from the jerky camera movement on some) and the acting was excellent! In terms of the writing and directing, there was so much brilliance in this movie on so many levels for me, particularly character moments that made me believe that the writers and directors were distinctly familiar with and appreciative of both the characters and their source material. Matter of fact, the writing and directing in this film was on such an other-worldly, genius level that if someone were to say it was crap, I would most likely dismiss their comments and merely attribute it to them simply not knowing the characters/source material enough to appreciate what the writers/directors did in this movie. The writers and Russo brothers seem to now their stuff. Frankly they did such an amazing job in my eyes, that I'm not sure it's possible that CA: CW could have been in better hands!Even with one of my favorite Marvel characters (Thor) M.I.A., I can still say that CA: CW is in my top 2-3 favorite comic book movies. My only gripe with this film is the jerky camera movement during action scenes...which was awful! Thankfully I don't get motion sickness, but I can't help feel for who want to watch and enjoy this film but do. This really ruins some of the action scenes in this film IMHO and I won't be surprised in the least if that is a major on-going complaint with movie-goers.In closing, CA: CW is an amazing movie experience! As a long time comic book nerd, I thoroughly enjoyed CA: CW and really hope others see the same merits in it that I have.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is Story told in,"With many people fearing the actions of super heroes, the government decides to push for the Anti-Hero Registration Act, a law that limits a heroes actions. This results in a division in The Avengers. Iron Man stands with this Act, claiming that their actions must be kept in check otherwise cities will continue to be destroyed, but Captain America feels that saving the world is daring enough and that they cannot rely on the government to protect the world. This escalates into an all-out war between Team Iron Man (Iron Man, Black Panther, Vision, Black Widow, War Machine, and Spiderman) and Team Captain America (Captain America, Bucky Barnes, Falcon, Sharon Carter, Scarlett Witch, Hawkeye, and Ant Man) while a new villain emerges"But the true Story,The story is made to bring out Bucky Barnes in as one of the main characters in the movie. The connection between Bucky Barnes and Iron man is made clear with each unraveling sub plot. It then becomes the origin story of Iron man. The story should be titled after Iron man instead of Captain America Civil War.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An amazing example of a Superhero movie done right.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just came out of the theater, so these are my unfiltered thoughts on the movie. The Good:- Visuals looks sprawling, the frames are jam-packed with design and the style is slick, fashionable, and very much grounded in reality. The effects feel more real than ever, and with the main action happening out in the sun, where it can be admired for what is - a stunning presentation of technical skill. The action itself is otherworldly, with giants tearing of plane wings seamlessly blended into the same shot as an extreme closeup of an A-list actor. The choreography of the fights makes the clash between beings with vastly different powers seem very believable. Before you go in to see this film, you might think "How the hell could a human like Black Widow face off against Wanda?" Well, she can't, but she still makes one of the more pivotal moves in the fight while the demi-gods are out pounding each other into the asphalt (which is awesome too, by the way!).- The acting is what you can expect from this team by now. It's professional, sticks very closely to the characters and by this time you can tell that the actors can pretty much jump in to the skin of their characters at will by now. New faces seem just as comfortable in their roles, with the main additions being the Black Panther, played by Chadwick Boseman, and Tom Holland as Spider Man. Their motivations were clear from the start but I especially like Bosemans' performance as it was at times subtle yet right on the nail. - The story is also on the good side of this review, and as a person not watching every trailer of a movie beforehand (because I figured out a while ago that it can only make a movie worse after a certain point) certain events, plot points and dialogue caught me off guard in a really good way. However, you should not go in to this film with the idea that the story is much more than what you've seen in the trailers. However, there are as I said some surprises in store for those that don't watch every piece of marketing on the web, and they're very enjoyable.The Bad:- The tone was much more serious in this one, and a few twists and turns in this film had to deal with some very sinister acts of violence, and the responsibilities that a these super-powered men and women need to embrace in order to prevent death and disaster. As such a film, there are fewer jokes and while the visuals and action is light in tone, that is only the surface. The meaning of the violence is sometimes quite grave. The funny thing is that they deal with the same subject as Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice - but much, much better and with a more coherent story. All in all, this isn't really bad in that sense, as I quite liked the more mature plot points, but it forces the directors to include fewer Marvel-style quips and jokes which mostly hit home for me. If you thought Age of Ultron had too many jokes, Civil War is the perfect movie for you.- There were a few plot holes. I won't go into them right now, as I don't want to ruin this amazing movie for others, but I will say that some of it bothered me a little. - The 3D was pretty bland. I look forward to seeing this movie on Blueray, as some wide-shots come out very blurry, even with my amazing seat snug in the middle of the back row.TL;DR: Despite it's few shortcomings, this is a superhero masterpiece and it should be enjoyed on the biggest screen possible. I will disregard the bad and give it a 10/10, as my critique is mostly personal opinion and based on the fact that I watched it in 3D. Go see this movie if you like to see action, stunning visuals and a group of A-list actors kicking verbal and literal ass.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As much as I enjoyed superheroes going nuts without exactly going Man of Steel about it, the premise of the movie is ... damn...I thought Batman vs Superman was ridiculous in terms of writing, but I can't believe I'm saying this - Marvel has outdumbed DC. Big time. They get saved by generally much more likable cast, but swallowing it gets hard. Captain series might be serious\dramatic, but if second movie was a fresh breath, then this is a bigger convolution than Week of Lultron.In almost every Marvel movie - they save the world, or the universe, in some way. They do it at a great risk, especially personal, even with casualties.Yet this movie will keep showing "high-profile" people(not some sorry neighbor dumb blonde mom) keep throwing personal level accusations at our heroes. I understand when people complain about MoS being a clusterbuck, and even the Avengers could be questioned, but deliberately making this drama a plot? Like I said, that's worse than BvS. We get a new Hydra, this time being the "World" they are trying to protect... I mean, come on, over a hundred countries signed a petition that affected probably... what, 2-3 of them? Talk about signing the anti-Russian sanctions... Ahem, and this Hydra is totally ballbreaking the Avengers. And, of course, the "leader" - Tony, is compromised(by a woman I'd personally hit in the face and pay to be put in an asylum) at the exact right time. Captain, again, is the fugitive, which should be a running gag by now... And then there are the new guys and... semi-new guys: -I thought the Amazing Spiderman was the worst spiderman there could be. Because it was wrong at pretty much every turn imaginable. But this... This is a disaster. I won't disrespect the actor, he was fine, and I won't even mention his aunt, Jesus effing... But he gets recruited by Tony and agrees to do his bidding to capture the bloody Captain... on a whim. Plus, there isn't even any real introduction, Spiderman is just bloated into the plot for no apparent reason. So our little protector of the weak is abiding a weapon manufacturer to capture the only man known to fight for the world. And while doing so, he is doing the most annoying impersonation of Spiderman imaginable. Gone is the original Spidey. Gone is even the boneritis-ridden Amazing. This is the new low. Might as well have hired Bieber for the role.-This "extra black" panther - I think he was the biggest villain in the movie. I mean, even the antagonist wasn't as much of an -hole as he was. His daddy gets whacked, among a dozen others, and our hero, our sorta "Avenger" - promises to "kill" the culprit... Damn... That's a first.-The antagonist is some sort of genius out of nowhere, and from his outstandingly -tarded exposition - Black Widow released Hydra files "to the public". I know Winter Soldier stated that Shield will be declassified, and that was already a drunken Shyamalan plot twist, but "to the public"? Hey, I think even Snowden would roll his eyes... And that's saying something.-Vision, the only guy besides Thor to be "worthy", a walking computer with a mind gem in his head - he acts as a second-hand puppet for the most official -hole for the whole movie. Personally, of all the Avengers, I'd expect him to Sherlock the whole deal first, and be the one next to cap. Instead he probably remains in a Jarvis mode for the purpose of 6v6.-Antman is apparently free to assist the Avengers now, despite all the Pym deal we saw previously. I mean, come on, he lets himself, and his suit - be captured by the new Hydra. Where is Pym in this? For all I know, it was Evangeline Lilly who did the trick in the end of the movie. Otherwise it's such bull that I can't even...On a final note... remember the finale of Winter Soldier? That killer line from Black Widow? You won't remove us, because you need us, because we do the things you won't? Well, apparently the whole world, 100+ countries - agrees to retire them. And, personally, I'd wanted to see the movie develop like Transformers 3: buck the humans. Buck them all. Let them burn, then come back and save them when the moment is right.So.. the movie started as bull, developed as bull, and ended as... well, a bit better smelling bull. It's interesting how they will continue this, because as much as the big brothers want to replicate The Incredibles - some things are better left unique.Superhero rumble: 10\10 Writing: 2\10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Blame Game</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Action Cinematography: Great Acting: Consistent with the rest of MCU flicks Storyline: Garbage. The biggest gripe I have with Captain America: Civil war is they use one of the lowest forms of storytelling, the misplaced blame angle. They don't just do it once, oh no, it's the only plot device used to move the story forward. Ironman and the UN wrongfully accuse the winter soldier of the Vienna bombing (and the conscious decision to carry out multiple terrorist attack's throughout history). The UN place's blame on the Avengers for all the destruction from the previous movies and the most recent Nigeria bombing. The movie's main villain, Helmut Zemo, holds the Avenger's responsible for the loss of his family in the Battle of Sokovia. That's the movie in a nutshell. Of course, all of the avenger's being held accountable for this and that do little to defend their actions to their accuser's, in some cases, not at all. If Civil War had logical interactions amongst characters no movie would exist, would there? Misplaced blame is one of the reason's why Batman vs. Superman was bad and it's becoming an increasingly prevalent device in the MCU. The dialogue in this one was also some of the weakest offered from any other part of the series. I'll give the script a pass for allowing Helmut Zemo the ability to impersonate a psychiatrist in what should be one of the world's most securest facilities. He was a former intelligence officer after all, eh? But he automagically acquire's both the Winter Soldier Book AND clear footage of a double murder on a desolate road from 1991, that shows the identity of both victims and the killer? Holy hell, even for a comic book movie that's pretty damn impressive. If only Harry Potter looked this guy up he could have had all those friggen' horcruxes in a couple of off-screen minutes. TL;DR - Civil war is a good spring action flick if you like Michael Bay movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie doesn't work for me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If I were ranking the Marvel movies (not including the X-Men movies I've seen but even WITH the couple X-Men movies I did watch) in a personal order of preference "Civil War" comes in dead last. Granted, Age of Ultron was pretty good but still... dead last.All that story development just drags on and on. And for what? The fight at the beginning, middle, and end? And then the ending ties it up in a short paragraph not much in line with the endlessly plodding story development? Undoubtedly, the "villain" of this particularly tortured story was the victim and the good guy. Not what I generally look for in a superhero vs. villain story.If I can't depend on Marvel to deliver me the super-hero vs. villain generally found in the genre what do they think they are selling me? Long as it was and as many talented people as they had working on it I feel it misses the mark by a mile.What a plodding story line.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visually appealing action, but lacks in everything else.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Captain America : The Civil War is the most awaited superhero movie for all Marvel and superhero's movies fans, but sadly for me, it failed as what it was supposed to be.The movie is about the separation of the Avengers, where Captain America and Iron Man are fighting about an idea, the one where the government wants them to hide and wait for orders before acting. Though it is a serious subject and the two team leaders tries to prove their points, the movie never really goes far enough about this idea. Captain America : The Civil War is a 2 hours and 30 minutes of nothing much happening and where the story will be forgotten.It is mostly about Iron Man more than Captain America the the point where it doesn't feel like a Captain America movie like the 2 first ones.Most of the credits of the movie goes towards the few actions scenes there are in the movies, they were well cut and explosives, though they don't feel like there are anything threatening to both teams. I appreciate the use of most of all the Avengers members and most of them shows good use of they're powers, props to Ant-Man and Spider-Man, they had good surprises. Overall, each actions scenes doesn't feels like a menace or anything, you don't fear for any characters and there are not a lots of emotions. There are evens some characters that are joking in the battlefield while fighting they're friends, it just doesn't feel serious and break the image of the "war" that is implied.In the end, Captain America : Civil War feels like a useless entry to the MCU, there is not much things happening in between the action scenes and it feels like a 2h30 introduction to the next MCU movie, probably the next Avengers. Fans will love seeing they're favourites heroes fighting, but there is not any depths at all and was felt unsatisfactory when the credits started rolling. The movie felt long, but I was still surprised when the credits appeared because nothing was felt accomplished in the end. It is probably one of the weakest Marvel movie after the first Avengers. Lets hope The Black Panther can do better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing, but still okay.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have generally liked all the Marvel superhero movies, but some less than others (obviously). I had high hopes for this one, which might be why I ended up so disappointed in the result.Most of the movie is built around the quarreling between the heroes themselves, but this ends up being uninteresting, and feel more like an excuse to have them go at each other. But even the fights have such low stakes that it's hard to get much excited for them.The villain's plot makes little sense (to me), and seems to be based a lot on luck. Without going into to much detail, it would have been impossible for the villain to anticipate and plan for the situation in the end. But perhaps we are supposed to understand that he is just improvising some sort of plan B? Either way, it was not very interesting.The movie does some things right, though. The movie did not feel over crowded, despite the absurd amount of heroes involved in it. They all felt like they belonged in the roles they were in. Ant-man and Spider-man stole every scene they were in giving me hope for the future of the marvel movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rest in piece, Batman V Superman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>-SPOILERS BY THE WAY- How this movie managed to both live up to the hype and surpass it is beyond me, but it did both. Before yesterday, my favorite movie was Christopher Nolan's Inception, but it looks like Marvel's Civil War has managed to take the cake. While subliminally, it seems Marvel has been setting up this film for a long time. Whenever Tony Stark and Steve Rogers meet on screen, there's usually some argument or tension. The Sokovia Accords was the end to the time bomb. At first I was afraid that some characters wouldn't get enough screen time. However, I was pleasantly surprised at how the Russos managed to juggle ten heroes while adding two new ones. Tom Holland's Spider Man is the best by far, but Black Panther was definitely the more interesting character. I'm excited for both solo films to come out. I'm surprised at how many people disliked Zemo. You may have to watch the film multiple times to realize it, but he's a fantastic character. He's driven by a thirst for revenge after the Avengers inadvertently killed his father, son, and wife. And what better way to tear them apart then to show Tony who killed his parents. The airport battle scene was amazing, but the friend-on-friend action at the end really took the cake for me. Bucky losing his metal arm, Tony's armor being demolished, and Steve dropping his shield were all very good emotional conveyors. Not to mention, while this is happening, T'Chala stops Zemo from committing suicide. It's dark, dark stuff, but it's shown in a way that Batman V Superman could never pull off. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Civil War thoughts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hi Guys,I just saw the movie, and is by far the most beautiful movie of the series. It has action, very good screenplay and very strong characters and viewpoints. It shows that anyone can lose in war, and that bad sh....it happens whenever you like it or hope it shouldn't happen. all characters are pictured OK except the cat dude that was too simple and very idiotic in his thoughts. For the director to put such a low minded person within a strong position see miss placed. He doesn't seem to have merited the position he had there in first place, as a person at that stage in life knows better than blind revenge. This is magnified in the view that the his father seemed to be far better in logic than the son, and it is showed that he had good relations to his father. Being shown that he has not got a part from his fathers knowledge confirms that the character, is in a much lower level in logic and miss placed in the movie. Even if he was not OK with his father ideas, he should have got the qualities to judge the facts on his own. It is a shame that the BEST movies so far in this decade are so close together. Hope we can see better ones in the future, who knows :) ;)Timi,</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fiirst off it seems Steve Rogers thinks Captain is the highest ranking and doesn't have to follow any rules. If you love the previous two Avenger movies then you will love this one. Since its basic the same story told 4 the 3rd time.CA The Winter Soldier is a better movie. Instead of an alien with a British accent trying to destroy the Avengers from the inside, it's a human with a Sokovian accent. Also love the hidden camera in the woods on some back-road in 1991 that shots multiple angles.would have been more believable to have had him to be able to download what he saw and shown his face in the mirror. Unless you were friends with CPT America in 1945 he will either just try to kill you or smash your face in. FYI he has more kills than Deadpool. Not sure if he knows what a situation going south means?! The black panther was great. Till he turns into a saint and just forgives everyone who tries to kill him or did kill his people. Spidey looks awesome. Can't wait for homecoming. So if you drank the Marvel Koolaid enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's really good, but still flawed.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I write this, I think Captain America Civil War is still to release in the USA. It's sitting at #89 on IMDb and it's been universally loved. I really love the MCU as a collected whole, and Captain America Civil War is one of the best, but if I'm going to review it honestly, it's still flawed.Flaw 1: Action scenes in shaky cam. Was Paul Greengrass a cameo director? The first couple of fight scenes were very hard to see with camera movement. And after ironically seen the trailer for Jason Bourne I was looking forward to dolly shot action sequences. Nope. They were very "Bournesque." The now famous airport battle was thankfully rather still (I'd imagine due to the heavy CGI), but the earlier fight sequences would have been far better shot if we could have seen the action.Flaw 2: Minor Spoiler. The character motives. The motives for the fight with Civil War, especially at the end, was very personal. For all 3 of the main characters - Bucky, Stark and Rogers - it became a personal battle. I think this was a flaw of the Civil War issue. The reason Civil War was so brilliant a story arc in the comics was that it was ideological. The movie had tones and set up the reasons, but by the end it became a personal grudge match. And worse, the characters behaved in ways that seemed to contradict their own actions earlier within the movie. Stark was especially guilty of this by the end of the movie. Overall it was an "acceptable" plot, but it would have been nicer to keep closer to the ideological battle of Civil War.Flaw 3: Major spoiler. The ending of the film. In the comic, the end of Civil War sees Captain America die. Crossbones and Agent 13 (Sharon Carter) kill Rogers. I am highly surprised this didn't happen in Civil War, and I thought it would have been a tie into the MCU to allow for Mystic / Time powers to be introduced to "resurrect" Rogers pre-Thanos. So as the movie starts with Crossbones and then Agent 13 is in place soon after, I felt the movie was building up to it. And then nothing. Why? If Captain America's death wasn't the end of Civil War (as it was in the comics), why were those scenes needed in the movie. Crossbone's battle made some plot sense, but Agent 13's place in the movie was superfluous. In fact, it would have been more interesting without her, as her only role was to return the equipment to Falcon and Rogers. They instead could have used Ant-Man to steal them, since he is a criminal. Good setup wasted.Final Thoughts: And here then is the rub. It's not a perfect movie if you try to be critical, especially if you know the source. But it's also really good, with great action scenes, especially that airport scene. The fighting felt heavy. The punches really felt like they were hurting because the emotions were there. It wasn't just some random alien, but it was our Avengers we've spent the last few movies getting to know. I did enjoy it, I'll go back and watch it again.</fullReview>

And like they said, Don't let vengeance consume you. Just because someone's framed doesn't mean they are a criminal. You should prove your innocence. And forgive one another even thought they hurt your feelings. Remember, the past may hurt, but look on a brighter future. You have to get up and be strong and move on. Always remember to listen before you act. Because you don't know if your actions could affect somebody. The stars of Captain America Civil War proved that they have not only their actions but also their talents. I think the stars are an amazing role model for every Marvel fans and young actors and actresses. So Thank You and God Bless. My Verdict 10/10</fullReview>

If this is a Captain America, shouldn't it be more focused on Captain America and less or close to 0 about the Avengers? We all love when all super heroes gather together but hey, let's focus the stories on the main character only. This was a bad stunt just to sell in the box office. Besides the fighting scenes which were awesome, the story behind the movie is very thin. I am a comics fan but I have to say I was getting bored at some times.

It had very little to do with the comic book tale.It was more of an Iron Man movie than a Captain America movie. It revolved around Iron Man having a horrible day, and Cap being a bystander in his own movie.What I liked:I liked the fact that in this movie we see more character development of Ant-Man and Hawkeye two characters that are not very well represented in the MCU yet.Black Panther was spot on from the character that I knew from the comic books of old.I appreciated the tie in to Agent Carter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marvel Stalemate Saga</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Walt Disney Studios should have changed the title from "Captain America: Civil War" to "Captain America: Stalemate" since none of the heroes who square off against each other die. Co-directors Anthony Russo and Joe Russo, who helmed "Captain America: The Winter Soldier," have the two rival divisions, led by Captain America and Iron Man, knocking the shenanigans out of each other in this contrived, drawn-out, 147 minute epic. Nevertheless, the worst thing that happens is War Machine loses control of his Iron Man style armored suit and makes a crash landing in a field. Although he suffers spinal damage, Lieutenant James Rhodes is back up and walking around with some difficulty before fade0ut. Mind you, "Captain America: Civil War" amounts to a letdown when nobody puts anybody down permanently. Ultimately, the two fractions emerge evenly matched. Nobody like S.H.I.E.L.D. Agent Phil Coulson is around to die and make an impact like in "Marvel's "The Avengers" (2012). At least the recent DC Comics movie "Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice" pretended to kill off one of the two title characters. Of course, anybody with a grain of sense knows that the adversary that perished in "Batman v Superman" isn't dead. Furthermore, the DC Comics extravaganza at least staged a funeral and the characters engaged in a period of mourning. Although the premise that Captain America and Iron Man would clash is certainly attention-grabbing, the movie pulls its punches because the superheroes emerge with little more than either bruises on themselves or scratches on their respective outfits. Despite several competently orchestrated physical confrontations, "Captain America: Civil War" rarely generates a modicum of suspense about its outcome. Basically, the Russo brothers stage one memorable fight at an evacuated airport, clear up the mystery behind the death of Tony Stark's parents, and introduce a new costume-clad character to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The Black Panther makes his debut, but he seems rather tame compared with the other Marvel champs. At one point, "Captain America: Civil War" seems more interested in rebooting the Spider-Man franchise than doing something with its protagonists that its PG-13 rating would condone. Sadly enough, the characters that stand out here aren't the title characters. Indeed, Spider-Man and Ant Man make a greater impression than any of the other Marvel titans, and Black Panther looks like Mardi Gras was his destination, and he paused to participate.Approximately three characters die in "Captain America: Civil War." United at the outset, our heroes descend upon Lagos and tangle with former S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Brock Rumlow, (Frank Grillo of "The Purge: Anarchy") a.k.a. Crossbones and his thugs who want to hijack a deadly biological weapon. Crossbones tries to kill Captain America with an explosion that obliterates his own life. Miraculously, the telekinetic Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen of "Godzilla") contains the blast and shifts it elsewhere to do its harm. Unfortunately, the blast shatters a nearby building, killing many unseen, innocent bystanders. The collateral damage fallout from the incident brings the Avengers under scrutiny. Afflicted with a guilty conscience about the death of an African-American lad in Logas, Tony Stark advocates the Sokovia Accords drawn up by the United Nations. Essentially, the Sokovia Accords establishes a panel to supervise the Avengers. Apparently, the indestructible Avengers may be responsible for killing more people than their own adversaries owing to the collateral damage that they have wrought during their escapades. Captain America (Chris Evans of "The Fantastic Four") abhors the idea, and he refuses to ink the pact. The death of Agent Peggy Carter solidifies his negative attitude toward the Sokovia Accords. A longtime Avengers adversary, U.S. Secretary of State Thaddeus "Thunderbolt" Ross (William Hurt of "Dark City") now enjoys a position with more prestige than power over them. Ross, you may recall, has been the bane of the Hulk. Matters grow even more serious. Steve Rogers' World War II pal Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan of Captain America: The Winter Soldier") is suspected of a igniting a deadly blast in Vienna where the Accords were being signed. Surveillance cameras show that Bucky was in town when the incident occurred. The blast kills King T'Chaka of Wakanda (John Kani of "The Wild Geese"), and his acrobatic son T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman of "42") dons a black bulletproof suit, a mask with cat ears, and gloves with retractable claws and embarks as The Black Panther to avenge his father's death. One of the many problems with "Captain America: Civil War" is that it bristles with far too many characters who do far too little to each other. Eventually, T'Challa will have his own stand alone movie, but he looks shoehorned into this film with nothing memorable to do. Worst of all, the chief villain is a family-guy-turned-vigilante, Helmut Zemo (Daniel Brühl of "Rush"), who is a rather dreary fellow compared with previous Marvel antagonists.Anybody familiar with the Marvel Comics graphic novel will tell you "Captain America" scenarists Christopher Markus &amp; Stephen McFeely have taken liberties with the source material. In the Mark Millar graphic novel, lesser costume clad warriors destroyed an elementary school while a reality-TV crew photographed their endeavors. This wholesale destruction prompted the President of the United States to enact the Superhero Registration Act to make superheroes more accountable for their actions. Furthermore, the law required these costume-clad crusaders to divulge their true identities. Now, these heroes face the prospect of serving as Federal employees or facing arrest. Iron Man supports the act. "Becoming public employees makes perfect sense," he proclaims, "if it helps people sleep a little easier." Captain America opposes it, "Super heroes need to stay above that stuff or Washington starts telling us who the super-villains are." Later, Iron Man tricks Captain America and his Secret Avengers into responding to a fire at petrochemical plant where hundreds people could die. Ultimately, Captain America surrenders after Iron Man beats him into submission."Captain America: Civil War" isn't half as good as the previous two "Avengers" movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was a comic addict, but these new movies are really getting crazy. Super heroes seem to have developed powers and abilities that they classically never had. Each movie seems to try to out "super" the next with special effects etc. with less and less story. For me this one does not walk (aka it is lame). Plenty of special effects....some quite "Jerky", but apart from that, little of anything to attract. Captain America and his band of merry men seem to have developed invincibility, being able to sustain impacts and blows that would kill or maim any mere mortal.If you like that sort of thing then by all means see it.

		<fullReview>The meta-score and ratings for this movie is overrated. This movie didn't feel like the Civil War from the Marvel Comics at all. This shouldn't even be call Civil War. It's just as the tag line says: Team Cap vs Team Iron Man. Their were a lot of random scenes and jokes that shouldn't be there. People who thinks this movie is incredible are completely bias. I was disappointed. Anyone who cares about a nice and flawless development for a story-line should be disappointed. Hawkeye was just there. Same with Spidey and Ant-Man. The beginning of the movie shows a scene from 1991 yet we see a bunch of flat screens monitors. Its possible for the those scientist to create Winter Soldier back then yet Iron Man, Mr. Tony Stark can't even a better leg than Winter Soldier's arm for his buddy War Machine. Captain America takes a bunch of Iron Man's repulsor attack yet he's only slightly injured. Cap is Super "Human" not Super Alien. Black Widow disappears with only the explanation of Ross is coming to get her. I mean she's hot but come on she's super spy they could've done a lot more than that. Hawkeye is on Team Cap/the fugitive side which doesn't make sense because if he was truly thinking about his Family, he would've been on Iron Man's side. Falcon dodging The Vision's attack as if he got spider-sense yet War Machine couldn't detect that. Iron Man could've catch up to the Quinjet if he truly tried. Spider-Man? Spider-Boy. That's all their is to say about him. One thing though, Aunt May is too young. She looks like mid 30-mid 40's. Vision could've single-handily take out Cap and Winter Soldier without a sweat. But for some reason as with Thor, Marvel decided to make them weaker than they should be. There was no need for Crossbone's appearance. They only placed him their for 1. "Bucky" 2. Scarlet Witch's disaster. For number 1, they could've done something else, something much better that wasting a villain like that. Number 2, after New York and Sokovia, the Government of the world took action for that? And where in the world is Nick Fury? He was the one who started the whole Avengers thing yet he's no where to be found and wasn't even mentioned. A lot of inconsistency and bad story building. Worst thing that bothers be is this is supposed to be a war. A "War". Didn't feel like it to me and every little chance they get, they pop out a joke. Now for the things I DO enjoy in the movie. Ant-Man was hilarious. Robert Downey Jr. played Tony Star as good as ever. Black Panther was awesome, fighting or not. Speaking of Black Panther, the hand-to-hand combat action from Black Panther and Captain America was excellent.

		<shortDescription>Pretty Underwhelming, it Has to Be Said</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start off by saying that I didn't come into this film with very high hopes.When I heard that Civil War was the next comic book that Marvel was going to loosely adapt, I was concerned. Personally, I hated the comic, simply because it had too many characters, not enough substance and inconsistent characterisation out the wazoo. I was incredibly worried when they announced that this was their next project after the brilliant Age of Ultron (which I absolutely adored) and the surprisingly fresh and inventive Ant-Man. I was also deeply concerned that the Russo brothers were directing. While I did enjoy Winter Soldier, I found the tone to be bit inconsistent and worried that this would be the same.As it turned out, the tone was perfectly fine, but in the end, I came out of this film feeling...apathetic, really. I wasn't emotionally invested, I wasn't riled up, and I wasn't all that interested in what happened to the Avengers by the end, all of which are a first for me when it comes to a Marvel movie.Normally, I enjoy anything that involves the excellent Chris Evans and the wonderful Robert Downey Jr combating tyranny and evil with the rest of the team, but here I just felt exhausted. For one, the plot is unfocused. It moves at a break-neck pace with hardly any stopping to breathe, without any real character development (outside of Wanda, Vision, Spidey and Panther) and without real substance. By the end, I was so tired after seeing this film that I felt as though I could sleep for 70 years without any aid from suspended animation.Then there's the lacklustre villain, Zemo, who gets the generic 'my-family-is-dead-because-of-the-recklessness-of-the-heroes' motivation that is extremely tired at this stage. To be perfectly honest, I don't really understand why this film needed a villain. The comic book didn't have an antagonist outside of Reed, Pym and Tony's recklessness and Cap being blinded by his own motivations. The conflict should have come from within the group, and Cap and Tony should have been fighting due to their ideological differences instead of having this villain lurking in the background. I genuinely feel that it would have been much more fulfilling if it had focused on just the team and their internal struggles, which could have led to fruitful interaction and development of their personalities.Finally, I really disliked the whole 'he-killed-my-mom' thing with Tony, and the fact that Cap didn't bother telling him this incredibly important information that could have torn the team apart at a later date, as it did here. I understand that Cap was trying to convince himself that he was protecting Tony when he was just protecting himself, but it really bothered me. Despite the fact that Bucky is his best friend, I really don't think Cap would conceal such delicate information from his team-mates. It actually reminded me of him chastising Tony for doing exactly the same thing in AoU in relation to Ultron and his covert creation of the AI.That said, there were some things I really enjoyed. I loved the introductions of both Spidey (who gets the best quips, IMO) and Black Panther, and especially loved to see Ant-Man and his fanboying over meeting Captain America. Giant-Man's transformation made me beam with delight and the whole airport scene was exhilarating and felt like the event we were promised. I enjoyed the chemistry between Wanda and Vision and Sam and Bucky's bickering over absolutely everything. Plus, I was really satisfied with the tribute to Agent Carter and I loved the quips and subtle nuances of Friday. It feels nice to have an Irish voice among all the American ones.In the end, however, I wasn't overly-impressed with the results of this film. It was passable, really, and personally I feel it was on a par with Guardians. I'm still looking forward to seeing Doctor Strange and Ragnarok, but honestly, Civil War was not my cup of tea, and really not as good as First Avenger or Winter Soldier.Still, they can't all be great, right?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No, "Civil War" isn't the Best Marvel Movie Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When early word had it that Captain America: Civil War was the best film Marvel's done to date, I should have known better. I guess having the privilege to see big blockbusters in advance does make one want to overpraise them into oblivion, even if it's something like Batman v Superman. But don't worry. Civil War is at least better than that, but it's certainly not the best Marvel film to date. Far from it.I have so many thoughts regarding this film that it would be too much to write out in a review, so I'll boil it down to this: Marvel will be Marvel, and that's what kept Civil War from being great. Like most of their films, Civil War follows a certain formula that we've come to expect from Marvel flicks, and it doesn't stray away from that path. Its unwillingness to take risks is ultimately disappointing but not all that surprising. While the trailers for Civil War promised something dark, serious, and challenging, where lives and relationships between the characters we love are at stake, the film is anything but. In fact, Civil War has a surprising amount of humor, so much so that it severely undercuts the tension and central conflict between Iron Man and Captain America. Why call it a CIVIL WAR when there are one-liners and quips spoken every minute? Since when were Falcon and Bucky buddy-buddy towards each other? Their scenes, among many others, felt like something out of a freaking sitcom. Despite the many flaws BvS suffered from, the film at least had a consistent tone and the climactic battle itself felt significant and crucial to a point where someone could die.That's the biggest weakness of this film. Everything felt so trivial and inconsequential. Calling it a Civil War is an overstatement when the war itself never amounts to anything more than a bunch of kids fighting together on a playground. There are no real casualties in this film, despite the fact that the film tries so very hard to convince you otherwise. "You've caused so many civilian casualties!" our heroes are told, but just wait until the next scene when there are some jokes thrown in to lighten up the mood, because you know, talking about endangering lives and having security vs. freedom shouldn't be *too* serious a discussion. You can't have your cake and eat it too, Marvel, and that's exactly what Civil War wanted: to be sincere about the very real and relevant issues it's tackling but also make it fun and entertaining for the whole family to enjoy - because more $$$. Even during the climax when motivations and reveals come into play and you feel like someone could die, it ends in such a whimper that you feel what occurred won't have any meaningful effect in future films.And that's just it. Civil War is entertaining and watchable for what it is - and again, a whole lot better than BvS - but it could have been so much more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A mildly better 'Batman v. Superman'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We've come to it again. Marvel's yearly offering is here and they're all starting to blur. I am now ready to give the world my thoughts. And I am really going to be a nasty contrarian here... The long and short of it is that it maybe the most disappointing movie Marvel has ever made. Despite moments of brilliance it ends up being one of Marvel's worst offerings as a studio. If I had to pin it down on one thing it would be that it follows the formula to a tee and that with this Civil War story line with dramatic possibilities it has no stakes whatsoever.The Civil War fight isn't about ideas. None of our heroes take a fully fledged philosophical stand to fight for their beliefs. It is merely a fight about personal grudges and bad feelings brought to a large scale. The 'Civil War' plays as if we get the little humorous personality complexes from Whedon's first 'Avengers' brought to fist fights really. Only the faintest traces of the Patriot Act type commentary that the Civil War story line had in the comics are shown. In the end it all comes down to Tony wanting revenge for the death of his parents. And I am sorry but I am so tired of the "But he killed my mother!" It all but ruined the excellent 'X-Men; First Class' and it does the same here. It's the laziest of writing you can do in any story. Tony and Cap aren't really all that different in the end. Tony basically finds the conspiracy to destroy the Avengers and says "but you killed my mother!" When you watch these superhero movies am I the only one who gets bored when nobody gets hurt, wounded or maimed in the slightest? 'Civil War' suffers because it is about our heroes fighting each other and so neither side can suffer any casualties because they have to return for the sequel. Why should I care about anything that happens in this battle? And I realize that 'killing off' any of these characters would merely be temporary. And yet wouldn't it be so interesting to see how the characters and audience might react to such an ordeal if Steve or Tony were thought to be dead? As awful as 'Batman v. Superman' was it at least had more guts than this movie did in that it 'Killed off' Superman.We need something to show that this civil war mattered. We can't just have the status quo otherwise nothing about this mattered. Do they really expect me to believe that you couldn't kill off one of the B-list Avengers? Who's going to miss Wanda Maximoff? Or Hawkeye? Show that this thing had stakes. Tony and Cap are going to befriends again just like that.I really didn't care for it. (And here's another point of conversation. Spider-Man makes his latest appearance and also makes a groan worthy reference to that 'old movie Empire Strikes Back' (which **** you Disney for trying to shamelessly cross promote your stuff) And please what red-blooded American nerd hasn't seen 'Empire Strikes Back' fifty times? Disney has also trapped themselves badly. This line means that 'Star Wars' is a work of fiction in this universe. Which ultimately means that Marvel and 'Star Wars' cannot conceivably cross-over. So no Boba Fett as Starlord's father I'm afraid. (Then again how much credit does Disney really give you?))</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too many superheroes, too little action</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not going to write the plot since many commentators already did that beautifully. I am not a big fan of this genre but still I had enjoyed watching Spiderman or Batman in the past. This movie is a little bit overrated in my opinion. Too many superheroes, a little bit of drama about those heroes' guilty conscience for the innocent people who got killed because of their actions to save the world, and too little action. I was very bored towards the middle of the movie and wanted to get out of the theater if I wasn't there for my daughter. Even she started wiggling on her seat which is very unlikely if a movie was a gripping one. If you really like this genre, you may like it but surely it wasn't for my taste.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is this what you call war???</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>They were not kidding when they said this was a Captain America movie. Aside from the occasional pompous Tony Stark stealing the spotlight, every actor in this film had minimal screen time. Those that had descent amount of time in front of the camera where quite forgettable. This is one of the biggest downfalls of the franchise thus far. It might just be too much of a challenge to keep track of that many story lines and characters and there is also no denying how shallow the actual script in this film is. Not to mention the franchise has failed to really bring a memorable villain to this universe. The villain here, without going into too much details and spoilers, is some self righteous victim of the Avengers deadly carelessness out for revenge...really? As far as the actual story line it is as predictable as any other Marvel films in the past. I would find it surprising if anybody who watched the film saw something they weren't already anticipating. The "plot twists" were more like plot reroutes and were nothing unexpected. I was also yearning for a lot more depth in the dialouge and interactions between the characters, yet I was sorely disappointed when they chose to go with the long tedious action sequences instead. You would assume that the highlights of the film were the already mentioned confrontations between these super heroes yet, they leave a lot to be desired. At a certain point it almost becomes pointless to see these heroes relentlessly pounding on each other without any real consequences. We get they're nearly immortal with all of their abilities but at some point during the film you will feel guilty for demanding some actual blood to be shed. I almost feel that the main audience of the film were children and non comic book fans. Not that this is bad in any way but their material was not as transcendent as Guardians of the Galaxy, for example. My biggest problem with the film was with the one dimensional characters scattered throughout the two hours. None of whom really grasped my attention. We all knew what each characters motives were which pretty much took out all of the intrigue. We live in a time where we demand "gray characters", in a manner of speaking. We want flawed characters that seem more human....characters that we can truly relate too. A warning for you movie "critics", do no expect that from this film. Having said all that the film was descent and was watchable. There are moments when the film went with very realistic and mature themes such as, weather who should regulate the activities of such powerful beings....which was something to really ponder. There were also elements of the film that were intriguing such as the mass casualties of the Avengers excursions. Ultimately, however, the film fails to really make us believe there is an actual war going on between the Avengers. In the end it will seem like a minor disagreement which they will all scrapbook about and laugh of over a plate of shwarma. Perhaps I just had really high expectations which lead to my unpleasant disappointment. Or perhaps the standard for comic book films is lower than any other type of film. Whatever the case may be, the film is worth the viewing even with all of it's flaws.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>High ratings deluded us</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To start my review, I must say I'm not a big fan of Marvel and I'm not very familiar with the pre-sequels. I got into the cinema, with the feeling of both excitement and both I would rather see Mowgli feeling.Firstly, as this movie built up, all I felt was boredom. Conversations were OK, but I couldn't pay much attention to it, as it felt like I know the movie's ending already. The only part of the movie, that was interesting for me, and I could really pay attention to was the Airport's fighting scene. But then again, the constant stupid jokes ruined it. I couldn't understand why everyone else laughed at these very awkward, corny jokes, at the cinema expect us. The story was bad and mediocre, also the acting was mediocre too. We decided to watch it, in 3d, but it turned out to be a bad idea, as the fighting scene's very clipping and felt low in FPS. Overall, It felt like it will never end, and we felt constant boredom through the whole movie. It is a mediocre action movie, and I don't really understand the means of the high ratings. I wish we could have seen Mowgli's story instead of this trite action movie (,but some of us really wanted to see this, because of the high ratings).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nearly a complete departure from the conventional comic book superhero movie genre. Avengers 2.5 is a politically-charged superhero movie that will catch you off guard and provide you with a mostly non-cartoonish plot filled with well-developed conflict and character development. Witness some of your favorite Marvel superheroes secede from the Avengers and oppose those who they once fought side-by-side. Along the way, you also get to meet some new additions to the team that will provide some awkward comedic sequences in this otherwise serious movie. Deep dark secrets come to the surface that threaten the very possibility of the team ever having any hope of reunification. Captain America: Civil War is a brilliantly produced film that will have even those who typically do not care for most superhero films leaving the theatre satisfied and anticipating the next installment in the series. Although it is really an Avengers movie, there is still enough focus on the title character to support the choice of titles for this action-packed epic adventure.It isn't often that a genre typically filled with high concept, shallow plots can surprise you with a narrative radiating with anthropological and political themes and subtext. The brilliance of Captain America: Civil War is that it provides the audience with equal parts action-packed fight choreography and well-developed dramatic plot with prolific amounts of character conflict. Furthermore, the story will exceed your expectations of the ability to tap into one's superficial response to action-packed stimuli and activate the deeper emotions of allegiance, betrayal, and self-preservation. For those who have not seen the previous movies in the Captain America series? another admirable element of this installment, is not causing those who have yet to watch the previous CA movies to feel left out of the excitement. Provided you have seen the preceding Avengers movies, this one will keep you trekking along with your favorite Avengers universe characters. There are certainly minor elements or past relationships that are introduced in the previous CA movies, but most likely you will be able to pick up on the aforementioned as you watch Civil War.Another observation of this installment in the Captain America/Avengers franchises respectfully, is the movie's success in both including current characters and introducing new ones without the film ever feeling too crowded, as it was with Batman v Superman. In addition to the Avengers minus Hulk and Thor, the audience is introduced to an adolescent Spider-Man (Tom Holland) and are re- acquainted with Ant Man (Paul Rudd). As I am not familiar with the comics, I cannot comment on this Spider-Man in respect to staying true to the comic, but I found this incarnation of Spider-Man to be on the verge of annoying. Perhaps that is how he is suppose to be, but it did not fit in with how he has been historically portrayed in cartoons and movies. However, the inclusion of both the respective characters did not feel forced as it so easily could have. Since the film primarily focused on Captain America and secondly Iron Man, the large cast of characters was handled efficiently. The writers could include all these characters in one narrative, but shift the focus from character or character thus never overstimulating or overwhelming the audience with the development of such a dynamic ensemble cast.Ordinarily, I do not speak so highly of superhero movies; but this film left me feeling quite satisfied and pleased with how well the film played off as a serious movie complete with plenty of opportunity for emotional connections. That being said, the one sequence of the movie that I did not find as entertaining or fitting is the elaborate "civil war" battle on the tarmac. Was it choreographed well? Yes. Was it instrumental in moving the plot forward? Yes. Did it effectively fit in with the rest of the mood and pacing of the film? No. Moreover, that entire sequence of scenes just felt awkward. And, that is mostly due to the inclusion of the naivety and immaturity of Spider- Man and witty/sarcastic/near-juvenile antics of Ant Man. Perhaps if only one adolescent-like character had been added, that part of the film would not have felt so awkward. As to not give away the reasons for the solemn mood of the film, I cannot go into much detail; but, the manner which this scene was written and directed just felt out of place and interrupted the otherwise excellent pacing and mood of the story. I agree that most serious movies need comedic relief in order to generate an emotional roller-coaster, but this was just a little too funny with respect to the rest of the film.The summer blockbuster season is officially underway with the undoubtedly successful opening weekend of Captain America: Civil War aka Avengers 2.5. Unlike last year's Avengers: Age of Ultron, this installment will take you on fantastic journey of emotional mountains and valleys of character and plot development. This film proves that a superhero movie can be both fantastically action-packed and dramatic. The political subtext will also provide friends and family countless hours of discussion and analysis. Although this is not an adult superhero movie in the way Deadpool was, there is still language and violence that may not be appropriate for young kids. Still, one of the earmarks of a summer blockbuster is a movie that can attract and please both teens and adults, and this is definitely a great example. Hopefully, this movie is an indicator of an exhilarating summer season at the cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'm not that impressed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To be honest I expected more, but Marvel does what Marvel does. Before going to cinema I read lots of reviews that the movie is awesome, that it's far better than BvS, because here you can finally see a great Super-hero versus clash unlike BvS and so on. But in fact I didn't see anything that great. Sure, the movie was fine, but it was nothing more compared to the rest of the Marvel products. They just continue the trend. Nothing new, nothing extraordinary. The scenario is not that great, it's kinda predictable, it has flaws, the fightings are in the typical unrealistic Marvel style, the CGI is crappy at some points, etc etc. Don't get me wrong. The movie is good, but I'm pointing some of the flaws, similar flaws that have been pointed for the BvS movie, but here no one dares to criticise. Before calling me a DC fanboy I'd say that I'm trying to be objective here - the movie is not perfect, in fact it's not even great, because there's nothing that can impress you unless you're 14-16 years old. Sure, it might entertain you a bit, but it won't impress you, definitely.My score is 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me just start by saying I love Superheroes but have never been a big fan of Captain America - He is too much of a clean cut, charisma devoid, goody too shoes IMO. That said, I enjoyed the first Cap Film and both Avengers movies. I even praised the second Captain America film because, despite a couple of things it was a good film with lots of action and some awesome visual sequences.What spoiled it for me is exactly what spoiled Civil War too. The Winter Soldier himself. I accept the second movie was centered around him (hence The title) But, Captain America's unwavering efforts to rescue and re-establish his friendship with his psychotic, murderous ex-friend (despite the many deaths caused by him) was sickeningly repetitive and boring.Fast forward to Civil War, which I was really looking forward to (new characters joining the fray - wahoo) only to suffer the same fate again; seeing an otherwise great movie spoiled because it revolves around the winter soldier....again. Urrggghh! I mean: the Winter Soldier has even less personality than Captain America and that is truly an underwhelming experience to endure.After watching a superhero movie, I am usually excited, happy and hyped. After Captain America: Civil War I was quite angry, simply because I knew it could have been so much better!</fullReview>

It's smart, well written, shot flawlessly with the best action imaginable, has superb performances, top notch effects and plot twists and turns that keep a viewer guessing and on the edge of the seat.From great character definition to well orchestrated action to funny lines to moving emotional scenes to true conspiracy and thrills to the powerful structure of the film, this is one superbly written film.THE best movie of the year because it remembers what the cinema is for... SMART ENTERTAINMENT. It never wants to insult intelligence like other big budget movies usually do (and some have already done so this very year). Civil War is smart but fun and thrilling. THAT is what the cinema is for and to quote the first film? "Let's hear it for Captain America!"</fullReview>

In my opinion that does not suit the character as I know him.They should also had fleshed out more what the governments are trying to do with "supers".Oh and why change Ant-Man's helmet?!Other than that the film was great! Best Spider-Man to date, made me laugh very hard several times. This is the Spider-Man I know from the comics! Black Panther looks bad ass and looks bad ass.Great fight scenes of course.

		<shortDescription>The Mad Max: Fury Road Of Superhero Movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>READ AT YOUR OWN RISK. The Russo Brothers may not get an Oscar-Nomimation for their direction in Civil War but this is one heck of a brilliant superhero movie. On that that note alone it's safe to say, Civil War is the Mad Max Fury Road of superhero comic-book movies. Where to begin. Civil War takes place a year or so after AGE OF ULTRON. Just like in the beginning of A.O.U., the Avengers (Captain America's Team; Steve Rogers/Cap, Romanoff/Black Widow, Sam Wilson/Falcon, and Wanda/Scarlet Witch) embarks on mission to Largos to stop a "villain" called CROSSBONE aka Brock Rumlow from stealing a biological weapon. Upon losing the Weapon to the Avengers, Crossbone (engaged in a fight with Captain America) reveals a detonator to detonate himself and anyone around him, including his current opponent, Cap. Wanda sees this and uses her powers to contain the bomb as it exploded. Unable to control her power she accidentally launched the bomb onto a building killing Crossbone and a number civilians (which we later learned to be first-aid workers from Wakanda providing Relief-Support)This incident sets up the movie and opens up the discussion about the dangers of unsupervised Super-humans. With intense distrust for the Avengers, the United Nations set out to pass the Sokovia Accords; a law that allows the U.N. to sanctioned and regulate people with superhuman abilities. The Avengers are then divided in two groups with Tony Stark/Iron leading one side of the issue and Cap on the other. Tony Starks, who might be hanging on the promise he made to Pepper Potts in IRON MAN 3 (to destroy all the armor-suits), is for the accord as he felt responsible for what happened at Sokovia since he was the one that created Ultron. Rogers, on the other hand, is against the Accord; believing that becoming a government property take away their rights as people--and deserves right to choose. At the Summit in Vienna (to pass the Sokovia Accords) we meet T'Challa/Black Panther, also in attendance is Romanoff. A Bomb exploded at the Summit Building killing T'Challa's father. But things spiced up when Bucky is shown to the Bomber of the building at Vienna and allegedly responsible for the death of T'challa's father and others. Cap, who believes Bucky is innocent and has changed since the event of Winter Soldier, (saving Cap in from drowning) travels to Bucharest where Bucky's hiding to seek out his testimony and to warn him that a Task Force Unit is coming after him. Which leads to one of the many entertaining action sequences in CIVIL WAR which involved Cap, Bucky, Falcon and introduction of the Black Panther in action. And once the action starts you wished it never stops. It's that good, so good that it even make some interesting part of the story so dull in comparison. It's obvious that Bucky is been framed and someone (Baron Zemo) is behindall of this and a PLOT to divide and conquer the Avengers-forcing them to pay for their mistakes. And the thing is no matter how much you think you know about the plot--it still ended up surprises you, even shock if you will. Cap, Falcon, Bucky and Black Panther are captured by the police and brought to the base. Bucky is then experimented on by Baron Zemo, who uses some "trigger words" which makes Bucky go nuts, struggling with his some PTSD-EFFECT which goes to back 1991, when he was by created HYDRA. Cap eventually stops Bucky. Cap and Falcon interrogates Bucky and he tells them that Zemo is responsible for him going berserk. Feeling that Bucky might be withholding more informatio, Falcon recruits Scott Lang/Ant-man to get the job done to Cap's dismay. We later learn that Bucky wasn't the only "winter soldier" and Zemo is heading to Moscow to unfreeze the others.With Bucky still, both a threat and a fugitive-at-large protected by Team Cap, Tony convinces Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross to assemble a team of his own to bring Bucky in, which includes a really good Tom Holland as Spiderman; other members are Rhodes/War Machine, Vision, Black Widow, and of course black Panther, in probably the best scene you've ever see in a Superhero or an Action movie, say, of the past twenty-years, or even ever, when the Avengers square off in the Airport "Melee". Though it's strange to see the Avengers going against one another, you immediately forgave the plot, as soon as you're drawn in every bit of the action. It is a fun roller-coaster ride, filled with comedic moments with a handful of dramatic tension, and LOTS OF FUN. This is one for the ages. This scene alone is worth the price admission. NOTE: We even get to learn that even if the Avengers and their powers are regulated by a governing body --that accidents are still inevitable. It's the nature of being a superhuman with super-abilities. Controlling one power is part of becoming an identity of self and how and why it is use should be a choice of that individual. And even if you thought Civil War couldn't get any better following the "Airport Fight", it capped it all of with a final battle that has all the ramification of themes that ranged from family, friendship, brotherhood, love, lost and more. Is this a great movie? Time will tell. But it's a great one for the genre, and the Russo Brothers are the best to accomplish such feat since Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy (Batman Begins being my favorite of the three.) CAPTAIN America could be the MCU's Best Trilogy/Anthology yet.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Captain America:Civil War its just another success by the Russo Brothers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ater so many movies from the Marvel franchise, Civil War was one of many films that every fan was expecting to watch, and finally its here, but the question is....Captain America:Civil War its good? No. Captain America:Civil War its great!This movie its great, its a perfect example of how a Superhero movie should be, its funny but at the same time, emotional and intense with a good story.I'm not going to spoil anything so i'll be quick(...as possible)The introduction of characters like Black Panther its great, the characters are great,everyone have scenes where are show interesting and i never felt boring at all,that's because everyone have something to do in this movie( or at least most of the characters) or have an arc,specially Steve and Bucky. Almost every performance in this movie its good but the best for me its RDJ, i never saw so much emotions of Tony in just one movie and this isn't an Iron-Man movie.The story is good, Zemo is fine, i have some relative problems with him but his plan its great and at least makes sense. The soundtrack its good and the choreography its great, better than The Winter Soldier in my opinion.Even if its great, its not a perfect movie, it has some problems, Spider-Man is awesome but the use of Spider-Man was forced,almost every joke its great in this film, but suddenly there are more serious or mature scenes and then those scenes are interrupted by a joke scene, even in the War scene, and in some scenes that doesn't fit in the movie, other minor concerns are those annoying white text of the location or the final fight. But overall its a great movie and one of the best marvel movies if not the best, highly recommended if you want to watch something entertaining and very well done.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great story, amazing action, beautiful character design, but a bit rushed out</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story in this movie is great, it has great motives and it made audiences question which side is right. It is darker than previous marvel movies and has a more serious topic since it's about politics, human experimenting, terrorism, and the causes of the destruction caused by The Avengers.The characters are so well written, they all have their motives except a few characters that i will talk about later. Captain having to decide whether he should help his friend Bucky and break the law or to support the government act to control the action of The Avengers. While Tony, trying to do what's right for him after seeing the aftermath of all the battle The Avengers fought before. And of course, the best part of the movie that is, the action. The action in this movie is phenomenal. It has the same style with the one in Winter Soldier, which we all love very much. But now, we had tons of other superheroes involves. And how they introduce and design Black Panther is amazing. But with Spider-Man.. Well i really liked the actor as Peter Parker. He got the witty nerd act going on. But once he jumped to the Spider-Man suit, well he never did actually since Spider-Man is just pure CGI, a bad CGI. And how they put Spider-Man in the movie is so rushed out. The character's involvement in the plot itself aren't even significant. It went the same with Ant-Man. They could honestly left them out from the film and it wouldn't make a difference, well beside that one awesome fight scene will be less epic. But in a serious movie with these deep characters, the two characters felt really out of place with their over the top sense of humor. I really wished they were introduced slower so we get to see the character developed more. The other thing about the movie I didn't like, is that the first half of the movie is very serious, emotional, and political but then BOOM action orgasm comes in. The action scene is awesome though, I loved them. But they shouldn't be very straight forward about it. They really just slapped it in the audience face. And how the plot progressed slow then suddenly every superhero on the earth start hitting each other up and blowing stuff up. But excluding all that, the ending was awesome and very emotional. It's certainly is better than the rest of the superhero movies that has came out this year and I even think it will be better than the rest to come (X-men, Suicide Squad, and Dr Strange). Definitely my top 5 marvel movie.WATCH IT NOW!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best super Hero Movie This year?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>is to fast to said that is the best movie there are 4 movies that did not come out yet, but is very correct to said that this is the best marvel movie to the date, it mix all the drama, action, and fun in a perfect way, sadly marvel still can't figure out what to do with the villains of their movies, but i think it was necessary, to give more importance to the story between Cap and Iron man, unexpected twists, and the principal plot to drop tears, anyway for me this was close to perfection, with a few exaggerated things in the action but overshadowed by the awesome direction and storytelling of the Russo Brothers, there are some times that the shaky cam takes you out but it was very little, so for me awesome movie, awesome acting, great effects, spider-man is the best to the date, Black panther (T'chala) perfect match to all the bright avengers, is a must see movie, you can 't miss it in theaters. AWESOME!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Immature. This movie is for the kids.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just look at the Poster pic of Civil War. LOL "Winter Soldier" should have got a 95% and this should have been below 50%.Spider-man talks too much, not in a good way like Deadpool. This movie is not for adults. I saw this with my boyfriend. We were annoyed. How can people ignore the constant one liners:"You have the right to remain silent!" Spider-man screams as he fights Falcon in the air."Sorry cap this won't kill you, but it won't tickle either.""Sorry you guys I got one job here, and I gotta impress Mr. Stark so I am really sorry.""Alright now I am "p-word" off now."Every character that was about to make a move in a fight, a one liner came up. NO ONE SHUTS UP and takes the fights seriously. Humor was dry and cheesy. Especially the kiddie one-liners that were all over the place. Batman V Superman and X-Men Apocalypse avoided too much comedic talk. Civil War was worse than last Avengers movie.And the scene where they are uniformly walking side by side with their teams towards the opposing team...Look at the profile pic of Civil War....choreographed like a Michael Jackson Zombie music video or John Travolta with his gang in Grease, or a dance off. At that point I wanted to leave.Fights looked controlled, choreographed and interrupted with camera cuts every 20 seconds. No one stood out except for Spider-Man and not in a good way. Samples of there fight styles are in the last 5 films. Nothing new. And most fight scenes and chases where done badly with CG.Another thing, you know everyone is going to be O.K. expect for the bad guy. I am not worried for any of them because if someone strikes, it is either blocked, reverted to a stronger comeback strike, or they survive the blow. Like I said the same thing in past five films. Fights are perfect, too pretty. And you know everyone is going to recover. And Captain America does not die, no main characters die except for civilians and other soldiers. There are no mysteries.Don't understand why this got a 90%. All the other films where better than this. This should have got a 50%. Really bad. No solid acting either. Jennifer Lawrence's acting on X-MEN APOCALYPSE and all other X-MEN films is way better that the cast in CIVIL WAR, way better than Scarlett Johansson. With that being said I look forward to Thor movie. Director did a great job with the comedy and directing in "What We do in the Shadows." I am sure will get a great comic action movie with some tasteful humor.If you liked Winter Soldier or Deadpool, then this movie is not for you. Too immature, its for the kids.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The first film I walked out of..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I kinda liked MCU when it was in the phase of Iron Man - Avengers 1. Those were just good films with somewhat decent humour and sick new fighting scenes, all caked up with stunning visuals and, of course, superb acting (as in, RDJ, Mark Ruffalo and Sam Jakcson ONLY!, others were just watchable). Those films were truly good, I enjoyed them for what the were, mostly because of the fact that they didn't take themselves very seriously (note: does not mean they were dumb). That is until recently, when thing got fuc*ed up royally..MCU is just not meant to be serious. Stick to what you are good at: fun family film - making with gloriously dumb one-liners. Let all the seriousness and darkness of the real world to the Zack Snyder's et al. DCEU vision. BvS, for all the hate and so- called, the worst plot- holes and editing bashing it received, in my eyes, handled its very idea - being dark (thus realistic) reflection of the Real world - very, very satisfyingly. It is not the best comic-book film, no (Justice League is meant to be that :D), but out of the CW and Batman v Superman, I must go with Dawn of Justice. That film is simply superior to Civil War in any aspect, especially fight scenes (airport - ehm - "fighting" was really a downer for me).Finally, I do not think that the title Civil War is appropriate, when the highest number of assailants appearing on the screen in the same time is...12 or something. That-Is-Not-A-War, let alone civil.And, yeah,..I will forever remember this film, for it made me leave my IMAX seat and walk out of a screening for the very first time in my life. If it is of an interest to you, I decided to pack my things right after the utterly shitty airport drunk brawl.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>definitely not the best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know critics have loved the film but there's really not a lot of same going on in the fans review basis. After all I am really disappointed. After so much praise it was really not good to see that the movie is not even half as great as the critics say. There are huge plot holes that are never solved. And we never really get to know more of Black Panther. And also a weird thing: Black Widow lets Cap and the winter soldier escape and both government nor Tony nor the whole other Avengers working for the government including BLACK PANTHER gives athing. I mean cap is their sort of enemy and they don't even care about she just let the two escape. Plus there's really not a lot of new in the ending. So cap and his friends are in safe asylum in which they are welcomed by Black Panther who simply follows the orders of Iron Man who now is still secretly working together with cap.And by the time avengers 3 comes around there's really not a big problem with the main villain reveal, now is it? That kind of plot holes are really not a lot of " oh can ignore that". Marvel really has got to come out with something new and also deliver endings that really change their universe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Word I Could Use to Describe this Movie is Idiotic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Captain America: Civil War follows the Avengers after the events of Age of Ultron. The government wants to control the Avengers because people die whenever they save the world, so they want to be able to try to limit that. Steve Rogers doesn't want to be controlled, but Tony Stark thinks that they should, and so everyone picks a side they start fighting over it. I'll start with what I liked about this movie. The fights were a big improvement over those in The Winter Soldier, which I found to be incredibly fake and boring. In one particular fight I liked what they did with Ant-Man's powers, and Iron Man's new suit looks pretty cool. Now what didn't I like about this movie? Oh, where to start. The characters, I guess. They're terrible. It's not that they aren't well developed (although they aren't), but they're all just incredibly stupid. They weren't dumb in the previous movies most of the time, but it was as if between movies everyone except Steve Rogers developed some mental disability. In the first fifteen minutes a character contains a bomb, then un-contains it and throws it at a building, killing a few people inside. Then she cries about it and everyone tells her that it wasn't her fault and she shouldn't worry. What? That could have easily been avoided if she simply didn't do anything else. Apparently she was even too stupid to not do anything. This is only one example of this, however. The whole movie is just fueled by idiots, and the plot only works because of said idiots. Whenever the Avengers save the world a few people might die instead of, you know, seven billion. Which would you prefer? Seriously, no one in this movie thinks anything over. No one ever points out that they'd rather have a couple people die over the entire human race, either. So are we just supposed to act like this idea doesn't exist? Or is every character actually retarded? I was kind of excited for the new Spider-Man, everyone seems to like him a lot so far. Why, I don't know. Tom Holland plays easily the worst Spider-Man I've ever seen. Sure, his suit is pretty cool, but him as a character? Stupidly annoying. He won't shut his mouth. And it's not like he's saying anything funny or clever, he's just being a waste of space for the sake of being a waste of space. He doesn't capture the funny side of Peter Parker, and he doesn't capture the geeky side of him either. He references Star Wars, and maybe some people think that's geeky, but that's about it. Now I don't really care about the source material for movies, but everyone says that he does these things when he really doesn't. I just thought he was obnoxious. And his character didn't even need to exist. Without him the movie would have been the exact same, only Tony Stark's team would briefly have had five people while Steve Rogers had six. "We need to make it fair, so let's force in a character simply for the sake of getting people excited for another pointless solo movie!" quote Marvel. Yeah, great idea. I liked Black Panther better. As in I liked his costume and the way he fought. His character was about as flat as everyone else. At least he had a believable and more interesting reason for being where he was. His introduction was a lot better than Spider-Man's, who was pretty forced. By the time the parking lot fight scene ended I was done. But there was still forty-five minutes left, and they weren't fun or enjoyable at all. The forced conflict with the 'villain' wrapped up, and that was that. Now let's talk about the 'villain'. I put that in quotations because he doesn't do anything really. All the characters act like he's a big deal (and so does he), but he doesn't actually do anything. He gets unimportant characters who normally wouldn't have been involved involved in the fight, and that's it. You'd think his motivation would be deeper or bigger than it is in the end, but it isn't. Finally, when I reached the after-credits scene I was pretty disappointed. Not because the scene was lame (although it was) but because it had to do with the actual plot instead of just being a tease at the next movie, which is what these scenes are supposed to be considering the fact that not everyone sits around for the after credits scenes or even knows they exist. You wouldn't put the climax of a movie in the after credits scene right? So why put plot in it?Overall Captain America: Civil War is idiotic. The characters are so indescribably stupid, the plot itself is stupid and relies stupid characters, Spider-Man is annoying and pointless, Black Panther is okay, and the 'villain' is just an excuse to make it a longer movie like Batman v. Superman, the other superhero versus superhero movie that came out this year. Don't listen to this review if you don't want to. If you love Marvel you'll love the crap out of this movie because you people eat this garbage up. But if you're like me and able to see flaw in stuff you like then hopefully you at least see where I'm coming from with this. And in the end there is not a shred of any part of me that would recommend this movie. I would if it were shorter (because it's the new big thing and you should see it to form your own opinion), but two and half hours were stolen from me, hours that I could have used to watch something that would have sucked less, so don't watch this movie if you think these things that I have mentioned will bother you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>People want heroes, not laughing stocks. This movie delivers the latter.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A bunch of cartoon characters making a lot a noise and fuss for reasons that remain a mystery. There's a lot of fighting and mayhem, along with the usual dose of high-tech special effects. The problem is that the story is so shallow as to render it almost nonexistent. Good guys fighting good guys for reasons that are so contrived that even for comic-book characters it simply is not enough to justify all the mayhem. Would be like the Lone Ranger fighting Tonto over politics. Who cares? The formula just does not work. Plus, the movie has a lot of silly dialog, which provoked unintended laughter. There is little attempt at character development. Soon it becomes apparent that there are no good guys or bad guys, just a bunch of guys flexing their high-tech muscles. The use of flashbacks just adds to the confusion. The Spiderman character is incredibly mushy, even for a comic book story. The only character that has some depth is Iron Man, played by Robert Downey Jr. It seems that much of the plot centers around him. But he does not carry the story. The movie failed to engage the audience's attention. Even a story based on comic book characters has to have some dramatic content. Otherwise, as in the case of this movie, the entire story becomes stagy, shallow and noisy. Noise is no substitute for drama. The audience wants characters they can care about, not laugh at. Listen Hollywood: people want heroes, not laughing stocks. Have Captain America fighting Nazis, not his friends. Have Tony Stark save people in distress. Have the beautiful Black Widow show the world that she is great. Have these super heroes do superb things that win them real acclaim. If it wants to, Hollywood can write those kinds of stories.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marvel are on a roll.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Captain America Civil War is the thirteenth film of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It is directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, with a screenplay by Christopher Markus &amp; Stephen McFeely. In Captain America: Civil War, disagreement over international oversight of the Avengers fractures them into opposing factions - one led by Steve Rogers and the other by Tony Stark. Civil War is definitely one of the best Marvel movies to date, and absolutely on par with The Winter Soldier which was also great. They are both on top in the Marvel Cinematic Movies ranking of mine so far. The conflict between these well beloved characters is done in a brilliant and fantastic way by the amazing Russo brothers who took the cheese out of the first Captain America movie , made one serious and great second movie, and build upon them both with the third outing. Everyone does a great job here, Chris Evans has made Captain America his own same as Robert Downey Jr for Iron Man. It features a very big ensemble cast and not one of them is anything less than great on the role. The fight scenes are also some of the best ever made in a comic book movie, even better than in The Winter Soldier. Especially the airport scene is just mesmerizing and totally stands out from everything else that's going on. Spider-Man is also unbelievably well done and Tom Holland is just fantastic. I am one of the few people who actually loved The Amazing Spider Man movies, and really got mad to hear that they are going to reboot the character again but I can see now that it was worth it. The visuals are great from beginning to end, the music is also good as usual. The villain is something that most people though it was the weakest point but I strongly disagree with that. He had reasoning as to why he is doing those things, and he pushes the other characters in new directions which is also necessary. I generally adored this movie, and even though I am a DC fan, there's just no denying that Marvel knows what they're doing and that is why they are much more successful right now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Superheroes pitted against each other in a quest for righteousness this seems to be the trend this year. First it was superman versus batman and now its captain America . The movie starts from where captain America 'The Winter Soldier left'.This guy is actually responsible for Iron Man's parents death. Never mind the half baked story and the logic. And then there is the secretary of state baying for the avengers blood that they come strictly under the purview of the state for causing mindless loss of lives and property during their heroic quests.Mindless no doubt. Roped in is some sovokian guy who wants to eliminate the avengers by deliberately causing confusions amongst the avengers because his family was accidentally killed by them. and suddenly we have two avengers groups; the upright headed by Captain America and the politically correct headed by the Iron man.More surprises,the group manages to rope in The teenage spiderman and the Ant man, The picture becomes clear now. Superheroes against superheroes. What follows is some cortex splitting but riveting action. but in the end all this doesn't make sense and so does the huge expenses that must have gone into the making of this sequel. All in all confusions galore. Right from the director to the audience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Getting tired with superhero movies.......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know about you but i'm starting to get tired with so many superhero films they release almost each month.I don't know why marvel have so much success with those films but for me it's time to withdraw from those kind of films especially the superhero vs superhero films like avengers and this captain America film.in those kind of films we most experience video games cgi effects as a superhero fights another superhero.......feeble minded boy stuff.At least solo superhero films are more serious than the S.H vs films.as for this movie it was not bad at all...it had fights...plot...action but like i said we get too much of these movies lately AND IT'S KINDA BORING.I think as long as those films will be in fashion we will always get new ones plus TV series.next similar film in line to be released is the new X-MEN film and a dozen more were announced including characters like DR. STRANGE who are not well known to the public.don't know bout you.........but for me it's getting boring.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After watching the trailers for this film I had high hopes going into the cinema, I thought the previous Cap film was pretty good so I was not going to miss this one....well I wish I did.Here's my quick summary:Story line was not good, almost felt like the writers couldn't come up with anything substantial.New characters felt to one dimensional especially Black Panther's character. Spiderman! sorry to say but was a bit too annoying for my liking, should have webbed his own mouth.the villain was so boring I was expecting someone far more intriguing. A total letdown when he confessed what his motive was. Some action scenes were a bit absurd like outrunning cars on a highway or jumping off 3 story buildings, felt too cartoonist at times.All in all just another average action adventure, I think Ill wait for the DVD next time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not to sound too political, but the MCU is destroying itself like the Republicans have been the same year this is released. More and more talking, arguing, internal fighting and less and less action seem to be the trademark of both the MCU and the RNC as of late. I know I am just guessing here, but this movie felt like it was 80% talk and a few sprinkled action scenes to remind us we were watching a superhero movie. Worse, it was repetitive talk. Over and over the same argument about signing an agreement so the Avengers can be micromanaged. Sorta sounds like the entire Fifty Shades of Gray movie. Luckily, this was better than that trash.In Civil War's defense, the minute action scenes were enjoyable, though nothing groundbreaking. The comedy was hilarious ? thanks, Robert Downey Jr. and Scarlett Johansson for being spot on. And the movie was well shot. No problems with the filming. Just had so many problems with the endless talking. Gosh, it felt like such a bummer to just hear and see great characters just stand around and debate all the time. It didn't help the movie went on and on and on? spoiler: the title war scene takes place 45 minutes or so before the film ends, so there's so much more to endure to get to the end.Basically, 2016 seems to be the year where the good comic book characters fight themselves. This isn't just a trend; EVERYONE is doing it. Let's see: Deadpool vs. X-Men. Batman vs. Superman. Half the Avengers vs. the other half. And upcoming: Storm (at least) vs. X-men. At least the Suicide Squad members are bad to begin with?In this third incarnation of that already tired plot, Tony Stark gets confronted by a mother of one of the collateral damage, agrees with the idiot General Ross of Hulk fame and convinces half the Avengers to become babysat. Meanwhile, the other half disagrees and it mostly stems from a story of an old friendship no one really cares about. Fight, talk, talk, talk, fight, talk, fight?yeah, this is sounding political. Two new characters are introduced and let me tell you: they are AWESOME. Spider-Boy (I can't simply refer to someone who looks 12 as a man yet) and Black Panther. I would actually recommend this movie on those two characters alone, if it didn't take so dang long to get to them and then they only play second ? or third ? fiddle to all the rest. Here's to hoping they get their own movies soon?love to just see them, even if in a double-billed adventure.But, even then, Spidey, himself, accounts for part of the script problems. He felt so forced into this script and the timeframe to recruit him to one-half of the "civil war" doesn't make any sense. Tony is given 36 hours to find Captain America for, I guess questioning and he wastes more than a day of travelling on the chance the preteen will join them with virtually no training. (Doesn't matter, he seemed to learn all he needed to on the flight back to the war.)I digress. Luckily, it contains enough good to warrant the average rating but not enough to see it a second time. Okay, in truth, I might watch it again. Probably years from now when I do another MCU marathon or if my Dad wants to see it for Father's Day. But, it's not going to be one I will desire to see again knowing I have to spend 80% of 2? hours with non-action/action characters plainly talking too much.***Final thoughts: Couple of spoilers here, so fair warning. Despite the evidence needed to prove one side was right and the other clearly wrong, the movie has no conclusion. You will spend 2? hours in a film like one of those split end-series films that they broke up into two parts, such as: Harry Potter 7a and 7b, Twilight 4a and 4b or Hunger Games 3a and 3b. (I haven't seen any of the Divergent series, but I'm told they did the same.) I'm sure a Band-Aid will be placed so they can re-assemble for the Avengers 3a and 3b?damnit, they're doing it again! Anyways, it just drops off and sadly, that was very unsatisfying, especially since they already told us what's coming.Additionally, I'm told there's yet another two post-credit scenes. I am NOT a fan of these as I am usually ready to jump ship after 2? hours once the real movie ends. I did stay for the first of two since it was just a couple of minutes following the "end" of the movie. I just didn't have the patience to sit through another 10 minutes of credits to see another 30 or less seconds. I'll just watch it online once available, which should be soon. Even if it's not, someone can just tell me what happens. I'm really not that interested thanks to their cheap trick they keep doing over and over. It's getting old.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No spoilers here.I thought this was so much better than Batman vs Superman. The storyline was clean-cut, and it was weaved well to introduce the new superhero characters that were not part of the Avengers. Captain America and Iron Man did a great job as being on opposite teams and also in recruiting more members into the Avenger universe. The fight scenes were well executed and I like how the stuns work between all the superhero interaction.Now, like any other Marvel movie, there's always a scene after the screen credits roll, so watch for that as always.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Holy Plot Holes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved the movie when I first saw it. And went to see it again, when I noticed something that just ruined the movie for me.Where was Vision at the beginning of the movie? It's not like he had a personal life or something more important to do. All Vision really has is being an Avenger, and when the Avengers are on a mission to prevent a terrorist from gaining access to a chemical weapon, shouldn't it be ALL HANDS ON DECK? But nope, no Vision. And you know why? If Vision had been there he would have clocked that bomb vest from the get go and he would have gotten Crossbones far from civilians. No casualties at all. Which means no movie. This ENTIRE movie relied on the massive plot hole required at the start of the movie. You fill in that plot hole by having Vision present at the beginning, and the rest of the movie just falls apart. So even though I liked aspects of the movie, I can't call it a good movie or give it a good score when the movie can't function without plot holes.There's another plot hole the movie needed to make it work. All of the Avengers forgot about to mention to Ross that they saved New York from a nuke launched by the US GOVERNMENT. They also refused to speak up and point out that had they done nothing in the other instances he whined about, there would be no humans on Earth because Ultron would have KILLED THEM ALL.And suddenly there were mass casualties in Sokovia? Really? Because I remember Age of Ultron made a point of showing the Avengers getting all of the civilians onto the hellicarrier. Now, for the sake of this movie's plot to make the Avengers look dangerous, they suddenly had a lot of dead civilians to blame on the Avengers. PLOT HOLE.And here comes the second biggest plot hole of the movie. How did Zemo know Tony was just going to suddenly figure out Cap had been right the whole time and how did he know that Tony would show up in Russia to aide Steve, giving Zemo the chance to show the camera footage of Bucky killing Tony's parents to further cement the rift in their friendship? And I also love how convenient it was that there just so happened to be a security camera right there in such a perfect spot to catch the alleged expert assassin Winter Soldier (didn't pop the camera before you walked in front of it?) as he killed Tony's parents. He even made a point to pose in front of the camera, looking right into it like everyone watching was supposed to freak out and squeal with delight and shock. I mean, I thought Bucky was going to hold up a sign at the camera that said, "Check it out Tony, I totally killed your parents and hopefully Steve doesn't keep that knowledge from you because that'd be totes awkward at the Avengers hang out, amirite?"I loved Spider-man in it. Well, not his completely CGI costume. But character wise he was just like the comics.The action was great. So 1 star for action, 1 star for Spider-man. 8 stars off for the movie not being able to function without the massive plot holes.I love how so-called "Professional Critics" have looked over all of these plot holes. I also love how many comic fanboys ignore them as well. It's like, 'Let's pick apart anything made by DC while celebrating Marvel for the same things we claim to hate DC movies for and let's write off X-men because it's totes not fair they won't let Marvel Studios have those characters back for their plot hole, McGuffin riddled movies.This movie has a high score on Rotten Tomatoes and IMDb. And it just shows that when people say they hate plot holes, it just means as long as it's not a Marvel Movie will they hate plot holes. All of the plot holes people have whined about in Batman v. Superman are all either not plot holes or just nitpicking. Like the "Why are their Moms both SUDDENLY named Martha? It's like, sure they've had those names in the comics for decades and were named by different writers, but we need something to complain about!!!"Marvel Studios suck nowadays. They all need McGuffins (Bucky was this film's McGuffin), they all follow the same exact formula, there are always plot holes needed to make these movies work to keep the shared universe working. I know some people will read this and want my head on a pike. But if it's okay to criticize one studios movies, then it's fair to do the same to Marvel. Especially when everyone is just being willfully blind to this so-called "Perfect" movie's problems.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A really well put together movie, on par with quality we expect of Marvel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie does everything right. All the things that BvS struggled with are handled beautifully here.The movie takes the time to develop all of the many characters in this series and introduce new characters. Two previously known additions to Avengers namely, Spiderman and Antman, and a brand new badass character, Black Panther, who proves once and for all that you can intro a new character without a damn origin story and have them play just fine.Every character gets screen time to develop an opinion on the issue that divides the ranks of the Avengers. Their conclusions feel natural to the character's experiences and therefore their motivations feel genuine. As such we are easily able to associate with characters on both sides. When the fights happen it's hard to know who to root for, you feel like you are watching your friends have a falling out. Even when you pick a side on the issue itself from your own perspective, you feel like the characters on the other side reached the "wrong" decision based on logic that makes sense to them.The characters on screen also act the same way. They love the avengers that oppose them, but they see no way out. They try to pull their punches, but eventually things escalate. This is brilliant, and makes you as the viewer much more invested in the fighting.The movie manages to get the pacing right also, the entire thing feels like it's 40 minutes long. When it was over I couldn't believe that all that time flew by.In conclusion this was an extremely enjoyable action movie. All the fights and effects are extremely well done and very exciting as we've come to expect from Marvell in recent years. But most importantly you care for the fights because the characters are likable and well developed, this lets you get invested in the universe and the conflict that it presents. Really well done.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well well well , Marvel have done it again ! What an amazing movie that was. excellently Written movie , from the start to the end this movie was so brilliant. Weeks before this movie was released I was wondering how they would fit every characters role on screen but I was excelled at how good it was. Each character had an perfect amount of screen time. The movie was very well paced so it kept me extremely interested throughout the whole movie. Also the story line was brilliantly produced that I could not have imagined. Chadwick Boseman and Tom Holland played Black Panther and Spiderman beautifully which was a relief. All in all Captain America Civil War Was a great movie and broke a lot of expectations ! Can't wait for the rest of the marvel movies :) !!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well-packed action movie (minor spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm neither the Marvel, nor DC fans, but I find this film awesome.The story has a consistent quiet fast pace. It's a simply non-stop thrill ride and you won't be bored for a second because they're gonna fill every minute with an entertainment, story and an action scene. The story are unexpectedly good. It's not about good and evil, it's about clash of a different ideology of reaching goal. Smooth twist at the near end of the film.The best part when it comes to the battle. Nothing much to say when it was nearly perfect. Love it how they choreographed. Love it when they fight each other with they specialty. Honestly it's more than I expected.But well, nothing is perfect. The villain didn't worked so well. And also the 'war' in the airport scene doesn't feel like a war at all. I mean the fighting scene was fantastic, but this war just left some minority damage compared to another movies. Vision also suddenly 'missing' in airport scene while Wanda worked hard. There's also funny scene when Captain's weight might suddenly increased that helicopter could't take off when he suddenly hang on.Overall, This movie worth every penny I spend on the theater. Probably gonna watch it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This one's boring. Not much plot, or at least a plot that rambles all over the place, trying to tie in too many lead characters. This franchise has worked in the past because it doesn't take itself too seriously and the characters usually have plenty of one liners poking fun at themselves and each other. The only place where this happens in this movie is in the airport fight scene. Generally you know what to expect with this type of movie. But even the teenagers in our house said it was boring. Just a heap of fight scenes at regular intervals in a movie that was just heading towards ... the next one.The introduction of a young Spiderman was the only humorous part of the movie. And Spiderman's aunt has never been so hot as she is cast here (Marisa Tomei). Look out for Stan Lee's cameo as a FedEx driver too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've never been one of those people who live and breathe Avengers. Have to admit that Captain America has always been one of my favourite super heroes due to the fact that he's the most normal avenger. Most people know somebody who could hold their own in a battle with Captain America.The movie title gives away the fact that this is going to be Avenger vs Avenger, so rather feared for Captain America. Anyway no real surprise that plot plays a secondary role in the movie to wise cracks and fight scenes. I found the movie entertaining if a little confusing at times. My guess is that the editing removed quite a bit of dialogue and no action sequences. Those people who do love the Avengers franchise will surely be thrilled with the movie though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad Direction, Insipid Script</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why did the moneymen entrust this franchise movie to two TV directors whose biggest accomplishment was getting the shows "Community" and "Animal Practice" canceled. Their lack of experience explains why they felt they needed to use the nausea inducing shaky camera for action scenes, why no scenes were cleanly cut and simply slid into each other, and why bad dialogue abounded. Joe &amp; Tony, this is a movie, not a bad comedy series. You could tell the actor's were as thrilled with this direction as I was as they sleepwalked though their parts.The overall story logic kind of worked, but was so weak they threw in characters left and right simply to get enough content. Wait to watch until it come out on on free TV...which should happen in about a week.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Greatest MCU Film of All Time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Captain America: Civil War is without a doubt, the greatest movie in the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe. You read that correctly. The story is incredibly compelling and very deep for a superhero movie, the acting is outstanding (per usual when it comes to these) and the action scenes are intense, to say the very least. The Russo Brothers have once again hit it out of the park with Civil War, and it's just as great as The Winter Soldier.As usual, Chris Evans was incredible as Steve Rodgers/Captain America. He has such a likability to him that you just cannot ignore. As you know, Robert Downey Jr. owns the role of Tony Stark. If for whatever reason another actor gets the chance to play Stark, it's likely they won't come close to playing the character as well as RDJ. The biggest surprise to me was Sebastian Stan as Bucky Barnes, AKA The Winter Soldier. He plays a much bigger role in this film compared to the previous Captain America films, and Stan managed to pull off an extremely interesting and captivating performance. You don't know if you should root for him or be against him. Scarlett Johansson gives a noteworthy performance as Black Widow yet again, and Elizabeth Olsen and Jeremy Renner, as well as Paul Bettany are all pretty great in their roles as Scarlett Witch, Hawkeye, and Vision respectively. Also, the new additions to the MCU are Black Panther and (finally!) Spider-Man. I do not want to say much about them because I would rather you see them for yourself, but I will say Panther may be the most interesting and mysterious hero yet, and personally, Tom Holland is my favorite Spider-Man ever, and I never thought I would say that. The climatic fight scene in the airport is the most entertaining fight I may have seen in film. I don't want to spoil, but Ant-Man steals the show in this scene. And the fight between Cap and Iron Man is so intense it will literally bring you to the edge of your seat.This movie is what every single Marvel fan has been waiting for. It is a complete rebound after Age of Ultron, which disappointed me completely. Phase Three is off to a very hot start, and we may be in for the best phase yet. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had very high expectations for the movie with early reviews of IMDb and with two trailers, Also I am a fan of MARVEL MCU yet didn't miss any of past MCU movies. I am glad to say that I didn't got disappointed with this movie and it was beyond my expectations with Amazing spider man &amp; specially black panther who does wonderful part of the movie. The fight between Captain America+winter soldier vs Iron man is possible and Cap is right with his opinion and Iron man also got a point. When I go to watch movie I had argument with my friend who was on Team Cap and I was with team Iron man, But finally when movie ends we both had kept out of choosing team and felt sad about what happen, what Baron Zemo did, BTW he is actually not a villain but a man seek vengeance I guess. The movie deserves 9.5/10 and only issue I heard from my friends was if you were not familiar with MCU early movies you might not understand the story well. But I was okay with movie from beginning to end because I was Marvel fan and this movie got on of the best fights I have seen in a movie. The special music during action scenes gave me awesome feeling too. Strongly recommend to watch this masterpiece ASAP..!!!</fullReview>

Robert Downey Jr. is phenomenal as he once again plays billionaire Tony Stark and weapons-clad Iron Man, only this time packing great emotion into his character and letting us actually see brokenness in his eyes, while Chris Evans delivers as he deals with the moral issues of standing up or going against his closest friends. There is a brilliant plot twist at the end (no spoilers) and true fans of the Marvel Universe: I warn you, bring tissues.

		<fullReview>I have to admit that my expectations weren't very high on this movie. Although the interesting trailer, I always thought it will be the same like with the Age of Ultron, few good moments in kind of boring movie. I have never been so wrong in my life.In my opinion, this movie has good action moments, with the pinch of humor in right moments (I'll never forget car scene with Cap, Bucky and Falcon). And, once again, Marvel hit the spot with the choice of actors. Chadwick, Tom and Daniel rightfully took place side to side with the rest of the excellent standard crew. Also, Paul Rudd as Ant Man fitted like a puzzle in Team Cap.Not to lie, there were some moments which were a little bit too long and made you think ?Oh, come on already". Exactly for this reason I gave 9/10, because I couldn't wait the second after credits because I had to go to the bathroom. But, overall impression is positive and I would watch it again soon. Team Cap FTW!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was expecting big things from this film. Especially with the mild disappointment of Batman vs Superman. I had a lot of faith in the Russo brothers to deliver, especially after what they did with The Winter Soldier. And, boy they delivered. Again, they've delivered the perfect blend of action, humour and seriousness we've seen in other Marvel hits, but this time they had about 10 superheroes to fit in. And they did it. They actually gave each character a chance to shine in their own respect. Which I thought was outstanding. The action was expertly done, with minimal CGI and lots of hand-to-hand combat, which is how it should be done. In summary, this film has made me very excited for Infinity War. P.S: Spiderman is f***ing awesome!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An amazing movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, I will say that this movie was brilliantly made. The soundtrack was stunning, and went together perfectly with the movie. There were a few plot holes, and pieces that didn't make sense, and I didn't like or agree with, but I had a wonderful time watching this.I will not spoil any of the movie, but I will say that I think Ant- Man could have been either excluded from the movie, or brought down a little on the humor. He seems to add too much, and this movie is supposed to be somewhat dark and serious. I also think that Spider- Man should have been added into more of the movie, since he was one of the bigger parts of the comic story-line.So I will say this; if you were expecting something extremely close to the comics, and nothing else will make you happy, you will be disappointed. I have read the comics, and those aside, this movie was great. Bucky and Sam have a very good friendship, it seems.(I think there should have been a darker tone with Bucky's recovery, though that might have come from reading too many very angst-filled fan-fictions, ha ha.)This movie's choreography was amazing! I was happy to find out that the same person who did it for CA:TWS was going to do it for this movie, and I wasn't disappointed.Second, I am very glad that the Russo Brothers directed this movie. They did very well with what they had at their disposal. (For one, everyone actually had earpieces!)The Black Panther was one of my favorite characters. He was very respectable, I think, and extremely mature.All-in-all, this movie could have been more, but it was absolutely amazing, and I will definitely watch it again, and again. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Very disappointing given how much I enjoyed the previous Winter Soldier, which Id certainly recommend, unlike this one. I find it surprising that the same directors and writers were involved. Far too many long talkie parts and most of the action consisted of hand-to-hand fist fights, which got terribly boring and repetitive. Not much of a plot either, and Tony Stark takes up as much screen time, if not more, as Capt America, which is never a good thing (and I mean Stark, not Iron Man). It is not a terrible movie, but to call it, as some have, the best Marvel film so far is laughable. That title could possibly go to the Winter Soldier, but not this one. A shame.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Do you ever go to a concert for a band you loved 30 years before? It's great seeing the whole band back together, singing their songs with loyal, adoring fans. You have a wonderful night of nostalgia and, for a moment, you're transported back in time with the reminder of things you used to love. You overlook the fact that the band is a bunch of old fat guys, that their voices crack, their timing's off, etc ... you just love the fact that your favorite rockers are together with you again. That's the way I felt watching Civil War. While it's fun to spend a few hours with these characters again, the experience brought nothing new, nothing fresh and simply reminded me of the better films that preceded it. I watched it with a packed crowd that barely chuckled (barely made a sound) and who applauded meekly at the end like parents at the end of an elementary school play before filing quietly out of the theater. Few remained for the final stinger. For a 2.5 hour movie, it felt like it lasted longer.I loved the first Captain America. Its sense of patriotism and nostalgia was infectious. It's my favorite Marvel film. I really enjoyed the second CA, too, although at a point I felt a bit of CGI overload (especially when Widow removed the CG mask). But overall, they are definitely my favorite MCU films. I also enjoyed Ant-Man and the first Iron Man but could have easily skipped Guardians and the Thor films. When I read the sort of reviews this movie got (along with the reviews of Jungle Book three weeks ago), I can't help but think that Disney has brainwashed the world's critics. After seeing this film, I know it's true. Captain America: Civil War is in the bottom % of the Marvel films, right there with Iron Man 3, Thor 2 and the Hulk movies. The multiple chase and fight scenes are monotonous and, ultimately, pointless. The pacing is tedious and the story is jam-packed with too many characters. A scene in which Stark meets Peter Parker is not only unnecessary, but stops the movie in its tracks for ten full minutes. I don't understand the excitement reviewers have for the character; in my opinion, Spider-Man's role in the film was annoying and desperate. It would have been as if Robin appeared in the final battle in Batman v Superman asking the heroes if they had ever seen some 80s action movie in the middle of the fight ... a movie that the new movie was clearly ripping off. That's what Spidey does here - he provides comic relief for the kiddies.About halfway through the film I glanced at my watch. I kept glancing at it about every fifteen minutes. The movie seemed to go on ... and on ... and on. But there wasn't a single scene I loved, no musical score to embrace, no development from the first act to the last. The characters were the same at the end as they were in the beginning. And it was definitely Stan Lee's worst cameo in a film, a nyuk-nyuk joke setup that fell flat.Just so you know this isn't a hate-fest, let me tell you what I liked. 1. Black Panther and Scarlett Witch make memorable contributions to the film. 2. I have never been so glad for Paul Rudd to appear in a movie as I was in this one. His Ant-Man provides a much-needed spark. 3. I was glad to see William Hurt reprise his role as General Ross. I spoke to a few moviegoers on the way out of the theater. They thought Deadpool was much better (so did I, and I only marginally enjoyed that one). My kids were satisfied enough, although one thought Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman could have easily bested all of the Avengers by herself. They have no desire to see it again. Both enjoyed Batman v Superman better (both saw it three times). Like any loyal groupie, I will pay money to see my favorite rock band again when they come to town in concert and, likewise, I'll stand in line for that next Marvel movie. But I have a feeling I have heard their best songs before. Their Greatest Hits are in the past.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good movie, but nothing that you haven't seen before (still entertaining and keeps you engaged though).Marvel has followed a simple plot line lately: Just make the biggest opponent the Avengers face...themselves. Genius. Wow.Look, I get that it works, but this movie didn't bring anything new to the table. Yet again, we have someone pulling the strings and pitting these guys against each other, like Loki and Ultron before them but with a different reasoning. Sure there is more explanation behind it, more characters, clear sides...but apart from all that, it was simply just entertaining. And that's what Marvel does well even if it's just recycled and presented differently.I love Captain America, he did pretty much lead the role (obviously because it is his movie technically) but this movie pretty much was building on other smaller characters like Widow, Antman, Vision, and Panther while introducing Spidey to balance out the "serious dark tone" the film tried to capture.Sure it sets up future films, but why praise this movie for doing the exact same thing BvS did at a smaller scale two months ago (but apparently was TOO MUCH)? Everything some people hated about BvS was even worse in this one...but we are giving Marvel a pass just because it's not DC? Come on.Marvel did do a good job, don't get me wrong...but they didn't take any risks or freedoms with this film. It had a very predictable plot and subplot that most people will eat up because they are unfamiliar with Marvel comics (unlike DC, where everyone knows who's who before the franchise was even thought of).Sure this movie does a good job as a continuation of the Marvel Universe, but it wasn't really something that builds Captain America role (like Winter Solider did) but, again, was really just building the smaller characters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Uneven Avengers Escapade Masquerading as a Cap Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really bought into the hype surrounding this film and was hoping we'd all be in store for a masterpiece in the vein of 'The Winter Soldier'. What we get instead is a very convoluted, nonsensical, and unnecessary sequel with a bad guy (Zemo) who's about as scary as an elderly church-going granny. About the only enjoyable things about this film are watching Scarlet Witch in action and realizing that Tom Holland is the one Sipder-Man to rule them all. Holland seriously had some of the best dialogue and action scenes. Black Panther on the other hand gets blackballed in his introduction to the MCU. His place in the story basically just screams placeholder. In fact, Black Panther completely gets shafted in the closing credits...Spider-Man gets a thunderous crowd applause when the words "Spider- Man will Return" flash up on the screen. Black Panther gets no such closing credits. Another point of complaint would be just the pacing of the story and some of its elements. The action pieces of the film come in spurts, between long droning stretches of Cap and Iron Man waxing philosophical about who knows what. I actually found myself nodding off to sleep during these stretches of non action. Also a huge problem is the Winter Soldier's central placement in the film and his storyline. Marvel needs to make a firm decision about this character's direction in the MCU, because they throw out a lot of mixed signals to the viewer. At this point, the Winter Soldier is planned for many more films, but he's almost completely unlikable and pretty much somehow lost all his rad intimidation factor of when he was the heel of the last movie. If the audience is supposed to be full of sympathy for the Winter Soldier, Marvel is not stoking that fire in the right way at all. So in conclusion the main positive of this movie is Spider-Man. The negatives are many including character misuse and numerous story misfires. Stow your expectations away and just enjoy the very few simple pleasures this disappointing film delivers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Actors, Mediocre Movie, Bad Story line</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is titled as "Captain America : Civil War" but ironically its an Avengers movie with Captain America villains. Although very enjoyable if you're 14, the movie is average or just above average in my point of view. Here are some good and bad points about it:GOOD1. The cast is overloaded with talented artists, even if you don't like the story, there are Chris Evans and Scarlett to save you from boredom :p.2. Don Cheadlie, as War Machine had his best movie in the MCU. It's the first time he did something real rather than playing butt of Iron Man's crude humor.3. Marvel's own Martian Manhunter aka The Vision had a real role in which we learn about the character's development. Ant-Man also had a decent role, especially in the otherwise subdued action scenes during the main fight.4. The Black Panther was the most amazing thing in this movie apart from Captain. From an outraged person itching to avenge his father's loss to a sought out guy, something that depicts a real superhero, the Panther was the best element in the movie and it was a fitting preview to the upcoming Black Panther Solo in 2018. BAD1. It's marketed as the final part of Captain America's trilogy and a sequel to "The Winter Soldier", and although the movies are connected,this film is an extension of Avengers rather than just Captain America.2. The plot is a typical Avengers thing, in which Iron Man doesn't listen sh*t and acts like a d*ck to create problems for everyone. 3. That teenage Spiderman looked good on the animated show when I was four, its a "League of Douche" material to place a kid in a war zone after showing that he lied to his Aunt (the hottest Aunt on the face of Earth) to travel to Germany, after Iron Man agreed to help him with is homework and give him some gadgets.4. Although "The Vision" is one of the most able and powerful superheroes, he is nothing but a red colored Martian Manhunter from the Justice League. I'm not saying it is not in accordance with the comics, but if they can make a fool out of the main antagonist of the movie, Zemo, they could've definitely done better than coloring a DC character.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now after about 3000 arguments with random Instagram people and hours watching reviews and watching the movie I've decided to take my rating of 9 out of 10 To a 8.2. Captain America is a great movie it's has some fun parts but as a whole movie it doesn't really work but the fun parts are really fun. It's all makes sense why they do this and why they do that in airport scene no one is trying to kill because team iron mans plan is to just arrest them and team cap was to go beat up assassins. And how visions missing for half of fight scene because he's kind of in the middle and only got involved when he beloved he needed to. Zemo is developed enough and man driven by vengeance what else do you need to know like really the one thing I don't agree with is people calling him a weak villain his plan to turn them against each other would have probz been better if Tony killed Bucky but I didn't want anyone to die because thanos will be a massive threat and they need everyone . There's a lot going on in the movie and introduction to two knew characters which were amazing but this was kind of a test for the russos and every flaw they have in this will be perfected in infinity war first they only had to deal with cap widow fury and Sam but now they had all superheroes except 2 but for a first try they did great and I know infinity war is in good hands after seeing what they have done with this movie where they got to bring all avengers together.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderful piece of cinematic choreography</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's always fun to see super-heroes ranged against each other - somehow it makes it more of a fair fight than creating some arch-villain who ultimately doesn't really stand a chance. In the X-Men movies, we've always had this conflict with the mutants led by Professor X constantly opposed by those following Magneto. In the DC Comics universe, we have very recently seen Batman versus Superman in "Dawn Of Justice". Now we have the mother of all civil wars with a team led by Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans) battling it out with a squad alongside Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr) which presents the largest collection of superheroes ever assembled on the screen. The Winter Soldier, Falcon, Hawkeye, War Machine, Ant-Man, Spider- Man, Black Widow, Scarlet Witch, Vision - they're all there. Plus newcomer Black Panther.The great success of this immensely enjoyable movie is that all these superheroes have a decent amount of screen time with good lines and exciting action. When the two tribes go to war, the result is a wonderful piece of cinematic choreography. So what's the argument between them? Well, as in "Dawn Of Justice", it's dawned on politicians that, when superheroes smash up cities, there is collateral damage - innocent people are killed. So 117 nations come together to draft the Sokovia Accord which requires them all to operate under the ultimate control of the United Nations. Both "Dawn Of Justice" and "Civil War" can be seen as metaphors for contemporary debates in our own world: should our security services and our global corporations be subjected to more regulation and restraint?As with all the superhero franchises, there are many allusions to previous films, so here it helps if you've seen all the earlier movies in the Marvel cinematic universe and can remember exactly what happened (I have and I don't). Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely have scripted all three "Captain America" movies and Anthony and Joe Russo have directed the last two and they have set a high bar for the promised "Avengers: Infinity War - Part I" (2018) and "Avengers: Infinity War - Part II" (2019) by which time I'll have forgotten even more but no doubt be just as excited and welcoming.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>AWESOME MOVIE! Marvel again sets the bar VERY high.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just like the last Cap film, I can see why everyone is praising Captain America: Civil War. Marvel AGAIN manages to deliver a little bit of everything and does it with style and integrity. This extremely talented cast fit each character perfectly, both large and especially the smaller roles. The story itself is told in a masterful, crisp manner and is every bit a conspiracy thriller as it is an adventure. The dialogue is witty and the humor works its way seamlessly in to the natural order of the story. The film certainly is smart and delivers more emotion than most will expect. These epic comic book style slugfests HAVE NEVER BEEN DONE BETTER. What's wonderful is that these spectacular action set pieces are inserted as a vehicle for the story and not just to see CGI things explode. What makes Captain America: Civil War BETTER than just about every action film to date is the fact that it balances amazing spectacle with an intelligent and a moving plot with full character arcs. How many movies can pull that off? Like many other Marvel films, this is movie making of the most entertaining order but actually does it even better if that's possible. It easily deserves all the praise it has generated from both fans and critics alike. The events here makes everyone long for Avengers Infinity War but also makes me wonder if they can every possibly top this film? Marvel again sets the bar is now set VERY high.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, this movie is directed brilliantly, the Russo brothers do a fantastic job and translating the comic into a very entertaining movie. The writing is fantastic, and the actors, with Downey being the highlight, and the movie makes you switch between both sides, and makes it difficult to decide on which team to stand with.Now Tom as Spider-Man, is the best choice the Marvel Movies have made since Downey as Stark. He is fantastic here, despite his limited screen time. He really shines as the web-slinger, and his comedic performance does not seem forced, and it ends making you hungry to see more of him. The other characters are also very entertaining to see, and there is not one dull moment with them, and their chemistry is fantastic, one of the major things that keep this movie on its feet.The best thing about Civil War, is the action, this is some of the best action I have seen in a movie in a long time. There is some shaky cam in some parts, however it can make some of it hard to make out, but also very effective.Now for the bad stuff, first, the runtime. It can seem very long at times, with some scenes added feel shoehorned in there, to make the movie a little longer. But the worst aspect is by far the CGI. I know - all the other marvel movies have had decent special effects, but this one, not so much. Some scenes look OK at best, but other times, specifically the Black Panther, you can tell how fake he is. The leaping, the explosions, and even some of the powers look so bad. Robert's CGI head is also very noticeable on his Iron Man suit without his helmet, and it distracts every time you see him like this. The green screen effects are also very bad, and you can see it's fake from a mile off.Other than that, there is nothing else bad about this movie. It is better than most Marvel movies, behind only Guardians of the Galaxy. 8.4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply One Of THE BEST Marvel Movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1)New Characters - Black Panther was truly amazing. Even though we didn't get his Comic-book powers in the movie, his close-hand combat was spot on. Spiderman was also very good. Been looking for the Spidey without all the drama and intense moments but rather the one (like in the comics) with the clichéd jokes and puns. Wade Wilson and Tony Stark move over, a new joker is in town! Can't wait for SPIDERMAN: HOMECOMING (July 28, 2017) &amp; BLACK PANTHER (Feb 18, 2018).2)Story-line - Even though people are crying about the ending, I feel Marvel did a solid one on the whole story-line. They completely showed us how every thing turned to the civil war without jumping over important info unlike in some marvel Movies. The ending was a perfect set up for the Movie Black Panther. People wanted the other "WiNTER SOLDIERS" to fight the avengers but are you forgetting, there were only 4 people (Iron Man, Cap, Bucky &amp; Black Panther) against the 5 Guys who beat Bucky easily. Also, Falcon and the others were in SUPER-SUPER-SUPER-MAX Prison so no Backup. I mean really?? Did y'all really think they had a chance?? The ending was good, NOTHING MORE! Moving ON,The past Marvel movies we've seen Black Widow &amp; Captain America on one side and I feel it was a good thing for them to break up (even though it was for only half of the movie). It would have also been nice to see Falcon break up with Captain but what can we say, there must always be an ass- licker in the movie.3)Action - The action in this movie was totally impressive. This was seriously the first time I think Natasha Romanoff kicked ass that hard since the first Avengers. It is a good thing Vision and Wanda Maximoff didn't too get much action because their kinetic powers pretty much make them the most powerful and we would not want to watch people simply defeating each other by the waves of their hands. NOPE, we needed close combat and THANK YOU MARVEL for finally giving it to us. Even Tony was using his hand-to-hand (with the help of Friday) to fight. It was really interesting to see! It was disappointing than no one died but I don't think Rody will be back anytime soon. It's really gonna be interesting to see how Marvel will bring most of the Superheroes back into the movie Infinity Wars 1 &amp; 2.Don't Leave Early, There Are Two Post Credit Scenes In This Movie Which Have Given Us A Glimpse Of The Upcoming Movies Black Panther and Spiderman: Homecoming.I nearly forgot the Stan Lee cameo. Can't be a good Marvel movie without one!! "Delivery for Tony Stank!"8.3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfect example of how to make a great super hero film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not usually keen on giving such high scores, just look at my other reviews.But at the same time, this film had a lot of expectations and a lot to make up for. Avengers 2 was pretty boring, not funny and not very entertaining movie. Plus with Batman v Superman getting released before this, Captain America: Civil war had it tough. This movie probably doesn't deserve a solid 9, but it does deserve to stand out from other comic book movies, because it should be an example of how to correctly make a super hero movie. Captain America, had more Avengers then first two Avengers film put together. It showcased new characters and gave more back story to; Black Panther, Ant-man, Vision, Scarlet Witch and Spider-man. That is a lot of new super heroes to give screen time, considering you still have the big players like Captain America, Iron-man, War Machine, Black Widow, Hawk-eye, Winter Soldier and Falcon. This film does an excellent job at handling so many heroes, not the same thing can be said for Avengers 2 or Batman V Superman, which failed to keep you balanced between 3 heroes and 2 villains.The Marketing on the film was great, i was really going in expecting to see a full civil war between Cap and Iron-man, but the way the did it in the film was pretty good, the whole build up of the two sides was really good, and the fight between all heroes was much awesome! Yes, it really was Awesome! with many heroes using their techniques and new skills or fight scenes.Spider-man in this film was brilliant. I really hope Sony doesn't screw it up and continue to make him work at being a better franchise. He really did a great job at being the comic relief. The story had few hiccups, but nothing to major, as it was overlooked by the bigger picture. Moments in the film, where you would go as a critic and say "That character would not make that decision, or he is to smart to think like that" but even that wasn't as bad as seeing Ultron lose to Avengers 2 or Batman being played the whole film in Batman v Superman.Like i said, this film might not deserve a 9/10, but it gets from me because it does deliver what so many heroes film have failed to do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>7/10 honestly its a season of disappointments *Spoilers*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is indeed a season of disappointments. Maybe because we have three competing studious creating so much hype about movies that they fail to live up to their own expectations. Here goes a review:What this movie got correctly:1. A large number of people in the movie, but it was well managed and well directed. No one seemed out of place and had a definite place in the script. Its good to see everyone playing not just their part but their effective characters as well. Loved when BW betrayed team iron man, double spying is in her DNA! 2. Awesome action sequences. The Russo's know how to direct a good chase sequence. The highway scene and the airport scene were awesome. Giant man was done OK. Spider man was good, talkative, overactive. 3. Humor. Well, for good or the worse, this movie has a lot of humor and it did get all of us chuckling. My wife liked it... I maybe would have liked a little less humor when everyone is trying to kill each other... Anyway, everyone in the hall seemed happy, so i will say the directors got it correctly. 4. Fast paced. With a little bit of story telling, the movie was fairly fast paced with some or the other thing keeping us intrigued. What the movie didn't get right:1. You put 10 heroes together, where is the villain? Is an ordinary Sokivian a villain? Is avengers so weak that they broke up so easily? You build up the movie saying there could be five evil winter soldiers in the end and then have Zemo put a bullet in them for a stupid reason? Ridiculous. Instead Zemo should have turned them all active and made them fight Cap, Iron man, WS and BP. Disappointment. MCU movies are so good, but please invest some writers and provide a good villain! (Damn you Feige if you get Thanos wrong and waste a decade!) 2. Whats up with that hot as$ Aunt May? They have got Peter parker gravely wrong. How does stark know her already? Felt a bit pushed. 3. Really? Stark lets Clint, SW, Ant man all rot in prison? He had no issues when SW and quicksilver agreed to support him in AOU although his weapons were the reason that SW and Quicksilvers parents dies. Why cant he handle one truth that WS was controlled like a puppet and had no mind of his own. 3. Scale wasn't as grand as Avengers level movie, but it was certainly shown to be such in trailers. This was a little disappointing. All in all, it was 7/10. Two super hero mash ups haven't lived up to the hype. I hope X men doesn't disappoint. Only those lacking creativity would find facts stranger than fiction</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Everything you want from a superhero movie, and more.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once in a while there comes a movie that fits everything just right, it boasts lofty expectations and delivers it in every aspects, "Civil War" is undoubtedly such movie. With such large pool of characters and subplots, it's impressive that these larger-than-life characters are presented with great narrative and the right amount of spotlight as well as humor for all.The story revolves around Sokovia Accord, a treaty to handle Avengers as they are causing too much collateral damage on their missions. The main strong point of this movie is how it manages to gather these dozen of characters and give each of them an engaging narrative, even the newcomers. It mainly plays with the clash of Iron-Man and Captain America, but none of the other superheroes feel left out, they all find their respective place.The struggle feels approachable as the movie shifts between the heavier tone for Winter Soldier or Scarlet Witch, yet it allows space for new members to establish themselves. The addition of Black Panther and Spider-Man are refreshing, they fit like gloves to the already large cast, and Black Panther even takes on a quite large portion of the narration as he asserts his presence incredibly well.It also benefits from good twists, this time it's not an alien force or robot invasion, but a real rift between the members, a more depth than previously done. Eventually they end up in small and large skirmishes alike. There's ample choreography to enhance the fights, the ones who rely on their fists are treated with amazing intense scuffle, while the others are done with good deal of CG.The two elements work wonderfully together, shifting between them with ease and fluid transition. Each character has their own style, their signature which translates well into the humor, they trade punches and banters with equal measure. The movie has reached the balanced between cracking jokes and presenting a riveting story."Civil War" is everything you want from a superhero movie, and more. It's a display of excellence on all fronts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One problem that Marvel will start to face is not one to be easily solved, more and more characters and egos. Sometimes it gets hard to track every character but indeed civil war does it extraordinarily in amazing 'Marvel' fashion. Characters had quite balanced screen times and input to the overall story and the action scenes of this movie is just stunning, the airport fight scene is the best movie fight scene ever which has really proved me wrong. After seeing the trailer and what little bits we got of that scene I assumed that Marvel's attempt to transfer a comic book splash page to live action looks ridiculous since there are only what 10 people charging at each other while in the comic books we get like 100 give or take 10 people. This has actually always been my concern since the movie was first announced I honestly never thought they would be able to pull off this comic book classic this early on in the development of the cinematic universe. But, am I glad that they did. I am very interested in finding out what the repercussions of this event would be on the development of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Marvel has nailed it again.</fullReview>

RUSSO BROTHERS presents a beautifully crafted film with all the action, emotional, and drama. Obviously the film doesn't have a bulk of superheroes alike actual comic but believe me it has everything you expect from the film. The core story of rivalries between team cap and team iron man is breathtaking. Addition of new charming characters such as black panther and spider-man gives a great upgrade to avengers. Costumes - Perfect Action Sequences - Fascinating Story - Impressive. Tom Holland as spider-man is the exact spider-man we need - Young, Strong and Blabber mouth. Chadwick Bosemen - You sir deserve a medal for your performance. As per me villains weren't given enough part, could use Zemo and Crossbones in better way. Well a multi-starer film will leave you questioning that did I chose the team wisely.&#x202a;#&#x200e;TeamCap&#x202c; &#x202a;#&#x200e;LovelySingh&#x202c;</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is not quite a review, it's something more than that. The law of gravity existed before Newton discovered it. The same Stupidity, existed before was discovered by man. Some people continue to make films without making this second discovery... So, about this guy, Captain America, if he would use his shield to stem the stupidity of mankind, it would be a great thing. If those characters with wings would put their hardware in the benefit of transportation of those real refugees (excluding the terrorists) across the Mediterranean, would be wonderful. To spend $ 250 million (estimated) to realize such a mess, it seems not only stupid, but also an act of malice (instead to donate those money to the sick or orphans or homeless, etc.) 8.3 stars here on IMDb? Doesn't worth not even 1 star. 979 reviews before mine? That shows how stupidity stirs interest and what is the level of culture and intelligence in the world...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The One thing that was wrong</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The is no way that Captain America beats Spiderman, it's ridicules. You would understand the irritation if you are true Marvel and Spiderman Comic book reader. Spiderman is stronger and faster than Captain America, not to mention the fact that Spiderman is intellectually gifted and bright in the likes of genius kids in league with the likes of Tony Stark. The main reason why Spiderman beats Captain America though is because Spiderman can dodge bullets. He can also see and sense blows miles away before they touch his body, not to mention that he senses danger even before the attack happens. The only way to hurt Spiderman is to distract him in the havoc and chaos created, with innocent bystanders or what not, while Cap has to hide behind his shield. Captain America had difficulties fighting the Winter Soldier while Spiderman defeated the Winter Soldier and Falcon at the same time? it all speaks volume of favoritism for branding and marketing purposes rather than staying true to the Marvel Characters integrity. Spiderman is also tactical and he always subdues all his opponents by using his wits and intelligence rather than hurting them, always finding it more preferable although he is more than capable of going rounds blow for blow with some Powerful Beings. Captain Americas strength, endurance and stamina is mediocre in comparison with Spiderman too. It is a shame that the fight scene didn't do the fight between Cap and Spiderman justice although I understand the necessity for branding for more blockbusters.The great things about the Movie was all due to Black Panther, Antman, Spiderman and the childish quarrels between Falcon and Winter Soldier. They put life, personality and charm into the blockbuster.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A shame so many false reviewers mark this so high.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a big Marvel fan for many years, and seeing a very cleverly put together trailer, plus extremely good (well GREAT) early reviews I was looking forward to this film. I came out the cinema with my young nephew thinking this - was it because he is only young, and needed a toilet break, and I generally made sure hes enjoying it, that I missed out on engrossing myself into a classic movie? So I went again, and realized no its was not that at all, and this movie is not very good at all. The story line is very weak, the main fight scenes are awful personally, no tension, no actual reason to feel they are fighting with any conviction for the side they choose, and their different skill sets just make it all a bit of a mess. I am sure there are some very well paid reviewers to lie about this film. DC (and no regardless of your petty thoughts) seem to try and make some dark deep stories, and are more targeted towards adults. Marvel seem to try and aim at kids. So if you want to take your child to this film, then yes they will enjoy this fairly action packed light heart colorful film, but anyone over the age of 15 that likes some sort of depth will not. DC = Adult films. Marvel = Child flick. Shame as I loved the first Avengers film. Wait for the DVD and do not waste your hard earned cash on this, unless your taking children.</fullReview>

Spiderman's fanboy is pretty funny. Great actor pick for Spidey. Personal touches between the characters is a great break in the action.Another director could have allowed the movie to drag over the 2 1/2 hour behemoth. Never drags, great throughout. Moves along great.Of course the action and pace accelerates in the 3rd act and is great!It's a toss up between Avengers and Cap 3 on which is the best. Avengers probably edges out because it was the first group movie that really worked. Sorry X-men.You'll definitely enjoy it on the big screen and later at home.

I haven't been a fan of their last one or maybe the one before that. But lemme say that Marvel has snowballed farther down than I expected. 1. They didn't even get half of the story right due to the fact that S o n y owns part of some marvel characters but still there are a lot of things that could have been better 2. I was so livid that they took creative liberties on spider man. He was not recruited by Stark nor did anyone underestimate him in the team Even though they changed so much to get around S o n y it ended up ruining the whole marvel story line.They would have been better off waiting to release the whole story line for the marvel civil war way later. The acting was decent however most actors seemed tired of playing their roles. One last thing was the genre change to fit a more dramatic style of movie was horrible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marvel just keeps raising the bar for multi-superhero movies...in every aspect...best one so far!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Russo brothers raise the bar for multi-hero movies to a whole new level after their earlier success of Captain America: The Winter Soldier. As expected the CGI and Stunt team does a fantastic job, better actually, than Winter Soldier which is in itself a masterpiece. Those of us, someone like me who haven't read much of the comics, may be expecting a different plot/background on which the 'Civil War' happens...although the movie takes on many different angles and perspectives through which we can see the characters in new light. With Winter Soldier, they've already laid the platform for this one and it builds beautifully on it. Marvel has always had this knack of handling multiple characters and preserving their individuality while keeping them in sync with the plot, and it doesn't disappoint this time as well. Quite a few character introductions were hinted in the trailers itself what with Black Panther and Spidey coming back to the MCU. What is impeccable is they give each character its own space while still building up on the story. A lot of tussle, both emotional and physical can be seen between the so-called two teams, each member struggling in their own stead of facing someone who until quite recently was fighting with them side by side. The background score complements each scene perfectly well and the camera team captures each stunt with breath taking perfection.Overall, it is a brilliant attempt given the complexity of the plot which I won't discuss here for the sake of the thrill of actually witnessing it in cinemas. If you've not already watched it, you're missing out on some serious entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best films of this summer, a real delight.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Following upon from the success of Captain America: Winter Soldier is a sequel, once again directed by the Russo brothers, adapting Mark Millar's famous Civil War series to the big screen. The thirteenth feature in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, backed by Disney, will this turn out to be the unlucky entry in the highly successful franchise?Following on from the events of Age of Ultron, after another incident involving the Avengers ends in some high profile collateral damage, the UN demand a form of accountability in the form of the 'Sokovia Accords'. This would mean the Avengers would only be allowed to intercede in international matters when called upon by a supervising committee. The Avengers are left split by this with one side agreeing with Captain America, siding against the accords, and one group siding with Iron Man, who wishes to follow the demands of the U.N. The issue is complicated further when the signing of the bill is seemingly bombed by The Winter Soldier, Captain America's brainwashed best friend, resulting in numerous deaths, including the killing of T'Chaka the King of Wakanda.Much like Batman vs Superman there is a lot of plot to weave through in Civil War, however unlike BvS this film balances its characters with much more success. By no means does everything flow perfectly, but the ideological clash of the characters is kept clear and concise, assisted by us having gotten to know these characters in previous features. Evans and Downey Jnr continue their fine work as the clashing pair, the figureheads of the Marvel Universe, and this feud has been brewing throughout the Avengers series. Recalling so many characters from the MCU could threaten to destabilise the movie, but as we have met so many of the characters before their importance in the story is flexible, with invested characters taking the foreground. For example Ant-Man appears in the film, in little more than an extended cameo, he has little grasp of the larger situation but his fleeting appearance is highly entertaining. Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) is one of the new additions to the gigantic ensemble and although Boseman does have a charismatic presence there is so much going on in Civil War that we never really get to connect with him. Although it must be admitted that getting to see more of the character in his own feature, under the direction of Ryan Coogler, is an intriguing prospect. The much hyped appearance of Spiderman within the MCU has been one of the most talked about aspects of Civil War and it is a pleasure to report that Tom Holland did a fantastic job as everyone's favourite wall crawler, capturing the youthful enthusiasm that makes the character so popular. Credit goes not just to the actor, but also to the writers/directors for funnelling fresh creative life into a character going through his third incarnation in only fourteen years. Having referenced the writing it would be ill of me not to discuss the work of Christopher Markus &amp; Stephen Mcfeely (Yes that is his real name, and it's awesome) on their fourth Marvel project. They have written the screenplays for the entire Captain America trilogy, and their ability to translate a character many would have dismissed as ill-fitting for a modern audience, due to the perception of him being dated, has turned Captain America, alongside Iron Man, into the flagship character of the MCU. Marvel have long been accused of under developing their villains, their film's tend to focus on the protagonists by design, and Daniel Bruhl's performance is a brief one as Helmut Zemo. However I will say I was impressed by what I did see of the character, and his motivations complement the film's themes in the larger context. With a cast so large I will give small mentions of praise to the continued impressive displays of Elisabeth Olson, Anthony Mackie, Paul Bettany, Jeremy Renner, Don Cheadle, Scarlett Johansson and Emily VanCamp. Sebastian Stan's Winter Soldier is more of a plot piece than a character and I hope to see him explored beyond simply being a brainwashed weapon in the future so we can see more range, especially if, as expected, he becomes a larger part of the MCU in the future. With a range of action scenes I was impressed by the Russo Brothers use of variety, the earlier fight scenes being very organic, using a hand-held camera to amplify the 'street level' of the conflict. Later when the two superhero sides showdown the style changes to a much more fixed fluid motion to allow us to enjoy the wide open spectacle of what amounts to an MCU Royal Rumble. Henry Jackman, one of my favourite composers, once again delivers a stirring powerful score and it's no surprise he was called back on board following his fine work on The Winter Soldier.With such a massively packed movie I have had to disavow my typical word count just to get close to covering most of the parts of Civil War I wished to discuss. Containing such a monumental amount of content and balancing the narrative, character motivations and plot of the film as well as the Russo's have is a great accomplishment. That the film is therefore unable to completely satisfy all components that hold it together is a small criticism for such a well-made feature but one that needs to be recognised. There is another nagging issue that I cannot elaborate on as it would take us into spoiler region, something I am unwilling to do so soon from release. Suffice it to say it revolves around another common complaint levied at Marvel films in the past that with each passing feature becomes a slightly more aggrandising concern. For now though Civil War is a feast of what fans of the genre will love best, definitely worth seeing, whichever side you're on.Review by Alexander Halsall.

		<shortDescription>Contrived and Convoluted - a Weak Effort From Marvel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where to begin with this one? First, there is zero reason for The Avengers to be fighting each other. The whole conflict is contrived simply to present an over fluffed fight scene between Avengers.Think of a person looking for a fight for no apparent legit reason just so he/she can say, " I kicked someone's ass last night," and that pretty sums up the contrived so-called fighting reason between Avengers here. No tension, nothing is at risk, attempts to insert comedy inappropriately and feels like a WWE wrestling match. Convoluted in the sense that The Winter Soldier's back story regresses into some weird thoughtless and lazy story writing thing here. The strong bond and character development Bucky and Steve Rogers have in the first Captain America film now is contrived and shallow -- absolutely no heart.Stark's reason to be "pissed off" is highly contrived and added as an afterthought in an attempt to justify his so-called 'rage' which is more in line with a boy with his feelings hurt than a man who is genuinely full of anger.I must have missed something with this film that the majority of people (or paid reviewers?) didn't. In my opinion, this film is average at best, and on par with Iron Man 3, but better than BvS as that film may be the worst 'superhero' flick ever made.I always know when I'm not liking a film when I say to myself "this film seems really long" halfway through, then check the time to verify exactly how long it's been running.Verdict - It's not terrible but it's not good. Think of a meal consisting solely of cheap store bought preservative filled White Bread and that sums up how I feel about this film.</fullReview>

I understand that in the comics there have been numerous contrived misunderstanding among team members who claim to be friends when they are clearly not, as well as among those who are friends, in service to telling a story.

From beginning to end, the movie is very engaging and I think I was more invested because I've seen every movie so I have seen everything unfold to this point.This is definitely a Captain America film because it's all connected to him but it also feels like a mini-Avengers film and even duals as a Iron Man 4 film, simply because everyone has a time to shine. No one is really in there just to fill space. I am Team Cap all the way but part of me definitely understood Team Iron Man. You really flip flop because you understand each side's motivation. Black Panther is the star of this though. He was handled perfectly. People who aren't familiar with him are only getting the surface level amount of what he's capable of in this movie, but he;s relentless, regal and steals every scene he is in. Spider-Man comes in second. He is the Spider-Man I have always wanted. I was a fan of Andrew Garfield's portrayal but Tom Holland is definitely superior in this and his abilities are dope. Ant-Man will surprised many people. I thought Team Iron Man was the superior team but Ant-Man is definitely someone you want on your team.Overall, the Russo Brother know exactly how to handle a superhero film. They know how to balance every element needed to make it solid and re-watchable. Many have an issue with the villain, but I didn't. Underused but still drove the plot forward.Airport scene is the best superhero action sequence I have ever witness. The overkill with TV spots and clips don't even do it justice. Go see this film!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Russian brothers here has the responsibility to make the best film of this Universe Film Marvel, for many they could for me no more than civil war is much higher than the Avengers: Age of Ultron that is, civil war is not an adaptation 100 % faithful to the comic, it has few characters involved not half having the HQ, more is now understood that it would not to put so many characters in movie only 02:30 minutes, civil War has a good rhythm and a good edition, CGI and well placed without exaggeration, action scenes are well choreographed, the Russian unfortunately took too bad a character that could have a future that is crossed bones, the acting is good and medium, I found Chris Evans the best movie , the shares of spider and Ant man are great, we have a very loyal spider man, he is nerd, funny is making jokes all the time, the airport scene is excellent, it has a lot of action and fun, and the film pattern continues Marvel, with enough jokes, more for this film the jokes are better and less unnecessary it was Ultron, I found the motivations of implausible patterns at the end when the Black Panther (which is great) learns that Zemo killed his father, the 2 are face to face and the Black Panther simply not kill, I found ridiculous because the Panther was chasing Bucky (which is good too in this film) to kill like crazy, then the Zemo it simply saves it, another thing, the film not risk killing a character he simply just let the paralytic Rhodes is still little because we had each theory that a character would die and end up dying one, the final scene of the film is good, the soundtrack is good too, Captain America civil War is a great film, has one of the best fights of super hero movie film, and a good pace, had several new characters and some very funny scenes, the film has some holes and characters that should not even it is the film, such as the character of Martin Freeman I or you're doing there, the view is less than the Captain America the Winter Soldier and the Avengers.

		<shortDescription>Well made and decent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I agreed to go and see this movie with friends, I regretted that decision. This is mainly because I do not enjoy many superhero movies and I rarely go out of my way to see them. But this one was an interesting journey and had a cool concept of superhero beating the hell out of each other. So I don't regret the decision anymore. The movie is well shot but it felt like it had quite a bit of shaky cam in the fight scenes which I find quite annoying usually. The pacing of the movie felt quite fast and neatly laid out which was great. I wasn't bored through the movie like I have been with other recent Superhero flicks so that was great. The exposition can be a bit boring and tedious but the movie gets going quite quickly and has a good balance of everything you want with this type of movie. The action is great all the way through. There are many fights spaced out through the exposition scenes, all the fights felt brutal. And because its superheroes vs each other it can feel quite personal and gripping, even though you know they wont kill each other really. If you want to see this movie, the best reason to see it is for the action and characters, as there is a lot of both them things. Plus the stories or structure are never the strong part of superhero movies usually anyway. The characters are pretty much all the people we've seen before in the past movies plus a few new ones added in. So if you love the characters then thats one of the greatest reasons to see any movie! As the focus of this movie is more aimed at Captain America, Tony Stark is less witty then he probably would be in a movie where he is more of the focus but he still manages to get some humour in still so its not gone completely. All the actors play their parts great and all work off of each other well. No one lets the team down with a dodgy performance. The story of course is the main point and it may be the weakest point of the movie, at least to me anyway. Superhero movies very rarely have a story that actually makes you feel anything and the story just feels like it has to be there to keep the audience away from action for a while. With that said, it isn't badly done or in need to be ranted about. The overall point in the movie was apparently done in Batman Vs Superman which doesn't surprise me as Hollywood love to release two movies at the same time with a similar narrative and message. With all this said, this movies main focus is characters and not story. And the characters are all there, so if you love them, then you'll like the movie. It has the humour and the drama that the other films have which you may like if you enjoyed it in the other movies. If you are a fan of superhero movies at all then you should really like it as I believe it ticks all the boxes for an enjoyable superhero flick. If you aren't a fan though then you may still possibly like it because of the concept, or something else may wow you. If you hate these types of movies with a passion then you may not like this one, in fact you'll hate it. It doesn't break any ground or do much too differently that the other movies do. And given that I don't enjoy them ones, then I guess I like the movie mainly for the concept. The movie overall is a good experience and I enjoyed it. I wouldn't mind watching it again. If I had to choose between all of the superhero films, this would be on my list of likely to pick. People might be wondering if its better than Batman Vs Superman and id say, given all the criticism that movie got, this one must be the better one out of the two.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spiderman Was Dumbest Addition Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So to echo most of the reviews the overall movie was awesome, I have always loved the flow of the Marvel movies and how they each interlink. the only addition I found to the movie which was baffling was the addition of Spiderman. I love the wall crawler and loved the cartoon, first Spiderman trilogy and the amazing Spiderman as well but this new spidy just doesn't fit in anywhere??? He has a hot aunt, he still a kid who is in school and frankly how the heck does Tony Stark feature and make him cool. Only part of the movie in my opinion that that totally botched up. Could have rather used the character from the Amazing Spiderman and tied him into the picture or left the wall crawler out all together, I'm sure Iron Man could have found someone else to be on his team.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After the high of Deadpool, came the low of BvS...I really needed something to wash out the BvS taste :)....and this movie supplied it....Of course, as comic book lovers will know, this civil war does has no relation to the comic book version...at times it appears the movie is more an introduction for the newer movies to come - infinity wars (which I am sure will be different to the comics as well), black panther (of course), spiderman (Aunt May was certainly a revelation, not sure how I will reconcile this view with the comic book version :) :). There are some passing references to other potential areas as well, but we will leave that for later....some of the action scenes are excellent, though the CGI is jagged in some scenes like the black panther-winter soldier fight. Yet other scenes like the big civil war fight swung from exceptional to ridiculous (the giant ant man fighting) in a matter of seconds and then back to exceptional.Spiderman finally turned out to be the wise-cracking teenage superhero he originally was and still is and the black panther act - costume, action and the bodyguard (when she threatens the black widow) was excellent - leaving me with a good feeling about the black panther movie. Of course, this means another spidey reboot, but I guess that can't be helped (of course, someone will have to explain how everyone gets out of the webbing so easily , and of course the young aunt may, rather than the young MJ we were used to during civil war :) :) Overall, the movie is definitely watchable - not as good as guardians, but not as bad as the ultron movie (don't get me wrong - - action scenes are interspersed with emotions...yes, very very watchable !!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Emotional Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Captain America: Civil War was a really awesome movie. All the action scenes were so great that I just stared in awe with my mouth open. (Subtle spoilers ahead) Although it strayed from the comics by changing a lot of things, it made it a lot better by dealing with personal motives rather than mainly fighting because of the act. It's all about Cap's love for Bucky, who I really hated and had a grudge on at first but then I realized that everything wasn't his fault and that he was just controlled. About the characters, I really liked how they portrayed Black Panther (SPOILERS! YOU ARE WARNED) enfueled with rage after his father's death, he still chose not to be consumed by revenge like the others (referring to Tony Stark) and chose not to kill Zemo. You know it's a really good movie when even the antagonist (Tony Stark) makes you feel that he is also right. I changed sides the whole time I watched, from Team Stark to Team Cap to Team Stark to... nothing at all. They were both right. And I am left undecided. It did not end with a happy ending however, which I totally expected but still crushed my heart. (Even though I expected a more depressing ending just like the Civil War comics) Despite this I did not tear up, But I can assure you that it really made me cry... on the inside. Good Job Marvel, well played. *claps*</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Headache Inducing Mess</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like all too many productions lately, this one is barely a story, loud to the point of being obnoxious but lavish in its CGI production values. We again have people who seem to have super human abilities but no explanation of how that may have happened or what limits they have on their capacities. At least one of them, a flea sized human, sprouts another capacity in the middle of a fight - again no explanation of how this happened or if this is the end of it. Also their capacity to take punishment seems greatly enhanced. Each of the gets thrown around bouncing off of hard surfaces experiencing no trauma, fatigue or even getting dirty. That is until one of them does get terribly injured from suffering an impact no more than he has suffered countless times in the immediate past. Again, no explanation why this acceleration seriously injured him while the previous 500 similar ones did not. The one saving aspect of this movie is the recognition by the crew and public that them performing their feats leave behind a terrific amount of damage which seems to be a plot point usually ignored in these comic book sorts of movies. I was hoping that they'd consider this but in fact, it only turns into another series of fights where they leave behind more damage including destroying a huge airplane just because they can. So the movie starts to take a path more thoughtful than a typical three year old would like but abandons it almost immediately. Meanwhile there is some sort of other faction made up of Russians who are duplicates or something or other and they factor in somehow as well. Oh, then we have some mythical Edenish African Kingdom and the laughably mysterious addition of yet a new super hero just because at this point the whole thing is so utterly idiotic, well why not? Loud, thoughtless, pitched for five year olds at best but gee, great CGI.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*Spoiler alerts... I GUESS*So initially I had this movie at around 6.5, but the more I thought about it, the more angry I got. I'm a big Caps fan and enjoyed most of these Marvel movies (Minus age of Ultron). But this movie was just lazy.So here is the entire movie... seriously: Opening scene the Avengers have to stop these guys. And there's a lot of collateral damage. The UN is like "You guys f*** things up too much. Stop". And there is a protocol to keep them in check. Protocol is led by a Nigerian King and a prince (sounds like a scam to me... see what I did there?)So Ironman is like, "Yeah! Good idea!" And Cap is like "Nah. We're not doing to do that". Then everyone picks a side. And they cheaply introduce some characters. Then they fight. And while they're fighting, they're like "Oh, sorry I have to fight you". Then they stop fighting... That's the whole F***in movie... That's it. There is something else about a Slovokian (or something) special units guy. But he's only used to show IronMan this video that pisses them off and makes them want to fight.That's it... Seriously. If you watched this movie and liked it, but now realize the movie didn't need to happen, you're welcome. The whole movie was to introduce like two new characters. Disney was like "You know what... screw it. Forget the actual effort of writing anything. These dummies will watch it." (I'm guilty).Anyway, the end....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marvel put DC in their place!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching Batman vs Superman I was pretty disappointed, one of the reasons being that Batman and Superman hardly fought. So going into this film I was worried whether there would actually be a war. Now I'm not trying to compare the films but unlike Batman vs Superman the Russo brothers nailed the war bit and this film is incredible. I absolutely loved this film and this is one of the greatest superhero films of all time. First of all the directing. The Russo brothers once again killed it in the MCU they just do not disappoint and the effects, writing and acting is fantastic. Chris Evans was great in this film as was Sebastian Stan. Robert Downey Jr was brilliant in this film his performances as both Tony Stark and Iron were unbelievable, it is safe to say he is the king of the MCU. I was very happy with how they portrayed Ant-Man. I for one loved Ant-Man and I thought Paul Rudd was very good. As for everyone else I didn't think there were any bad performances and I thought everyone in this film was fantastic. I think that Daniel Brühl is not getting the credit he deserves. I thought he made for a great villain and he had a great motivation. As for the new characters I was so worried whether they would nail Black Panther and my favourite superhero Spiderman. First of all Black Panther. I thought Chadwick Bosman was so good as Black Panther and he was so bad ass and the introduction to him was thrilling, exciting and unforgettable. As for the new Spiderman. Now this is the one I was really worried about as he is my favourite superhero. I am happy too say that they killed it. I loved everything about Spiderman, his suit, humour, the performance, the scenes he was in and the action. The introduction to him with Tony Stark was a fantastic scene with great dialogue. Tom Holland gave a great performance and I cannot wait to see Spiderman Homecoming.The action has never been better in a Marvel movie. Every single action scene drew me in and I was always on the edge of my seat. The airport scene is absolutely brilliant and jaw dropping. The tension and acting is great. You can see in this battle that some of the superheroes are still friends but due to a big decision they end up fighting each other. Everything about the airport scene I loved. It is one of the greatest action scenes of all time and I loved it. The final action scene in the film is so thrilling and emotional. After you find out that it was the Winter Soldier who killed Tony Stark's parents there is a huge emotional battle in between Iron Man and Captain America and Bucky Barnes aka the Winter Soldier. It is just a great scene that had a thrilling and great climax. In conclusion this is an exceptional film that I loved from start to finish. Once again the MCU does not disappoint and you are doing yourself a favour if you go and see this film. Plus make sure you watch both credit scenes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was a little afraid going into Captain America: Civil War because many movies with a lot of strong characters tend to focus less on the story. I am ecstatic to said that this did not happen. Each opinion of the characters are shown and the story comes together nicely. Now let's talk about the fight scenes and CGI. They were awesome! I think Black Widow had some the most intricate fight moves. Sure it was not actually Scarlett Johansson and probably her stunt double, I say this because her back is facing the camera most of the fight scenes. The CGI was so well done and the biggest CGI image is in the very beginning of the movie that involves Tony Stark. I don't want to spoil too much about it but it is very neat. I had only one issue. The fight scenes while they were great they did go on for a while. I do not know if I was just tired that day but one fight scene I started nodding off. But like I said it may have to do more with me then the movie. Better than the second Avenger movie, Captain America: Civil War is action packed and enjoyable for all ages.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What can you say? The MCU's batting average is pretty solid</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Marvel films have come a long way now. First they started with movies establishing the characters. Then they all crossed over to fight threats. Now the only sensible thing to do is to start having them come into serious conflict with each other.The MCU films have so far been solid. You have had great ones like Iron Man, The Avengers and Winter Soldier. And you've had meh ones like Iron Man 2, Thor the Dark World. For me personally, the worst of the bunch is Iron Man 3 but even that is somewhat well made.I will say Civil War is the more appropriate Avengers sequel. Ultron somewhat gave me a headache as it was all over the place. And its no surprise Joss Whedon just quit after that. This film is surprisingly contained despite being based off of Mark Millar's very extensive storyline. Having removed Hulk and Thor really helped contain the story.The action set-pieces, while not as all over the place as Ultron was, were still sometimes difficult to watch. I like that the Russo brothers introduced some grit in the Winter Soldier, but they introduced a mild form a shaky cam in Civil War. Yes the camera jolted up and down at times during a frenetic action sequence with some quick cuts.The best set-piece though had to be the airport throwdown. And unlike Batman v Superman earlier this year, there was a proper build-up to the throwdown between the two disagreeing factions. Not only that, the airport was empty so you can watch the fight with maximum comfort and not worry about civilians or wanton destruction.And with the build-up to the fight, you can definitely see the characters really develop, not only in this film but the preceding ones as well. Tony Stark started off as basically a neo-con in the first film, then to a guy who opposes the government to now believing in accountability therefore being surprisingly in favour of the superhero registration accord. Steve Rogers a guy who is a relic from a different time is basically someone who always wants to do the right thing and working for the government that looks out for its own self interests may not be the right thing. Both have equally valid points.There are two new additions. Black Panther or T'Challa is the first. And I'm so glad he finally got his big screen treatment. He is such an awesome character and adds to the diversity sorely lacking in superhero films. His costume is amazing as well. With the director of Creed making his film, it will kick a lot of ass.The second addition is Spider-Man. And this is one of the better adaptations of the character as they really embellished on his youth. We keep forgetting that Spidey is in his teens. Although I am concerned now that the Marvel films have an over-abundance of quippy characters: Iron Man, Starlord, Ant-Man and now him.As usual in an MCU film, the villain is forgettable. In this case however, you can excuse that because the main conflict is between the heroes. The revelation in the third act really helps to reinforce that.So yes this film was really enjoyable. More focused than Ultron and better story telling than the DC films. The only gripe is just with the filming and editing of the action sequences. Marvel, you done it again.</fullReview>

Just the fact that the film is part of the saga Catain America and not that of the Avengers made me turn up their nose (although the sequel "The soldier in winter" is more pleasant of the first chapter). This film has many flaws, the biggest is to have had the presumption to be able to handle so many superheroes in a minimum span of time searching for the inner self-destruction with a "civil war" is not a war. They're just beating and even cursory: the action scenes are fast and often you can not perceive the movements. Missing irony who had the Avengers, there are plenty of downtime and many scenes end in themselves. Not to mention the internal plot and the pseudo-villain who is the setting for a movie without a foundation. Bunch of heroes and superheroes that make you smile all together, but they can not keep afloat a movie too pretentious.</fullReview>

None of that Batman V Superman crap! Ohh no! This is how you do a movie about superheroes fighting each other! This movie can even live up to the epic of the first Avengers! Wow!!! I felt so excited and pumped up in every scene of this movie...Even the boring talking parts. Seriously! Oh my god this is such an awesome film. The first half of the film was good but the second half after the intermission was by far the best part about the movie! Also, another thing, I loved Spider-Man in this movie. Nerdy and Funny!

This is my most fave part of the film.2) Cap &amp; Iron Man fighting - This is the last fight in the movie. It was so cool.3) The opening fight scene - It was cool, especially with the scene being shot at a market.So, I recommend watching this movie. It's worth your money &amp; time.

		<fullReview>I was optimistic but cautious going into this movie. Marvel has been on such an amazing run recently that I thought that they have to slip up at some point... right? And with so many superheroes in 1 movie without Whedon at the helm, I was concerned.Needless to say I was worried for nothing! The story was set-up brilliantly and continued going strong for the remainder of the film. The Avengers have had their problems here and there in the past, but things finally reached boiling point after a mission turned south and more innocent people died. Our 2 new characters were great, Black Panther and Spiderman both had great introductions and both felt like they actually had something to do rather than just be there for the sake of the plot. Speaking of Spiderman, Tom Holland did a great job! When cast people thought he didn't look the part and that he looked too young, whether you still think that or not you can't deny he played the part really well and I for one am really looking forward to 'Homecoming' and seeing what more Tom has too offer.Overall brilliantly crafted movie, the Marvel juggernaut continues to keep moving forward without a hitch. Bring on Doctor Strange.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, what can I say? If you haven't watched this film, get up and watch it! In my opinion this is one of the best Marvel films since The Avengers. Clever dialogue and good old fashion story telling is what makes this movie so fantastic. First of all I would like to say how pleasantly surprised I was by the introduction of Spider Man into the Marvel Cinematic universe. It was a beautiful transition and I particularly like how Tony Stark fills the mentor role in Spidey's life. Another awesome intro was Black Panther. The character is well portrayed by Chadwick Boseman and I greatly look forward to watching the Panther stand alone movie next year. Chadwick adds new depth to the film, a depth the movie used to its advantage. Daniel Brühl's portrayal of Baron Zemo (or Zemo) is understated which enhances the movie greatly. Brühl's performance is not the copy and paste villain who seems to populate a lot of Marvel movies. Instead he is credible and, unusually, the audience can sympathise with him. The Russo brothers didn't disappoint at all. Their inspired direction really brings the film to life. The added aspect of Stark's origin ties the bow perfectly for me personally. Every frame feels painstakingly analysed which is the trademark of a good director (or should I say directors). Overall, the performances are spectacular and the structure of the story is very well organised. However, I do feel like this is more of an Iron Man/Avengers movie than a Captain American one. This isn't a problem though, as every character is developed just enough. I would give Captain America: Civil War 8 out of 10 because this is everything a comic book movie should be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When it comes to superhero movies they rarely succeed at making the whole saga of movies (specifically trilogy) consistently good. Some might argue The Dark Knight Trilogy is perfect I think that's bullshit, The Dark Knight Rises is a mediocre at best and disappointing finale to what could have been a nice Batman Anthology. Other trilogies that haven't come out well are: X-Men Trilogy (Last Stand wasn't good), Spiderman Trilogy (Spiderman 3 doesn't need explanation), Iron Man Trilogy (neither of the sequels are any good), Blade Trilogy (Trinity sucks) and the old Superman and Batman sagas (sagas which the first two films were actually really good, but the two that followed were laughable corny crap).. Civil War is actually even better than Winter Soldier and First Avenger which is insane. The Russo brothers continue Bucky and Cap's story in this very well crafted adaptation (which actually has little to do with the comics). The performances are great, specially Tom Holland and Chadwick Boseman as the newcomers to the MCU. The airport scene is even better than people are saying. It's as action packed as a film can get. Every superhero in the movie get's their moment to shine. The only weakness I can think of is the villain.. But we already expect mediocre villains from the MCU, THE MOVIE IS PERFECT ANYWAY!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With two superheroes going head to head in one movie, this movie is made to be a real turning point. Captain America: civil war is the third movie about Captain America and has to follow two movies that were great. But what can you expect form a movie where superheroes don't fight against evil but against each other?There are two teams in this movie, on the one side you have Iron man (Robert Downey Jr.) and on the other side Captain America (Chris Evans). Let's begin with Iron man. ...Check out the full review of "Captain America: civil war" on our blog and let us know what you think. https://thetalkingpicturesblog.wordpress.com/2016/05/01/captain- America-civil-war/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A milestone for the MCU</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Captain America: Civil War is in short, a movie about the Avengers being pressured to be monitored by the U.N. Some agree to this, others don't and it boils down to a fight. In midst of all this tension, Captain America discovers that Hydra (I think?) is still alive and has to end its plans again.Don't get fooled by it's name - Captain America: Civil War is not about the Civil War arc that happened in the comics. It does have the tension and fights but it's not the Civil War you thought it'd be. But honesty, who cares?Yes, it's not what it was in the comics but it still is an amazing movie. If you saw the trailers and thought you've seen too much, don't worry - You haven't seen anything yet. This movie has lots of action and lots of funny moments, just like any Marvel movie but the introduction of characters and the addition of others makes the fight between the Avengers all the more exciting.If I have to say at least something bad about it, the villain is kinda bad? Like his plan is close to what Loki tried in The Avengers (Without the taking over the world) just because the Avengers "killed" his family. Not the greatest villain but not the worst either, just okay.Other than that, the movie is pretty much flawless. Captain America: Civil War is a great action movie, it's right there with Terminator 2 and Die Hard. It's the best Marvel movie to date and I'm glad to see the Infinity War movies are in good hands.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a massive fan of the MCU, I have been eagerly awaiting Captain America Civil War for months. I had such high hopes and expectations and the film does not disappoint. In fact, it exceeds my expectations. I personally really liked age of ultron (AOU) however this film juggles all of the characters perfectly and has learned from the negatives raised from that installment. It gives each character their moment and does them all justice. This film is a sequel to AOU and equally a sequel to the Winter Soldier, yet each previous MCU installment is touched upon in this movie. The building blocks previously set up in previous movies helps for the politics of the film to be relatable, interesting and entertaining, an aspect which is often done so poorly in other movies (look at the Star Wars prequels!!) This allows for a patient yet gripping film from the onset and doesn't rely on constant action and fight scenes. The reasons each hero chooses a particular side is justified and understandable. Iron mans decision to stand against cap is also justified and paints the character in a new light in my opinion. You genuinely feel for both characters. The action is brilliant and is arguably the best of any superhero movie. The film has some genuinely upsetting and emotional moments yet manages to then flip it to moments of laughter and humour. The timing is sublime. Overall Civil War is a mature movie that raises the bar for the genre. It surpasses the winter soldier which I believe was the best superhero movie to date and leaves the MCU in such an interesting and exciting position. I can't wait to see more. Get your ticket and watch!!!!! #TeamCap</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ultimate Marvel Movie Experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everything in the MCU has been leading to the production of this masterfully made film. Marvel has yet to make a dud of a film and they seem to have been developing their style, choice in filmmakers and talent involved.All of Marvel's efforts over the first two phases of the MCU has yielded Captain America: Civil War. This movie is action packed, a political thriller, a chase film, a character piece with a human heart. Critics and public opinion dismissing the movies produced by Marvel Studios as mere 'superhero' films have either not watched enough of these movies or they need to watch this one.The cast has proved by now that they work well together as an ensemble and the main trio at the heart of the story Chris Evans, Robert Downey Jr and Sebastian Stan deliver human, vulnerable and heartbreaking performances.Superhero comic books and as a consequence their films have since their inception been adapting and mirroring real life issues and struggles of the real world at the period of their issue. This film is no exception. Dealing with themes such as power, loss, family, friendship and forming basic human connections. The movie marks the strongest addition to the Marvel slate and beyond initial enthusiasm may rank as one of the greatest superhero films of all time, if not the greatest.Character development has not suffered at the expense of the presence of the variety of superheroes sharing the screen. The story is well crafted and the ideology spurring the civil war convincing.The new additions to the cast, the long awaited younger version of Spiderman and the ever intriguing Black Panther of Wakanda have worked well within the storyline and provided each of the aforementioned superheroes with a very satisfying origin story to make the transition to their own feature length films smoother.An absolute achievement from the Russo brothers with the only desire left being at least a mild reference to the TV Show world which would undoubtedly be influenced by the events in the film. An amazing and unprecedented superhero film with a heart, a human heart. A must see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fantastic character driven film that makes the viewer's question themselves. Both sides are right and wrong at the same time. You will go back and forth between which side you are on.Pros:1) Great action scenes, especially the airport sequence2) Spider-Man, Black Panther and Ant-Man stole the show3) Each character gets their moment to shine (doesn't feel overcrowded at all) and acting is great4) Extremely well written plot5) Both sides provide valid points and reasons why they are fighting.50/50:1) Zemo is a great character and his reasons are solid. But his plan required a little too much "coincidence".Cons:1) Some of the characters' motives for choosing sides aren't that clear or explained.Overall great film. 9/10. One of the best Comicbook movie of all time. And undoubtedly a great movieTips: Though not 100% necessary, I would highly recommend seeing "Captain America : The Winter Soldier" and then "Avengers : Age of Ultron" to appreciate this movie. And to fully appreciate this movie see all MCU movies prior to to this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Marvel Universe is based on fun and fighting with an interesting story tucked in there. Captain America Civil War definitely delivers on these parts!While the story is a continuation of the previous Captain America movie Winter Soldier, the scope is far more than that. You could say it's an Avengers movie, but the stories of the Captain's past and where he believes his future lies are what gives this movie some interesting depth.But who are we kidding? The intersecting story of all Marvel heroes is great, but the fighting, one-liners and hilarious scenes are why I come back. if you're the same, well you'll have a Marvelous time.The new characters and some minor known characters are allowed to claim the spotlight, putting others in their shadow for once (watch the movie and you'll get it)I can't wait for the upcoming Infinity War movies, a lot has to happen to screw those up with this cast, these directors and the Vision of the MCU. But who knows, maybe Thor Ragnarok will bring an ironic end to the good times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hard hitting, mature filmmaking crossed with action-packed, hilarious fun.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The greatest superhero movie ever made? Perhaps not. It's a judgement, I personally can only make after seeing this movie more than once. What I can say is this: If it were an average affair, the flaws and faults in the structure may have derailed this beast of a movie. But this is no average affair. Too put it simply, this is the best Marvel movie yet. Should there be anything better in the future, this franchise may very well stand as one of the greatest to have ever existed.We'll start with the flaws as I want them out of the way and they are more niggles than hard errors. The pace is fierce but patchy (what Marvel movie isn't). the beginning especially, is in a big hurry to get through, what is, a great deal of set up. The central conflict of this movie relies heavily on everything that comes before it however and here, character motivations are a little rushed. The ending, also, suffers in the same kind of way. You could also call a lot of the big moments an unfortunate case of 'I already know what's about to happen'...itis... HOWEVER! This is the full blockbuster ingredients list, cooked to near-perfection: Emotionally charged, intelligent, bold, hilarious, action-packed and so much fun. It's a proper grown up affair with a superhero stamp on it. It's engaging, it's interesting, all points on all sides are relevant and understandable and perhaps most importantly, this is firmly, a Captain America movie. Iron Man is there and he's a major player, but he is not the star of the show.All other players are integral and exciting to watch, especially that very special new player! His intro is hilarious. Even better, every character has a run in with each other at one point or another and most of them ooze amazing and often surprising chemistry with each other. The best of which get the least amount of screen time together, but leave the most satisfying mark.The overall story is very well thought out. It's spread over several different plot lines, but they all come together as one big, beast of a movie. Like I said, it's patchy, but Civil War makes the absolute most of it's run time to get in what's needed for the story and what is, all but demanded, from the viewer. The Russo brothers have done a very good job here. Infinity War only looks to be more promising with each new movie. Finally, the emotional heft. It's everywhere in this movie. This isn't a grim affair, but it is dark one. Many punches are inflicted on our heroes and if you love them as much as I do, it can be a hard watch. But it's real and at times, quite heart wrenching. This is a character story at it's core and despite the success of everything else, this, they absolutely needed to make work. And they do. It's not perfect, but it's the best Marvel has done so far to put that lump in your throat. Shed that tear. Make you wish everyone could just get along. But in the end, when the result is a movie this good, you may not actually want them too. As for sides: There are no easy choices, there are no easy results. There is only first class, grown up filmmaking.Highlight: The airport tussle. Trust me, the trailer spoils nothing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Great Responsibility</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Eight years into Marvel Studios' multi-property film franchise and its increasingly convoluted continuity, a movie as good as "Captain America: Civil War" (2016) is truly and delightfully surprising. While I doubt it could stand alone, and is guilty of a few shoe- horned cameos and more than a few plot contrivances, the second instalment from Joe and Anthony Russo (directors of the previous and similarly impressive Captain America: The Winter Solider {2014}) is a success. As an action spectacle it is above par; as a springboard for future franchise films it is reinvigorating; and as a meditation on the problem of superheroes' power and sovereignty it is the best since Zack Snyder's "Watchmen" (2009). We are not likely to see critical reception that puts it in league with Christopher Nolan's "The Dark Knight" (2008), rather condescendingly hailed by non- superhero fans as something "more than a comic book movie" (Roger Ebert). But "Civil War" is every bit as engaged with themes of authority and morality as Nolan's seminal work, and borrows much credence from the Marvel Cinematic Universe's well-established lore and cast of characters. It is as close to the true, transcendent experience of comic book fandom as we have yet to see on the big screen.Following the events of the sadly inferior "Avengers: Age of Ultron" (2015), Steve Rogers as Captain America (Chris Evans) leads a new team of superheroes in pursuit of a minor villain leftover from "The Winter Soldier", only to sustain a large number of civilian casualties. It's the final straw for the governments of the world, says long-absent Marvel player General "Thunderbolt" Ross (William Hurt, last seen in 2008's "The Incredible Hulk"). Now a superhero registration act is in order, rendering all enhanced individuals legally beholden to the United Nations and impotent to act without democratic approval. Humbled by the weight of failure from previous films, Tony Stark as Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) is in favour of the proposal. Rogers, ruffled by his intimate experience of governmental corruption from previous films, is suspicious, but might have agreed to compromise if not for the involvement of his life-long friend turned Soviet sleeper assassin, Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Staan - the aforementioned Winter Soldier). Barnes has been framed for a terrorist bombing in South Africa and Rogers is alone in defending his innocence. With the help of a mystery malefactor (Daniel Bruhl), the rift between heroes grows into civil war...The basic premise of this film was adapted from a cross-over Marvel comics event of the same name (published 2006-7), and represented a major paradigm shift in post-9/11 superhero narratives. This arose from the undeniable fact that it was becoming impossible to appreciate large-scale urban destruction without qualms, and that superheroes have always left large-scale urban destruction in their wake. It is something that has been addressed in previous films, particularly "The Avengers" (2012) and "Age of Ultron", in which writer-director Joss Whedon made a point of conflict containment and showed Rogers doing everything possible to clear the battleground of bystanders ? maybe that way we could cathartically enjoy New York's decimation again. But the Avengers are making one hell of an omelette here. "You try to save as many people as you can," Rogers confesses. "Sometimes that doesn't mean everyone".This is Captain America's polite way of using the phrase "collateral damage", a theme that has wormed its way into the heart of superhero culture over the last ten years, and to great effect. That "Civil War" takes an issue like collateral damage so seriously is its finest quality: we have here a film that does adhere to a fairly formulaic script wherein a villain turns the heroes against each other (seen in both Avengers movies), but not one that lets the heroes off that easily. While much of the story is somewhat contrived - utilizing the classic trope of villain-as-impossibly- prescient-mastermind-who-knows-what-every-character-will-do-every- step-of-the-way - the conflict at its heart is not. It is a very real ideological difference that exists between Rogers and Stark, and not a misunderstanding used to justify a series of fight scenes. "You're wrong, you think you're right, and that makes you dangerous," claims the film's most exciting cameo character. It doesn't matter who he's talking to. At the same time, the movie remains a solid melodrama, such that we feel the personal stakes which all stories require to function at an emotional level. Stark and Rogers take their sides on principle that is not abstract, but informed by personal tragedy. Bolstered by thematic ties to the story's two main antagonists, "Civil War" works as drama as well as dissertation. This is all especially impressive given the studio mandates which must have been weighing upon it, to consolidate the plots and characters of Marvel's eleven preceding films and set up the seven films slated for release by 2019. This is a juggling act of economic, thematic and storytelling responsibility that is rarely executed with such aplomb in the arena of Hollywood blockbusters. It will make money and please fans, an increasingly difficult double threat for superhero cinema. And while it requires a baseline of fandom to operate as a good film, it does do it. It is a story about power; it is a story about people. After all, every story is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another one has joined the MCU's best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Marvel and the Russo Brothers did it again! to simply put, it's a spectacular film overall.Captain America: Civil War has all the things that makes a comic- book movie an enjoyable blast. It's entertaining, it's emotional, it has action-packed scenes that will leave you at the edge of your seat and of course, it certainly has humor in it and just the right amount as well so it won't come out as a jarring or brooding movie experience. This is what a blockbuster film should be.My main fear before watching this movie was how were they going to handle this amount of characters in one film since even the last Avengers movie: Age of Ultron had a difficult time in doing so. After watching it though, all I got to say is that it surpassed almost every bit of expectation I had and gave each of our heroes their spotlight moments which allowed them to standout in the movie in their own way which the Russos did flawlessly especially the newly introduced character Black Panther which they also nailed perfectly and served as a strong introduction for those who don't read the comics and aren't familiar about his character at all.Maybe my only problem with this film is that it's vastly different from it's comic counterpart but I do understand that the MCU is trying something different so I won't bitch about it too much. The villain didn't bothered me as much as people say it was, though his plan was a little too intricate, he was still an exceptionally good villain with a legit motive but I do agree with some people that he didn't need to be in this movie since it's already filled with the necessary conflict that would otherwise make it a thrilling film. Now for my final thoughts about Captain America: Civil War. If you enjoy comic-book or superhero films as a whole with no bias, this movie is a must see and you'll probably enjoy the hell out of it. This movie proves that a film can satisfy the fans, the general audience AND the critics all at the same time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent accomplishment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As brief background I am an avid comic book fan (both Marvel and DC, but I read Batman the most). I loved the Dark Knight Trilogy and have been generally pleased with most MCU output. I thought Man of Steel was OK but that Batman v Superman was actually quite poor film- making.Civil War has simply made me think even less of BvS. I know some people don't like comparisons but I cannot help it when Civil War does what BvS tried to do but actually accomplishes it. The good:- The action scenes are great - it really felt like a comic book had come alive- I was very engrossed with the story - I felt it flowed well and I really bought both sides of the argument. I could see where Cap was coming from and where Iron Man was. The fights were all justified - it never felt like the movie was trying to force a fight on the characters with tenuous justification like it did with BvS. On the contrary, the characters do not want to fight and are merely forced to by circumstances. This gives it more of an emotional kick. The conclusions feel satisfactory as well.- Black Panther has translated to screen well - he is the guy from the comics, good parts and bad. He is also extremely formidable. His very last scene promises great things about his solo movie- Spider-Man again seems like the most faithful to the comics we've seen yet. He talks a lot during fights - to everyone's annoyance - and has a great sense of humour.- Some reviews have been a bit lukewarm on the bad guy, Zemo, but I disagree. I thought he was given a very human motivation (again, unlike Lex from BvS). By the end you almost feel sorry for himThe bad:- It was a bit slow in parts but I was so excited I didn't mind. I question how these parts will hold up to repeat viewing</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Marvel's "Captain America: Civil War" is a film so sincere in its aspirations, so determined to stand out from the superhero crowd, that to see it collapse under the strain of its ambition is quite underwhelming. The film pits Avengers Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) and Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) against each other in a clash of ideologies, and to see them fairly debate in lieu of individuality and regulation, respectively, is nothing short of compelling and thought-provoking, especially since both sides have their own set of consequences.The action sequences and fight choreography are top-notch, probably the best in the Marvel crop, with the Russo brothers proving themselves the studio's golden goose. They (with mightily impressive stunt choreography from the John Wick directors) direct with a slick, brutal efficiency and perfect comic timing that can make action junkies sigh with relief, which aides greatly in that big, highly-hyped superhero throwdown.But the villainous cog behind the conflict nearly collapses the entire film. It becomes increasingly preposterous the more I think about it. To pit Cap'n and Iron Man against each other, there has to be a plausible catalyst towards their tension to bring any real emotional weight to the film. This villain, all by his lonesome, uses preparations and tactics that would make Bane and MacGuyver blush in comparison, resulting in plot/continuity holes so big a dozen helicarriers combined can fly through them. However, and this doesn't spoil the plot, what he does at the end of the film ditches the core of the film and resembles a Saturday morning cartoon.It's still a better film than Batman vs. Superman.</fullReview>

The fight between allies was as pointless as Batman V. Superman, yet somehow worse, and the comedy lacked its typical punch.

		<fullReview>It's pretty baffling to think that we are thirteen movies into a cinematic universe or franchise and yet for some reason(in my opinion) there is a odd sense of similarity in all these movies whether it relates to the theme, style or content.Maybe these movies are keen in focusing on that important factor or maybe it's more likely that they are simply recycling the same matter over and over again without any cinematic style.I refer to them as movies instead of films because they are just that, routine blockbusters made to entertain audience and comic book fans through accurate and enhanced representation of characters and reliant use of computer generated effects to deliver spectacle rater than actually telling a meaningful story by fully taking advantage of the visual medium of film.Civil war has all the traits of a marvel movie(for better or for worse). The camera-work is shaky, especially during the fight sequences, making them pretty irritating.The cinematography is pretty bland, dull and worst of all is colorless(not as bad as batman v superman though). The score or music is forgettable and the sound was just about the same as all these films.The entire movie pretty much presents the question of whether an avengers is required or not(mush like superman) and shows the inner conflict within the avengers on whether to agree to be supervised.It shows the conflict between captain America and iron man, which builds to a full fledged battle between their respective teams(members of the avengers) and the airport fight was fun, it just didn't make for a compelling battle.The film then focuses on the winter soldier, who was framed by Zemo, another antagonist and then reveal a past incident which furthers the feud between iron man and Steve Rodgers, making it more personnel.While i applaud the movie for depicting situations of conflict within such close friends, it doesn't make up for the fact that the humans in this movie are treated as insignificant and incapable of protecting an event involving important leaders.Zemo is able to easily bomb the united nations meeting without any detection, which is simply absurd.The 3d is pretty much wasted and doesn't add anything to enhance the movie. Moreover the movie failed to live up to the seriousness of the plot due to weak dialog, mediocre acting and the inclusion of characters that didn't bring anything to the movie and instead just padded the running time(Spiderman, vision, scarlet witch). This movie is overstuffed with characters like the black panther, ant man, vision, Hawk-eye etc.Hell i really don't understand why they couldn't add Thor and Hulk and just name it avengers 3.There is a Spiderman cameo in this where he shows his admiration for the avengers, cracks lame jokes and does his share in the battle at the airport and all of it just doesn't work at least for me.It angered how they reduced Spiderman to a mere fan of the avengers assemble when he is a more iconic character than them.Spideman was basically thrown into the movie for the sake of pleasing the fans. The new suit just looked digitally tailored and ridiculous and the cracking of jokes during n important battle just swept any tension for that event.Despite having hurdles of materials and weapons thrown against them, not a single member lost their life.The acting is pretty mediocre.Robert Downy Junior plays the same character he played in the previous films, only more restraint and with less depth.Scarlett Johnson is alright, though i never felt anything for her character.T supporting cast didn't add much to the movie. Chris Evans was just bland and had the same face throughout the entire movie.I never for once believed in his character and his performance didn't help the situation.The questions regarding the safety and security of people by their watchful guardians and how much of that authority is accountable is reduced to a simple answer of team iron man or captain America by the entire company with it's promotional trailers.In the end it didn't feel like best of friends cashing in rage due to indifference's during the final battle but instead felt like two emotionless robots fighting for the sake of building a battle.So While not a bad film in any ways civil war much like all marvel movies suffer from the overstuffed characters,bland performances as well as uninspiring film making techniques.The safe and generic approach of film making opted by the creators pretty much disqualified any artistic merit involved in the movie and at the end of the day it's basically a product meant to e consumed by the masses without any hesitation or effort, discounting everything that makes cinema grant.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>9.3/10 "Oh what's this? Another comic book movie? Oh well. Wait, is it just Captain America v. Iron Man? I bet it'll be just as bad as that Batman v. Superman movie." I may be a little tired of comic book movies, as I am sure other people already are and I do not really approve Marvel has planned films until like 2023. However, if they continue to deliver movies of this caliber, they are very welcome to do so. Civil War is a pretty good movie. It has some great action, good stunt work and some pretty good performances and introductions to some secondary characters.First, the things I liked. You're constantly switching teams. I was "Team Iron Man " when I went into the movie theater, but the movie presents both sides with great, understandable motivation and you identify with both sides. You never grow to hate anyone but you kind of know where they're coming from and that's a sign of a well written film. It's funny when it need to be, serious when the story demands it and just badass all around. Also, these movies are actually fun and don't feel like the most depressing thing in the world. Yep, I'm looking at you Zack Snyder. Most of the action is pretty good, especially the airport fight which is simply phenomenal, I would even say perfect. The movie also addresses some heavier themes, which are thought provoking and the movie isn't afraid to do so. Another thing I love about these Marvel films is that, sure they are a part this massive MCU, however, most of these films you could watch, without having any previous idea what the other films were about or about who these characters are, and you could still completely follow what is going on. And this is something to be praised: Civil War stands alone as its own movie. This is the first we see of Black Panther and not knowing anything about him I liked his intro to this universe. Spider-Man was the best part of the movie, at least for me. Tom Holland really captured the character of Peter Parker like no one else has and was a great Spider-Man. I can't wait to see more of him.Now, for the things I did not like. The first thing is the villain. The whole movie you're wondering what his plan is but he never feels like a real threat amongst our heroes. He's just kind of there and does bad things. There is a point in the movie where I even forgot he was in it. His motivation was clear and in the end your questions are answered, but overall I think his plan was a little too "Dr. Evilish" if you catch my drift. Upon further thought, I realized everything of importance in the film could have easily happened if he wasn't in the film. Sure, the catalyst for the actions would have been different but the outcome would have been pretty much the same. The action was great for the most part, but particularly at the beginning of the film it did get a bit shaky at times, maybe even a little too shaky. You could almost always follow what was going on but it made me kind of dizzy. I've said this several times for the Marvel movies and it does take some points away for me, but the score in these movies is inexcusably mediocre. It always (or at least most of the time) feels like generic superhero music in these Marvel films and it is something that needs to be addressed. No spoilers, but I was disappointed with the way the movie ended and it felt kind of dumb to be honest. It involves a letter so you know exactly what I'm talking about.But overall, Marvel has really done a great job once again with Civil War. The best thing about this film is that every character has something to do and every single one of them has a certain depth to them and you can identify with their actions. No one feels out of place (Well, maybe Hawkeye a little bit, but you can identify with him and you know where he's coming from) and in a movie with as many characters as this, it should be praised. Civil War is action packed and loads of fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The standard for any studio interested in making a comic book adaptation!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alright friends...here goes my SPOILER FREE review of Captain America: Civil WarFirst off let me begin be saying, I had VERY HIGH expectations for this movie and I was not disappointed!With all due respect to James Gunn, Christopher Nolan and Joss Whedon, but the Russo bros. have cemented themselves as the dynamic duo of comic book movies!!! They have demonstrated not only an uncanny ability to tell a compelling story but also pay homage to the source material in such a subtle way, it is clear these guys are fans that do not just see the comic panels but fully understand the emotions and personalities of the characters.The movie was so well written, it is clear that it is a stand alone Captain America movie and not just Avengers 2.5 (as many were touting it when the cast was announced). The presence of the other Avengers does not take away from the overall plot.Each character has a clear reason for being in this movie. And NONE of them feel shoe horned in. There is clear logic as to why they are there and there is just enough introductory backstory that you feel satisfied. (Here's looking at you DC!).Now on that note, the biggest questions of this film are Spidey and BP...Let me just repeat my mantra...MARVEL STUDIOS HAS THE BEST CASTING DEPARTMENT IN FILM RIGHT NOW!!!Chadwick Boseman is phenomenal as the Wakandan hero! And Tom Holland is fantastic as a finally faithful incarnation of our friendly neighborhood Spiderman!The pacing of the film is great, with wildly entertaining set pieces and THE BEST action sequences of not just any Marvel movie but you'd be hard pressed to find this kind of action/fighting scenes in ANY American movie in the last 25 years!Once again, RDJ, Chris Evans and The rest of the crew are in perfect form and deliver strong performances as their comic book counterparts. You can tell they are comfortable playing the characters and have a clear understanding of their roles and motivations.The special effects are top-notch (as expected) but the use of practical effects in conjunction with cgi is flawless and (currently) imperceptible. The sound and music is great...with no weird intro songs (;0) BvS).However, it was not without flaws. There were a couple of small holes that could have used some filler. Although these minor gaps DO NOT detract from the main plot and over all story (I hope WB/DC is listening!).As for entertainment value, this movie is on the money! There is something for everyone! Subtle comedy, action, drama, romance and it shifts between dark tension, light comedy, and all star action seamlessly.From a story perspective, Civil War fits nicely into the MCU's overall plot. It glues together the events of past films into a logical point (up to now). And just when you think all is kosher...the crap doth hit the fan yet again; keeping you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end!Also, the Russo's tip their hat to the source material at least 3 times. (Please keep in mind I have only seen the film once and my sons were with me so there were two instances in which they distracted me during character interactions.)Fans of the original comic should keep their eyes and EARS peeled for these moments as they will bring a nice smile to their faces. Especially, when they look around at the non- comic readers in the theater who have no clue!!!And since I'm on the subject, IF YOU HAVE AN INFANT, DO THE REST OF THE AUDIENCE A FAVOR AND HIRE A SITTER!!!! Or AT LEAST GET THEM OUT OF THE THEATER QUICKLY IF THEY GET FUSSY!As I said in my brief message when I stepped out of the theater, this movie was AWESOME. And I believe it is far superior to anything else to date from Marvel/Disney, FOX or WB/DC. It has raised the bar to another level. WB was wise to release BvS before this movie. Because had it tried to go head to head, it would have been demolished!Luckily, Dr Strange is far off and it will be something completely different. So, like Antman and GOTG, it stands to set itself apart from everything else in Hollywood right now.And there it is. My non-spoiler review of Captain America: Civil War.I give it a 9.4 out of 10!(AND I WILL BE WATCHING IT AT LEAST TWICE MORE IN THEATERS!)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Phenomenal action, but sloppy and inconsistent. Ruined Captain America's character.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, This should have been called "The Avengers: Civil War". That would have been a more appropriate title given what happens in the movie. PROS: Stellar CGI and action. Pleasant surprises with many other Marvel characters they threw in. They made Black Widow stronger and with better fighting scenes. CONS: Iron Man and Captain America were inconsistent to who we know their characters to be. In some ways, their roles were reversed. Without revealing exactly what happens, my conclusion is that they ruined the role model Captain America. It may very well be a reflection of society, who loves the brash and contentious Donald Trump but indicted Mitt Romney as being too perfect. Is a traditional, rule abiding, good old American values Captain America no longer appealing to the masses? It appears so, according to Hollywood.They introduced plot lines that didn't go anywhere (and some were missed opportunities to build out further) and new characters that left you wondering why they were put in in the first place. While you always have to go into these movies with a very hearty suspension of disbelief, there is a lot you have to let go of. You wonder why certain characters were whipping up on others, or why immortal ones weren't wiping out mere humans. While I went into the movie for pure mentally unplugged enjoyment, it was hard to ignore some things. So go into the movie deciding you won't pay attention to what you know about the characters, and try to let the movie take you on the journey the story is trying to tell you. Ignore inconsistencies, don't think too much about it, and watch a movie full of really cool Marvel characters all interacting with each other.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Avengers 2.5: Civil Bore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Political interference in the Avengers' activities causes a rift between former allies Captain America and Iron Man. Politics. Rifts. Allies. That basically sums up this take on Civil War fairly well. And replace 'War' with 'Selfish Disputes'. There's little to sink your teeth into despite marketing "OMG ARE YOU TEAM CAP OR TEAM IRON MAN!?" The end result is Team Neither. Two and half hours of bravado and nobody dies. Oh, except Peggy Carter, she dies from old age. SHOCKING! Captain America: Civil War is not a Captain America film. Fact. Early this week the Russo Bros let slip that they feel Civil War was a reaction to Warner Bros announcing Batman v Superman. And it shows, feeling like just another product off the Disney assembly line: safe, cookie cutter fluff. Considering you all tweet and post MCU related memes, fan theories all year round, there wasn't much point in rewatching previous Marvel films before this release, it's everywhere we go, whether we want it or not. It's not comic book movie fatigue, i'm sick of this middle of the road, stale Marvel Cinematic Universe.New characters are developed better (Spiderman, Black Panther) than others (Martin Freeman) but it's typical Marvel being safe and taking few risks. So because of that i won't list every character and their performance because you know what to expect, it's more of the same. For once, Marvel didn't con us with their trailers, you get what they promised. Apart from seeing Spiderman and Giant Man battling it out, there are few surprises and most of what's on screen feels uninteresting.The amount of similarities with Batman v Superman are interesting: opening with an incident in an African city, camera panning up to a destroyed building with civilian deaths, a chat between heroes that the world is talking and "it's not your fault", bombing of a meeting where the future of our heroes is discussed, a villain who manipulates events to force the heroes to fight, and dead parents are mentioned.Civil War looks more like a Netflix movie with it's washed out visuals and a generic, almost non existent score that has no effort put into it. Outside of the airport battle (although good in parts, it felt like a training exercise than a 'War') there isn't much to shout about. Why is that? Because there's no emotional depth, weight or threat. The opening fight in Lagos involving Crossbones and his henchmen was The Russos once again trying to imitate Bourne, ending up more like G.I. Joe with a touch of shaky cam and over editing right out of Taken 3. A jarring visual experience that tries too hard to be exciting.One of the dumbest things nobody will pick up on (or question because it's such a 'fun' movie, right?) is Tony Stark asking a teenager who's only been Spiderman for 6 months to help him FIGHT one half of THE AVENGERS that also includes A WANTED KILLER in the Winter Soldier. Sure, it was great to see this Peter Parker, young and indecisive interacting with Tony Stark, but come on seriously, is he really going.....oh i forgot, this is a 'fun' movie, i need to turn my brain off.The much hyped discussion for the past year or two has been, "Who's going to die in Civil War?" Do you fanboys really think Marvel is that bold to kill off any of their main characters? There is no death for Captain America like in the comic storyline. How about Bucky? Nope. Oh you thought maybe Marvel would flip the script and kill Tony Stark? WRONG. Therefore, the whole journey is rendered meaningless. Zemo's plan of destroying an 'empire from within', it worked for a few minutes i guess? Suddenly the death of Stark's parents is important after a zillion MCU films, and Bucky was responsible. Okay then. After the dust has settled, Steve Rogers sends a letter to apologise and explain his reasons to Stark. Much like Age of Ultron, ending in such a whimper, a nice little package with a pretty ribbon on top.I'm 35 years old. I grew up on comic books and movies like many kids. In the early 90s, i always imagined what would it be like to see my favourite superheroes on the big screen one day. Fast forward to today and thankfully i can say we all have Bryan Singer's X-Men 2, Days of Future Past, Sam Raimi's Spiderman 2, Zack Snyder's Man of Steel, Joe Johnston's Captain America and many more. These films surprised us, cinematic yet straight out the comics, familiar yet new. After phase one, I feel the MCU isn't matching the standards set. Marvel insist on pandering to general audiences with the movie equivalent of McDonalds. Going into Civil War i was ready to tune out the lame, predictable humour, but i was annoyed where the comic relief came from this time around. "Quick, Ant-Man won't have much screen time, just shoe-horn jokes that the mouth breathers will love, make Falcon say those lines!" was probably Kevin Feige's masterplan. When i can predict what the next shot/line is going to be and the audience is going to belly laugh while i sit there and cringe, i need to admit defeat, clearly these movies are not targeted at me. If you love cheesy jokes written for 5 year olds and fall for the 'wait for it wink wink' approach to those scenes, maybe it's new to you or something, and that's the form of entertainment you think is 'awesome'.Like i said earlier, I'm 35. I don't have time to turn my brain off and lose brain cells faster than normal because Marvel want to dumb down the comic book movie genre with borderline insulting efforts like this. I expected more but all i got was Avengers 2.5: Civil Bore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Masterpiece Marvel will be remembered by</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen all of MCUs but I've never considered them films. More of like a series of product/ TV episodes with great production value. I liked the first Iron Man as its a complete film of its own and structurally sets the ultimate MCU formula that pretty much continue to work with all other movies. I also liked Guardians of the Galaxy which I thought really differed itself from what people think Marvel should be. That being said I've always thought Feige was a genius in the fact that he doesn't set out to do "comic book" movies but rather playing with different genres within the same universe. Yet Captain America: Civil War is a totally different animal. It's the ultimate Marvel movie that geeks like myself dream of in their head ever since they announced plan to do shared universe back in 2009. Ensemble movies are hard to pull off strictly from a storytelling perspective. Balancing characters, keeping each motivation simple and understandable, tonally fresh, thematically focused, and with just right amount of pace that keeps the momentum going and in the case of of this one: digging deeper into existing characters AND introducing brand new ICONIC ones without ruining the whole narrative. Civil War actually does all of them but never forgets to keep it fun and action-packed enough in the process. Black Panther is a classic yet niche character in the universe. But they amount of care that went into introducing and forging him into this already crowded ensemble is handled with great care and details. Spiderman is on a mission as well but the Russo brothers spends enough time with him to bring the character, along with his origin and new background almost seamlessly and with great humor into the MCU. All of these make the airport smackdown scene all the more memorable as we can easily root for all of the characters at their most classic selves.Perhaps the most difficult achievement in all of this is that with all the fireworks at play and character motivations, Cap is still at the very core of the story. This is after all, a Captain America movie and they never seize to remind you of that as it starts and end with his arc completed and emotionally satisfying.It just doesn't get better than this. So stop reading now and get a ticket.</fullReview>

Too much of the movie is just talking about "do we sign the agreement?", "Should we sign?", "Will they sign?", "I feel so bad about what happened", "How can they not see what is right?".. There was barely a time for anything else, and until we did see something else and you think that maybe that's it, the movie is starting, we soon go back to the same talking. I have given it 6 stars since still on its own, its an OK movie, but if you compare it to other Marvel movies, it's relatively at the bottom and one of their worst.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I can't Take This Anymore...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yet another unoriginal bland superhero movie packed full of clichés blah blah blah blah.I'll start off by saying that I'm aware that these movies are supposed to be fun and not taken all too seriously, but I'm sorry, that is not a sufficient excuse for such an effortless straight up boring script and narrative throughout many recent (and particularly this) Marvel films that have come about, aside from maybe Ant-Man and Deadpool it seems like these movies are just carbon copies of each other each more unoriginal and irrelevant than the last, and yet critics eat up this uninspired drivel over and over.There is almost nothing unique about this film, and this is coming from someone that is relatively familiar with the civil-war comic books, this film lacks any of the depth, complexities or tension that was contained in the source material. Characters are completely one dimensional and never get seriously hurt, knowing they will never die takes any suspense away from the drawn out CGI fight-scenes completely. The narrative and dialogue is just poorly written and beyond all entirely dull, there aren't even character arks, its just damn bland badly written story with no outstanding qualities at all. I find it extremely difficult to care about any of these characters really especially given the comically black and white nonsensical positions that start this very anti-climactic "Civil War" to begin with.There isn't really more to say, if you like ultimately uninteresting mindless action films I suppose you might like this, but thats all that can really be said for it. There are many characters that aren't even one-dimensional and they borderline on figures to fill the screen and plot-devices *cough cough* Falcon and Hawkeye *cough cough* The brand new spiderman is somehow manages to be even worse than Garfield's even with his very limited and completely unnecessary addition to the movie, his costume is Green-Lantern level bad, anyone who says differently is lying to themselves.Thats my take, truthfully I hated this movie, and this is coming from someone who, for the most part enjoyed the last Avengers movie for what it was, but the fact that these glaring flaws continue to be ignored by moviegoers and critics alike is nothing short of maddening.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>- SPOILER FREE - (As long as you've watched the trailers)(TLDR at bottom)Going into Captain America: Civil War (I'll call it Civil War from now) I was extremely excited for the film. This was something I was really excited for, especially after the success that was Winter Soldier. I knew the Russo's knew what they were doing with Cap and were good at both progressing plot and developing characters. Something I love in film. So how does Civil War stand up? The answer, in short, is that it's good.All I've seen said about this film is praise, 10 stars and shouts of this film being a classic. Whilst I wouldn't say this film is a classic, it's not a bad film. One of the film's main attractions comes in the promise of the Avengers being split in half and going head to head against one another, and you get that in heaps. There are plenty of fights in this film between heroes, with the exception of the very first fight every single fight in this film is between the heroes that have been developed in previous movies, and the action is stellar. Considering the vast majority of these heroes only rely on hand-to- hand combat it's really amazing that the action feels so fresh and swift, it's something to definitely be commended, and all of the fights feel swift and real.With the action pretty much down, how does the story do? Here I have a bit of an issue. In my eyes, the plot is a bit of a mess. Literally so much drama could have been avoided if anyone just TALKED to someone on the other side of the argument, at least ATTEMPT to reason with the opposing side before going in with guns blazing. There is also a villain in this film that has an extremely convoluted plot, a plan that relies almost entirely on coincidence and luck. I think the film could have done without him. So overall, the plot is relatively weak.But how does the character development fair? For the most part it's done pretty well. The film wisely decides to focus most of it's attention on Captain America and Bucky (aka: Winter Soldier) as it is still a Captain America film. With these two characters you can really sense both of their struggles. Bucky's done a lot of bad things that fall on his shoulders but he did them all brain washed and only now is regaining his identity whilst nearly everyone else wants him gone. Cap is determined to help his friend where no one else will, to help that one lost soul from his past, the last healthy memory of the world Cap once knew and can never get back. It's very well done stuff. Iron Man gets some decent development too. It's good to see Stark on the back foot and struggling to keep everything together when it's all falling apart, Stark trying to amend for past mistakes and being fought against. It's a side of Stark we haven't really seen before. Widow also has an interesting plot in her deciding between choosing what she knows is safe and what her guts want her to go. Other than this, however, the development is poor, ESPECIALLY for Vision and Scarlet Witch.But overall, here's why this film can not be higher than a seven. It accomplishes nothing. It's a problem I had with Age of Ultron and it's a problem I have here. In these movies, where the universe is slowly being build upon piece by piece, I want each movie to have an impact on the universe, for the world to adapt and alter because of the events in the film. I felt Civil War could have been more. Ultimately, once the film is finished, everyone pretty much ends up where they began and it just makes me a little disappointed. What I loved so much about Winter Soldier was the pretty interesting plot, the development of characters and the companionship of Cap and Black Widow. Understandably this couldn't be focused on as much due to the cast, but it still feels lacking. Also, Winter Soldier changed a lot. It introduced a new character, new motivations, it collapsed SHIELD and the characters changed. You don't get that in Civil War. It's not that the film's bad, it's not it's actually quite good, but for me it's good in the places I care less about so I can't really give it more than a seven. I had fun and got what I wanted at the core but I felt like just a few more tweaks could have made this one of the greats.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Compared to the first and second films in the Captain America franchise, Captain America: Civil War isn't quite as fun or thrilling unless impressive CGI and loud action sequences are enough to whet your appetite. Captain America: The First Avenger had a riveting plot that kept you at the edge of your seat. This one lacks suspense and is jam-packed with so many superheroes that, unless you're already very familiar with the franchise, you'll forget why you should be caring about these cardboard characters and their relations to begin with. Attempts to generate poignancy fall flat and come across as clunky while the wafer-thin plot feels stretched too thinly.Winter soldier still is the best MCU movie... And this is overrated as hell...critics are ruining good DC movies box office like BvS MoS and Watchmen.. MCU tried to do something different and managed to stick to the same old mediocre formula ..

		<fullReview>They battle each other. There is no villain, maybe some villain who just wants revenge from the other movie. It's funny how the actors and split up to go and promote this in Asia and Europe constantly saying how "this movie changes everything," when someone points a phone camera on them. What is it changing, that they are battling each other? I agree. It is great. The good vs bad thing is tired. This is a fresh idea. The villains are not the point here anymore because villains do not get people into seats, it's always the heroes. The villains are an afterthought.Plot: The movie is about Bucky, again, the sidekick turned brainwashed person, always running around, it's like the guy is out of control! It's like the only point is giving the original superheroes more screen time while introducing a couple of new ones for their own movies. The movie is kind of banal but I *like* this banal. There's all this plot about *official* type Documents that have to be *signed* by the superheroes about destruction which goes with the whole "reality" thing. Also If you don't like some of the crappier superheroes oh well, you gotta watch them all, but no one is overpowered and the only two overpowered superheroes are on opposing sides, a woman and man which is good, otherwise everyone would be just vaporized, know what I am saying? I'm saying these two can make Civil Peace hehe.Humor: There are good moments here. A lot of quips from everyone.Action: Action is good, maybe too good, you see how stuff and people get damaged grittily. Plus the action is going into new holes of goodness, not banal! But some movies have terrible action scenes but is that really a bad thing? It's more about who looks good in those bodysuits. I mean they're not going to walk around in shorts with dress shoes and knee-high socks.Box-office: This is important because without the money put in and gotten, these might as well be Youtube videos with people in alleyways. Let's see how the movie truly does in the box- office because it's called "Captain America", especially in other countries it would be like America watching "Captain Asia" or "Captain Antarctica." But it is still banking on the good of the other movies in this saga so yay.Superheroes: These movies really just come down to these things who do you choose, team this team that. The noble guy with the shield, the badboy in the suit who flies around, then everyone else is popping up too, someone with magic powers coming out the hands like out of Final Fantasy, some sort of a Cat person. It's like a video game where you can pick your player. The guy who shoots arrows is currently the *only* one who still uses this technology which is astounding. It just goes to show that more action movies should implement more arrow technology to chill out, just whip it out, cock it and BANG! Enemy goes down. This actor in an interview says his character was retired shooting all holes in one at golf and then gets asked to rejoin so his AIM is on point. Anyone remember AIM? Wow seems so simple before this era of social media.Overview: More of a bridge movie not its own thing but good action scenes. It's interesting how the Bucky actor says he puts some jelly on his arm to get into the metal arm. Buck me.Peek me on: https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7497943.Alan_Malraux? from_search=true&amp;search_version=servicehttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/13392796.Jon_Mickus? from_search=true&amp;search_version=service</fullReview>

You know i look it in 3D and in every punch, the camera rotates 2-3 times my eyes get tired, and i became eye cancer.. No soundtrack or anything else what can you cheer up at fighting only to much superheros who they try to make their power in balance... standing 6 vs 6 in a row and with the "ding ding ding" they run at each other ... you know they compares it with BvS i saw that too 2 months ago and i can remember every fight scene and there was epic moments (like "Do you bleed" and all the other battle quotes) but here .. i cannot, the only flop's in the film is Spiderman and Black panther, and I'm a Black panther fan, Spiderman was very good, but all the others shouldn't be in the film, there was too much and it was not a "Be" for all them, you can explain the storyline in 20 seconds and i couldn't stand it in the theater... i even forget a time that there was a villain, and they say "great moves" and other things... nah, widow again with his leg around neck turning back flip moves what we see in every films she appears a 20 time, vision at the fight with only two lame laser shots, you know when you saw deadpool you cant laugh at the little jokes in here, the travel and the place switches they couldn't do it,captain fights at Africa a time 2 seconds later he is in a funeral ... you know, are my expectations to high?i don't know, the only thing i can remember panther, winter and capt. Can run faster than vehicles and twice then usain bolt sry marvel fans I'm a big comic book-film fan but this was not what we need ..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>DC vs. Marvel: Surprisingly DC won</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>- Contains spoilers -This is my first review and since I am German, forgive me any grammatical mistakes.However my verdict is no mistake.It seems to be Zeitgeist, that heroes fight against heroes. In Cap3 we see Cap and Iron-Man fight against each other because Tony Stark feels bad about people getting killed (actually nobody meant for anybody to die, but Wanda's decision was not the brightest). In my opinion the suicide-bomber version in the Civil- War-Comics was a better one, than the "colleteral damage-version" in the movie. But that was not enough for Tony Stark to get mad as a douche-bag. Bucky killed his parents (don't remember that from any comic I've read). Don't you think, that's overkill? In my opinion it would have been the wiser choice, that Captain America doubts his action, since he was more involved in the deaths than Iron-Man. Wanda should have chosen an SM-outfit (remember Speedball in the comics), because she was involved in the deaths of many. Why does Tony Stark suffer more than Cap, when a mother gives him a photo of her son who died in the Age of Ultron-movie? My verdict: The comic on which the movie is based convinced me much more of the conflict. In the comic-books Peter Parker chose to reveal his secret identity, because that was what the government demanded so that heroes were no loose canons.DC's Batman vs. Superman wasn't as funny as Cap3 was, but: The fight between Supe and Bat was orchestrated more convincingly. The end of the fight was a humane shift of Bat's opinion, which stirred a lot of emotions in me. Cap3 let me laugh out loud in some scenes, but did not move me emotionally. If you like Cap3 and haven't watched Batman vs. Superman, please give it a try.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Marvel Studios have done it yet again. Just when they appeared to be running out of steam after Age of Ultron and Ant-Man sat comfortably in the middle of the MCU canon, they strike back with this enormously entertaining series-booster. Essentially Avengers 2.5, this movie is crowded with so many well-known characters it's a miracle it's a movie at all, let alone a coherent and consistently exhilarating one. When the end credits roll there's disappointment rather than relief, unlike other recent superhero vs superhero efforts. The plot mechanics don't completely hold up under scrutiny ? especially the antagonist's scheme ? but it is the pitch-perfect character interaction that propels the story in between the multitude of kick-arse action sequences. And what kick-arse action sequences they are! Bookended with an impressively gritty Bourne-esque set piece and a seriously personal (and intense) punch up, each battle is cleverly given it's own spin to avoid feeling repetitive. Nothing tops the truly remarkable showdown amongst superhero friends though; with everyone fighting everyone, a web-slinging newbie stealing the show and a HUGE surprise, it confidently challenges the New York alien beat-down for MCU's greatest set piece. It doesn't quite reach Guardians levels of humour but there's a wonderful levity maintained throughout and the quip-filled dialogue is often laugh-out-loud funny, strongly aided by the rock-solid cast (both familiar and new). Picking a standout amongst such an electrifyingly diverse group of players is impossible; series regulars ? Cap (Evans), Iron Man (RDJ), Black Widow (ScarJo), et al ? are always excellent, whilst newcomers Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and Spider-Man (Tom Holland) are both downright awesome. Somehow fresh despite having a dozen films come before it in the MCU, Civil War is a near-perfect popcorn flick that galvanises enthusiasm for the upcoming onslaught of Marvel adventures.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outstanding! Marvel is unstoppable!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>CAPTAIN America: CIVIL WAR is the best Marvel movie yet. It's superhero conflict done right! Spectacular action sequences, it's well thought out, it's got nicely placed humor here and there, the plot and the motivations make sense, all the characters have fair share amount of screen time, and may I just say that the new Spider-Man is totally awesome! Even if you didn't grow up reading comic books, you will geek out every step of the way. This film is every bit as fun as 2012's "The Avengers." One of the many brilliant things that Marvel's Kevin Feige and his creative team and writers and directors did is that they already mapped out Marvel Cinematic Universe, they already know what A through Z will be and how to connect the dots in between. And so when Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross (William Hurt) shows the Avengers the disastrous consequences of their saving-the-world efforts, we the audience feel the impact as well because we remember those individual movies which lead up to this installment, they're still fresh in our memories. And in CAPTAIN America: CIVIL WAR, the repercussion of Cap vs. The Winter Soldier continues to be force that drives the story forward, because it's actually more layered than we think.I know what you're going to ask me. What do I think of the new Spider-Man? Fair enough. Before we get to that, let me just say that my initial concerns that this movie would end up just being some kind of Avengers 2.5 instead of a Cap movie, because of the inclusion of so many characters, my initial concerns subside because again, by this time, Marvel already knows what they're doing, they know how to balance fun and intense action, they know that they have to showcase the skills and traits of each character instead of applying one size fits all. Screenwriters Christopher Markus, Stephen McFeely with directors Anthony Russo and Joe Russo are all master storytellers. OK.. so Spider-Man. He's alright. I'm kidding. He's awesome! And I truly mean that. Actor Tom Holland is perfect in this role. No offense to Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield, but Holland's version is the Spidey that we the fans have been anticipating and I'm not talking just about his wise-cracking sarcasm, Holland owns it, he embodies it, he has some of the coolest lines in this film. And this whole idea of picking up the character from the middle and putting him into the mix, is absolutely brilliant because Spider-Man's time in CAPTAIN America: CIVIL WAR is as significant and as scene-stealing as Quicksilver was in "X-Men: Days Of Future Past," he's the one most fans will talk about long after this movie's done.Another great addition is Chadwick Boseman as Black Panther, and wait till you get a load of the surprise that Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) will have for you in the well-choreographed airport scene which is the part where both teams ultimately clash. That said, there is an underlying secret, there is a common enemy so smart that he doesn't even have to get his hands dirty, that's how clever this script is, because it's more than just about Sokovia accords or putting superheroes in check, and the reason the characters clash makes sense, it's more than just about a simple payback. That ability to keep itself fresh at every turn is one of the many, many strengths of CAPTAIN America: CIVIL WAR. The story ends with you wondering if your favorite heroes would ever join forces again when a greater threat like Thanos finally comes to town. What an outstanding film with great performances across the board. In this year where Daredevil is fighting Punisher on TV, Superman is fighting Batman on the big screen and apparently Charlize Theron's Ravenna is fighting Emily Blunt's Freya in "The Huntsman: Winter's War,"... CAPTAIN America: CIVIL WAR trumps all.-- Rama's Screen --</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've made up my mind (although I thought this before, but I've forgotten): Marvel movies (aside from X-Men) are for little kids, nerds, immature boys... you get the point. The first Avengers was... okay (there was SOMETHING in there that just didn't "click"... something broken... something forced... something very, very cheap... like it shouted "IT'S AN Imitation!!!" from a distance. And indeed, if anyone remembers, Avengers were made AFTER The Justice League... a mere copy... a pale replica... a teenage-nerdy attempt to create a rival universe... But everything in this universe seems to be very poorly inspired... and sustained by tongue-in-cheek jokes that offer a very short relief every now and then... So many Marvel fanboys have "demolished" Batman V Superman (which was a FAR superior movie... artistically made)... well... boys... if you like your puppet toys of Cap America and Iron Man... no one will forbid you to play with them as much as your kiddie heart pleases... but when you grow up you will desire a different kind of movies... and then you'll understand Snyder's version of a more mature superhero movie... Tonight I wanted to leave the theater ... but because it's an IMAX theater i tormented myself into remaining till the very end... It was a silly, poorly-scripted, miserably-put-together attempt of milking money from people... Absolutely NOTHING aroused my interest... didn't care about any of the characters... (literally!!!) - in short: LAME - LAME - LAME!!! I swore to myself i will never see any Avengers-related movie again... this cow is almost comatose... of how much they milked it already... It would be humane to finally let it rest in piece... But they're too profit-oriented to listen to the wisdom that says "retire while still in full glory" (even now it's too late for them anyway...)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Russo brothers deliver one of the great comic-book films to the MCU</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back when Captain America: Civil War was announced during a Marvel Studios event in 2014, the anticipation I have had for this entry into the Marvel Cinematic Universe has been rising with every single passing moment. Kevin Feige, the president of Marvel Studios, stood on a stage and announced the next Captain America film would be named Serpent Society and every single person was left a little underwhelmed. Then he backtracked and revealed the film's true title, as well as bringing out Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr. to a deafening noise from the excited crowd.Taking elements from the popular Civil War comic and rearranging a few things to make it fit the continuity of the MCU, Marvel turned to the Russo brothers, Anthony and Joe, who did such a good job with The Winter Soldier, to bring this story to the big screen. The Russo brothers have struck gold once again with Civil War, a film that may not only be the best entry into the MCU but one of the greatest comic-book films ever made.After events in New York, Washington DC, Sokovia and finally, a botched mission in Lagos, the Avengers, led by Captain America (Chris Evans), are brought in by the US government to sign the Sokovia Accords, a document that states the Avengers must work under government supervision rather than their own free will. Many people still see them as heroes yet there is a growing number of people who see them as nothing more than vigilantes who should be put on a leash, or stopped altogether. Captain America, who also has the trouble of finding his best friend Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan) before he's taken out for good, decides against signing the document, causing a rift between not only himself and Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), but splitting the Avengers right down the middle.While the Avengers, with the exception of Thor and Hulk, are all in Civil War, it is still most definitely a Captain America film, driven by a very personal story for the First Avenger. I have to applaud the writers, Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, for the job they have done delivering a strong emotional core to Civil War. Captain America's main priority is getting Bucky, operating as the Winter Soldier for years, back at all costs and the effect it has on his friendship with Tony Stark is devastating, culminating in an emotionally fuelled finale that will leave you torn. These are characters we've spent eight years following so to see them come to blows, especially when you can agree with why both are fighting, makes you genuinely care about the fight itself and the fallout of it all. One of the highlights of The Winter Soldier was the action, particularly the hand-to-hand fights, and it's great to see the Russo brothers deliver brilliant action once again. The film is full of pulsating action whether it be close quarter combat or blistering chase sequences however, the stand-out action sequence in Civil War comes in the form of an all out brawl between two teams made up of various Avengers in a German airport. It's full of wonderful character moments and some brilliantly executed fun surprises, making it quite possibly one of the greatest scenes in any comic-book film. One of my worries for Civil War was whether there would be too many characters in one film. It could have been a recipe for disaster and ended in a convoluted mess but that is definitely not the case. The Russo brothers do the characters we are familiar with justice as well as introducing new faces that I can't wait to see again in the MCU. Both Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr. have never been better in their respective roles of Captain America and Tony Stark. Downey Jr. in particular gives a really memorable performance as a guilt ridden Stark who feels the Avengers should be reined in. All of the other familiar faces are brought to life with good performances but the real stand-outs are the new characters that we'd all been dying to see in action. First up is Chadwick Boseman in the role of T'Challa/Black Panther, a prince and warrior of Wakanda. Boseman cuts a very regal and imposing figure as Black Panther, more than holding his own against the likes of Captain America and the Winter Soldier. Then there is Peter Parker/Spider-Man, played by Tom Holland. This is Spider-Man's debut in the MCU after Sony agreed to share the rights with Marvel Studios so they had to get it right. They didn't just get it right, they nailed it with Spider- Man. This is the Spider-Man I've wanted to see for some time now, quip after quip during the airport fight and a distinct awkwardness as Peter Parker, and I can't wait to see more of him in the future. I will wait to see how his solo film pans out but we could be seeing the best Spider- Man yet here. Take note DC, this is how you introduce new characters that will go on to shape the future of your cinematic universe.Juggling a film of this magnitude with the vast array of characters on show is no easy challenge, yet it's one that the Russo brothers thrive on. They have delivered a brilliant comic-book film in Captain America: Civil War and, with the stakes even higher and more characters to come for the next Avengers films, they are certainly the right men for the job.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A solid superhero flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I rarely have high expectation for Marvel films but i went to see the premier of Civil War anyway because i heard many good things about this film. And it didn't disappoint me.Civil War was certainly the most ambitious attempt of Marvel studio. The story was more mature, darker than any films they have made before. It is well-built with unexpected and impactful twist (for people who haven't read comic books like me). It had many significant and serious conflicts between characters and inner conflicts of themselves. All heroes we knew had to choose between their friendship, brotherhood, and the Greater good through out the film. They were torn apart by their past, their own decisions and their own friends. There were some cliché moments but the drama was handled quite well. Therefore it made action scenes more substantial, more intense and more meaningful.I personally didn't like action scenes much mainly because they were filled with too many cuts, shaky cams and typical vapid humour. But they were decent nonetheless and their style fit with the fast pace of the film. Btw the music and sound effect were good in those scenes.Also even through the movie was mature and dark but it still make me smile several times by some light-hearted momentsA good film and entertaining cinema experience: 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found myself observing this film with a feeling of mild amusement, pondering over how the hell this franchise has gained so much traction and popularity. Smash, punch, abominable one-liner, rinse, repeat.The traditional elements of a superhero movie have been totally removed, replaced by unrelatable shiny suits and often totally unexplained superpowers. Personal growth, strength in the face of adversity, finding you've got something special when you feel ordinary: that's a superhero movie.Give me Deadpool, GOTT or the original Spiderman. Give me some depth, story, even a touch of reality.They might as well have filmed this whole movie in a wrestling ring and saved a few million dollars. I'm sure the kids that bump it up to a shocking 8.5 on IMDb would still be quaking with excitement behind their 3-D specs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Once again, The Russo's have proved their prowess in making excellent superhero films. The story was magnificent! Each character had their own little arc for them to develop in, unlike in most movies, where too many characters means little development for other characters, but this movie pulled it off with grace! And let me say that airport scene, and any other action scene in this film, OH MY GOD! The choreography was spot on. Every fight has emotional depth. I can feel myself almost crying at some points. And SPIDERMAN! This Spiderman was the best Spiderman and the best Peter Parker I saw on screen to DATE! And Black Panther, I haven't forgot about him, he was great too! This movie is just so near perfect, it's unbelievable. And now let me address all those fanboys calling me and other reviewers Marvel biased fanboys for giving this movie a high score. IT DESERVES IT. This was a payoff of 8 years of hard work. It's everything Batman v Superman isn't.So in concusion. It was Amazingly, Spectacularly Great. 10/10 would see, would see again, would buy, and would die for. Thank you Russo Brothers, for bringing my childhood fantasies to life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Opening to Marvel: Phase Three is a simple: Oh, by God!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"There was no way more perfect and majestic to start Phase Three of Marvel Cinematic Universe"This "Captain America: Civil War" Review contains some spoilers. If you have not seen "Civil War" film, please, do not read, this could destroy it.A few years ago, approximately, five or six years, Marvel had in its hands one script and one proposal that possessed enough unknowns. That project would receive the name of "Avengers". The biggest concern for the owners of the company was supposed to make a film where not only a hero was the protagonist, may break the story, be boring and completely commercial. Two years later, on May 4, 2012, "Marvel's The Avengers" landed in all movie theaters, solving each and every one of those unknowns on just the first day at the box office. Today, Mayo 2016, "Civil War" increases its number of participants to 12 heroes and 3 villains. Will this be the film event of the year? I don't know, I can only assure, Marvel has lost the fear and perhaps in the next few years its projects could reach total perfection (Avengers: Infinity War Part:1 or 2).Based on the Comic of 2006-2007, movie serves as a sequel to "Age of Ultron" and "Captain America: The Winter Soldier". After all the fighting and disaster in "Ultron", the Avengers return to discuss issues still more violent than in 2015, the death of innocents (something very, very similar to what we saw in "BvS", with Superman, and then say that they are polar opposites) and the dilemma, Does our help really help?Thaddeus "Thunderbolt" Ross (William Hurt, reprising his role from The Incredible Hulk) immediately ordered a conference to bring together to acclaimed heroes. After showing the dramatic and terrible consequences of their actions, it opens way for the culprit of this civil war. Sokovia Accords established by the United Nations. That treaty, aims to put each of the actions and missions of the Avengers in the hands of the United Nations for so, take care of each human life, taking into account that it will be them who decide if the heroes can act or not. As expected, not everyone agrees. They needed something for fight, here is their reason. After discussions, different thoughts, ideologies and equations, the decisions are made. 36 hours, two teams, a objective, an end, and Russo Brothers, Civil War has begun!I affirm with all security and respect that "Civil War" has the best sequences of action of Marvel films so far, with sophisticated and perfect choreographies and training. A true example, and personally one of the best parts of the movie, the fight at Berlin airport. The presentation of both sides, literally, made me cry, its class, its style, its elegance and its professionalism to mix and combine each of the specific abilities (physical and emotional) of the old and new heroes, to create a scene of entertainment, quality and long, long fight makes that truly the public continues to support to "Marvel" for continue, (Curious fact: Directors David Leitch and Chad Stahelski ("John Wick") are part of the second unit of the film)."Spider-Man is the equivalent to Wonder Woman in Civil War"Special relevance has the presentation of Spider-man and Black Panther. Their inclusion is appropriate, the first is introduced in way more relaxed and comic, who along with his fight and jokes makes this be the best performance in the Peter Parker story.Another hero who had appointment was a Black Panther, an heir to the throne full of hatred and pain, perfect for his own movie and with a fresh and innovative appearance. In addition, other friends already seen previously are incorporate to the group as "Ant-Man", associating the world of past facts (seen in the films) with the present, something that really strengthens and gives coherence to the Marvel Universe. While many characters used this as a springboard for their own films (Spider Man - Black Panther), all boils down to the personal conflict revealed at the end between these three men, it is something that goes beyond policies, laws, treaties or rules, this is personal. Russo brothers take the decision after pleasing to the public with that magnificent fight, they there will be no more effects, flying planes, cobwebs, or CGI, for that moment, they weave meticulously a narrow path to focus on the three real protagonist of the story, Tony, Steve and Bucky.And then, arrive the final fight, "Iron Man" vs. "Captain America" a dispute of friends. The fact that Bucky was defeated and they could fight each other was really fantastic, this is not a trick more to win more money, it is the destiny. Personally, I felt like the final fight between Batman and Superman, that anger but at the same time love, that hate but at the same time forgiveness , it created a swirl of emotions and thoughts that ended in fatalism. "CW" had all the unimaginable, and even the enigmatic and traditional cameo appearance of Stan Lee.Phase three has begun. If Marvel offers us more equal or better products that this, will sound crazy but, they could reach the level and love of critics and fans to "Star Wars" . Goodbye to the cliché about Marvel films are cheap fiction and paste sh_t, quality exists. "Civil War" gives us a true contrast of "BvS", but is just as tasty, fruitful and exciting. "CW" is the best film of "Marvel" so far. It plants strong and resistant foundations to the future to come, leaving a hard and impossible work for Warner Bros. with "Suicide Squad" and Fox and Marvel (again) with "X-Men: Apocalypse" in May and "Doctor Strange" in November.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best MCU Movies So Far</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was lucky enough to see an early screening of this movie. From the opening scene till the final battle, I was completely blown away. First off I'm gonna start by talking about the performances.This is the best acting we've seen in the MCU hands down. To highlight a few, Robert Downey Junior gives a Tony Stark a more personal side that we have yet to completely see if him. Chadwick Boseman and Tom Holland are both perfectly casted as Black Panther and Spider-Man respectively. The action was great. The relationships that these characters have built over the course of several movies creates a new level of complexity that makes these fight sequences more emotional and powerful. The Airport Battle is the best action scene in the MCU and is rivaled only by the Quicksilver scene from DOFP. The final thing I have to say about what made this movie so damn good, was the fact that all of the events in this movie are permanent and will have a long lasting impact. The only complaint I've had with the MCU is the fact that most of the events in their movies are resolved by the climax and there is no lasting impact on future films. While no future films have come out at the time I've written this review, it still seems safe to say that the events in this movie will have a permanent effect on the rest of the MCU. It is rare that I go into a movie with this high of expectations and i leave the theater completely blown away. 10/10 Great Movie</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Marvel film, Yet.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cynically speaking, the whole mold that the latest Marvel movie creates, is a colossal set up that engenders subsequent sequels and solo outings in the ever expanding Marvel Cinematic Universe. The third for titular Captain America, "Civil War" is essentially the third Avengers film, starting with events happening a year after "Age of Ultron". That is not to say the film is mistakenly titled, because it still is, in all important aspects, a Captain America movie. It's just that, he isn't alone. The sheer size of this potential billion-dollar movie calls for an equally mammoth effort from sibling directors, Anthony and Joe Russo, who also both helmed Cap's previous film, Winter Soldier. Their deft maneuver results in a beautifully crafted cinematic piece, whose towering bravura, bestows the entire proceedings with striking depth and sentimentality, which may not be the first for the genre, but enough to make it Marvel's best film, to date.In "Civil War", the brewing enmity between Steve Rogers/ Captain America (Chris Evans) and Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) inevitably arises and turns bitter in the wake of their relentless campaigns to save humanity. The irony emerges amidst of their efforts, when greater authority finally asked who should be held accountable for the collateral damages brought both by their offensive and defensive operations. The motion begins to roll when a mission in Lagos resulted to unexpected amount of destruction and deaths.Differences in views divide the once solid group into two colliding factions. With Stark and his allies resigned to submit under the Sokovia Accords, Captain and the rest of his team, move away with staunch stand to operate freely under no greater force's jurisdiction. There is an intelligent attempt from both sides to meet halfway, but battle line is imminently drawn as a result of another attack which Cap's best buddy, Winter Soldier? now simply, Bucky Barnes? is believed to orchestrate. Doctrinal contrasts force heroes to pick sides, and the resulting chaos ensues a much bigger damage than what came in the missions they've previously pulled off together.While Joss Whedon's "Age of Ultron" is as massive as a superhero movie could be, Russo's Civil War is colossal in its own right, maintaining the former's size as it shifts to a more character- driven narrative, with its emotional weight heaviest on Steve Rogers' shoulders. There is a striking hint of effort to not overpopulate the proceedings with relentless chaos and destructions, but the ones inevitably allowed, are delivered in immaculate visual glory, each explosive action set- piece captured with breathtaking panoramic ingenuity. Even with all the intersecting plot lines laid out for every important character of this superhero extravaganza, they all eventually converge at one point, in which Captain Rogers and his connection with Stark, plays a key part. There is a visceral profoundness in how his character is written that finally places him at the center of his own film, and Evans has his commitment fully deployed for the role. And for a film whose own size seems to undermine its very own titular hero, the accomplished feat is truly massive for Captain, himself.A film of this size naturally gets devoured by its very own ambitions. Character-wise, Civil War is as big as the last two Avengers movies. And while Thor and Hulk are both missing in action here, newcomers are welcomed to fill in their shoes. The film facilitates the solid introduction of Chad Boswick's Black Panther, whose stand-alone film is due in 2018. But perhaps, as most people who've seen it, will say, the entry of the amazing web- slinger is the film's most anticipated highlight. Tom Holland's Spider- Man is a breath of fresh air, and it delivers some hope for the character's looming third big screen incarnation, next year. His comic timing may have been at par with that of Paul Rudd's Ant- Man, who shares one of the most genuine fanboy moments in the movie. This lightness comes amid the political tensions and philosophical differences between the opposing forces, one that is utterly missing in DC's Batman v Superman's messed-up attempt to pull off an essentially similar drama, last month.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Certainly not one to miss, another knock out of the park by Marvel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As visually impressive as it striking and powerful. Captain America: Civil War does an outstanding job of juggling a multitude of moving and important parts that it's absolutely ludicrous that the movie is as coherent as it is. But somehow it just works. I'm at a loss for words, as to how the Joe and Anthony Russo were able to craft something so compelling and thematically respectable, using superheroes to tell a serious and heavy story, while understanding and being more than willing to provide levity throughout the film. The fight scenes and choreography are tight and extremely well done, and while they do lose a little edge do to some fast editing, I won't knock how exhilarating certain scenes are throughout the film. They took big leaps with this movie and it sure paid off. And I'm very much taking into account that I just saw the movie, and I'm still dealing with the rush of anxiety that came with almost not getting in. But as I cool down I'm definitely feeling that excitement lifted. Not that you weren't already gonna see it, but if you weren't, I highly recommend it, based purely on it's wow fact, enjoyment, and great storytelling. I can't wait to see this again opening night.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Civil War will succeed, BvS has failed.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once again, Marvel has proved itself to make good movies, all movies depend on a good script, good director and good producer which Marvel has all three. Those who think BvS is better than Marvel is clearly psychotic, Autistic, mentally unstable, delusional and paranoid at the same time. Dc films except the dark knight trilogy does not however. Marvel films has a good balance in characters and jokes and dark moments while doing all very good at the same time. BvS has shown nothing interesting in particular or potential to expand their universe, watch Winter soldier, and Iron man, they are the best films to be made and the rest of Marvel films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not even going to get into the plot or events as they are played out. I'm sickened by this movie just like Superman v Batman. Seriously? We can't find enough bad guys, no, we have to take our heroes and tear them apart. Pitting two of our more famous "good guys" against each other brings out the worst in them. Alas it doesn't just bring out the worst in them, simply by forcing other heroes to take sides we ruin their reputations as well. "Heroes" fighting against "Heroes" shows us we really don't have any heroes left to root for. Thanks for ruining our heroes for us. Bottom line in the Marvel Universe? There are NO good guys. Just shades of bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great Movie:Epic/True Super Hero movie My Friend: Im not gonna spoil one single thing, since this movie should be seen by only the two trailers you probably saw. Don't watch any TV spots after the second trailer or whatever!Im gonna touch a few aspects and rate them.Acting: Of course it's amazing. The characters we were waiting for were black panther and of course SPIDERMAN! Both were done amazing! Spiderman has a bigger role than I personally expected and it's done with grace. Love it. Black Panther was such a good character with great motivation why he's doing what he's doing. The acting per usual from the other characters were great! 10/10 Story: Now where another (let's leave it) unnamed superhero movie failed this year, and no I'm not talking about dead-pool.., was the story. Now this story is what I expected from the other unnamed superhero movie. I didn't know what side I wanted to be on; cap's or iron man's. I was so conflicted and even while they're fighting you don't know who to root for. The villain in this movie felt a bit, not really out of place, but unnecessary in my opinion. But Marvel always struggles to find a good fleshed out villain except for Loki &amp; kingpin in the series. 8/10 Action/Cinematography: O boy..If you're an action freak you will love this, if you're a comic book fan.. you're gonna LIVE these amazing action set pieces. The much anticipated airport scene is AMAZING. You've seen nothing, literally nothing of the amazing action that will bestow upon you guys. The airport scene is in complete IMAX and has a runtime of around 17 minutes. Just let that sink in! The Russo brothers know how to create great action and film it great as well. I can go on record and say this is by far the best superhero action scenes ever. 20/10. Verdict: Was it a perfect movie? No. But for me as a fan it came darn close. The only thing that bothered me were the villains, well actually one of the few that are in there. Was it better than... Batman v superman.. yes by far. I mean we're in a comic book movie year, so we might as well compare it. Batman v superman lacked in a lot of places and civil war just did it better. Just the conflict in ideologies made it so much more believable why the characters fought and because this whole story arc is happening now after 2 cross over movies, 3 iron movies and 2 cap movies.. the stakes are so incredibly high. I tried to compare dead-pool with it as well, but it's a different movie in terms of it being a solo movie and setting something up, instead of showing a conflict between good and good instead of good and evil. Checkmate, haters. And sorry, it's just not your year. I have seen this movie, but I won't mention a single spoiler here. (If you guys want proof, you can PM me and I'll tell you how the movie ends and the after credits). The reason I'm really writing this review is that I KNOW THERE WILL BE BIASED PEOPLE HERE WHO'LL WRITE THAT BVS IS BETTER and this is trash, etc, etc. Well, just see this movie and judge for yourself. Speaking briefly of the movie, it is an emotional roller coaster with an absolutely beautiful end. Spidey had a satisfying screen time. As for the acting, by the time the movie ended, I was a happy man. Russov's are handling Infinity War, and after watching this movie, how they did justice to characters, I'll not worry. A movie we wanted as well as deserve.Russo Brothers did an amazing job with this film. I loved every scene in this film.The action is amazing,its good to see Chris Evans again as Capitan America,Robert , well he is tony stark and i actually loved him this film more than in his own movies. Black Panther, Antman y Spiderman, they are just amazing and interesting characters in the film. Visual effects are amazing and the battles are really good. I thought that marvel will never do a very good movie like it was winter soldier, but i was wrong, i was totally wrong I don't like to compare, but i enjoy this film more than batman v superman. It's obviously that it is not perfect, that's sure but for me this is the best marvel movie, and i cant wait for the infinity war, the MCU is in good hands with the Russo brothers. Why are you waiting for me to review this, when you should watch it instead. You already know that this is one of the best Marvel movies to date. You already know that this movie has an all star cast. You already know that this movie has great directors. You already know that this movie is adapting one of the most iconic stories. You already know that this movie introduces two great new characters. .... You may already know that this Spiderman, is regarded as THE defining PP and Spiderman. You may already know that this Black Panther is a Badass. You may already know that the action scenes are new/inventive and great. You may already know that this movie has a lot off heart and emotion. .... You can predict this movie will cross the Billion mark. You can predict this movie is a movie for all fans and not just the comic fans. You can predict that only DC fan boys/girls will not find this review helpful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Personal Favorite Marvel Film To Date, Topping All Expectations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Captain America: Civil War is directed by both Anthony and Joe Russo and is a sequel to 2014's Captain America: The Winter Soldier, also directed by the Russo brothers. After an accident occurred while the new Avengers were on the hunt for Crossbones, the United States government proposes that the Avengers be government controlled. Captain America disagrees with the idea, and Iron Man is all for it. This conflict in decision begins to rip the Avengers apart, starting a civil war.I was really on the edge over Captain America: Civil War. I loved both the previous two Captain America movies, and the two Avengers installments as well. Walking out of the theater, I got all I had wanted and more. Captain America: Civil War is now my favorite Marvel film to date. I loved everything about it, and was so happy to see just how amazingly well everything worked out.The Russo brothers did absolutely amazing with this movie. Not only are all of the characters flawlessly well rounded, but the direction and script are fantastic as well. The direction perfectly captured all of the action throughout the film, and was handled very nicely. Many wide shots were used, and the action was without shaky cam or quick cuts. All of the dialogue was near flawless as well. The audience is very subtly introduced to the conflict between Captain America and Iron Man, and dives deeper into it as the film progresses. The points presented by both sides are both right in there own ways, and that adds so much to this movie.The characters in Civil War are as close to perfect as it gets. I cared for every character in the film, whether they be a superhero or not. Black Panther's introduction into the Marvel Cinematic Universe was great, and I can't wait for his solo film in 2018. Spiderman in this film is, in my opinion, the best on screen Spiderman of all time. I like Tom Holland as the web head a bit better than Tobey Maguire, and way better than Andrew Garfield. His suit was great, and he delivered a lot of quips while fighting, just like the fans wanted. Lines such as "You have the right to remain silent!" or "You have a metal arm? That's awesome, dude!" made Spiderman near perfect in this movie. I loved the characters of both Spiderman and Black Panther.Besides the fact of the new characters, the Russo brothers also went deeper into the characters that we've already seen. Vision was given a lot more depth through Civil War, as was Scarlet Witch. The relationship between the two was great, and was given the attention it deserved. Both Hawkeye and Black Widow got a lot of screen time, and Hawkeye's relationship with Scarlet Witch, which he inspired to become an Avenger at the end of Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015), was explored more deeply, and played off very well. Black Widow's internal conflict with which team she truly supported was shown neatly, however not distracting from the main plot.Both Iron Man and Captain America were fleshed out much more than they have been before, despite how long the two have been in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Their struggles with each other was astounding at how well it was used. Falcon and War Machine were both given a lot more attention than they have been before, and that worked amazingly. As seen in the trailer, War Machine gets injured, and that gave his character a lot more depth. Falcon's friendship with Captain America was expressed more heavily, now that they know each other better. Cap's relationship with Bucky was also incredible. The exploration dealt to Bucky's character was high, and appreciated very much. And, without spoiling anything, Ant Man's character was, simply put, flawless all throughout Civil War.All of the acting was great as well. Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Anthony Mackie, Don Cheadle, Elizabeth Olsen, Paul Bettany, Sebastian Stan, Chadwick Boseman, Jeremy Renner, Tom Holland, Paul Rudd, William Hurt, and Daniel Bruhl all did fantastic. Each performance was unique in its own way, and all of the characters were played greatly. Each actor's portrayal of his or her character was amazing, and each and every character was given the depth they deserved.Overall, Captain America: Civil War is my favorite Marvel movie to date, and my second favorite comic book movie, topped only by The Dark Knight (2008). The Russo brothers have made a true masterpiece of a film, heightening all expectations for Avengers: Infinity War Parts I and II (2018-2019).</fullReview>

I was hoping to see more about the other characters and less about Bucky.and honestly.. the reason why all this happened... is really really really stupid .. they tried to link it with other movies, but they failed badly.on the other hand, one positive thing they did is that they kept Iron Man image and they managed to show both views equally without affecting viewers views. Spoiler: the movie is different that the comics.. a lotI was really hoping to see a better movie.</fullReview>

Even the starting is slow and characters look plain. The villain is hardly to believe and share his goal. Too many jokes again even in the critical scenes that don't let the movie be transformed in adult movie.Downey Jr looks tired of his role as Ironman and his acting has disappointed me. The conflict is not deeper at all. It caused expectation that disappears as soon as spidey is out of the movie.Sorry, but I really don't like this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first film was about giving Steve the opportunity to be the hero he was born to be. The Avengers gave him the chance to matter in the modern era. Winter Soldier gave him true character depth and turmoil that we never saw in those first two installments. Now, we get to see Steve turn the corner and add to the depth but not in ways anyone will expect.It was easier in the 1940's to judge right and wrong. Now, it's more difficult to gauge how to deal with the events we've seen in the previous MCU films. Threats are different and some have been engineered by those seeking to do good. The debate on how to handle them is genuinely intriguing and it all serves as a wonderful foundation to the overall story. How far to take precautionary measures? Who is responsible and who oversees whom? For a man who fought to serve with all his life, how much is too much? Add to this Steve being stoic and not wanting to burden anyone with his struggles concerning Bucky Barnes. It's exactly what a man from that era would do and one that is loyal to a friend he's with "until the end of the line." That turmoil and moral self independence mixed with a "never give up" attitude is what makes the character so dynamic and interesting but it's also the perfect base to the conflict in this movie. Thus as we've all seen in the trailers, Tony wants to "punch him in his perfect teeth" and do more than that actually. Steve does struggle and he does connect with people and show vulnerability, which leads many true heroes to side with him. Yet, Tony has valid and noble points as well. All this grounds the film and makes everything more interesting.All the characters used in this film work amazingly well. The ones we've seen before are fleshed out more. EVERY character is given at least one scene to shine. I love the Black Panther here and what is seen establishes him perfectly. Spider-Man really is as great as everyone has been saying. The Falcon is an absolute ace. Sam's friendship proves to be invaluable. The Scarlet Witch is a true surprise. I didn't think she would play this large of a role. Again, EVERYONE is used intelligently and superbly. No one feels show-horned or sandwiched in to the film. The story comes first and everyone fits.I really loved the hard-edged, physical action. They took what was great in the last film and made it even better. Not only is it hard-edged but adding more diverse powers and characters means the action is as spectacular as it gets. It exactly what these characters should be depicted doing and it's literally a comic book come to life in the best way possible. The action is brutal yet graceful and everything works tremendously well. The Russos have it down. Cap isn't just a guy who was given the ability of speed and enhanced strength. He's been training and his enhanced mind makes him just as dangerous as his muscles. His training and ability make him VERY dangerous and the movie continues to show that in stupendous ways. The fights in this movie are the most impactful that I've EVER seem. The airport showdown will go down in history. Seriously, the stuff of instant classic legend.Overall, a perfect sequel that follows in the footsteps of the best the genre has ever seen and one of the best adventure movies that I have ever seen.</fullReview>

Clash between the avengers is sensational, with strong arguments on both sides and the two right sides. Spider Man and Black Panther very well presented, has good appearances and are introduced naturally different from BvS pushing new characters unnaturally some very superficially hard not to compare these two films unfortunately ... Marvel knows how to use dark colors and fun at times suitable film. amazing America captain as ever, Iron Man expectable, spiderman great the best. Incredible one of the best films of Marvel, Russian brothers showing once again its capacity and this time with a thicker film and more characters weight was a perfect test for the next avengers they will be ahead, credibility and trust in their work was fully guaranteed after this film. Finally, surprising and great movie worth much follow that it is one of the best films of Marvel Studios.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I don't think this film deserves the immense praise it is receiving, I truly think it is a lot of fun and is one of the better MCU films. The acting in this film is all very good, Robert Downey Jr plays Tony Stark great, like he always does, and Chris Evans fits the role of Steve Rogers well. The film juggles many characters, and for the most part, does a good, commendable job, though some characters, like Hawkeye or Rhodey, get very little to do and aren't as fun to watch as some others. Tom Holland kills it as Peter Parker/Spider-Man, he certainly is the best Spidey to date. Every scene with him is great and fun to watch. Chadwick Boseman does a great job at Black Panther, and the character is interesting and entertaining. Once more Paul Rudd is funny and likable as Ant-Man, even though he is sorely underused, he does get time to shine when he turns into Giant Man. Paul Bettany and Elizabeth Olsen are good and Vision and Scarlet Witch, respectively, and their characters have nice arcs.The story is well put together and runs smoothly for the most part. It does gets convoluted towards the end, but it mostly works. The villain is one note and has no charisma, but his motivations tie into the film nicely, and he gets some time to shine. The cinematography is quite boring, under saturated and gray. The airport fight is severely hurt by the amount of gray in it.The action in this film is handles magnificently, aside from a couple of shaky segments, like the tunnel chase, which was straight out of Taken 2. The big fight scene at the airport is extremely fun, and it is great seeing all these unique powers playing off each other. Ant-Man turning giant is pure fan-service, but it adds a great dynamic to the battle and in turn makes it more fun.The film has good emotion, specifically towards the end, when it is revealed that Bucky murdered Tony's parents, which leads to a heart wrenching conclusion.Overall, while I can't quite grasp giving the film a 10/10, I did enjoy it, and feel that it is a great addition to the MCU.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a wonderful character study to go along with the BEST action I've ever seen!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At the start, the film finds Captain America yet again adjusting to working under the increasingly morally ambiguous ways of the new Avengers structure. The set up is masterfully done. This is the fifth time we've seen the character and it's remarkable how complex and how much depth has been layered on to developing this icon. The Avengers film touched a bit with his feelings of what it was like to be in the modern era, and Winter Soldier drove the point home. Following that classic sequel, Civil War is a wonderful character study to go along with a purely thrilling plot. This was exactly the perfect vehicle to deliver a film to advance the character of Captain America but also give Tony Stark a perfect finishing arc and more development himself. What makes BOTH Steve and Tony interesting aren't their abilities or weapons but the men themselves. Steve's moral code and "man out of time" elements are tested in this film but not in a way anyone saw coming. The viewer that normally would trust that Cap is doing what's right can look at his actions in a different light. He is still coming to terms with a past that is long gone and he is still longing for a better more decent era. Putting Bucky back in the mix clouds his judgment. Dealing with the shades of grey of the modern era and being part of any controlling organization after the events of the Winter Soldier movie has changed him. It's exactly like all the epic events and decisions Tony Stark has made over five films has changed the character of Iron Man. The resulting conflict between the two is as epic as can be. Like in Steve's last solo movie, his past comes back and explodes all throughout his new life. Tracking down his old pal Bucky, who was once an amoral assassin and a mind controlled Russian thug, proves to be a catalyst to everything that happens. Everything happens and unfolds in a believable and an intelligent manner. Every single ultimately cool character gets a chance to shine including Bucky but also incredible new characters like Black Panther and Spider-Man. Each one is fleshed out wonderfully for their supporting roles. Again, beyond cool. I really enjoyed both previous Captain America films but this movie is as dark and exciting as Winter Solder but also adds a degree of depth. This movie has a whole new flavor and that's exactly what was needed and what Marvel does so well. The 1940's romance and even the "Raiders of the Lost Ark" tone fit the first film quite nicely. The conspiracy thriller vibe of the second film was refreshing and so well done. Here, just like the Cap character, adaptation is a key. What they deliver with this Civil War feels fresh and is certainly amazing. Steve is still a patriot but he's continuing to question authority. His old-fashioned values pay off in many cases but here, are they leading him astray? Questioning what is wrong and questioning what is morally cloudy is a test of true character. Yet, being old school stubborn can result in missing key points and can result in bad consequences. That is exactly why the character of Steve Rogers is so interesting. He's so much more than a super soldier boy scout. There's depth, angst and pathos and we all can relate to him. He is out-of-place and he is old-fashioned but proud of that in a way. In a movie like this, pride comes before the fall. Tony Stark is ahead of him on that curve. Tony knows the price of arrogance and even the price of acting unilaterally with the best of intentions. He knows the road to hell is paved with those best of intentions. When these two philosophies and life lessons collide, that's as cool as the superhero brawl that accompanies it. The story itself is an amazing action thriller with a ton of intrigue and psychological issues. Honestly, I didn't expect it to be this clever and this deep. I did expect it to be exciting and it certainly delivers on that. Each new character and each hold over Avenger character works in to the story perfectly. Everything about this movie is a joy to watch. The cast is perfect and everyone is used exceptionally well. This IS the best sequel the genre has ever seen and I know tat's saying a lot. It could be Marvel's best effort ever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another winner from Marvel!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I pretty much like or love all the Marvel Studios movies, starting with Iron Man through last year's Ant-Man. So there was virtually no chance I wouldn't enjoy Civil War. But this might be my favorite Marvel movie yet. So many characters are in it, yet I felt like every one of them got at least one memorable moment, even lame ol' Hawkeye! At the end of Act 2, there's a 20-minute battle scene that involves a dozen super-heroes, and it's amazing, probably the best of this genre. I went in rooting 100% for Cap, but by the end, I was feeling really badly for Iron Man and kinda wanted to see him kick Steve Rogers' butt. We get a couple of new heroes ? Spider-Man and the Black Panther ? and they are both just about perfect translations from comic book to film. This Brit they have playing Peter Parker is probably my favorite Spidey yet, even though he's only on screen for maybe 15 minutes. He's exactly as Spidey should be: a nervous kid who handles his anxiety by being a nonstop motormouth during his battles. And the Panther is just so cool. Ant-Man plays a big part in that huge battle I mentioned, getting some of the best moments during the fight. But really, this movie is Cap's, Bucky's, and Tony's story. What helps make it so great is how Marvel has built up their saga over multiple movies ? we're already familiar with and invested in these characters. And the filmmakers use that to great advantage here. It's sad to see them pitted against each other, but completely understandable in the context of the film. Bottom line: if you've enjoyed some or all of the Marvel movies, you'll have a great time with Civil War. It's a blast! And it might even draw a tear or two?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was one of the few fortunate people who got to watch this early. This movie was everything i hoped Civil War to be. It was funny, got you emotionally involved and Action Packed. Yes! the action is done brilliantly. The best I've ever seen in a comic book movie. Maybe one of the best in movies in general. This movie is not your average comic book good vs evil movie. It's much of a clash between ideologies which was really interesting to see. I also have to talk about how Spiderman was portrayed in this movie. I really liked him. As expected he was not the focus of the movie. However, he was not just a cameo either. The few scenes he was in the movie was enough to like him. If i have to point out flaws there is hardly any. Marvel is almost perfect. Almost. I do have one problem with the movie. It was the main villain. Like other marvel villain, this villain just didn't work for me. The movie would have done fine even without the villain. It feels like he was just there because ...he was just there!. But it's not a deal breaker people!! The story isn't about the villain. It's about Civil War. And you're gonna get it.. I can't recommend this movie enough. Believe me guys, the 1 star reviews are all from Marvel haters. They just can't accept the fact that Civil War was a great move. Most of those reviewers probably haven't even watched the movie. Ignore the haters and watch the movie. You won't be disapppointed.</fullReview>

Every character fit right and at no point did the movie feel crammed with superheroes. In my opinion, the two heroes that stole the show was Spider-Man and black panther. They got both of these characters right especially black panther. As much as I loved Batman V. Superman, I have to give this movie more credit. The Russo brothers did not disappoint and they delivered another marvel masterpiece just like the winter soldier. This movie was very good and I plan on seeing it again when it comes out to all theaters and maybe a couple more times! This movie made me very excited to see what comes next in the MCU.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fulfills Promise of Being a 'Civil War'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My greatest concern entering this movie was that it would play out as more of a Civil Dispute rather than a civil War, but thankfully is is absolutely the latter, and people get hurt. Really hurt. But what a film! What a lovely, lovely film! Every minute, every second was nothing but pure entertainment and cinematic glory. Civil War doesn't quite recapture the wonderment and sheer awesomeness of the Avengers, but it comes very close - however, it is ultimately the superior film.Sporting what is arguably the best action in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Captain America is a non-stop thrill ride. The airport scene (as corny as it may appear in teasers) is one of the best action scenes to grace the marvel Cinematic Universe, and the way it is choreographed and filmed is beyond spectacular. The sense of childish bewilderment and the rush of adrenaline that occurred during this scene was overpowering and i sat in awe for quite some time afterward.The tone from Winter Soldier has been carried over into the heavily anticipated sequel and furthers the storyline in spectacular fashion. yes, as seen in the trailers, there are a lot of characters involved in this film. In past, this has meant bad news (Amazing Spider Man 2, Spider Man 3, Age of Ultron) but not in this instant. However, each character is given their due; seamlessly tied into the story and each receiving adequate screen time and narrative. However, as in tradition with most Marvel films - the villains are extremely poor. Marvel seem to have consistent issues in producing decent villains, and this is by no means an exception. However, it is a rather minor component of the film and is wholly forgivable.It's is exciting, tense, and an absolute blast of a time. For not one single minute was I bored or disinterested. As it stands, Captain America: Civl War may just be one of the greatest comic book movies of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Infinity War is in good hands.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Checkmate, haters. And sorry, it's just not your year. I have seen this movie, but I won't mention a single spoiler here. (If you guys want proof, you can PM me and I'll tell you how the movie ends and the after credits). The reason I'm really writing this review is that I KNOW THERE WILL BE BIASED PEOPLE HERE WHO'LL WRITE THAT BVS IS BETTER and this is trash, etc, etc. Well, just see this movie and judge for yourself. Speaking briefly of the movie, it is an emotional roller coaster with an absolutely beautiful end. Spidey had a satisfying screen time. As for the acting, by the time the movie ended, I was a happy man. Russov's are handling Infinity War, and after watching this movie, how they did justice to characters, I'll not worry. A movie we wanted as well as deserve.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is a masterpiece in super hero genre. Almost every character there was well constructed. The film is well paced, the action scenes were great, the story was simple yet well presented. Even when Spider Man was introduced it didn't ruin the film's pacing or made his insertion seem forced. Black Panther may be a bit of a disappointment in the beginning but as the character develops he gets much better and matures more than Tony Stark. The villain? He wasn't even necessary, and yet did what he had to do. Some of the characters question the whole new law thing and start thinking about their actions in recent events. It's not like the comics, but for me it seems that the director and the script writer did everything they could with the resources they had. I know that giving it a 10 may be a bit of an exaggeration for some people because there are better films than this one, but for me in the super hero genre this one is the best so far.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>wow. superb entertainment. weak start but it got better and better. what cap will do for bucky. felt he would have fought hulk and thor if they were present and on team stark (wonder whose side they would have taken). that last fight was so emotional - and brutal, unlike the hugely entertaining airport fight. a believable villain with a twisted plan. great cameos by spidey, ant man and hawkeye. a cool black panther. a dark secret. weak and under-cooked romantic subplot though and vision and wanda were a little dull in comparison but necessary. it lived up to the hype and was way better than ultron. russos are the no. 1 directors in mcu with winter soldier and this. looking forward to infinity war. hope they don't falter like whedon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) has grown to encompass twelve films and four TV series the lions share of which have been enthusiastically accepted and celebrated by audiences and critics. That's close to a decade now where a cultural phenomenon, based on superhero spectacle, larger-than-life characters and interesting stories, has surpassed every other tent-pole to become the largest franchise ever. Captain America: Civil War (or Avengers 2.5 as it is dubbed) is lucky number thirteen. With a slate full of interconnected movies still set to 2019, it can be reasonably assumed at least one of these things has to be a dud, a catastrophe, a Batman &amp; Robin (1997) level misfire. Will Civil War, with it's bloated cast, be the straw that breaks the camel's back? Have we finally reached a point were the massive MCU begins to crumble? Can Civil War meet expectations or will choke haphazardly on its own opulence?The answer is not only a resounding no but a loud, thunderous hell no! Civil War is not only one of the most unabashedly entertaining popcorn blockbusters to come out of this year so far, it rivals The Avengers (2012) and Iron Man (2008) as one of the strongest Marvel films to exist since the inception of the studio's grand design. Manufactured with the determined ardor of its titular hero and forged with the surprisingly ductile malleability of the ever expanding MCU, Civil War is a rollicking ride, completely self-assured in its ability to please. Never have I seen a blockbuster so sure of itself; flexing its well toned, well hardened muscles to the amazement and guffaws of the film's target audience (which might as well be everyone at this point).The film simultaneously continues the long-hanging character threads of Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014) and that of Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015) and wraps them into a nice little bow while leaving a little something more to keep us hungry for more. Captain Steve Rogers (Evans) and his fellow Avengers botch a mission in Lagos, Nigeria leading to the collateral deaths of Wakandan aid workers. Secretary of State Ross (Hurt) sees the growing death toll directly and indirectly caused by the Avengers as cause for alarm, and asks them to sign a treaty relinquishing their private status. After the damage cause by Ultron, Iron Man (Downey Jr.) becomes the treaty's strongest advocate and obliges Black Widow (Johansson), War Machine (Cheadle) and Vision (Bettany) to sign. Captain America and Falcon (Mackie) however refuse. Things become much more complicated when a bombing during the signing of the treaty is blamed on Cap's old friend, the mind-controlled super soldier Bucky aka Winter Soldier (Stan). What's worse, the bombing killed the Wakandan King whose son T'Challa (Boseman) vows revenge. T'Challa uses the resources of his country to construct a Vibranium suit he uses to battle foes as Black Panther. Meanwhile Cap and Falcon race to find the Winter Soldier before authorities do, and try to get to the bottom of who's behind the bombing.Other plot points involve Ant-Man (Rudd), Scarlet Witch (Olsen), Hawkeye (Renner) and (drum-roll) Spider-Man (Holland); gingerly added on to the espionage thriller antics and burgeoning rivalry that dominates the film. Seeing all the plot elements on paper would make anyone assume the film resembles a house of cards, poised to topple at the first slight breeze. Well folks, not only does the movie stand on its own, it juggles the various side-plots in such a way that it would make even the smallest theater audience erupt in applause. I honestly don't know whether I should be amazed, impressed, waiting gleefully in anticipation for further installments of the MCU or feel bad for DC whose own expanded universe is struggling to get past the starting line. Not to bring up a sour point but Captain America: Civil War sidesteps the problems that plagued Batman V Superman (2016) in such a way as to resemble a guy on the best day of his life skipping past a dirty puddle.Civil War is so sure of itself as a movie that its central conflict is relatively minor when compared to the world shattering exploits of Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) and the Thor series (2011-2017). Our main villain Zemo (Bruhl), for all his malevolent posturing, fades into the background with intentions so intimate as to be both inconsequential and surprisingly melancholic all at once. His master plan proves simple when compared to the lofty goals of Loki, Ultron or even Ivan Vanko, yet the results he gets prove emotionally loaded. It's just as well since the infighting between the Avengers proves electrifying with everyone (yes even Hawkeye) having a chance to shine. Particular praise should be bestowed upon the minor appearances of Spider-Man and Ant-Man who despite small screen times leave big impressions in more way than one.The MCU has officially reached critical mass. Even if the upcoming Doctor Strange (2016), Thor: Ragnarok (2017) or Black Panther (2018) are all total busts, they can do nothing to damage Disney and Marvel's endgame which as far as narrative goes is an ultimate, mind-blowing showdown in The Infinity Wars (2018-2019). What started as a risky little idea has turned into the dominant force in an entire popular movie genre and by extension the childhood and young adulthood of an entire generation. Civil War is but one of the tightest bolts in the machine that promises at least three more years of comic-book superhero bliss. Like the Death, taxes and Donald Trump, the MCU is now an unassailable reality. Here's to hoping it does us well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Few thoughts, based on 2 viewings on release-day, almost back-back, in different cinemas, one on an IMAX screen, albeit without the IMAX print, darker-toned in spite of digital 4K.Avengers 2.5, not Cap 3. But not a bad thing at that. Since the story at its core is more like Winter Soldier part 2.Getting the Russo brothers to spearhead/direct 'CA2: Winter soldier' was perhaps one of the most inspiring things done by Marvel's Kevin Feige, almost on par with his hiring Firefly's Joss Whedon for the 1st Avengers movie, still the best, in this series.Other than the political shenanigans in that one, one of its characteristics was its being a consistently high-energy, kinetic action set-piece showcase, which were tied together very, very well.However, this one also has a lot of weak plot-elements, and while (in my head) they're so big that they should derail the entire movie, they don't, because whatever's good is so strong that the movie stands up to be its own great epic-feeling experience.Confused about whether to begin with the weak stuff, or the strong ones.Before that though, here's the sequence of the movies in the Marvel universe, beginning all the way with 'Iron Man'. Every time there's a release of one of these, all these movies play the night before, and there are hardcore fans out there, few of them friends of mine, who binge-watch them all every time.Iron Man, The incredible Hulk (Norton, Roth, Hurt), Iron Man 2, Thor, Captain America: The 1st Avenger, The Avengers, Iron Man 3, Thor: the dark world, Captain America (2): The Winter Soldier, Guardians of the Galaxy, Avengers (2): Age of Ultron, Ant-man, CA(3)/Avengers 2.5: Civil War/....this one......OK Lemme begin strong (heh-heh):* The superhero smack-down sequences, all the way to the end. 3 larger-than-life action set-pieces. And though the one at the end does not come close to bettering the ones that came before, and this IS a kinda let-down, they've all been intricately staged and executed. * Chadwick Boseman as Black Panther. All of his angst, in spite of being clichéd, do work. * This is gonna be controversial, but the absence of Thor and Hulk, is actually believable here, and makes sense, even with a little lip-service. * The original person who brought the Avengers together, Ant-man, not Hank Pym like in the comics, but Paul Rudd's Scott Lang. A hoot, in each and every sequence he's in. Cannot wait for Ant-man 2. A. Ma. Zing!!!!!!! * Spidey in an action sequence. Excellent in-action character interplay. * The airport, nee, runway, showdown. * The chase in Vienna (or what stood-in for Vienna). * Finally, decent runtime. Finally. For the Falcon, Sharon Carter, and even William Hurt's Ross. * United Nations getting in on some Avengers action. Not enuf (see below), but some of it. * The 3D. * Couple of Zemo-twists, at the end, that ultimately turned out to be weak (see below), but were effective on first viewing.Now, and this is to get it outta my system, the (Very, very) Weak stuff:* No Nick Fury. No Maria Hill. No explanation for their not being there. Even the absence of P.Potts, nvr a major plot-device, except for 'Iron Man 3' is given a cursory once-over, but their absence after their presence all over the last one? * My favorite Ross was Sam Elliott in the first, and absolutely fantastic 'Hulk', made by Ang Lee, in the Kenneth Branagh style of grand Shakespearean tragedy, not William Hurt from the Transporter style of Leterrier's filmmaking (tho Tim Roth stood out, along with Norton). So, guess what? No Elliott, only Hurt, and perhaps one of the weakest rounders-up ever, especially without Nick Fury around. * 10 minutes to Spider-man, for no reason? Seriously? Iron man had to go bring this guy for help? Against Cap? That entire segment might have made more sense in the stand-alone Spider-man movie, and this could just have been just a call from 'Stank' to him. 10-minute runtime, I would have edited out, never mind all the hysterical whistling in the cinema, by public who think they know these chaps! * * Love Marisa Tomei. But, she's aunt May? Come on!!!!! All shapes and sizes, indeed.... * Sebastian Stan's time from when he falls off the top of the train in Cap 1, until Winter soldier, is still a little bit shrouded. Who saved him (Hydra, I know)? How did that save come about? Lazy storytelling. And these guys squeezed Spider Man 0.5 at the cost of Winter Soldier. Sad. * Very less runtime for Hawkeye, Crossbones, Black Widow, Scarlet Witch. * * Speaking of Wanda what about her angst regarding the death of Quicksilver? Doesn't mtr anymore? * Rhodey. L4-S1 after that? Seriously? * The Vision: Drone and drone and drone.....and drone some more. Yawn! * The action set- pieces, which need to be better than the one that came last. Here, however, the one in the middle, so to speak, is the best of the lot. * How about a non-US SoS heading the UN Avengers initiative? Do away with Ross, or have them partner, or don't call it the U.N., for chrissakes. 'Hannibal' (the movie) was more international, with Giancarlo Giannini playing a prominent character on the trail of you-know-who. * Now, and this is perhaps the weakest link in all Marvel movies. What does it take for a superhero to die? In the comics, Steve Rogers' Cap mantle is taken on both by Bucky, as well as the Falcon. Where are the surprises? I'm not asking them to go full GoT on this, but hey? Elements of surprise are good.....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Captain America: Civil War Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Simply awesome from the fight scenes to the comedy and the excitement to the thrill every thing was perfect in the movie. From the starting till the end i could not decide which side i am on (but to be fair there was no a side to choose as cap was trying to prevent evil to happening and tony didn't know the whole story). And the final fight between cap., bucky and iron man was awesome and honestly at that moment I was on iron man's side as I understood with his motivation, if someone killed my parents I would have done the same . Lot of people are comparing this to BvS . One cannot overlook the similarities like:-Batman hated superman because he destroyed his building and lot of his friends died Iron Man hated bucky because he killed his parents .Superman was fighting Batman because if he didn't his mom will die. Cap. was fighting iron man because if he didn't his best friend will die by the hands of iron man.Both had an under developed villain .Both had some plot convenient situation like Lex knowing that batman will be waiting for superman at that Gotham bay angry enough to fight and kill him.(how and why to one knows).Zemo knowing that iron man will show up at that remote hydra cave location with cap. and bucky.Both zemo and lex end up in prisonWe all liked wonder woman in BvS and Black Panther in Civil war,both were not the main focus of the film .(I didn't mentioned spider-boy because we already loved him even before the movie).Both has unnecessary side plots like:-5 winter solder in civil war.(That hydra cave has no real impact on the story zemo could have spilled the secret anywhere ,why did he needed the hydras secret cave) Lois lane bullet side story.(it was the only reason her being in the movie)..But in the end I thing Russo brothers handled the story,emotion and thrill way better than zack snyder. . . . .In the end it was an awesome ,well balanced movie and as a dc &amp; marvel fan i hate to say it but the movie was better than BvS.(I liked BvS too).The thing i admire most about both dc and marvel cinematic universe that they are completely different in terms of tone,action,etc and as a fan I will get to enjoy two completely different kind of universes</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's Iron Man 3 bad. Very slow, with some good action scenes.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is at the level of badness of Iron Man 3 or Man of Steel. It seems to be no script, just random fighting scenes intertwined with boring-to-death talking scenes. Some of these scenes (like the car scene with Tony Stark parents) are repeated as many as three times in the movie. They also introduce a random romantic episode for Steve Rogers that makes no sense, and shows no chemistry whatsoever. The point is, that no matter the strenght of the Captain, there is always a women above him. The target of the script seems to be "look at all these stupid males with big egos fighting each other: they would do much better if they all behaved like women do, because women are superior in all aspects, and males should be expendable, and subordinated. And rich". In fact, no female character in this movie is ever wrong as the plot goes, and one of those even beats the most powerful character, the Vision, in one blow, because "he had her locked up at home". Some other scenes are obviously written by a woman with no sense of gender balance, like male characters complimenting others on their eye color, double meaningful comments that the writer didn't catch, and excessively male ass from behind frames. Some character appear from nowhere in the middle of the fight, and they tell the Spiderman story _again_, but this time, making him look like an idiot, broke teenager (tough his aunt May who is supposed to be in her old age, is flirtable by Iron Man, because, reasons). aaand the black Widoe has to fight Hawkeye -again-, because... because that is what couples do, right? They fight! Really, I was expecting way more from this movie. The ending is left unresolved, and many of the side plots as well, not because they plan a continuation, but because they obviously didn't know how to tie up the loose ends. On the bright side: there are some action scenes that really nail it, like the one with all of the heros. Even tough they seem disconnected and ilogical, the CG and superheroic tricks can be enjoyable when watched on a large screen. Veredict: fast-forward to the good scenes, trash the rest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Marvel's 13th entry in their MCU comes in as the answer to anyone who was thinking that the super hero genre was starting to die or that it had spent its potential. "Captain America: Civil War" is a soaring triumph of modern mythological storytelling which improves on its source material and delivers a film with a remarkable artistic credit.The most stunning element the film immediately presents is its relentless momentum and pace. The way in which every single story beat feels necessary and connected with everything else is astonishing. There isn't half a moment wasted, you are grabbed by the narrative and never given reason to let go. What the Russos manage to do with these characters is shocking the more you think about it. They succeed in not only make this story integral and interesting to every one of them, they also manage to give each and every one of them further and deep character development and insight, from the smallest one to the ones we have seen in six movies already.I have no idea how a vision this big and complicated got so smoothly adapted on screen. There is so much to get across, so many points to tick, so many elements in play and the filmmakers manage to nail every single one of them. The themes are engrossing and relatable, but most importantly they are presented to you in a clear way, you don't have doubts about character motivations, every one of them has complexity and relatability and it is a joy to see their relations unfold on screen.And we haven't even started talking about the action scenes here. On a first impression I might say that this is one of the best action films of this cinema era, it might just be an instant classic from that point of view. These sequences all have such an urgency to them, you feel stakes and momentum. They are supporting every beat of the storytelling, they are almost all an integrating part of it and stunning to experience. The flawlessness with which they are put together is overwhelming. Not a beat was missed. The stuns are clearly visible, the CGI (for the first time ever in a Marvel movie) is unnoticeable, the complexity is engaging and not distracting.Look, the sophistication of the film is reflective of the difficulty of reviewing it, everything is just so good and emotionally touching, it is coherently funny, joyful, dramatic and thrilling, there just is too much to get into, every one of these actors should deserve a paragraph on their own, their commitment in bringing this together is heart warming and they all deliver performances that are exactly what the movie needs. The music, the villain, the sound, I just could go on and on about the technical perfection we have here, it almost moves me to tears because it is the demonstration of everything I've believed: love and passion for the material always bring to the best results and the fact that everybody involved is so clearly caring about the final result is demonstrative of why this film is such a success that I really look forward to checking out again because I am sure there will be stuff to be found in further viewings.It does bear some minor problems: a 10 minute rounding the edges could have been easily possible, the famous airport scene has a couple of tonal shifts that could have been handled slightly better, there is a little too much breathing space between the first and second climax, yet that is probably all.I loved this movie with both my heart and my brain, it is put together with a mastery and affection that is rare to find in any kind of movie overall, it is the proof of the equality of all movies and that it doesn't matter what is in yours, what matters is what story your telling. I repeat I genuinely can't wait for a second viewing, it is so encouraging to see a movie this big and this commercial be so endearing and important for cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great acting and visuals with a pretty well developed narrative</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie dives right into action which sets the drive of the entire film. It is action packed and there is never a dull moment. As well, the movie is a cohesive whole and is very well made. Usually with these many characters and A-list actors, there is unequal screen time between each, and the narrative of each character is separate from each other. An example would be to compare this to Batman v Superman. Even with just two characters the narratives could not interweave, and were very distinct from the other.In Captain America: Civil War, even though the overall narrative mainly focuses on the dispute between Iron Man and Captain America, the rest of the cast isn't left out. Everyone gets screen time and though some inevitably get more than others, it isn't noticed much in the context of the film. So much like how the narrative is about team segregation, the film itself did very well in creating a cohesive, well-rounded portrayal of all characters.This is also probably because most of the actors and actresses are reprising their roles and know their characters inside out. Thus, the acting and chemistry between them aided in creating this cohesive unit of the film. Everyone played their parts well and I was completely absorbed into the world of the movie.The action scenes and visual effects are great once again. Marvel films have established that they know how to create visually stunning action effects. The action too shows some impressive fighting scenes. Both Black Widow and Sharon Carter display kick-ass moves.Overall, this film is greatly entertaining and the narrative well established. The appearance of Zemo (Daniel Bruhl) is a bit sudden and random, but in the overall context is a good addition and necessary to the plot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly good for Marvel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Marvel have a history of promoting hyper aggressive female characters and this movie is no exception. For the first time though, they've extended that hyper aggression to most of the cast (male and female). It used to be reserved for the Hulk and Black Widow. In order to create the illusion of extreme feats of strength, the first 20 minutes of the movie was almost unwatchable as they cut and chopped fight scenes frantically. Later scenes did not suffer from this fragmentation.Then, there was the ridiculous speech by Sharon Carter (Emily VanCamp) telling us that the only people who face adversity were women and that no woman ever went anywhere before the 1950s. Maybe, the writers and VanCAmp should study people like Frances Kelsey and Srinivasa Ramanujan. This speech was just plain insulting. But, it's consistent with Marvel, so, everyone should be used to these propaganda statements by now.However, if you can look past revisionist history by the writers and VanCamp, the story was otherwise almost flawless. There was, surprisingly, a lot of heart to this movie. Thankfully, the writers and directors spent a lot less time on hyper-violence than past efforts. However, they are still obsessed with ninja warriors. They've now added another over the top ninja to the cast.Surprise performance of the movie was Jeremy Renner as Arrow Guy. It's the first movie where he hasn't been lame. Elizabeth Olsen also demonstrated some solid acting chops.Visual effects were surprisingly inconsistent for a Marvel movie. There is a scene with a truck and some fire which looked particularly fake.However, this movie was most the most enjoyable of the Marvel Universe for me. Some heart to the characters, good acting from most of the performers, believable conflict and a toned down Robert Downey Jr. Win, win, win.If you didn't like the Avengers movies, you may like this one. It's got enough heart that you actually care about the characters this time around. However, it's still got its share of hyper-violence, although, for the first time, most of the characters get their moment of hyper-violence, not just Black Widow.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, where do I start with my critique of this overrated piece of crap. First of all, Captain America: Civil War is by no ways a "bad" movie, it can be watched multiple times ( most likely three times) without getting stale and boring. Civil war has a few really entertaining fight scenes and even its juvenile humor works sometimes (i.e Cap kissing Agent Carter's niece...yuck), but overall it is NOT a great comic book movie or even Marvel's best movie yet. The best Marvel movie to me still belongs to Captain America: Winter Soldier because it made an otherwise boring superhero interesting all by himself. With regards to flaws, Civil "War" has a laundry list the size of Texas. The characters motivations are deeply nonsensical. I mean what made Black Widow, who witnessed Hydra's takeover of SHIELD, side with the biggest hypocrite in comic book history: Thunderbolt Ross. She saw what made Cap paranoid, but still chose to back Tony Stark? Why?! Then there is Tony Stark, Marvel's golden child. Why would Ironman who refuses to share his extremely dangerous technology with the government willingly submit to the United Nations mandate?! This dude wouldn't even submit to the US government of which he is a citizen off and can actually influence its decisions given the fact that he is wealthy as hell. Moving on to the villain ,Marvel's Kryptonite, why is Zemo mad at the entire Avengers squad ( Thor and Hulk omitted for no reason) for the actions of Ultron that was created by guess who? Tony Stark. If Zemo should be mad at anybody it should be Tony, he created the monster that wrecked havoc around the world and directly led to Zemo's family's death. What did Captain America do to deserve punishment? He at least tried to stop the abomination Stark created. Then there is the marketing department's greatest tool in the character of Spiderman. Why was he here? What did he do to add to the plot? Are you telling the audience that Tony is so manipulative that he added a teenage to his team without thinking of the potential dangers?! But again, Marvel movies are not made for audience's trying to think, its all about the humor mixed with a heavy dose of violence. Not trying to sound like a hater, but am sick of critical acclaim given to his movies. This film did not add anything to what comic book movies can be, it didn't make the MCU look consequential, it's just another Avengers movie winking at the audience to come back for more. Kevin Feige, a true genius IMO, has managed to turn film making into a WWE type business, which never ends and only exist to promote the next installment. In conclusion, the only thing i liked about this film was BLACK PANTHER.I mean, finally Marvel has developed the balls to introduce a non disposable black character. Falcon's actor is just one bad contract problem from been swapped out for another random and disposable black actor. Until Black Panther comes out I am avoiding MCU installments like the 10 plagues of Egypt. Am out!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Avengers: Age of Ultron fell a bit short in my opinion, as the action of it was intended to prepare the Civil War part. So, the main attraction was actually this movie.By far, the movie surpassed its predecessors because of the amount of superheroes involved (actually, all of them :) ). The conflict rises on a political matter but every single one has its own motivation to state their ground. The plot is simple but well written while it offers the chance for introducing other heroes, such as Black Panther and Spiderman. There is a fine twist to the movie that may surprise a lot of people (the victims of Winter Soldier in the late 90's mission) and another one which will make the most die hard fans wonder what will happen next (regarding the not dead of Captain America). Yet, the movie is fun, has its intense moments and sets ground for some cool developments. Cannot wait and see what other things will happen in the MCU next :D.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Captain America: Civil War is a comic based movie (for those who don't know) and is the third installment in the Captain America. Released in 2016, grossing over $406 million in the United States alone (placing it in the #2 spot for 2016. When I review movies, I like to break it up into different categories, discuss them, and then wrap it up in a conclusion.Story: I don't like to spoil movies often (especially Marvel releases), so I'm just going to talk about the continuity of the plot. Being that this is a sequel, it could be a little to follow the storyline if you haven't seen the previous installments (or read the comics), but I feel like the story is relatively simple and most audiences can catch on. Being that Captain America (as well as over half of other Marvel characters) are ultimately owned by Disney, it's interesting to see a grittier and darker film. I personally liked the vibe that was given off of the film. This movie was more than a slug-it-out film like Thor or even Iron Man and offers significant material that puts you in a place where you think and relate to the characters and their struggles. There were very few plot holes in the plot, but one thing that did bother me is that some of the newer characters that were introduced had shallow backgrounds and (if you don't follow the Marvel Cinematic Universe or comics) could make you wonder why they are even there. 8/10 Characters: Most of the MCU characters from previous installments are back with the addition of some other characters like the Black Panther and Spider-Man. When there is multiple significant characters in one movie it is easy for characters to get sidelined, but "Captain" does a good job of this. I probably should have mentioned this is the story category, but while I'm on the topic of characters, I feel like the title didn't really fit the movie. It doesn't really feel like a Captain America film, it feels more like an Avengers 2.5. Anyways, the established characters show some growth and the new additions are very entertaining and add to the film in many different ways. I'm just going to say that I'm not even sure who the villain is in the movie, it feels to me that it is a matter of interpretation. 8.5/10 Action: Marvel Studios always does a good job when shooting action scenes and "Civil War" is no different. I really enjoyed how the characters' powers were incorporated into their fighting style and the film definitely offered some memorable moments that will not be forgotten. With a strong combination of choreographed and CGI fight scenes, the movie has a very strong visual appeal. 9/10 Special Effects: As I mentioned briefly in the previous category, the overall special effects in the film are pretty solid, but I really don't know what to say when I saw Spider-Man's costume on the screen. The whole thing looks like a glossed over, CGI mess and to me became very distracting and looked really out of place. Being that the rights for Spider-Man were acquired shortly before shooting for the film started, it's understandable ... not really. Hopefully Spidey's suit will look better in his upcoming solo film "Spider-Man: Homecoming". 8/10 Conclusion: I honestly believe that this is one of the better films in the MCU, and definitely the best of the Captain America installments. I give this movie an 8/10. If you haven't seen the previous Captain America movies I recommend you watch them (except for the first movie. It wasn't that good, but it is important for his back story) and then wrap it up with "Civil War". Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was amazing! From start to finish, I enjoyed every scene so in the Captain America series, this is my favorite and in my opinion, the best of the three films. I did not care for the first film but winter soldier was an excellent sequel to it and then Civil War does the unexpected and is even better than Winter Soldier. One amazing thing about the movie is the choreography in the fight scenes. All of the scenes were very clean and polished. They reminded me of a Jason Bourne or James Bond fight with superheros which was something that I did not know I wanted but apparently I did because every time there was a fight scene, I was on the edge of my seat. The best fight was the scene in the trailer that everyone has seen, the scene at the terminal. The way the superheros were implemented was very intricate and you did not feel like one superhero was overshadowed by another. I felt like I saw all of the abilities of each character.The new characters in this movie are amazing too. Tom Holland as Spider- Man and Chadwick Boseman as Black Panther were magnificent. I still do not know who I liked more but both roles were performed excellently and I can not wait for their individual films. This is Ant-Man's first time with the Avengers and he held his own as well in this movie as well which I enjoyed.Also, the story was mesmerizing. I was intrigued by what was going on and understood the reasoning of each character. The story was not the main thing I enjoyed though. Overall, this was a great film and if you have not seen this movie, you need to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun to see all the characters (established &amp; new ones)on screen together, but the stakes in this *Avengers 2.5* are ultimately too low to provide any real tension</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First the performances were good to very good. I especially must give props to Robert Downey Jr. who once again steals the show. He is however supported by strong &amp; heartfelt performances from Daniel Brühl, who plays the tormented &amp; vengeful Helmut Zemo + Tom Holland, providing a fun take on Peter Parker/Spider-Man. Though I feel his portrayal is very close to Andrew Garfield. Special mention for Paul Bettany for his reserved, well acted Vision.The film's main plot strings together well &amp; falls into place at the climax, as our villain apparently succeeded in his goal. He is sure to return in future installments &amp; I feel he's the first interesting villain since Loki (though his plans in "Thor" &amp; "The Avengers" made no sense whatsoever)&amp; Red Skull. However, the supersoldier subplot was just a waste of time &amp; should have been left on the cutting room floor.The character of T'Challa/Black Panther's introduction is rushed, but his story arc progresses well over the course of the film. And his first encounter with Bucky is a very cool one, showcasing Panther's agile skillset. Sadly the same can't be said about the airport fight. This hyped scene is rather dull in it's execution &amp; the combatants are all allies, FRIENDS. Therefore there is no tension, only the final threeway fight between Iron Man &amp; Captain America + Bucky has significant meaning &amp; cause. But it's impact is ultimately diminished by Rogers' sincere message to Tony sometime after the event. Wow, suddenly the hope of them being pals again is near! No, it's a rather forced pay-off.It shouldn't have been named "Civil War", plain &amp; simple. It does no justice to the widely praised comic arc, (which I admit I didn't really follow, except for a few Spider-Man issues)but I have enough of a general view of the subject matter to estimate it's value.The provided thrills do warrant a watch, but no hard feelings if you prefer to watch something else.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is not perfect... But, it is intelligent. It's a story, and, it is in fact such a Civil War, that the act of war itself, is the main villain. The Russo's realized something very pertinent from the word go; This movie ran the risk of being too loud, cluttered, without direction, CGI driven and pointless... In other words, the Russo's realized that, if one sticks to the script without a second thought, sticks to what is expected, Civil War would be the absolute mess that was Batman v Superman.My only complaint about this movie, quite honestly, exists from the Russo's careful, and marvelous construction. The story, including the screenplay, was epic. The character introductions... Spider- Man's was Amazing, haha... And Black Panthers'... was so well motivated, then logically deescalated.My complaint within the Russo's excellent vision, was that, they took away a few things - 3 in particular, that for me, make a HUGE difference. Firstly, the Score, was boring... It diminished the excitement terribly... It was too, non-existent and short lived. And also, the Airport scene... It was very good, but, it was not at all as mind blowing and legendary as it was supposed to be... Almost like the final fight scene in Iron Man Three, damn it, it left me wanting. The editing as well... The scene of Black Widow catching the vial in Lagos was cut so badly (amongst a few others), I felt myself deliberately trying to shrink my irritation, because that fight scene was so awesome, that editing that scene correctly, would've been the sweet cherry on top. These are my only problems.From there, Zemo (Daniel Bruhl, I've got nothing but love) was a thrilling undertone villain, in the back- round, logically and with good motive, wonderfully orchestrating a collapse of an empire - while the empire is understandably distracted, like Ultron would say: 'From the inside"... And at the end, you ask yourself; "Did he lose, really". Unlike BvS, with Sups "death", you know he is coming back, so, tension is lost... But, with Civil War, even with knowing The Avengers are coming back, you sense that, they aren't coming back the same... You sense that, a part of The Avengers, are in fact, dead.Bucky, Vision, Scarlet, Hawkeye, War Machine, Ant/Giant Man... My goodness, there is so much to say and love about this movie, and how the Russo's tied it together that... I mean, I'd have to type a review that would take the full 147 minutes to read.An the unsung hero in this movie; Sam Wilson/Falcon. Anthony Mackie... He was just, stunning. I loved him... He killed it!!!This thrilling ride could've been a 9.9/10... However, it doesn't deserve a 7... So, I'll give it an 8/10... A lot of thought went into the story, and I love that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining!... But Lacking.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I even begin to speak about the movie, I first feel it to be my duty to elaborate upon the concept by which this movie is inspired. Civil War, the Comic Book Series, was a universe encompassing Marvel Comics event that split the superhero landscape as we knew it in half. Spin-off volumes chronicled each individual hero's experience with the SRA. With an almost Mooresian level of satire it attacked (or defended) the American Government system with an allegory that remains just as striking, even close to ten years later. I went to see the movie with all this in mind. Marvel's impeccable track record of perfect casting continues with new additions Chadwick Boseman, and Tom Hollland, who are both perfect renditions of who their character should be. Hollands voice is what really makes his part memorable. That post adolescence squeak in the middle of an enormous clash marks Marvel's mastery over the characters THEY have created. T'challa, or Black Panther as he is known is a little different. WE find him at the film's beginning as a mere son of a king. He travels on a bit of a parallel journey to the rest of the Avengers as he evolves from being a man driven by passionate revenge, to a noble king, who puts others first. Boseman's royal composure and distinctly Wakandan diction add a lot to an otherwise Ameri-centric movie. This isn't a typical "Mindless action Movie", Though it may seem so to the casual observer. As a comic reader myself, it is evident that this is a labor of love on the part of the Russo Brothers. The powers, and motivations of each character are showcased in a very satisfying way. While there is much differentiation between the books and the movie, the character interactions are mostly logical and help drive the plot forward. I've said a lot of good things about this movie. Now, as much as I hate to do this to a marvel movie (Captain America no less) there are some things that must be said. Aside from the movie's climax, there is a playfulness between the combatants that is humorous when battling a foe such as Ultron, but a tad bit vexing when best friends are more or less trying to kill each other.This is, in a word, a "Safe" movie. Disney's perpetually politically correct M.O. forces it to pull its potentially poignant punches. I'm reminded of Simon &amp; Garfunkel's "people talking without speaking", for certainly, nobody in this film "dares disturb the sound of silence." Rather than Making a statement about government, CA:CW opts to pin the SRA on the U.N., which would absolutely never really happen. For a concept so heavily based on the works of Alan Moore, they would have done well to recall that one of V for Vendetta's key ingredients was its direct connection between the fictional fascist government, and the current British parliament. This film could have been such a powerful political allegory, and I fully expected it to be given the anti-NSA message broadcast in Winter Soldier. It opts for a money making popcorn muncher instead. A complete absence of "Cape-Killers", or any other large government force reflects an almost cowardly carefulness. The movie spares each major character for the sake of future revenue, rather than allow the plot to go deeper. This movie has fun going for it, the whole thing is a blast; but beyond that, there really isn't anything more. Many movies try to break the superhero movie mold, attempting to bring something new to the table. Many fail. Civil War, however, left its hammer at home.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First, well choreographed fight scenes and a good depiction of Spider- Man were what made this movie good. I guess it had been too long since I last saw "The Winter Soldier" and "Age of Ultron," because I really did not remember the Sokovia events and character interactions as portrayed in "Civil War." Granted there are twists in the story regarding the villain and his motivations, but the twist literally took me out of the movie when I realized he did more than just set up Bucky. Also I was really let down that this movie's darker depiction was such a departure from the other Marvel movies. Characters literally were about to kill each other over a series of misunderstandings, and we're left with no real resolution to the story's character conflicts. Why was Tony not upset about the Raft? Was Tony making out with Aunt May??? And if Peter was Spider-Man for 6 months, how is Aunt May already on the prowl within a few months of Uncle Ben's death?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Solid movie, although nowhere near as great as its current rating suggests. After the flop that was Avengers 2 (not at the box office, but in terms of quality), this was a nice mix-up. While technically called Captain America: Civil War, this movie straddles the line between an Avengers movie and a Captain America movie. One of the biggest problems I had was the motivations for Captain and Iron Man as to their positions on the accords. Based on everything that we've seen from the two in previous movies, Iron Man is the relaxed character while Captain America is the stern government-follower. Their positions should have been flipped, comics be damned! Spider-Man was delightfully annoying, as he should be. Something that they try to do in this movie is make all the characters even in terms of powers, probably to sell action figures. Hawkeye was in a major fight and he was almost holding his own, insanely unrealistic. Other than these petty complaints, it was a decent movie with OK acting and average humor for Marvel. The action is pretty top notch and lots of blood was spilled, although I wish there was at least one character death.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Civil War a good movie but instead of Civil War it was like a civil battle and that is suppose to setup infinity war story line. nope! i can't see that happening in a best way. The problem still remains with marvel cinematic universe is underdeveloped Villains except "Loki". In Civil War Team Iron man vs Team Cap. was happening in a way where they are having fun instead of a very very serious battle. Come on It's Phase III now. "Mad Titan " is suppose to be on his way to hunt infinity stones and our heroes are having fun? So this tells that Infinity War could suck. No disrespect for marvel but they need to gear up the level and seriousness of upcoming movies and i definitely don't mean make dark and gritty movies. Also i say Marvel should really focus on "Thor: Ragnarok" because this movie really need to setup Infinity War because that is where Civil War has hopelessly failed. Thor 3 has to be very serious perhaps like Lord of the Rings. instead i heard the upcoming film's director says he will fill the movies with humor? Battle Scale and Seriousness needed to be geared up in the M.C.U.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will start this off by saying the last two comic book movies that have come out B v. S and Deadpool have disappointed me.Now with that being said lets move onto this one. I have always liked the Captain America movies I think they are the true crown jewel to the MCU (Marvel Comic or character Universe). Chris Evans does a great job playing the patriotic yet humble Steve "Captain America" Rogers. While we get Robert Downey Jr. back as the egotist Tony Stark.I do not feel that Tony Stark added to much to this film it seems like his snide and ego just get bigger and bigger. He never learns anything about being the douche he is. But, some of the best things that happen in this film are the introduction of T'Challa a.k.a Black Panther I was very excited to see him on the screen this being a character that goes back to my youth.I thought he was treated respect and how wrote and treated the character.I really do not want to say to much about this movie because I want you to discover it for yourself</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First, it was so boring except for the first half of the presentation part of the film. There was unwarranted extensions. 2. Events began at midnight and continued.A superhero film based group that wants to take control of the titular government. For the full authority of the United Nations and 117 countries (in words) All will be in the United States. Hand in hand with all the equipment will be put to task by navigating only by the government and will act accordingly. This is a kind of mercenary under the government. no relevance at all to the super heroics. Okay thank you.Our hero thinks sit, Tony and Rhodey is a clear yes no outside Vision. Already just these contract signing later in BW. Black Panther and does not sign the Spidey. During the conference, an explosion takes place, and falsely blamed Bucky. Why? Because he's a member of the Winter Military Hydra. More research is to not know what's going on. Just because a photo. Okay thank you in it.In a way, they caught me, but he does not think at all? Explosion Occurs in Vienna Bucky gets you in Berlin. You take them into custody, but no investigation. Let the government does not wake up. Tony how not wake up. No. How am I even had a big ego never end, you're standing praise of continuous intelligence. What happened is because of you because of the ego as the event has ended, Ultron. Iron Man I love, but I can not stand the ego Tony Stark. I have to say I'm sorry. Ulan I am clever Banner now understand in this world ...Black Panther's one reason he killed his father and take revenge on Tony's next for him after WS think on that side already find the right path.When it comes to BW, the woman does not know what he was doing already. Tony went to a gas side of things but still looked serious Cap.Let's get to Spidey. First, Tom, I hate Peter Parker sucks beyond cinema also been contrived role. High school students have done a hero or you know something I do not say more. Aunt May in disaster seriously. Interesting. If we look at the normal age of the child, though. Also, just because a lot of crap to include the story was Tony. You know a lot of myths. Hopefully after this predicament as Peter against my friends. Do not remove the costume, if possible at all.I like Spider-Man, as it is not bad. The learning that fought during the war and the war in the 6 month process interesting. I liked fighting speaking style and the very speech. He left hop details. Spidey talking alone our other heroes were fighting remained heavy in this situation.In the film, we see a very serious fight scene, I bind you in friendship.If Tony's friends never thought I could sell so quickly. Even when they do something every moment captured in Recovers said, but did not. I'm still angry now also understand events.Bucky's Tony's a soldier that is controlled by the family of the man killed Hydra situation is very clear they do not even remember that moment. There should act mature. Nothing to do eventually family.A lot of friends in the film as the film instead of the Civil War Winter Soldier: Bucky's Roads. Zemo's because the man went to the caliper. As a result, the film was not very exciting but tastefully monitored. Yours ...</fullReview>

Chris Evans expresses beautifully.Robert Downey displays the same attitude that personifies him.Overall all the actors have done a nice job. Action sequences were top notch in the second half!!! You might feel disappointed with how SPIDEY is handled but overall it is a good watch. To sum it up it was more of an AVENGERS assemble fighting the enemy within. Highly recommended.

		<shortDescription>Best Crossover Movie to Date</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>DISCLAIMER: I read Marvel's Civil War four or more years ago and I believe it is the best story arc ever written. Not only does the story arc include almost every character in the Marvel comic world, it has an incredibly relevant and sound basis. Hence, I was very skeptical of the movie because it had so much to live up to.That's how blown away I was with the movie because they adapted it well for the screen and made a compelling enough story that wasn't too simplistic. Some may say that this was nothing more than a Marvel version of Batman v. Superman. Not even. This story existed well before that movie came out and the Batman v. Superman impetus was very contrived (a Gotham City character interacting with a Metropolis character and the simple moralistic reasons they fought). Civil War, as the name implies, was far more encompassing than simply two superegos battling it out with one having an epiphany mid-fight. This is the best crossover multi-character movie to date.You may ask about the action because after all this is a big budget superhero movie. Don't worry your little head about that. With 12 of Marvel's finest partaking in a battle you are sure to see plenty of well choreographed fighting and an equal amount of quips and one-liners.But the action isn't the reason for the excellent review; it all goes back to the story. It's been a while since I've seen a superhero story this well written. They stuck to the true essence of the Civil War story arc (that being superhero registration) while adapting it to introduce characters not originally apart of the story AND making the story believable enough to have a final showdown.Sometimes, in an effort to get an epic fight, a movie will throw together a very elementary plot that has all the complexity of a game of tag. Basically a simple misunderstanding or good guy turned rogue and two friends are in a Battle Royal. Civil War's plot was more layered, more multi-dimensional and more thought provoking. Civil War had something for everyone and for sure when it was over you had chosen a side.</fullReview>

Definitely fight is not the answer. Same thing happens with Tony Stark aka IRON MAN and Steve Rogers aka CAPTAIN America.Some chose Tony's side and others choose captain side.They came to fight against each other. That's what the guy behind this wanted. He know he can't kill avengers but they can themselves.Robert Downey Jr. as iron man was superb but Chris Evans is awesome as captain. Cameos of ant man and spider man steals the show in anticlimax fight in airport.Climax fight is just stunning when Iron man and captain faces each other.Visuals are awesome and stunt choreography with dozen superheros is at it's best. Russo brothers made justice to story and screenplay.Finally the best superhero movie I have ever see till now. This just raised my expectations on next avengers movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad Aftertaste (Spoilers in the review)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To start off, I am a huge Marvel fan &amp; absolutely LOVE watching all of their films. Captain America: Civil War was a highly awaited one &amp; there was good reason for that, it had all the right ingredients to be the best superhero movie till date. An explosive cast? Check. A gripping storyline? Check. A realistic problem? Check. Drama &amp; suspense? Check. Humour? Check. Excitement? Check x infinity. The movie starts off really well &amp; really does keep you at the edge of the seat wondering what will come next but in the end it let's you down as it ends in a really simplistic manner. (Spoilers beyond this line) Tony finds out his parents had been murdered by Bucky &amp; in a fit of rage &amp; thirst for vengeance faces off against Bucky &amp; CapAm, in the end he gets beat &amp; accepts defeat. But here the plot begs the question: Would a character like Tony who does not give up when his loved ones are in question &amp; who has a fairly large ego just stop because he got beaten once? I don't think so &amp; I feel that's a major plot hole, Tony would come back with a new Iron Legion &amp; make CapAm &amp; Bucky pay. The only way to stop him would have been if Tony had EMPATHISED with Bucky, making him realise that just like he had killed innocents with Ultron unknowingly, Bucky had killed innocents under Hydra's control unknowingly. That's the only way Tony would have realised the flaws of his actions &amp; that an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind. CapAm going on fighting as if it was personal rather than an effort to save a friend from a friend also messed with Steve Rodgers' character as a sensible guy. The movie ends on a sour &amp; unrealistic note, Zemo gets his way, the Avengers crumble &amp; Captain America is the only one who gets what he wants - a complete ignorance of the Sokovia Accords. As a regular viewer of Marvel movies I had come to expect their movies ending on positive notes but this one just didn't feel like that &amp; I for one wasn't too fond of the change. I'm not saying the movie was bad, no it was definitely good, Spider man is the best Spider man yet, the interplay of Falcon &amp; CapAm is fantastic, Black Panther is someone you definitely connect with &amp; Ant Man continues to pull much more than his weight however this movie for one had the potential to be absolutely perfect but it wasn't &amp; the only reason for that was the sour finish. An unrealistic finish that completely ignores the character traits of 2 of it's most important characters. If I were to sum up my feelings I'd say I'm satisfied but not pleased as Marvel, in my humble opinion, let slip an opportunity to bring to its fanbase the best superhero movie till date.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marvel's form of Angst.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unlike the DC films I have seen that are full of foreboding and angst and self reflection and are dark and broody, such as "Batman v. Superman", I find Marvel to be warm, inviting, cheerful and fun, even when they are being broody.The story picks up from the last Marvel films Ant-man and Avengers:Age of Ultron. It does not incorporate any of the "Agents of Shield" television series, as happened last year. The Avengers, as they stand, are Captain America, Iron Man, Black Widow, Falcon (from Captain America: Winter Soldier and Ant-Man) and Scarlet Witch (from Age of Ultron). At the home base is Vision (from Age of Ultron), who makes some pivotal decisions later in the film. Saving the world many times comes at a great cost of human lives, and rather than be grateful only 10,000 died instead of a million, the UN has now created a protocol to put a rhetorical political leash on the Avengers. Not all agree. Tony says the Avengers need oversight (since there is no more official S.H.I.E.L.D), whereas Captain America believes the hero force must be independent to fight evil where they find it. If they were all of the same mind, there would be no movie. This is because *spoiler alert* the bad guy, named Zemo, is counting on this division. Zemo is grieving for his lost family killed in Sokovia by the villain Ultron lifting the city and then dropping it. Of course, he blames the Avengers. So he has hatched a long, convoluted scheme.This is my only problem with the Marvel universe. Blame the bad guy, not the heroes who saved us from the bad guys. But then we wouldn't put ourselves into the position of trying to control them politically. And Zemo is counting on this schism to seek revenge by making hero battle hero. And it works. There is a sub- plot about a group of "super-soldiers" formulated at the same time as Winter-Soldier (who also is a possible future ally.) It leads to some of the best fight scenes ever (not). No, it actually leads to nowhere, as they were only used as a ruse to get to a video. A video taken from some mysterious camera, that happened to be just where it needed to be.But enough with that. These are super-hero's, after all, so if I can suspend disbelief about that, surely I can suspend disbelief about conveniently placed cameras.As a wrap, I can say that when the credits rolled, and I put down my empty soda cup and empty popcorn bag, I had a smile on my face and a warm feeling in my soul, for I had just seen a very important chapter in the Marvel Universe's history and am anxious to see more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An improvement from Age of Ultron</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Civil war is a better improvement from age of ultron but however I feel it doesn't quite live up to the standard set by winter soldier. This film has brilliant performances across most of the board as well as a pretty interesting story to go with it. The Russo brothers have shown how it is possible to have so many characters but able to give each of them enough screen time so that you care about them. They also did a really good job of setting up each side of the arguments of this film whether it be from team cap or team iron man, for me personally I can understand the reasons behind both of them. A Final couple of positives of the film are a few stand out performances, although the majority of them were good. Sebastian Stan as winter soldier is the best part of the film once again, he did a fantastic job as the character and is a step above the rest. Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr also were also really good against each other making you believe the tension between the two characters. A little extra surprise to look for is ant man who is far better in this film than in his own solo film. Now onto the negatives of the film, the first is regarding the title of the film civil WAR. With a name like civil war and in any film with the name war in it, I would not be mistaken to think that one character would probably die. However NONE of the major characters in the airport fight die, winter solider being frozen again doesn't count. I think a more appropriate title for this film would have been, "Captain America : civil violent argument, but don't worry they will be around for avengers infinity war". The only other negative I with the film and with most marvel films, apart from winter solider, is there are too many jokes. Age of ultron and guardians of the galaxy are the worst at this and personally whenever a punch line comes up or happens it takes me out of the film. Makes the film and scenes seem childish and that the only purpose is to have a scene is for a joke which I personally find horrible. Finally I must mention this although its like comparing apples to oranges , captain America civil war is a better film than BVS. Although it pains me to say that, being a DC fan, they have a far better story which is simple at its core, however they have had since 2008 to get to this stage.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Full of superheroes but an exciting start to Phase 3 of the MCU</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a lot of superheroes in a Captain America: Civil War, so much so that the movie can barely contain it, but somehow it is pulled off to make an enjoyable, action-packed adventure and kick off the new phase of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I need to make a list so I remember: starting with Captain America there is also Falcon, Scarlet Witch, Black Widow, Winter Soldier, Hawkeye, Vision, War Machine, Black Panther, Ant-Man, Spiderman and of course Iron Man. The movie is packed but the plot was brisk only slowing down to explore the complex issue of the Sokovia Accord.The movie begins with the villain Crossbones played by Frank Grillo returning from the second film. He was in it for only a short amount of time but there are plenty of heroes to fill the void. The Vision and Scarlet Witch are forming a relationship that was shown in the Avengers: Age of Ultron. This movie is really a sequel to the Avengers and adds even more to the mix though it leaves off Thor and Hulk for a later film. Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It could have been better, but still a well executed Marvel film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"CA: Civil War" is an important step in super hero movies, because as known, it deals with some moral themes, asking some moral questions, it focuses on the destruction and mayhem in the cities by heroes. Therefore, it is an emotional movie also which is nice. Despite the movie is called "civil war", this is not exactly a war, a mini battle between the allies. This feels like an epic film, but unfortunately it is not. The best action part of the film comes at this point: the famous airport scene! It could have been much better, but still great! Recently, some super hero movies have started to inspire from "Empire Strikes Back" and this movie is one of them. It tries to be dark and epic like "ESB". Crossbones was a disappointment as a cameo, the other villain is pretty interesting though. The opening sequence of the movie which recalls "Expendables" movies are fun, but no more than that. The meetings among the heroes to discuss the subjects are key points of the film and very interesting to listen, but it could have been deeper, darker and longer. There is a few moments of an avenger in the middle of the movie and it is pretty touching indeed, Russo Brothers can touch your heart which is a plus, but again, the movie could have been much more touching and also intense. Black Panther is perfect! He is the star of the movie like Bucky in "The Winter Soldier." The chase scene is one of the bests in Marvel history. The shoots are jaw dropping! The battle between Cap and Stark which is the main focus of the story is fairly done and technically masterful, but it feels rushed. It is not brilliant or unforgettable, but touching and impressive! Iron Man is not too powerful in this movie which is an improvement (realistic) By the way, I was very impressed by the strong friendship between Steve and Bucky. "Civil War" is not epic or action packed, but it is very good. Spider- Man here is hilarious here and it is not a disappointment. I just didn't like his new "camera" eyes. Also, I don't like these frequent casting changes, but every new change means a new chance. As for Aunt May, a bold choice, but it was OK. All the other heroes do their part without question. For War Machine, I prefer Terrence Howard, but Cheadle is OK, too. Black Panther is cool, but too assertive and too self confident, but the character was extremely impressive. "Captain America: Civil War" is a very good and strong super hero movie, but it could have been better. I prefer "The Winter Soldier" over "Civil War."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>By every movie Marvel is getting better and better.This is epic...The action was the best ever seen in superhero history and I loved it..Spider Man is extremely funny and finally we saw a different young awesome Spider Man...I really loved the way they have introduced us to Black Panther,he was fantastic.Ant Man was un un un unbelievable!. By the end,as we expected Captain America defeats Iron Man and Tony lost for no reason! Did you see how hard Cap was hitting him..For me,no matter what, I wouldn't be back with Cap again if I was Stark..Iron Man maybe wrong but to see him recover would be very interesting in Avengers: Infinity War.From the beginning to end, I was waiting for Cap to die but he didn't! which made the ending stupid! No one died in the movie,not even Rhodes (War Machine). We all thought Rhodes would die but no one, no one died..That is what made this movie a little down!. Well that's all I got to say! Epic movie of the franchise!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>FANTASTIC - Except for Zemo and the Ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>CA:CW Where BvS was a fairly significant letdown for me, this film - while fantastic - is still a very mild letdown.The flaws(the 1st 2 kinda overlap): 1. This is what I mentioned in my BvS review. I was not a fan of the somewhat mentally unstable Lex Luthor. But I still stand by my opinion that Luthor was a far more effective villain than Zemo. Zemo in the end was just a criminal/terrorist. And he was just a dud IMO. 2. CA:CW up until the end sequence in Siberia is significantly better than BvS, but then it falls kinda flat at the end. That ending was just a big fizzle for me. And where BvS - though extremely dark - ends on a brighter, hopeful note. CA:CW is not as dark - up to that end - which is darker IMO. (Now, before the marvel guys start emailing me death threats and viruses ... I acknowledge that this is in line with the direction of the MCU, and the dark ending is supposed to setup the IW movies. But honestly, I think the ending setup in BvS was a tad bit better) 3. The battle scenes in Nigeria were shot all shaky so that they were kinda hard to follow. I don't remember that in TWS. The rest of the action scenes were all top-notch.The really good stuff: 1. CA:CW intro'ed Spidey and BP perhaps even a bit better than BvS did with BM and WW(though I think they both did those well). 2. Really well-done comic relief from Spidey and Ant-Man. I loved how those 2 played into the story. 3. Aside from Zemo's story, the writing was fantastic, near perfect. The story does flow and is easier to follow that the 1st half of BvS.So - for me - the net result of it is that - yes - CA:CW is better. It is a fantastic movie even with the somewhat disappointing ending. But I don't see it being a 10 nor BvS being a 1. It's more like 8.7-8.9 compared to 8.0-8.3 IMO.8.8</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing new..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Spoiler alert is needed.For a movie that contains War in the title there are too few battles. The movie is 2 and a half hours, it has so many characters and it manages to focus on a few. The "villain" in the movie was the most refreshing part. A simple guy with an idea that simply works. However they decided a better movie is made by just providing screen time to some big names. Having in mind that some of the heroes were just there for the paycheck as their relevance to the story was zero. Perhaps Spiderman was adding some difference and volume to the movie and I can not say he was bad. The problem is you can sense he was included to sell merchandise. Black Panther was also a nice character on the sidelines but he did not get far in gathering a real fan base. Overall like each Marvel movie we get flashbacks from the past and each movie reveals something new that "surprisingly" nobody knows. In conclusion the story is focused on describing the dynamic of the Avengers. Remember after you've seen the movie when the title has Captain and War in it, how much action did it have?</fullReview>

I kept assuming the civil war was going to be against super natural vs humans. More chaotic is what I thought, but still loved the movie. It was great to see all the different characters keep their roles tight. I went an seen this movie in 3D it was cool. Still prefer the good old 2D movie.

		<fullReview>Superhero fatigue is a problem that many people think is starting to settle in. Fantastic Four was an abysmal film and it made less than Spy Kids 3D: Game Over. Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice received terrible reviews and had one of the biggest Friday to Sunday drops. Are people sick of these films? Well, not if you're in the Marvel family it seems. For one thing, Marvel actually takes pride and careful attention to detail with their films, both the previously mentioned titles are rush jobs for specific reasons. Civil War is proof that the good guy vs good guy aspect of superhero films can be done right.The world wants to hold the Avengers accountable for all the death and destruction they've caused over the years, so the United Nations put together the Sokovia Accords, which means the Avengers would work for them. Tony Stark supports this. Steve Rogers does not. Things get more complicated when Bucky turns up again and is the prime suspect in a bombing that kills dozens of people. With two prominent members of the Avengers on opposing sides of the issue, will the team ever be the same again?Civil War has a lot going for it. Stellar cast, great characters, top-notch special effects, excellent action sequences, comedic relief and...well the list goes on. The Russo brothers have delivered a slick action film that makes me comfortable with the fact that they seem to be at the helm of the Marvel franchise now. When The Avengers was first announced, I thought it was going to be dreadful, then they said these guy named Joss Whedon was going to be directing it and my expectations instantly changed. Whedon delivered a great superhero film that set up the rest of the films to come. The Russo brothers now have the task of juggling all these characters and they do an admirable job.Each character has their shining moments, but the core of the story is Stark vs Rogers. So while it's fun to have Rudd come in and have a few laughs, I don't think anyone is expecting huge things from his character. Same with Spider-Man, who is forced in here to set up his future films within this weird shared universe with Sony. Those are not complaints, they both work wonderfully in the film. If I were to find a complaint it would be in the thought process of the villain, Zemo. His plan is so painstakingly convoluted that I wonder how it even worked at all. Too many things need to fall in place for him to get what he wants and it distracts from the emotional power of the climax. The actors and the history with the characters manage to save it a bit and do raise the stakes, but I had my problems nonetheless.The grand spectacle at the airport between these characters was indeed a highlight. When you have characters like Vision and Scarlet Witch, who are so powerful they could end the fight instantly, it's a good idea to have them simply do damage control. I wondered how they would handle these two, they did a decent job of it. After this film, I can only hope that Infinity Wars goes this route and gives each Avenger a worthy foe to fight and not a hoard of mindless foot soldiers, which is exactly what the previous two Avengers films did. Fans of the series will be pleased, the action is great (a bit shaky at first, but they let it breath later on) and some great introductions of new characters that will bring a fresh perspective to the franchise. Black Panther for one, steals a lot of the scenes he is in. Bold move to have such a big character "show up" in the film without a solo movie to set him up, but it works here. The cast is diversifying as more and more characters come into these films and I'm glad to see it. Tony Stark is great, RDJ does a great job with him, but we've seen the guy have a big role in these films 6 times now. I get that Marvel is scared to let some of these characters go because they are so integral to everything, but I honestly believe something along these lines needs to happen to bring more emotional depth to the franchise. For a studio willing to take chances are projects like Guardians of the Galaxy, they need to take a chance on this aspect as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>CAPTAIN America: CIVIL WAR starts out as a gabfest but mercifully degenerates into a cgi slugfest before all is said and done. While it's not exactly sophisticated in its overall concept ("divide and conquer"), it's better than most of the comic book-based fare to which we've been subjected these past several years. The only reason I was interested in seeing this one was because it promised to finally introduce one of Jack Kirby's greatest creations- The Black Panther- to the Big Screen. His origin story is told (however briefly) and we get to see him in costume (in the comics, his one-piece all black costume is almost identical to the DC Golden Age character Wildcat's costume) and in action (outrunning speeding police vehicles in questionable cgi sequences, but otherwise stealing most of the scenes he's in simply by virtue of being there). There are more superheroes per square foot in this one than in both AVENGERS movies combined. Comics fans can't ask for more (the screen couldn't hold 'em).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A follow up to winter soldier and age of ultron, the movie has a lot of what most of this super hero movies have: its too light at all times. My problem with this movie is it picked up the most annoying boy-ish aspect of the avengers movies: Exaggerated team fights were everyone fights super epic ally and nobody is scratched, guess the friend of iron man got hurt, i can't remember his name. It's got tons of logic mess ups and the physics are so off, everything is too fast. I know marvel wants to attract smaller kids because they increase revenue insanely, specially with the merchandise, but man, you never see gore,something frightening, or smart chats, just everyone killing mercenaries flawlessly, but can't get a hit on the stronger avenger dudes. Id love to see someone take 2 hits like a champ, but unable to get up, instead of having black widow be hit 400 times and a kick makes her fly 10 meters, hit a wall and nothing happens to her, perfect hair and her face is pretty as usual. In ultron there were 1000 explosions and her face barely had dirt. Everyone gets hit and walks it off, but if somebody hits an obstacle, oh, he is down for the count. What makes an action movie good, is not a lot of action, it's the development of the characters and the small events in between Next movie: Change up your plot twists please.

		<fullReview>Captain America: Civil War is Marvel's best movie yet and blows you away with a great story, humor and solid performances from Chris Evans, Tom Holland, Chadwick Boseman and Robert Downey Jr. The movie has faults such as limited development for some characters and some forced things in the plot but the positives simply outweigh the negatives by a large margin. Tom Holland gives us an amazing Spider Man that I look forward to seeing more of in the MCU and the plot gives us some valid points to Stark and Captain America's side which adds a flavor to the movie t. Characters such as Black Panther, Black Widow, Falcon and Wanda Maximoff are emotionally torn apart between Stark and Steve Roger's sides. This is the best movie so far of 2016 and the second best superhero movie behind The Dark Knight. I look forward to seeing more of the MCU and their upcoming projects in the years to come.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watched the movie yesterday. Without giving any spoilers, I thought that it was a very enjoyable movie, even for non-super hero moviegoer fans. The acting was excellent, especially Iron Man and Spiderman. The cinematography was very good, with the main battle between the opposing factions being the highlight...superb.The only flaw, if it can be called that, was that the movie started out rather slowly, but after the first twenty minutes or so, it was almost continuous action. No wonder that the Metascore rating is so high and the rotten tomatoes website gives the move very good reviews in general. The movie has everything, including a little humor at the right times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another killer movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a spoiler free review so please read for information regarding if its okay for kids to watch and if its a good movie(WHICH IT IS). Alright hi, Where do i start? This is a another amazing super hero movie which is totally different from an average super hero movie. This movie is like Avengers 2.5 and I would rather have this be the Avengers movie from last year which was Age of Ultron which was disappointing. Age of Ultron was setting up way too many future movies coming out like the third Thor movie. Age of Ultron was going in a million directions and you would be clueless and ask questions like Why is he in the movie if he isn't related in any way to the story line? However this movie was on topic and had a great story and by the end of the movie you would be like that all made sense. Now lets dive in and see what made this movie amazing. After the events of Captain America The Winter Soldier and Avengers: Age of Ultron, we see our hero Captain America doing his job which is saving people. Captain America alongside with the other Avengers: Black Widow, Falcon, and Scarlett Witch and the last two have become Avengers now, are on a mission when suddenly something bad happens and a building blows up with people in it. 170 countries unite and create the Sokovia Accords which states that any super hero must sign this and register their information just in case something bad happens and you don't get the blame for it. Captain America thinks its a bad idea (which I will not spoil why). While Iron Man thinks its a great idea( Which I will also not spoil). Then it becomes small argument which then becomes a "war' when a bombing happens and Bucky Barnes aka the Winter Soldier gets the blame for it. Captain America knows it wasn't him and goes against the law to protect his best friend. This movie introduce two major characters who I already started loving right when they got on screen. Spider Man who I thought was like the best character of the movie right next to Captain America and Black Panther who was a bad-ass. Both just fit in the movie and made everything perfect. Spider Man was hilarious and when he came in the movie and enchanted his stuff, I was like he is what made this movie one of the best. Black Panther was a bad-ass. When they introduced him in the movie, he was being fired at by a helicopter and bullets bounced right off his suit and I was just blown away. Im not going to spoil anything else so please go watch this movie. Sadly there was one flaw of the movie, the villain. Yeah there was a small villain who didn't have a costume but in the comics he's amazing! In the movie he isn't :(. Im talking about Baron Zemo who wasn't appealing at all and has a terrible backstory but is a really good mastermind! You will see why in the end of the movie. The action in this movie blew my mind away, the airport scene was one of the best action scene I have scene in my whole life, it was beautiful, well choreographed action and each character got their own solo part which told us why we grew up loving them. So please I cannot stretch it enough to go watch this movie. IS IT OKAY FOR THE KIDS? Yes its perfectly fine just like a couple of uses of S--T which you barely hear so its fine and there was this one quick kiss that wasn't teasing any kind of sexual interaction, just a sweet kiss and was funny, you will know when you see it. This movie also has great positive messages from Captain America like you don't leave anyone behind. Chris Evans has done it again as Captain America and told me why Cap is my favorite superhero. So please go watch this movie and have a great day!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the More Important Entries in the MCU</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Action packed from beginning to end, Marvel Studios expands its cinematic universe yet again in Captain America: Civil War.As the Avengers have stepped up to the plate, toe to toe against the forces that threaten our humble blue planet, public opinion of our heroes have been heavily tainted due to the high body count, and absolute destruction left in the wake of events that occurred in New York, Washington D.C, and the fictional country of Sokovia. Some hail the Avengers as the only group able to battle such enemies, but others believe that these events occurred because the Avengers allowed them to happen. Think about it for a second, if Thor never came to Earth, then neither would Loki. If Stark never invented the A.I Jarvis, then Ultron would never have been born. Captain America has been left in charge of the team for now, but the U.S government would like them to register their identities, and put themselves under their command. Although this entry lightly samples the massive 2006/07 Civil War crossover events, it does well on its own as the Marvel universe expands.The plot is everything an action movie should be, with a few twists and turns in the road. It is of course as linear an event as you would expect, you know 'catch the bad guy,' as every superhero film goes, and it rehashes a few topics already touched on in the first Avengers film where you have the typical 'Hero Vs. Hero' situation that everyone seems to love. Yet the film does well in its intensity, and is never cartoonish or convoluted within the borders of the story-line. I didn't expect too much after seeing 'The Winter Soldier (2014), which I felt was probably one of the more boring entries from Marvel, but this film makes up for that slow movie, expands on it, and drives home quite a punch. This is the film that I felt closes the second phase of Marvel, and leaves it open for new additions for the next.I found it difficult to put the focus on Captain America, because of the sheer volume of characters who star and interact with each other. It is a 'Captain America' branded film, but he shares the screen with several heroes throughout the film, and arguably this movie doesn't necessarily feel too focused on him. The major players all happen to pop in at some time (barring Thor and Hulk), but a few new faces have joined in the fray. Chris Evans does well reprising his role as the titular character. Robert Downey Jr, and Scarlett Johansson easily have as much screen time with the Captain (arguably more). Sebastian Stan returns as Bucky Barnes, and has certainly beefed up since his last incarnation as the Winter Soldier. A few new faces enter the fray as well. Chadwick Boseman as the Black Panther gets a poignant origin story here. Tom Holland, as the teenage Spiderman, is a welcome addition if you can ignore all other incarnations of the Webslinger (it fits better with the overall story if you do, and you don't won't have to shake your head at the gaping plot hole he provides). Finally, I was quite surprised at Daniel Bruhl's portrayal as the manipulative and intelligent Baron Zemo, and he was definitely the most human role in this entire film.However, one small issue I had was with the motivations behind the main characters. I did have a hard time trying to figure out what the divide was between these friends, outside of Tony Stark's and the Captain's motivations to keep the planet safe at all costs. I didn't really get why Stark would feel the need to register all superheroes if the government ALREADY knows who each super-individual is, and where they are at all times. Wouldn't registration be irrelevant? Tony Stark is one person who should be AGAINST this idea. After all, he's seen the Chitauri army gifted to Loki via Thanos during the Battle of New York, and he's one of the few people who comprehend the magnitude of this threat that faces mankind from a galaxy away.On the flipside; Why does Captain America, who's been a government agent from the very start of his adventure, oppose such a move from the U.S ? He's been a soldier in the American Army since World War II. If anything, he should be the one supporting registration, because he is already registered as a U.S infantryman. What's the difference if they are or not? It poses no threat to the Avengers, nor their members, nor the Winter Soldier. If he signed it, he could still go on after Bucky, and keep his allegiance in tact. An avid fan could easily argue these two roles should have been reversed from the comic book approach (where it made a lot more sense due to the sheer number of mutants and super-powered individuals, many of whom live in secret and have lives or families to protect. Cap goes against the government's plans for registration because he sees the act somewhat akin to what the Nazi's did to the Jewish people in WW2), but I'm certain they wanted to adhere to the original comic event somewhat without too many alterations.The movie could have easily been called Captain America Vs Iron Man, and still do well as a set up to the future Civil War events. I suppose, Marvel Studios wants to plow ahead with its endgame before people lose interest by 2018. All in all, Civil War is an absolute action smash from beginning to end, and I think this will be noted as one of the more important entries in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.</fullReview>

They made really good work with the characters they had available.Another aspect I didn't expect, is to like the new Spider-man. Despite the fact that he is far younger than any version yet, he is true to character, being the classic nerd and cracking jokes left and right.So far, the best movie of this year I have seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw Captain America Civil War in 3d this afternoon. There is a lot to take in while it was going on. Some things I thought I didn't understand during the movie, I was able to put together afterwards. It's almost like a political thriller. Being a follower of movies in general, I could get them referencing The Avengers and I was thinking, 'The Avengers must've been one hell of a movie'. That, and Age of Ultron. Being a newbie in the Marvel movies is somewhat challenging because there's so much history between the characters. Of course, it goes far beyond the movies; one would need to completely follow the stories in order to get as much as possible from it. It feels like there are two stories going on here: one is that The Avengers team are to sign the "Sokovia Accords" so as to lessen the amount of destruction of city streets and public property, which was probably what happened in the previous movies. It would be therefore to not place innocent civilians in danger. Most of them are in agreement with, except Steve Rogers aka Captain America. Afterwards, the South side of a building in Vienna gets destroyed where the signing of the Accords are to take place, which is how the character of Black Panther is introduced. To him it's personal because that's how he lost his father. Then, the other story is of Helmut Zemo, who masquerades as a doctor so he could steal a formula used for creating Winter Soldiers as what happened to Bucky Barnes. It's to extend HYDRA's army of killing machines (this goes back to Captain America: The First Avenger). Later on, much later on, Tony Stark finds out it was his parents who were murdered on the side of a road one night by The Winter Soldier, therefore making it more of a personal battle. Then there's Captain America with his loyalty to Bucky. It is a very good movie. I like how a lot of the characters tie in with one another. I like the addition of Black Panther and Spider-Man. My one problem with this movie is that it's LONG. Much of it goes by at a nice pace but getting towards the end, I was wondering when it was going to finish and why is that many of these blockbuster movies need to be 2 and a half hours long. Anyway, my overall rating is B+.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty Civil</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With a first half that is little more than an overlong political drama and a second half filled with huge action, Whedon-esque quips from a multitude of super-cameos; capped off with a single (masterful) revelation sequence, the main reason "Captain America: Civil War" only garners 7 stars has to do with a finale where?How do I say this without spoiling things?..."Captain America: Civil War", a movie which contains the epic Iron Man vs. Captain America confrontation; a confrontation which has been at least four films in the making, settles on a resolution that can only be described as "civil".Synopsis: Do the Avengers do more harm than good? NATO thinks so, as they petition to garner control of this super-group, after global outcry from citizens who were a part of the collateral damage seen in the last two Avengers films, request governmental restraint on the independently run team. This diplomatic plot device divides the group; with unresolved results.Is it me or did that plot seem way too CNN for a superhero movie? Well, that's because it was. And the deeper into the political well the extremely talkie "Civil War" fell into, the harder it became for me to wrap my mind around the fact that I potentially could be stuck watching an entire superhero film consisting of a series of repetitive moral and ethical roundtable discussions for 2 ? hours.Mid-Second Act, with the emergence of cameos from Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) Ant-Man (Paul Rudd)and the new Spider-Man (Tom Holland) who was shockingly the best part of the film, "Civil War" becomes the action packed superhero movie I'd been promised. During these moments (and only during these moments) do directors Anthony and Joe Russo shine. It just took so long to get there, as the plot did not warrant the pacing displayed within the first hour or so.And it all seemed to be going well. I was now entertained. During the final Act I had become immersed in a Greek tragedy plot twist which had me leaning forward in my seat (essentially in a bloodlust). And then? Bottom line, the conclusion to this film was surprisingly tame.Final Thought: Not only was "Captain America: Winter Soldier" a better movie, but so was "Batman v. Superman".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good waiting to be Great.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a good movie so far unless they create a sequel of this story line. The excitement of this film is not consistent. Let say the first and middle part of it is very ecstatic but the last part I think is kind of emotional and left me hanging but that's the great part of commercial movies they left the viewers crave for more. Also the credit part after you watch it, you will definitely say "I'll be waiting for more". Another positive remarks on this movie is, it has a great pick for casting especially for the newcomers; the new spidey, Tom Holland, will be a great Spider-man as what he showed in this movie. I'm a bit anxious on his stand-alone movie. And good line-up of heroes. Overall a good movie but not that great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Captain America: Civil War</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not technically a sequel to the Captain America series, it is more like another Avengers movie, the only Marvel characters missing are Nick Fury, Thor and the Hulk, so I looked forward to it, from director brothers Anthony and Joe Russo (Welcome to Collinwood, You, Me and Dupree, Captain America: The Winter Soldier). Basically the Avengers: Steve Rogers aka Captain America (Chris Evans), Natasha Romanoff aka Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Sam Wilson aka Falcon (Anthony Mackie) and Wanda Maximoff aka Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen, Mary-Kate and Ashley's sister) cause unintentional destruction whilst saving the world, the team are brought before U.S. Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross (William Hurt). Ross informs the team that the United Nations (UN) will have a panel determine their control for protection of the world, the team is divided: Tony Stark aka Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) supports oversight because he feels the destruction, but Rogers has more faith in his judgement than the government. A bomb explosion occurs in Vienna, security footage indicates the bomber is brainwashed super-soldier Bucky Barnes aka Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan), King T'Chaka (John Kani) is killed and his son T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman) vows to kill the Barnes. The government intends to kill Barnes, Rogers wants to bring him, as his childhood friend and war comrade, Rogers and Wilson find him in Bucharest, but they, Barnes and T'Challa, as his alter ego the Black Panther, are arrested. Helmut Zemo (Rush's Daniel Brühl) kills Barnes's old Hydra handler and steals a book containing trigger words that activate Barnes's brainwashing, infiltrating the facility Barnes is being held Zemo recites these words to make Barnes obey him, Zemo questions him, then sends him on a rampage. Rogers stops Barnes, he regains his senses and explains that Zemo is the real Vienna bomber, he wanted the location of of the Siberian Hydra base, where other brainwashed super-soldiers are kept in cryogenic stasis, unwilling to wait for authorisation to apprehend Zemo, Rogers and Wilson go rogue, recruiting Maximoff, Clint Barton aka Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and Scott Lang aka Ant-Man (Paul Rudd). Ross gives permission to Stark to capture the renegades, he assembles Romanoff and T'Challa in a team, along with Lieutenant James Rhodes aka War Machine (Don Cheadle), Vision (Paul Bettany) and new recruit Peter Parker aka Spider-Man (The Impossible's Tom Holland). Stark's team and Rogers' team come face to face at Leipzig/Halle Airport, they fight each other and cause destruction around them, until Romanoff allows Rogers and Barnes to escape, the rest of Rogers' team are captured and held at the Raft prison, Vision inadvertently shot down Rhodes causing him to be partially paralysed, and Romanoff is forced to go into hiding. Stark discovers evidence that Zemo framed Barnes and shows Wilson the evidence, Wilson gives Rogers' location, Stark goes to the Siberian Hydra facility, Rogers and Barnes are there and they strike a truce, T'Challa secretly followed, they discover the other super-soldiers have been killed Zemo, who shows Hydra archive footage that brainwashed Barnes was responsible for the death of Stark's parents, thought to be killed in an automobile accident. Stark is enraged that Rogers was aware of this and turns on them, blasting off Barnes' robotic arm, Rogers disables Stark's armour and escapes with Barnes, leaving his shield behind, Zemo is satisfied he has fractured the Avengers and attempts suicide, but T'Challa stops him and takes him to the authorities. In the aftermath, Rhodes is provided with exoskeletal leg braces to walk again, Rogers breaks his allies out of the Raft, Barnes is granted asylum by T'Challa and put into cryogenic sleep until a cure for his brainwashing can be found, Stark reads a letter from Rogers which assures him there can be a future for the Avengers, and Parker is seen testing a new gadget from Stark. Also starring Emily VanCamp as Sharon Carter, Frank Grillo as Brock Rumlow aka Crossbones, Martin Freeman as Everett K. Ross, Marisa Tomei as Aunt May Parker, John Slattery as Howard Stark, Hope Davis as Maria Stark, Alfre Woodard as Miriam Sharpe and Stan Lee as FedEx Driver. Evans and Downey Jr. dominate most of the picture with their acting skills, but it is great to see all the superheroes together again, the highlight is when they all clash, fight together and destroy an airport, the introductions of the Black Panther and web-slinging Spider-Men is well done, there is a good mixture of high-octane energy and a little needed humour, the special effects for the super powers and explosions are fantastic, and the story is relatively interesting, all in all it is a great fun action adventure. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As much a Captain America as an Iron Man movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is amazing to me that a movie like this manages to be not just a great sequel to The Winter Soldier, but also to Iron Man 3, AND Age of Ultron, and still also be a good movie. A movie like this could easily crumble under the weight of so many characters, and yet it doesn't. Most of them get plenty of plot and an arc. Enough time is also dedicated to the new characters that this movie introduces. This is not just a mindless action movie, like Age of Ultron. This is a pretty clever movie, with a solid plot, some red herrings, and twists. Of course not all characters get equal screen time. Thor and The Hulk aren't in the movie at all. And Hawk Eye is barely in it either. Other characters such as Vision, Scarlet Witch and Black Widow do get a decent plot. Vision struggles with human behavior, Wanda struggles with people being afraid of her, and Black Widow is caught in the middle, and struggling to pick a side. But in the end, I found myself strongly agreeing with Tony Stark. Even by the end of the movie, me and my friends had strong disagreements about which character was in the right. I find this a clear sign of a very strong plot.Where the movie especially shines is it's first half. The movie spends a lot of time explaining the conflict at the heart of the story, and addresses the cost of all the absurd destruction from The Avengers, Iron Man, The Winter Soldier and Age of Ultron. There's really good dialogue in this film. I loved hearing every characters point of view, and it's hard to argue with any of them. They all have solid motives. The new character Black Panther isn't just thrown in at random. He is central to the plot. And the plot feels very serious, just like with The Winter Soldier. It isn't until the middle of the movie, that it embraces the over the top comic book action and the humor from The Avengers. So in a way, this movie is half Winter Soldier, and half The Avengers.As far as comic book movies go, this is one of the best so far. It stands in stark contrast to the recent Batman V Superman. How can one movie be such a mess, and another do so much right? It honestly is some kind of miracle. Considering all the characters they need to juggle in this movie, and all the plot threads they need to tie together, this is one heck of a script.The action is also top notch. There's a lot of really good car chases and free running action scenes in this. This makes some of the action feel very grounded in reality, just as in The Winter Soldier. I also got the feeling that they made plenty of use of practical effects. Of course there is also plenty of use of CGI and this. But at no point did anything really stand out to me. Again, this is quite a miracle, considering all the different effect studios involved with this.Stay around till after the credits. Because the movie has both a mid-credits sequence, and an after-credits sequence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Captain America: Small Internal Struggle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, it's a given that this is no piece of art, being a Marvel movie. There won't be deep thinking or any thinking at all for that matter. You're expected to see action, explosions, awesome shiny creatures flying around and more explosions. My vote of 7/10 is after taking the genre into consideration. Why 7? Let's start with a perfect score and move down from there.I usually disconnect, unplug and turn off my education when I watch these movies, because I want to be a child again and enjoy them. However, sometimes my inner child decides to be smart and a little "why?" or "how?" slips out and ruins the movie a bit. Here's how it lost 3 points: Civil War is an adaptation from the comic books, but the title didn't keep the meaning. Marvel has been taking end-of-the- world super interesting scenarios and reducing the scale a lot. See Age of Ultron, for example, instead of a machine that could control most of the modern world and use it to give dawn to a new age, an age where humanity has been brought to its knees (*gasp* Age of Ultron...), we get James Spader making jokes and failing at being moderately menacing. It was barely the week of Ultron. Similarly, Civil War was a war that put humanity versus humanity and invoked a real moral dilemma that reached to everyone, turning family members and lovers against each other. It was a matter of people's own nature being possibly harmful to others. It had meaning. It reached you. The first main difference from the comic to the movie, in my opinion, is that the number of affected people is very different. Instead of millions of people that you and I can relate to, there's a dozen characters. The second one is the nature of what makes these characters special. In the comic, it was their powers, something that was part of them. There was no option to quit. They had to sign, and have their identities and powers made public, or fight. In the movie, most of the characters have no powers, just equipment. They have the option to pass it to someone, which also makes the act of signing an agreement kinda futile.This was a story where the Hulk would have mattered and he wasn't there. Marvel moved the Earth trying to get Spider-man because he was crucial to the plot, but in the end he was there just for the action scenes. No impact at all. Thor's perspective (not human) would have been important, but he wasn't there.So, it failed at being a Civil War movie.On the other hand, there are so many characters that you forget who the main character is. It definitely did not feel like a Captain America movie (ok by me, more explosions).In the end, we could have had another Captain America movie and/or we could have had an awesome Civil War movie. In my opinion, it failed, because it tried to be both. It succeeded in being something... different (who cares? explosions) I think minus 3 points for the disappointment is fair enough. It only disappointed, because there was an expectation. If you refrain from comparing to the comic or to previous Cap movies (or to anything that makes sense), it can be an entertaining movie. Again, explosions and jokes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best superhero movie since dark knight. .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was one of the most hyped summer blockbusters of 2016 and i have to say it didn't disappoint me and i have to say infinity wars is in good hands. First off this is a film made on a very good script. And anthony and Joe Russo did a stupendous job in handling a vast cast. Robert downey jr, Chris Evans, tom Holland and Chadwick boseman were standouts of the cast. Every other avengers get a story arc of their own but it is still a captain America movie. Captain bucky relationship, Wanda vision dynamics, spider man, ant-man, black panther and iron man's back story were stand out of the movie. Acting of all the cast was good. And the criticisms regarding helmut zemo, villain of the movie isn't a big problem as there are other villains in the movie who provide higher stakes for the movie. He is one of the most symphatatic villain that has appeared in a comic book movie and he corners captain America and starts civil war. This movie is much better than the comic story arc. All the fight scenes are visually enriching and have proved that you do not have to level cities to be visually good. And this movie sets other mcu movies while also telling the current story arc. This movie kick starts the phase 3 and back bones the other two avengers movies. This movie can be watched by average film goers and the audience may not necessarily be comic nerds.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's Hard to Top The First Avengers Movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After The Avengers came out back in 2012, Marvel Studios had a crap year back in 2013 with the release of a lot of bad superhero movies including the second Thor and the Third and Final Iron Man. 2014 seemed to be a much better year, but unfortunately, nothing Marvel Studios topped The Avengers. 2015 was when Age of Ultron came out and I was disappointed to find out that it was inferior to the first film and that Ant-Man was nothing special.Now you would think with Captain America Civil War, Which features Spider-Man, Black Panther, and big battles, Anthony and Joe Russo would try to top The Avengers. Unfortunately, the truth is, you can't top The First Avengers Movie. No matter how hard you try, you're already in a been there done that situation. Now that doesn't mean to say that Civil War isn't a good film, it really is. The story is about The Avengers team dividing into factions so that they can stop tearing the world apart with destruction. Iron Man/Tony Stark is on the Government's side while Captain America/Steve Rogers is on the independent side of things. The two duke it out in big battles, including a twenty minute one shot entirely in IMAX. The first thing I need to get off my chest is Spider-Man. After the disastrous Sony Reboots that ruined Harry Osborn, Peter Parker, Aunt May and Peter's Parents, I was hoping there would be a light at the end of the tunnel for this Spider-Man to be not only good, but amazing. So when Tony Stark goes to Queens to meet Peter, I was hoping nothing would be ruined. Anthony and Joe have done an stellar job with this Spider-Man. Tom Holland is not the best Spider-Man in my eyes, but he is a hell of a lot better than Andrew Garfield. The only problem I had was that the Aunt May's in these movies keep getting younger and younger. I'm so used to the trilogy's Aunt May that it's hard for me to accept different forms of her. Spider-Man is funny, he is cool, he has a bunch of different moves, he is what I want in a superhero character. Considering he is my all time favorite superhero, they did decently with him. I love it when he is fighting Ant-Man and is referencing The Empire Strikes Back.Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) is the real show stopper here. He really steals the whole show and is exciting to watch. Boseman's acting as Panther is masterfully improvised with a south African accent and makes you really want to see him in his own movie (Which will happen eventually.)Now that I've got the things I want to talk about done. How was the rest of the movie? The acting was... good. The visuals were... good. The action was... good. The story was... good OK Look I can't really say much that has already been explained but the whole point is that the movie is just good. Nothing spectacular or anything to rave over, it was just a perfectly good movie that begins Phase 3 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Look, the stand out characters in the movie were Ant-Man, Black Panther and of course Spider-Man. They are fun to be around. Robert Downey Jr's Iron Man is actually likable for once and the villain is quite clever. The end was kind of a bit lacking. I mean, I guess Captain America won the fight but it's like Iron Man is perfectly fine a few days later? I know I wasn't expecting any death between these characters as Chris Evans And Downey Jr have Infinity War left on their list but at least make it more clear. The ending had me a bit confused as I stumbled out of the theater but then I got it soon after.Look, It's everyone's duty to see the next Captain America because it's basically part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and everyone has seen all the films basically. Go see it on a Monday like I did so that you won't have to deal with a crowd. It's a good Matinée that will keep you entertained from beginning to end.84/100 B</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best of the MCU</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As much as I enjoy comic book movies, I really haven't enjoyed the MCU much. Sure, movies like "Iron Man", "Ant Man", and "Captain America: The Winter Soldier" are enjoyable, but the MCU as a whole feels like style over substance. I've longed to see these movies do more besides be eye candy for a years now, and while "Winter Soldier" did take strides in this direction, "Civil War" has gotten closer to what I've wanted to see than any other movie in the MCU.Of course, I can't help but compare this movie to "Batman v. Superman", as the two are too similar not to. I desired to see conflict in that movie, but more of a clash of ideologies rather than a physical confrontation. That movie could've done that well, but it never really executed on it. So how about "Civil War?" Again, this doesn't do it perfectly either, but it certainly gets closer to what I wanted to see than "Batman v. Superman" did.The conflict works better in this movie mainly because we have been able to see all the characters grow and develop. This isn't our first time seeing Iron Man or Cap, we've seen them progress over time. Not only are those two present, they are each joined by teammates who also have their own reasons and motivations for being involved. Having all of these well known characters involved makes the conflict feel all the more important. I also loved the political undertones of each side's thinking. The movie doesn't take a side and tries to make both seem valid, which keeps the conflict from feeling pointless.The action did get a little hard to see at times, but it's excellent, as always. The movie does feel a little crowded at times, but everyone still feels valuable. The new characters aren't featured quite as much as you might hope (you'll have to wait for their solo movies for that), but the movie did a good job of introducing them. I'm not sure if Tom Holland's Spider-Man is better than the previous two just yet, but he's still pretty fun. And I'm sure that I'm in the minority on this, but I'm really glad that the MCU's two dullest heroes aren't here. Glad that Black Widow romance wasn't brought up again either (I really hope they forget about that).While for me, an 8 is a solid rating (essentially meaning that I'd watch it again), the movie does have some flaws that hold it back. As always, the villain is forgettable and could've been left out of the movie entirely (Lex in "BvS" was similarly pointless). As I said, the action was hard to see. Finally, I won't spoil the last act, but I didn't like it very much. All I'll say is that it makes a similar mistake that "BvS" made in introducing new motivation for conflict that was entirely unnecessary.There are still parts of the MCU that bother me (like the terrible villains, lack of secret identities, and the fact that heroes kill people often here, but fanboys never get outraged like they do at other movies). However, the movie does take many steps forward on making the MCU more than just a series of mindless popcorn flicks. It's a great continuation of both "Age of Ultron" and "The Winter Soldier", introduces great additions to the MCU, and does a better job of handling the "authority vs liberty" debate than "Batman v. Superman" did. I don't say this often, but I'm genuinely looking forward to seeing where Marvel takes this series next.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best marvel has produced but will divide the comicbook fans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When politics interferes in the Avengers activity it causes a divideThe third film in the Cpt America series and second stand alone Cpt America film set in the present. This one takes place during and kicks off phase 3 of MCU's cinematic story lines and is a direct commentary of everything that has come before it in the MCU universe (other than Deadpool which remains an brilliant anomaly in the MCU). Learning from the last eight years is the theme of this third film, in fact it could be boiled down to two things - characters and their consequences. No longer can superheroes level a city and get away with it, actions have consequences and it's about time they were looked at. Where previous films have needed a bad guy or event unlike any other to be the main catalyst this just need a bad guy to push a button and watch the good guys go at it. That means there are no alien invaders, no AI terror and no cities floating (Sokovia).A simple mission to bring down Brock Rumlow (Frank Grillo) in Lagos goes slightly wrong and civilians (including Wakandan dignitaries) are killed, the UN makes a decision that the supers need to be regulated. Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) resists while Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) agrees, thus the battle lines are drawn for a civil war. Throw in the resurfacing of Bucky Barnes/ Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan) and chaos reigns supreme. Camp Stark believe the Winter Soldier to be partly responsible for the chaos while Camp Rogers believe differently. I didn't enjoy this as much as I was hoping to, maybe that's because the Civil War arc is one of my favourites in the Marvel comic universe and I was drawing on happy memories which weren't lived out on screen. I totally get that the film can't be a direct copy of the comics but still it just didn't feel right somehow. It felt drawn out in parts, maybe a little too choppy, and other parts were to quick to sink in properly. You seem to get lots of narrative and build up, then you'd get some random action, before being thrown back at the drawn out narrative. It felt like there was a lot of new/ different things (maybe too much) thrown in to create a spectacular film but also to build up for future films. This despite the fact that character and story development has already occurred in the previous phases / releases of MCU. While some of the established character in this movie didn't hit the mark for me, some of the newer characters actually came away with a lot more credibility than I was expecting from them. Black Panther/ T'Challa worked well, the suit, the mannerism in which Chadwick Boseman delivered the performance was great, he seemed to fit well into the Wakandan King's crown and mantle. Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) was a welcomed and humorous addition to the casting - not having to drive the films narrative he was allowed to be funny. The new version of Spiderman (Tom Holland) was brilliant - my favourite film version of the web- slinger in fact, and that despite only having a minor appearance. He had a bigger part in this than I expected and it was played out very loyal to the comic book Spiderman which made me very happy. His constant talking and wise-cracking positively give me a smile on my nerdy little face. Even the Falcon (Anthony Mackie) walks away from this with a lot of credibility in this, not just in his political opinions in the film but also the action scenes he's part of.With massive differences this certainly didn't feel like the Civil War of the comic world, which is a massive pity, but I understand it never could be - there aren't half as many players, carnage or history, and there isn't enough time to tell all the individual stories that lead up and contribute to it. The registration act of the comics is replaced with the Sokovia accords in the film.Personally I think this shouldn't have been billed as Civil War but more so a precursor to it - a Civil dispute maybe. This way it could lay the foundations for a Civil War which would come during phase 4 or 5 maybe with more players and history having gone before it. In it's own right this is still a great film, there is an awful lot of action in it which is beautifully choreographed, the airport fight scene at nearly 20mins is a masterpiece which exemplifies my statement. The acting is all fantastic, much like you'd expect with the other films before this all delivering well on acting skills too. The only person that looked out of place to me is Martin Freeman playing Everett Ross but maybe that's because I used to seeing him with a British accent and slightly downbeat glum performances. Villain's seem to be Marvel's downfall, Brock Rumlow is and Baron Zemo (Daniel Bruhl) both seem to be driven by revenge but other then that are fairly forgettable and 2 dimensional. The pairs future in the MCU will be interesting, especially if like me you are a comic fan and know what else they get up. The MCU really needs a bad-ass bad guy and can't just keep waiting for Thanos or relying on Loki's chaos, hopefully we'll see something positive in this area soon. So, the acting is top notch, the action is plentiful, the dialogue may be drawn out at times but doesn't interfere, all in all this is probably one of the best films in the MCU and my negativity in this review mainly stems from my comparing the film to the wonderful comic arc which I remember fondly. If I take that away from it this film is still a solid 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

I'm not saying this is a bad film just not what was advertised. The acting in the film was OK but it was probably iron mans worst film and captain Americas best film for acting. Everybody else gave there usual performances the villain is captain America and he is the main reason why they all fall apart. And the direction of this film was slow and then too fast and then to slow and again to fast. They should have left it to Joss Whedon he did the other movies in style!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally there was a battle between Cap And Tony</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd like to start the review by saying.....that with my hands down &#x1f450; this is so far, the most thoughtful movie made by the MCU.....it has established a kind of supremacy over all of the other marvel movies out there..especially the first one(Ironman 1 i.e.).......Marvel has tried it's best keeping up with the comic book adaptations and has done a pretty good job...the only problem in this "adaptation-buisness" was the fact that they had to introduce a new spider-man and had to portray him as not much of an interfering guy....his role was huge in the comics but in the film it was more like an amateur entering an arena with new heights of seriousness....another thing I would wanna point out is that the fighting sequences were too clearly sorted out with everyone in the team fighting against the others team's equally powered opponent...come on now...that is an incredible coincidence which does not really happen pretty often....there were not much cross-overs like Cap fighting the Vision, of course that's not possible though...so I think Vision should've been kept out of the scene......Now....the pro's!!One of the best undeniably inspiring moments was when Ironman beats the crap outta Cap.....but he still goes on say "I could do this all day"... And also the comic book adaptation of the scene when one of the woman (who lost her son while a bunch of superheros were battling against a bad guy in a school which led to a huge blast) spits on Tony's face for making false claims about making the world a better place...That was beautifully interpreted into the film where that woman looses her son in Sokovia during the battle of the Avengers with Ultron.....But however the best scene for me would be the post-dramatic scene where Ironman flashes his energy beams and Cap on the other hand obstructs it with his vibrant shield and with all his might and will.....wow that's the moment when it clicks...that's the moment when you know that you're no more watching a fight between ding-dong sissies..man this is real fight between two men, one working with a sense of morals and the other being calculative and keeping up with the score.....In the end...Captain America Civil War is not a war between to different teams....but a breathtaking battle between two people destined to urge to fight against each other.....it's a grand ShowDown...Future predictions...Can't tell</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun Avengers movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Totally enjoyed the movie. I've been a Captain America fan since the first movie. No one disappoints but Spider- Man. Since when did they hire a 12 year old to play the part?? Otherwise loved black panther and his accent. Scarlet Witch's abilities. Ant man's humor and his talents. Buckee and the brotherly relationship with Captain. Iron Man's quips. Ultrons sense of ethics. Black Widows martial art moves. Captain America's justifications. Nightwing's (?) toys. Hawkeye's cool factor. So it may seem like I'm being harsh on this Spider-Man actor. But it's hard to watch a Spider-Man who looks weak after watching the last two actors that portrayed him. Plus Marisa Tomei is spidey's great aunt?? In what universe?!?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The next big film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The next big film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe arrives in a slam-dunk fashion, with a great story line and unexpected twists and turns. The cast, once again, as usual, is a standout. Chris Evans still proves that he is Captain America, distilling in him doubt and a questioning manner, while also showing him as a conflicted and true leader. Evans commands the film and ever scenes that he is in, proving that the Marvel Cinematic Universe isn't complete without the character. Robert Downey Jr. once again proves that he is Tony Stark and that no other actor can depict the character. Downey takes a backseat to Evans in good fashion and doesn't try to take the film away from him. This is more Captain America, than Iron Man, with Stark only arriving into the film when necessary and never hogging the film away from Evans. Downey and Evans work well together, while successfully showing the different sides of both characters: Captain America as the leader and Tony Stark as the billionaire, who after the events of Age of Ultron, is guilt ridden. His decision to favor oversight comes from a civilian in Sokovia being killed during the battle, which has a huge impact over the film. Sebastian Stan makes a welcome return to Bucky Barnes, the brainwashed friend of Captain America, code-named the Winter Soldier. Once again this character proves that the Captain America trilogy is about one thing: brotherly love. Stan's depiction brings a sense of doubt and confusion, since he still trying to piece his entire life together, while it also partly ties certain events together. Scarlett Johansson is marvelous as always as Black Widow, delivering great lines and working well opposite both Evans and Downey. Anthony Mackie is once again amazing as Falcon, Captain America's new ally. Don Cheadle still works well with Downey and in the role of James Rhodes, having replaced Terence Howard in Iron Man 2. Jeremy Renner makes a great, small appearance as Hawkeye, as does Paul Rudd as Ant-Man, lending a sense of comedy to the film and giant surprises. Paul Bettany depicts Vision as an android attempting to come to grips with the world, while Elizabeth Olsen gets to further explore the character of Scarlet Witch, sharing some really great scenes with Bettany. William Hurt makes a welcome return to the MCU as Thunderbolt Ross, now Secretary of State. This approach seems to be done as a way to still make clear that The Incredible Hulk (the black sheep of the MCU) is still part of the universe. Hurt shows Ross as a complicated politician. Frank Grillo makes a great, small appearance as Rumlow at the beginning, while Emily VanCamp makes a welcome return as Sharon Carter and Martin Freeman is introduced to the MCU in a small role as Everett Ross, who will undoubtedly return for future installments. The real standouts in the film are Tom Holland as Spider-Man and Chadwick Boseman as Black Panther. Holland steals the scenes that he is in as Spider-Man, working exceptionally well opposite Evans and Downey, as well as Marisa Tomei, who depicts Aunt May. Holland is comedic, depicting the character as a nervous, geeky, unsure character. Holland seems to be the definitive version of the character, delivering a far better performance of the character than Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield, the two of whom are also fine actors. While some may say that Spider-Man is only featured in the film to introduce him into the MCU and also to setup the planned standalone film, I believe that Spider-Man worked out well in the film and lend a real sense of stamina to the film, especially the big fight. Boseman is amazing as Black Panther, delivering the character with menace and true purpose. Boseman is calm as the character, while the introduction is wild and spectacular. Daniel Bruhl makes a great appearance as the villain Zemo, who has a huge connection to the events of the film. While the character is different in the comic books, I can defend the change that had to be done, since it supports the film's plot and layout. Bruhl's approach to the character, as a calm and calculating villain, as well as the villain itself is spectacular, while he has got to be the best villain that the universe has had to see so far. The idea of having a normal, regular human face off against the Avengers is smart and total genius on the part of the filmmakers. The end result is films that will leave the viewer wondering how the universe will continue. Since Captain America: The Winter Soldier acted as a turning point in the MCU leading up to Age of Ultron, this film does the same, showing a change in Stark, while also showing Rogers as a new leader. The film ends in such a way with us wondering the directions that the characters will go in and also if Stark will ever be needed anymore, while also showing the lengths that he can go to. The film includes a number of good references to other films in the MCU, while it also acts as a terrific conclusion to the Captain America trilogy, proving that this is the best trilogy within the MCU. In the case of good third chapters in trilogies (Toy Story 3, The Dark Knight Rises, Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King) this film acts a fantastic third chapter to its own trilogy. The film also does the smart move of not revolving around a huge battle, showing the slow build up to the battle and the lengths that characters can go to, in a way showing a war of opinions in political style discussion. The result is a film that is terrific and well-handled, acting as a great comic book film, but also so far as this year's best comic book film. Fantastic!Source: http://captainamericacivilwarfilm.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent chapter in the never-ending Marvel Universe's patriotic hero</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>CAPTAIN America: CIVIL WAR (2016) ***1/2 Chris Evans, Robert Downey, Jr. , Scarlett Johansson, Sebastian Stan, Anthony Mackie, Don Cheadle, Jeremy Renner, Chadwick Boseman, Paul Bettany, Elizabeth Olsen, Paul Rudd, Emily VanCamp, Tom Holland, Daniel Bruhl, William Hurt, Martin Freeman, Marisa Tomei, Frank Grillo, John Slattery, Hope Davis, Alfre Woodard, John Kani. Excellent chapter in the never-ending Marvel Universe's patriotic hero (Evans evoking some true blue emotions) facing a crossroads moment - pledging allegiance to global watchdog supervision or rely on gut-instinct of standing up for the little guy overall, resulting in a fall-out with fellow bud and Avenger Tony Stark AKA Iron Man (Downey) who wants to do the right thing in spite of his friendships with fellow team members getting in the way. End result is a free for all battle of the wills and some genuine thrilling moments thanks largely to the directing team of siblings Anthony and Joe Russo with a dense screenplay by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely relying on more kinetic fast-and-furious action sequences and less on light-hearted humorous ones (which is the Achilles heel here folks) in spite of some warm welcome comic relief in Rudd's Ant Man and newcomer Holland as Spider-Man (don't worry he's getting a reboot too) By all means see it in IMAX 3-D to get the full effect of the amazing visuals and aforementioned battle royales! Because where else can you see Ant Man taking on giantess Black Widow? :D</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Civil War: Cap's Galore.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is incredible. For those of you who were left disappointed or underwhelmed by Age of Ultron, or if you liked the movie all the same, Captain America: Civil War opens up the flood gates and doesn't hold back with exploring The Avengers in greater detail than before. Civil War succeeds in direction and writing where Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice ultimately failed to live up to.Marvel keeps outdoing themselves with churning out these movies on a regular basis, but this film might stand out as being cream-of-the- crop against all the other Marvel Cinematic Universe installments made thus far. The movie is not completely perfect for me: there were some pacing issues pertaining to Black Panther's introduction, but aside from that little problem Civil War destroys all the stops and goes forward into ridiculously ambitious territory that these types of movies should achieve.Captain America: Civil War actually stands out as its own thing as well. Sure it's another chapter in the Marvel Universe essentially, but you get that these characters have emotions, values and ideologies that aren't entirely dependent on sequel-knowledge. I'm happy that a Marvel movie has made me feel the same way The Dark Knight left me; Civil War can be seen as a single episode of a bigger picture, or you can just dive right in here if you really want to.Civil War, Cap's Galore, Will Not Bore, Want Some More, Roger's Lore, Marvel's All. 5/5 stars.P.S. Spider-Man is in the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No regrets, go see this film now!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was expecting it to be good, but not as perfectly executed as it was. I was trying to be super critical in going into it for the sake of loving the original comic its based off, and any fault i found or obvious divergence from the source material was so easily shaken off that none of it held any ground in discrediting the rest of the film. For a comic book film, it felt ripped straight from the pages, it actually had a very comic brought to life feel to it, id say iron man and then ant man come second in this feeling it gives off. Not just blockbuster action for the sake of action, and the dialogue all fit perfectly without being overdone and cheesy. The bits of humour thrown in didn't cause face palms of discontent. It all just fit together so well I'm in awe. Perhaps the only part that constantly gave me enough pause was zeemo throughout the film, but his intentions and method - i felt came together very well in the end. Not perfectly, but enough that id call him the best villain marvel has executed in believability in a film so far, and to say that - and it being a totally normal guy without any special abilities, really says something about how well this was written. People often celebrate the directing allot more than writing, but the writing i found was what made this film so superior to all previous marvel films. a big applause for pulling a really remarkable film</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>High on breathtaking action and bro-feels!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Captain America: Civil War subtly disembarks crucial Marvel characters into the MCU grounds without overlooking the originals. There is a morsel for everybody, as they get a shot at each other with some rad action to ice the intriguing melodramatic plot. Nobody gets left out with their screen time, which was a Herculean thing to achieve. Marvel simply aced it.Bro-feels are hopping around throughout the movie as you see Cap and Iron Man digress from their paths to go against each other, in a gradually developing storyline. You can't help but feel sorry for both of them as they try to rip each other apart. Like other characters in the movie you end up taking sides yourselves. Iron Man is understandable but Captain America can't be written off either. Both are on such pedestals of morality that Civil War between them becomes inevitable.Action is sheer bonkers! So many cool stunning bits that you have to see the movie again to keep your cross-hairs locked. The biggest action driver is no doubt the Winter Soldier again, as Bucky Barnes ravages through every one who tries to either stop or catch him. Watch out for that highway action scene! He single handedly decimates every superhero who comes in his way. Black Panther gets introduced brilliantly to the tale. So does Spidey! Looking forward to watching their solo movies now.Civil War is high on humour just like any Marvel movie is, with Robert Downey Jr., Tom Holland, Anthony Mackie and Paul Rudd doing us the honors of throwing us off into non-stop guffaws. Brilliantly penned screenplay as usual with great music to cover things up. Editing is exceptional as well.Its drama lets you dig deeper into the heads of the superheroes, and make them fairly relatable. You can't help but relate your plight to these characters who get hammered under egotism, friendship, choices and conscience. Despite everything the movie packs in, you have to establish hands down that Iron Man stays the coolest, and Captain America undoubtedly the finest! The weird thing about Civil War is that you divide the movie into sub-sections and you still get awesome mini-movies that hit extraordinary feat per se. Wrap those little plots and there's the big one that reveals like an eye-opener eventually in the climax.One downside could be that there is no true villain in the movie. Rather a pointer that directs them into mangling each other to gnaw at the team from inside.Not going into the spoilers much I would recommend you go get on the awesome bandwagon at once, and enjoy the thrilling action-packed bromancing ride. Watch it over and over if you wish to relive its classy mind-numbing action.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What's so civil about war anyway ?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Marvel's path to comic-book film dominance was made a great deal easier after DC's Batman V Superman virtually took a giant dump in the pockets of those that paid for their tickets last March. Nonetheless, after 2015's bland Avengers sequel I was a little apprehensive about the quality that would be presented in Civil War, these concerns were soon forgotten about. With the Russo Brothers at the helm, as expected, Civil War is essentially a hybrid of previous films; The Avengers and Winter Soldier. The action scenes are grounded in a contextual reality that is reminiscent of Winter Soldier but incorporates the ensemble cast with a fluidity similar to the Avengers Assemble. The finished product is an extremely well balanced action film that keeps your attention from beginning to end and considering this is Marvel's longest film to date, it achieves this with a certain sense of passivity. The film is proficient at preserving the relationships that it has established throughout it's predecessors while harmlessly introducing MCU newbies Black Panther and Spiderman. The casting of these two characters is impeccable and I eagerly await the solo films that will ensue. Any criticisms that arise throughout the film are of the nitpicking variety and mostly consist of some convenient plot points and the occasional flat scene. Civil War justly deserves a seat in the higher echelons of the already over-saturated genre and the Russo Brothers have set the standard for all future Marvel films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Civil War? More like Winter Soldier 2: Civil Spar.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the film in both 2d and then a second time in 3d.In 2d format the action sequences were unbearable to watch. It was like shaky can to the max. I almost walked out within the first ten minutes over this. Please use a tripod. In 3d it was much more bearable and I hate 3d. I also don't understand why it was even offered in 3d. It didn't seem to do anything but stabilize the action.The score was either absent or extremely corny especially during the Captain America moments.Robert Downey Jr. is pretty much the savior for this film. His acting is top notch and magnetizing. But his character flaws are just unforgivable. I'm sure Stark knows what brainwashing is, how it works and also the emotional toll it's done to his pal Cap to know his best friend has been MK Ultra'd especially after the whole Winter Soldier fiasco. So to me Iron Man needs to retire literally for this incredible stupidity and disrespect. He is solely responsible for Rhodes injuries. Marvel also rushed in Black Panther, dialed down Scarlet Witch's powers to 0 at which point as a fan it's pretty insulting. House of M... Anyone? I also noticed during a particular movie came out recently people freaked out over the word 'Martha', and somehow when Cap hears the word 'Bucky', no one cares. Meanwhile people actually die to this mistake. Hilarious.Back to location, the hangar the big battle sequence takes place is very dull. All that money they made and it was filmed in the most boring scenery ever. Question. Did they even read Civil War? They had only a couple moments right. But really, I don't understand how a true Marvel fan could be happy with the result. This film was more about taglines, dumb jokes and not taking something like brainwashing seriously. I mean they could at least look into a cure. Regardless of my picky nerd rantings it was entertaining. Especially the end battle. I give it a seven.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So I watched the movie today with a lot of expectations and really had a great time watching it.It was again the Russo brothers who brought a uniqueness to this story like the other parts as well and did a great job. Acting wise the performance of each and everyone is top class.It was great to watch team cap and team iron man battle up against each other but the only thing I felt from the first half that what would be the conclusion.So the movie went on with a smooth pace until we got to see the epic fight.Finally at the end I thought the Russo brothers might have missed a bit of essence in it which would have really made it an innovative movie. I just felt from the beginning the movie was very logical and realistic but the conclusion part somehow lost its logical focus.On the whole this was a nice end to the trilogy and will be eagerly waiting for infinity war.So for all the comic book fans this will be a refreshing comic book adaptation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Marvel movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Russo brother obviously did an amazing job with The Winter Soldier so the bar has been set high and absolutely broke it. Cap Civil War is now my favourite Marvel movie.Beginning was a little bit slow, but not the first scene of the movie right after Marvel logo is show cause the action starts right away, after that.One of my favourite aspects of this movie is that there are a lot of characters and every one of them has a stand out moment.My favourite character in this movie is Iron Man. He has come a long way since Iron Man (2008). Uniet I stand with Iron Man. Spiderman is perfect. Minority of people think Tom Holland is terrible Spiderman cause he's too young and they are forgetting Peter Parker is a teenager. CW really excites me for Spiderman's solo movie. Oh and aunt May is hot. Black Panther is such a badass in this movie. Chadwick Bosemans performance is great and he in tunnel chase, one of my favourite scenes of the movie, steels the show from Cap, Bucky and Falcon. And yes this movie as well excites me for his solo movie. I also had a problem with the villain, Baron Zemo. I tought he was just there because they need a villain for the movie. He has one or two really important scenes, but they could've done it without him.The action is perfect. The airport scene is truly best action scene of this movie, not just this movie but any Comic Book movie in history. Mostly everyone is talking about it, as they should, but there are a few action scenes are getting overshadowed. Like previously mentioned tunnel chase and beginning and Iron Man vs Cap and Bucky. Iron Man vs Cap and Bucky is also the most emotional scene of the movie, and Zemo's there.I could talk about Civil War all day. It has a lot of memorable moments and quotes, great introducing to Spiderman and Black Panther. Marvel is stronger than ever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a fan of the Marvel movies, looking forward to the climax. This is a good movie, I highly recommend you watch it, but it felt like a filler. All the other movies had a great united sense about them(the movie), the characters and story was coherent if cut a bit short for theaters. This movie was jumping all over from one character to another as the story needed. Felt like poor planing the whole time, like they just had to get it out fast so they can move on. If your a fan of the Avengers you have to see this movie, like all Marvel movies it is part of a massive story that is not yet done. I just wanted more, more of this, more of that, why are we leaving, no go back, oh come on are all things I was saying to myself. Also the ability to predict what will happen was high in this one, even if you're not up to date with other media of the franchise. Whenever you can predict what will happen, you know that's a bad sign. If this was a 6+ hour movie it would be a epic tale, as is, it's just good. I watched this with high hopes, like all Marvel movies, I was disappointed but not enough to stop me from watching it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Avengers Disassemble</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now at the start of "Phase 3" Marvel has decided to open it up with one of its biggest films yet, putting together almost its entire roster of heroes in to one movie and taking on one of the biggest game changing conflicts within the entire history of Marvel. Whilst the film is at times clustered, the Russo brothers successfully create a blockbuster driven by a very personal conflict whilst still delivering some of the greatest action sequences of the franchise so far. After a mission goes wrong and several civilians end up being killed, a proposal is put forward to place the Avengers and all its heroes under government control which divides the Avengers in to two factions. On the one side is Captain America (Chris Evans), who after the events of "Captain America: The Winter Soldier" is distrusting of government interference and believes the Avengers are most effective working independently. On the other side Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), who after feeling responsible for destruction caused by Ultron believes that even the Avengers need to be kept in check. But during all this a villain named Zemo (Daneil Brühl, playing another Marvel villain who could have been very interesting but unfortunately goes completely underdeveloped throughout the film) hatches a plan involving Cap's former friend Bucky (AKA Winter Soldier) to further this divide between the Avengers. This causes all the Marvel heroes to choose their respective sides, with each having their own personal motives and reasons for who they side with, all colliding against one another in an all-out brawl. To the films credit, the inclusion of all these superheroes never detracts from the core conflict between Captain America and Iron Man, with their emotional conflict always remaining the centrepiece of the film. But at the same time, every cast member gets their own moment in the spotlight. Whether you want to see scenes exploring the relationships between characters like Captain America and Black Widow further explored or just fun moments like seeing Ant-man being shot off one of Hawkeye's arrows, this film will have something for any fan of the Marvel Universe to enjoy. Although out of the films massive cast the biggest standout of the film is Tom Holland as Spiderman. Whilst he only has around 10-15 minutes screen time, Tom Holland has the potential to be the best Spiderman yet. He's able to pull off both the awkward but charming Peter Parker and the fun quick witted web swinger better than either Maguire or Garfield were ever able to. Plus Holland works incredibly well off all the other heroes, particularly with Robert Downey Jr. as he and Holland appear to share a very natural chemistry with one another. The only drawback of Spiderman in the film is that at times the CGI appears very unnatural, looking a lot more like a video game character than he does an actual person. Nonetheless it was a great re-introduction to the character, without relying on the already familiar origin story, to be another great addition to the MCU. However just like too many superhero movies lately, by having so many different characters to juggle the movie does feel clustered at times, with some plot lines not getting the attention that they deserved and being incredibly underdeveloped. Probably the worse effect of this is the Black Panther's origin story. It's an interesting story about honour and revenge which on its own would have been enough to fill an entire film, but doesn't get the time it needs here and thus his origin story ends up feeling wasted. It's a shame too since it's the first time the characters been introduced in any film and it could have been a great backstory if the film had the opportunity to properly develop it. Plus Chadwick Bosman gives a great performance in the short time that he's actually given a chance to. Hopefully his standalone film should give a better opportunity to give the character the attention he deserves. Whilst there are a few problems with some of the films action sequences, with some scenes suffering from the overuse of fast paced editing techniques, for the most part the fight scenes have the same exciting tone and focus on practical effects that the Russo brothers demonstrated in Captain America: Winter Soldier. However the one scene in the film is the airport sequence, which sees both sides of the conflict and all the heroes collide together in an all-out brawl. I won't say anything specific about what happens in the fight, since it does have a lot of great surprises that shouldn't be spoiled, but it does just about everything that you'd want to see from these characters fighting and is probably one of the crowning achievements of the MCU so far. The only downside is that this scene is so incredible that afterwards the rest of the film ends up feeling fairly underwhelming in comparison.Also the film does shy away from some of the darker aspects of the original Civil War storyline from the comics and the movie doesn't do anything that we haven't seen from other Marvel movies before. Whilst the conflict between Captain America and Iron Man is interesting, the snappy back and forth between both sides whilst fun and enjoyable leads the clear impression that neither side will be willing to take the fight too far, thus reducing the stakes of the film. Saying this, Captain America: Civil War does just about everything that audiences expect from and want from the MCU. It's funny, it's exciting and it continues to explore the characters that have remained at the core of the Marvel Universe since its inception. On top of this the Russo brothers have once again proved themselves ready for the task of taking on the next Avengers movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really excited about this film and i've been waiting fir several years ti watch this. While some may claim showing the scenes in reverse is just an annoying trick to make a simple plot confusing and add a plethora of twists, I wholeheartedly disagree. Any good story teller knows it's not what you say, but how you say it.By playing the scenes in reverse you experience the confusion Lenny undergoes throughout the film. Showing some of the scenes in chronological order (BTW, the use of B&amp;W instead of color to make the time distinction was ingenious) creates suspense which builds as the two time lines converge. The somewhat rushed pace (compared to a written format) doesn't give you enough time to adequately analyze the events during the movie. This has two advantages: firstly you're going to talk about it after you leave the theater adding to experience immensely, and secondly you don't have time to think about what has happened (will happen) so you're experience better follows that of Lenny.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Superhero flick but... a bit overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So, Civil War was one of the most anticipated films of this year, but did it actually filled the expectations... yes! To be honest I was kind of nervous with how this movie was going to be because I am a great comic book fan, and to look at one of the best comic book story lines in a while being so different of what they where showing got me worried, but, thank god, it was a great massive spectacle, but I wanted and waited for something epic, and it was a bit to be that but for me the decisive point was the ending. Let's talk about the things I liked (That are a lot ha ha):1. The New Avengers: It was great to hear that Spiderman, Ant-man and Black Panther were going to be in this film and they didn't let down. Spidey was great with awesome comedy and a solid performance by Tom Holland, Ant-man once again was great although we already knew that, and of course Black Panther, I have to admit that for the first 2/3 of the movie I didn't liked him but at the end I think he was the best character because he was the one that proved everyone was wrong even him so... yeah he was awesome.2. The first 2/3 and a part of the other third of the story: at the beginning it really felt like Civil War because all centered in the Wakanda Files (I don't remember the real name) so that part really felt like a good Civil War adaptation.Now let's talk about what I didn't liked that are small things: 1.Hawkeye's apparition: Just that you don't really see haw they recruit him, that's all. 2.Special Effects: At time I felt it a little flat, and I really don't like a CGI Spiderman. 3. The majority of the last third: When we were getting a great Civil War you think is going to end with an amazing touch, but it ends being the Bucky thing we were kind of making through and a whinny Tony, with a touch of an asshole Steve and a, not bad but not great, Baron Zemo.Now the message I got from the movie and please is my own opinion you make your own: The message I got from the film was that you have to fight and stand for and by your own opinion and what you think is right, a little pause, I really like that part of the message but my problem is with this part, you have to fight and stand for and by your own opinion and what you think is right NO MATTER THE CONSEQUENCES EVEN IF THEY ARE BAD OR GOOD, now that part a lot of people may think is not really bad, and I understand them, but here is my point, is Captain America the guy you are talking about! He looks for what is best for people in general not only his best friend an I felt that what he did was a 360 degrees turn of the character because he doesn't mind hitting one of his friends just for another one and that's what I find so interesting, Why change a character that tries to fight for the common good and make him self interested? One word: Complexity of the character that I find intriguing, I don't dislike it or like it just felt a little odd and out of nowhere.So, as you can see you don't need to compare a movie with other to give your own point, just enjoy all the movies, because let's not forget that movies where made for entertainment not for being perfect. Like all the movies you can because without movies how could we see the world from a different point of view. One last thing, don't hate DC or Marvel movies because if we do that there is going to be a point where we won't have comic book movies and we're going to regret it. See the movie with and open mind, enjoy it, I swear you will have a blast! PEACE.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than the first two....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw The First Avenger and was expecting a lot more after seeing IM/IM2/Thor but those movies were just so much better than CA. Same thing happened with The Winter Soldier after seeing The Avengers/IM3/Thor: The Dark World/GOTG. After seeing Age of Ultron and Ant-Man I wasn't really looking forward to seeing Civil War because A2/AM were boring in my opinion, same with TFA/TWS but I saw Civil War tonight because it has been getting extremely great reviews and I have to say I was really, really impressed. Great story, amazing effects and most of all incredible action sequences. This is by far the best Marvel movie yet (besides Deadpool) and would highly recommend it to anyone to see once if not twice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One step from ridiculous to sublime...and this movie took that step....what a 'Marvel' to watch this movie....!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Super hero/ comic adaption movies are a big gamble - either it will turn out to be a Great Movie which will make its mark in the history (like 'The Avengers') or a serious disappointment ('Transformers', Spiderman 2,3, 'Fantastic Four' to name a few).To be completely Honest, after the recent movie 'Deadpool' of the same genre, which had an exciting and perfect comic timing and considering the past Captain America movies (sequels have a bad reputation and the last 'Vs' tag movie - Batman Vs Superman didn't raise any expectations), i didn't had much hope for this one but was glad it proved to be wrong.As expected, the movie was an Action packed one with great stunt scenes and visual 3 D effect but what was captivating about all this was it had a story to back all that action and a realistic touch to it.To elaborate further, each character had a time-line, a deep (and turbulent past) but which stuck seamlessly with the time-line of the other character (and there were so many such characters in this movie).Another interesting thing is that it adds flavor by involving the viewers/ fans into this movie and let them decide which side to be on - 'Captain America' or 'Iron Man' with each team having its own moral stand.Looking forward to more of such movies from Marvel studios...!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is definition of comic-book movie...It doesn't matter which side you are on you will question your side at the end of the movie,Speaking briefly of the movie, it is an emotional roller coaster with an absolutely beautiful end. Spidey had a satisfying screen time. As for the acting, by the time the movie ended, I was a happy man. Russos are handling Infinity War, and after watching this movie, how they did justice to characters, I'll not worry. A movie we wanted as well as deserve. The cast is perfect and everyone is used exceptionally well. This IS the best sequel the genre has ever seen and I know tat's saying a lot. It could be Marvel's best effort ever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite all of their heroic deeds, the Avengers have left an extensive trail of collateral damage causing politicians to view them as vigilantes who've operated outside the boundaries. When the 'Accords' are passed to regulate superhuman activity, tensions mount and definitive lines are drawn between moralistic Steve Rogers?who sees regulation as an infringement upon their right to choose, and repentant Tony Stark?who believes they should be put in check for any catastrophes they've caused. With new and very personal threats emerging, Earth's mightiest heroes suddenly find themselves engaged in conflict with their former comrades-in-arms. Not so much a Captain America solo adventure as it is an Avengers free-for-all, this is a unique and exciting blend of comic book adaptation and political thriller, with compelling themes of friendship, loyalty, and betrayal, not to mention the sheer joy of seeing so many superheroes engaged in a smackdown of epic proportions. There are too many characters to do all of them justice, but with great lines, spectacular action scenes/effects, and laugh-out loud humor, this is still a comic book geek's dream that only heightens anticipation for the future of the MCU. ***</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best from Marvel since Guardians</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The third addition to the 'Captain America' films is here. This time our favorite hero's are pitted against each other after disagreeing when the government tries to limit their free rein. Needless to say, tensions get high and a fight between them breaks out. Or that's at least what we were pitched through the trailers. This is not what happens in the film. Surprisingly enough, It is very similar to 'Dawn of Justice'. This film offers far better editing and the stakes feel higher but that seems to be the only major differences. That was actually pretty disappointing to see. You all know my stance on 'Dawn of Justice' so I won't go into it.But seeing these two very similar movies come out pretty close together made this one kinda boring. The entire time I couldn't help thinking I had seen a version of this already. That being said, this film is not much better than 'Dawn of Justice'. My biggest gripes are unfortunately directed right at the films biggest selling point.The fact that these hero's are fighting each other. I liked the idea that there was repercussions to the mindless violence of the previous films. It made for an interesting bit of conflict early on in the movie. But it was handled very poorly. Surprisingly enough this was in direct correlation with the characters motives. Which were incredibly stupid. Caps motives are simple, I'm not taking sides with the government because they are to restrictive. Iron Mans are not so simple. At first his arguments make sense. Regardless of the people we saved there are still thousands lost. And we have to be accountable for that.But what spurred this disagreement? The film opens with a fight taking place between Cap with some others and a couple of bad guys. One guy tries blowing himself up to kill Cap but Witch lady contains the blast and throws him into the air. Right into the only building around them. It kills some people and other people get upset.So you mean to tell me that this entire film could've been avoided if she, I don't know, threw him into the open space directly above her? Or just smashed him down into the ground? Right away the entire film feels delegitimized. They seriously could not have come up with a better excuse than, Oh a lot of people died because that witch lady can't aim worth crap?Or the fact that the only reason Iron Man wants to side with the government is because some random lady got mad at him. Like, he walked out of a presentation and a random lady was just standing there starring at the wall. Was her whole plan to just stand there and wait for him so she could shove her son all over him? What if he went off a different way? What if he didn't care at all? Would this entire film not have happen if he just didn't care?With in thirty minutes the only two characters that matter are given the stupidest motives ever. What about Black Panthers motives? Why didn't the blast that killed his father also kill him? He looked actually closer to it than his dad. Oh I get it, someone had to be mad at the Winter Soldier for this film to work in the slightest. All of this is at the very beginning of the film. By the end there was a mind boggling amount of plot holes and pretend risks being taking. &#x200b; So much so that I could spend hours talking about them, but I won't. Why? Because this film isn't that bad. All the performances were pretty great. As were the fight sequences. Especially the climatic fight scene. I won't go into why it made no sense but, logic aside, it was the only part of the film that was actually involving.The film does a lot right. The action is gritty, the music is great, and the acting is pretty great across the board. But it's difficult to ignore the holes all over the script. It's plagued with lapses in logic, character motives, and it lacks the great story and villain it tries desperately hard to have. In the end this is worth seeing if only to watch your favorite characters throw down. Even if you'll have to wade through a lot of poor writing to get there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Comic Book Movie to date. ***Spoiler Review***</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Captain America Civil War is without any words the best comic book movie to date. The Directors, Anthony and Joe Russo did a great job bringing these characters in life. Every one of the heroes (&amp; the Villain) has their time to shine and non of the stories feel out of place. Black Panther is the most serious and the most wise in the movie. Scarlet witch and the vision are the most interesting because they are the students of the film. Both are trying to understand what they were and what they have become. (They fear their powers) Ant-Man and Spiderman are the spotlight of the film by bringing fun and jokes. And by speaking of spider man...Finally after 14 year since we got the first spider-man movie in 2002, now we get spider-man done right. Tom Holland nailed the role of peter parker like none before and brought life to the character of spider-man. Robert Downey Jr. gave his best performance of tony stark since the first iron man movie and brought a lot more emotions in some of his scenes. Captain America showed he has come from a long way and has evolved as a character. And now he's in a part of his life that makes him finally feel old and tired. You can understand his motivations and his goals. Baron Zemo is by far my favorite MCU villain. He plays the long game, he's smart and has patience. You understand where he's coming from and why he is doing what he is doing. And at the end he succeeds he goal (not 100%) he destroyed the avengers. This is the first time we see the bad guy win in long time.Summary: The Russo Brothers did an excellent job directing the movie with so many characters in it and at the same time setting up new upcoming movies. The film is full of action and emotions and a story so thrilling that will make you want more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A rare third chapter that's solid.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kevin Feige, the Russos' and the MCU crew really get Cap. The Captain America trilogy is the best trilogy the MCU has provided so far. I don't think the last two Iron Man films are any good, and Thor is quite mediocre. I'd go so far as to say it's the best superhero trilogy out there as of now(Yes I did not like The Dark Knight Rises, calm down people, just my opinion). There was no bias or favoritism involved despite it being a Captain America film. The entire time everyone's reasoning to joining a certain side is completely justified and as an audience member you absolutely see their points, making it very difficult to see who is wrong and who is right. Tony Stark has a point. This is what the world wants, some form of accountability. Superheroes should not get a free pass. Are you gonna let a superhero get a free pass if someone close to you died during some random battle? It's tough to deal with, and it's so easy to root for Cap, but realistically, if this were the real world, you would want accountability, lets not kid ourselves. Would it actually work, maybe, maybe not, but the idea of it puts everyone into a more safer and secure mindset. He knows for a fact he needs to be put in check after the events of Ultron. However, in Cap's point of view, given what happened in Cap 2, how HYDRA took over and the how untrusting the government can be, I think we can all agree the safest is in his own hands. The government may say that they care about the safety of the people, and even if that were true, they're also as interested in fighting in wars and guaranteeing their interests. If superheroes were to fall into their full control, the government would just use them for that purpose. All these ideologies and view points are present and the film does a beautiful job presenting that, it's not just superheroes fighting for the sake of fighting. Give credit to writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely. The Russos' also deliver fantastic action sequences throughout. I'm not given to hyperbole, but the second act may be the best action sequence in a comic-book film ever. You'll have to see it for yourself to understand what I mean. This film is also wonderfully acted, it's the best acted MCU film to date. Scarlett Johnasson, Anthony Mackie, Paul Bettany, Jeremy Renner, Emily VanCamp, Don Cheadle, and William Hurt deliver the goods. Standouts to me were Sebastian Stan. He brings more to Bucky than ever. The bromance element between Bucky and Steve never felt overdone, but enough to give you the feels and make you care. He is quite a tragic character and it's very fleshed out. Chadwick Boesman delivers an effective T'challa/Black Panther. You understand his place within all this chaos. Elizabeth Olsen has a much more impactful role as Wanda Maximoff this time. I'd like to mention the bug heroes absolutely steal the show in that airport sequence. Paul Rudd's Scott Lang is basically the audience as he displays his inner fanboy. He has a big moment in the film that will surely be memorable. In a short amount of time, Tom Holland, the Russos', Kevin Feige, and the creative team at Marvel do what Sony failed to do in the past ten years or so. I'm now more excited than ever to see the next Spider-Man feature. Holland combines the best of Maguire and Garfield in his performance. Spider-Man is not just shoe- horned in, he's got a substantial role and it's just fabulous.For film's two leads, the heart and soul of this movie is Chris Evans as Captain America. One would think this is like an Avengers film, and Cap would get the short end of the stick, but to be honest, it really isn't just an Avengers film. Captain America is very much the lead character. He really is the heart of the MCU at this point. His morality is his greatest strength and there's an inspirational quality to his character. Downey Jr. this time around portrays a more disturbed and depressed Tony Stark. He's a bit more bleak and it's fascinating to see Tony at this state. Without any spoilers, Evans and Downey Jr. display their finest performances as these characters with an very intense and gut wrenching third act.The only nitpick I have is Zemo played by Daniel Bruhl. Although I loved his portrayal and found to understand what his motivations were, it seemed as if his execution heavily relied on coincidences a little too much. It seemed very far fetched for all the things to unravel at point of the film, but it didn't take away from the impact it had. Honestly they didn't need Zemo at all, if you took him out of the equation then I would contend that this is a near perfect superhero epic. With all that being said, it's still a wonderfully crafted film that did not disappoint. Where Batman v Superman tossed out ideas without ever thinking them through, Civil War is constantly aware of the consequences of its characters' actions, both to themselves and to the people around them. In my opinion Captain America: Civil War breaks the curse of every superhero threequel being either bad or disappointing. Civil War is another knock out and entertains relentlessly. It's an impressive opening to Phase 3 and nudges out The Winter Soldier for me by a hair. The Russo Brothers have a very good hold of this franchise now. They knew when to be serious and when to be humorous, balancing out the tone of the film extremely well. Not to mention juggling every character as much as they can. I think Infinity War is in very good hands.9.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The 'GREATEST' superhero movie ever made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you think of a superhero movie, you know you can't expect much. It's all fantasy and fake and anything could happen, but that's not what exactly matters, but HOW it's happens that's what actually makes us to crave, spend money and time on the fantasy land that doesn't exist. The whole cast and Joe brothers did it, they did it really well that they did it great. I completed the movie and I said to myself "it couldn't be any better"It has everything that you can expect from a marvel movie with a huge star cast like that, great performance, a right amount of mind blowing actions, breath taking fight sequences plus it has even more than that, it has comedy, well written and explained story and characters. It's definitely not one of those avengers types when after a part of a movie you'd yawn and sit back cause you know they're gonna shoot you with an overdose of action an mayhem. Just like always Chris proved that no one can play Cap any better than him, while Captain America making a choice and sticking to its side knowing the conflicts. While Tony is again serving it's purpose, beautifully done by Downey. Rudd steals the show with his cheesy lines while Spiderman taking half part of it by his true comical self. And Panther, man you'd see that guy and would crave for more of him. There's a huge list to go trust me, performance of the cast is what makes it beautiful. Its a masterpiece of Sci-fi, Action and Thriller genre after a long time.You'd go through the movie amazed and laughing. And by the time it would end, you probably won't wanna leave. So just stop reading and go out, WATCH IT!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>CAPTAIN America - CIVIL WAR - The comparison with Batman Vs Superman is inevitable. In my review to B vs S i had written that the reason shown for the fight between Batman and Superman was too silly , and could have been ignored if they could have talked about it. Many viewers on YouTube comments or on other websites have said that , come-on , give them a break , its a comic book movie , don't take it seriously , we need to get the fight of Batman and Superman , doesn't matter whether the reason is strong enough or not. But i say 'NO' , even if it is a comic book movie , we the audience are not fool , and we need strong reason if two of our heroes responsible for our safety are fighting with each other. And in CIVIL WAR , they talk , they counter attack , they try to stop each other , they give their own reasons and when nothing works THEN THEY FIGHT. And hell what a fight it was. Less i talk about the plot more it will be good for you to consume everything from the movie. Basically its about the casualty of people who died when our superheroes goes for big fight. The mass destruction happens , and many people die , and it is somehow the responsibility of the Avengers. Tony Stark , feeling the guilt of his doings in AGE OF ULTRON want to sign the accords of UNITED NATION that from now Avengers will be supervised by UN. We can clearly see why Tony , wants this , its because of his guilt , and he want Avengers to work on a more controlled manner. That's a sufficient reason. On contrary , Steve Rogers don't agree. He say what we do , must be in our hand , we cant be in control of Govt , because govt have agendas , and agendas can change. Here too i can clearly see why Cap America reacted like that , because i have seen how much betrayal he has suffered from the higher authorities in Winter Soldier. Their thinking differs on the moral ground. And nobody is wrong. And you can root for anyone you like (like its currently happening on YouTube , people discussing who is right and who is wrong) . But its not all about UN accords which make these heroes to fight. BUCKY the winter soldier and Cap America's dear friend becomes a very major plot character in the movie which i cannot discuss. This movie have more then enough action sequences to hold you to your seat. And these action sequences are best till date shown in any Super Hero Movies (yes surpassing MAN OF STEEL but not MAD MAX when it comes to non Super Hero Movies). Cant discuss about all the action set pieces , but the Airport fighting scene in BERLIN was brilliantly done. Each and every character gets his big moment , with introduction of Ant-man(injecting some of the best humor of the movie) from other movie and two new characters SPIDERMAN &amp; BLACK PANTHER . Spider man was great , Tom Holland is a nice choice for it. And he is the youngest Spider Man till date on big screen. Which makes him less experienced cracking more jokes then he should , but he cant control it as he was fighting with his role models . But i liked the character of No Nonsense Black Panther more then Spiderman And m also looking forward to his Stand Alone movie more. He was so serious , so royal , not cracking a single joke in whole movie. Its almost like African Batman of Marvel. I would also like to add , that unlike B vs S , the introductory characters are not just there in the movie for promotion of future movies , rather they have more they perfect reason to be here. Talking of characters , Cap America is always my favorite in the Avenger movies. And one of the best thing about his character is that he has a clear vision , that from the birth , that what he need , what he want to do for his country . And although the situations changes he never get confused about it. But , although Cap America is my favorite character , without any doubt its easy to say that ROBERT DWN. JUNIOR is the best actor among the whole cast of avenger. And he has done so much for the Avenger series (and also get many things in return) . Even if you will be on team Cap , there will be moments when you root for Iron Man , and that's shows the acting brilliance of Robert. He is different in Russo brothers hand as compared to in the hands of Joss Wehdon . He is more serious , full of guilt , less humorous , which makes him better. Cant discuss the other characters , otherwise i have to write another review for that. One thing i misses in Civil War was the Political Conspiracy which was shown in Winter Soldier . And also there was no suspense element here. But the action is more then enough to compensate it. 3d was great too. Look for the scene where BUCKY holds a running bike coming towards him , turn it and ride on it. It was awesome. Marvel Cinematic Universe has changed from here , stakes are high now. Will be interesting to watch how HULK and THOR will react to it. 8.5/10. By ANuP APu KuMaR.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marvel Studios' finest movie yet !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Captain America: Civil War (2016), the opening to Marvel: Phase Three was incredibly stellar. 'Twas phenomenal and is the Marvel Studios' finest movie yet. I've literally waited for one and a half year and finally it didn't disappoint. This is 2016's third superhero movie in a row after Deadpool and Batman v Superman which I've completely enjoyed watching. The Russo brothers have nailed it and I can say the 'Infinity Wars' are in good hands. The conflict in ideologies makes it believable why the characters fight here. I know both the movies BvS and Civil War could be kept for comparison but we are actually emotionally invested in all the characters from both the films. All your favourite guys split into teams and fight is visually a treat. Who needs a villain when you have Steve Rogers and Tony Stark? Both protagonists. Both antagonists.The 17-minute airport fight scene is one of the best action sequences in the history of superhero movies. Every character feels respected. The not-an-usual kid from Queens had an amazing presence and a satisfying screen time. Welcome home Spidey! And, the Wakandan Black Panther was absolutely remarkable. Thor, Banner and Pepper were missed.Special mention: Those power-packed dialogues, flawless action scenes, Spidey's cool action-comedy, Baron Zemo (though not a great villain but he has motivation), Stan Lee's cameo and of course Martin Freeman (our John "Hamish" Watson &#x1f600; ). I give my rating a clean 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had a problem with the avenger movies. They get around with too little a story to tell. There is a bad guy, he did something, then the avengers discuss something and they fight this ultimate battle that nobody can deny loving. Captain America is not this sort of a movie. Russo brother must have given an amazing efforts, and took a chance to make a movie this long to convey a story. But it paid off, the action became sideline because the story is gripping.The character build up was precisely done. On top of that, the new and returning characters were given adequate importance. Ant-Man was great, Spidey and Black Panther had a great intro, Cap and Stark had marvellous confrontations.Now talking about action scenes, they were innovative. We saw a lot of it never scene before. It was fresh and kept us at the edge of our seats.Bucky did good too. He had a fare share of footage and most of the story revolved around him. Daniel Bruhl, another new addition was mysterious and well suited in his role. Friendship was the root cause of this civil war, so I was expecting some heated arguments between friends who are facing each other, But I got more that what I expected, and I had high expectations I tell you that.The climax was exhilarating. With a good ending, all is set to make it one gem of a movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Revenge</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I suspect that very few in the audience going into the cinema are under the delusion that this is an Captain America personal showcase. The reason why it is not titled "The Avengers: Civil War" escapes me, but hardly matters.I chose "revenge" for my summary line. The added title "civil war" would also do. Ditto the title of a different, entirely unrelated movie: collateral damage. I like mine best though for it is most relevant to the plot. Revenge is the motivation. Revenge is also the tool. After a few red herrings, the final twist comes out: the chief villain, Russian scientist Zemo, reveals bitterly how he lost everything he had as collateral damage (hence my alternative summary line) during an Avengers' action. Recognizing his own limitations in any attempt to kill the Avengers, he patiently hatches a sinister plot to get them to kill each other, also driven by desire to revenge.What started the rift in the Avengers, however, is not revenge, but collateral damage. The government wants to bring the Avengers under control after considerable collateral damage results from more and more of their assignments. This will be done by having members sign a treaty which would limit their autonomy in action. The stand taken by the two leaders is unexpected. You would have thought that Captain America would be pro-establishment and therefore willingly sign, while Iron Man the free spirit will refuse. Guess again! It is the exact opposite. Joining Captain America to make a firm stand to resist any control are the regulars Falcon, Scarlet Witch and Hawkeye (coming out of retirement, so soon). Standing by him is also old boyhood friend Winter Soldier (coming out of deep freeze) and new recruit Ant-Man. In the opposing camp, with Iron Man are regulars War Machine, Black Widow and Vision. Black Panther's alliance is incidental as he believes that Winter Soldier at the other side killed his father (one of the red herrings as mentioned). Recruited to complete a matching number of six is Spider-Man who is really Spider-boy in personality. The power, however, is anything but boyish.I have already seen the movie twice. The narrative, a couple of minor twists notwithstanding, is not difficult to follow. But one scene towards (but not quite at) the end is worth watching again and again. This is the thirty-minute-plus all-out head-to-head combat between the two camps, involving all 12 superheroes. Things move so fast that you have to watch at least twice to appreciate how cleverly the whole thing has been crafted.Here are just a few examples among the numerous clever designs. Initially, it is one-on-one matching such as the obvious pitching of Captain America against Iron Man and Black Panther against Winter Soldier. But that is just the beginning.In the melee where Hawkeye has Black Widow under him, she quips "we are still friends, right?". At the sign of Hawkeye relenting, Scarlet Witch hurls her fireball their way together with a chiding to Hawkeye "You are pulling your punches".When shifting of opponents brings Hawkeye and Black Panther face-to-face, the former gentlemanly introduces himself "We haven't met. I'm Clint", only to be met by a dismissing "I don't care" by the latter.When Ant-Man transforms himself into a giant and is then brought down by Spider-Man by tripping him with spider threads, the latter pays tribute to the original Star Wars trilogy where ostrich-like agile artillery machines are brought down by attacking the lowest point of their center of gravity.When Captain America finally get upper hand over juvenile Spider-Man by trapping him under some heavy fallen structure, he asks "You are not a bad guy. Where are you from?" "Queens", replies Spider-Man. Captain America flashes a genuinely friendly smile, "Brooklyn", he offers. Good neighbors, even 70 years apart. I can go on and on, but one line says all: this exquisite sequence should be watched again, again and again.Just a quick summary of the status of each of the 12 characters, in preparation for watching the next one. Captain America rescued from the state prison Hawkeye, Falcon, Ant Man and Scarlet Witch, regrouping the core team for the next action. In a reflective mood are Iron Man, Vision and Black Widow contemplating the perpetual question of right-and-wrong. Each of the team leaders' closest friends is out of action: War Machine virtually in disability and Winter Soldier back to hibernation. Black Panther and Spider Man (boy) each goes back to his own life, for the time being.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good movie, just not sure if its a good superhero movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, let me start by saying i actually really liked this movie, is an awesome flick. Having said that it falls short of being the epic, awesome, mind-blowing movie i thought it would be, and in know the reason, the Russos didn't try that hard to make this a great superhero movie, they just wanted to make a great movie, and I'm not sure if it works.First, and what is actually my biggest complaint is the cinematography, the sometimes overused shaky cam along with the super dull color grading made this for a totally awful to look at movie. And it wasn't dark in a way it looked cool and let the primaries pop, it was just dull, and come on, this is a superhero movie, you can't just take the color way from it. Just look at Age of Ultron, the cinematography in that movie felt grand and epic, as the dark though not dull color palette allowed to the super colorful suits of our heroes to shine. The only scene i thought did look decent was the airport battle, and even that didn't look as mind-blowing as it should have. Im actually concerned for Infinity war, since the context of that movie would totally need epic cinematography along with super colorful grade.OK, second, and just as concerning is the soundtrack... dude i had never heard such a forgettable soundtrack in a mare movie. i would only be able do describe it with the same word of the cinematography... dull.Another big problem i had, and probably is an effect of the last two points is how short of epic the movie felt as a whole. The avengers never felt so small as in this movie. Even tho we had a bunch of locations you still felt like everything was happening in the same block. That bothered me as hell.Having said all of that, don't misunderstand me. If this wasn't the SUPERHERO movie had been waiting for like my whole life i would have probably liked it better. I mean the acting is fantastic, the plot is cool, and it has a lot of emotional weight. Is also has a lot of enjoyable moments and some pretty good humor, especially in ant-man and falcon moments. The characters are super interesting and the new ones are fantastic and I'm looking so forward this characters. Seeing spider man for the first time in the MCU was an almost religious experience and black panther is one of the most bad ass, cool characters in the MCU. Dialog is amazing and is amazingly deep. And the final battle was stunning. I'll say it again, it is an awesome movie, just not an awesome superhero movie, not even close to the awesomeness of the Avengers.Finally i would like to ask the Russos to try harder for Infinity war, and especially in the production aspects of the film, try as hard as you can to make it feel as epic as the conclusion of all the MCU deserves.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite the rather similar line up, it has obviously been decided that Captain America films would involve a little more of the adult world, leaving the Avengers movies for pure SMASH. Hence the Age of Ultron was a bit of a mess, but the Cap is ahead of the curve. Another clue is the leaving out of the ultra cartoons Hulk and Thor.One of the advantages of Captain America is precisely his lack of charisma. That throws the laugh lines to everyone else - even the Vision gets to clown about. And it's the humour, interjected in the action and intrigue that is handing these films a massive boost. The Black Panther is mainly given space to be Noble (joking aside, he is the one actually enhanced black guy, not mere sidekick). And Spider Man, take 3, is probably the best man / boy for the job.Once you get used to the sudden switches of city (usually with the name written across the entire screen) the frenetic pace doesn't trip the film up. There are still a number of plot holes and lacunae, but these are forgotten about because we got to see gems like Tony Stark sitting in Peter Parker's student room, chatting up Aunt May.The plot is certainly one we've seen before, but is a better way to house this type of titanic film than 'beat the super villain.. GO" or battle for the super thing-my. One of the strongest lines is given to the injured War Machine (or Iron Patriot. Or War Hammer) - who expresses his support for the hardline position right to the death - giving the film a palette of grey that allows for a serious review.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Enjoyed the film, although it wasn't particularly a stand-out. Action was decent though pacing erred in places; storyline was mediocre, overstuffed and all over the place; Evans was rather plastic. Downey Jr's acting was fantastic despite the poor choice made for the direction of his character. Hawkeye and Spider-Man had no place in the film; felt like the Russos were shoehorned into having Spider-Man in the film for marketing purposes. Chadwick Boseman was interesting on debut and was a good pick for Black Panther. Good to see Vision and Scarlett Witch finally get some much-needed character development, even if it was minor. Once again, we see a MCU edition with no real consequences. The story seemed way too forced. Bruhl was another missed opportunity by Marvel for a great villain, though that is the story's fault, not his acting. Hoping that the Russos ramp it up for the Infinity War movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Captain America Civil WarThe brothers that made Captain Ameirca the Winter soldier have done it again, and they have done it better, with more action, with more ideas, a very fine film. There is a divide of ideologies between two camps in the Avengers team, one sides with the hero of the film, probably the most fair, uncompromising, good natured super hero in screen, Captain America who thinks well that with an international council overseeing and deciding everything for the Avengers simply is not good enough, Captain America gives his hesitance on the issue that the agenda, objectives of people in that international council can be arbitrary and their whims and actions, decisions will indeed overrule them. This is an acceptable concern, but Tony thinks that this a good device to have more control and not get involved into this. Tony is very headstrong, arrogant, egomaniac, megalomaniac sometimes, he imperially decides what is best for everyone. Captain America will not bend or break, he believes in good in the people, he has faith in them, that they can do better, his perception of faith and hope that people can continue to improve, ameliorate always, including his estranged old friend, Bucky James Barnes. For him, Barnes is more than a friend, he is family and you don't give up on family. There is a conniving plot by Zemo, played by Daniel Brunl an underrated actor that has a nuanced performance, he has a covert scheme that is a shock. The Avengers fight against themselves, the fight is Leipzig is m?lée fighting, it is not bad but not the best part of the movie. The best part of the movie is the climax, the denouement of the fight between the protagonist characters, the heroes, one a good hero, the other one a flawed one, even an anti hero, they fight with all the strength, might, breath, tears, sweat, blood, everything is left in the soil, in the deck, in the ground, it is spectacular fight. The goodness of Captain America and the despair, the agony, the sadness in Iron Man, truly the best part of the film that leaves you subdued in an emotional level, you are spend with these characters that had had differences but had worked together, yet they have totally different perspectives, and beliefs, one is more good, the other more flawed and visceral, both think they are right, Stark is too arrogant to admit he could be wrong. The plot is very good, the fights are very good, except the m?lée and disorder in Leipzig, that is a good place to put the fight because Leipzig was the place where the Battle of Nations happened in 1813 between the Napoleonic Forces and the Allied Nations guided by Tsarist Russia, it was an interesting historical correlation. This is the best Marvel film ever, better than the Winter Soldier, with the brother directors now in charge with Avengers Infinity war, expect films at the same level of excellence, bravo.</fullReview>

Now onto the goods:Spidey and panther,great characters done justice by their actors.Also spidey looks like a poorly done cgiThe Action,the stunt team from john wick never disappoints especially with their practicality.That's about it.Can't say I enjoyed it as much I'd hope to but whatever,its just another cash grab from Disney.If you're a mindless Marvel sheep I KNOW you're drooling over this right now but for the rest of the people who saw it knows that it wasn't the "masterpiece" the critics have been painting it out to be.That being said,can't wait for the next Marvel crap fest.Adios Muchachos.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Phase Three</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the disappointment that was 'Batman vs Superman', Marvel had a lot riding on 'Civil War' and thankfully, this was a better film. However, that doesn't mean it wasn't without its problems. The opening was a neat way to showcase our new Avengers, flaunting their powers and flashy new gadgetry. However, this action sequence suffered most by having our heroes go up against Crossbones - Brock Rumlow from 'The Winter Soldier'. When Crossbones was foreshadowed in the prior film, it seemed his vengeance would result in a lot more pain and consequence for Cap, yet within five minutes he had been reduced to a pile of ashes. When you cast Frank Grillo it makes sense to make him more than just a throwaway villain. The Lagos sequence didn't deserve Crossbones as the antagonist; it could've been one of hundreds of minor criminals from the Marvel comics. Rumlow's character was built up so nicely in 'The Winter Soldier', it's such a shame to see him wasted as an average 'villain of the week'. I would, however, like to mention how impressive the calibre of action is in this movie and the previous Russo Brothers directed Cap film. The opening sequence on the ship in 'The Winter Soldier' is one of my favourite action set pieces in all of film and it made me so happy to see them bring this kind of action over into the next film. It makes me giddy to think what they'll do with the Hulk and Thor in 'Infinity War'. After Lagos, we are subjected to quite a bit of exposition and plot building (Hello, Thaddeus Ross). While it all feels important and necessary to lead our heroes to eventually come to blows, a lot of it does seem to drag on. However, things spice up with the introduction of T'Challa aka Black Panther. If I had to compare T'Challa and Black Panther as two separate characters, I would say T'Challa would be my favourite. Of course, they are the same person but the emotion and expression Chadwick Boseman puts into the face of the Wakandan left me in awe and I'm glad he took of his Panther helmet in his scene with Zemo. Even though this is his debut, already I feel T'Challa is one of the most rounded off characters in the MCU, imbued with nobility and a sense of righteousness we haven't felt with any other heroes thus far. Even though Black Panther came close, for me my new favourite superhero leaving the cinema is now Ant-Man. I loved the 'Ant-Man' movie; it was funny, it was quirky and it was feel-good. But it left me wondering how on earth Scott Lang would fit into the world of the Avengers. 'Civil War' gave me that answer and now I just want Paul Rudd to be in every Marvel movie. Please. Lang's introduction to Cap was hilarious and things only got funnier when the airport sequence kicked off. To see Ant-Man pretty much take out Iron Man showcased just how powerful and useful a hero he could actually be, which is something that didn't shine through in his standalone movie. His team up with Hawkeye, or 'arrow guy' as Scott calls him, was a perfect homage to the comics. But nothing beat the moment when he became Giant Man, lumbering around the airport in a slow, clumsy manner, taking on anyone he could catch up with. Now, the airport sequence. Easily the best superhero set piece in the entirety of cinema. Hawkeye has a staff, not just arrows. Scarlet Witch is not someone you wanna get on the wrong side of. The Falcon actually becomes cool. And, of course, everything about Ant- Man. Every hero got to strut their stuff in this sequence and even though there are clearly some Avengers stronger than others, they all have their advantages and powers against each other. The only thing that let it down was the fact we knew nobody would die. Even the Rhodey scare was quickly dealt with. Most of these people are friends and don't actually want to hurt each other; something Scarlet Witch points out to Hawkeye after his scuffle with Black Widow. One things most critics agree on is that Marvel consistently provides us with weak villains. Crossbones fall into that category, but for me Helmut Zemo, played by Daniel Bruhl, was actually one of my favourite villains. He wasn't the typical villain; he had no powers and, for the most part, he stayed out of our heroes way as he conducted his own mission, tracking down the other Winter Soldiers. He ended up being the mastermind of the final skirmish as he revealed to Tony that Bucky killed his parents. The reasoning behind this was probably the weakest part of Zemo's character, but it resulted in a brutal fight between Iron Man, Cap and Bucky. A fight that will assumedly change everything for our heroes. Thankfully, T'Challa stopped Zemo from killing himself in the Russian snow and instead sent him off in handcuffs to Martin Freeman, meaning we will get to see Freeman (nice, although it was a brief appearance) and Bruhl again. All in all, 'Civil War' was a good movie. It had its flaws and it wasn't the best MCU movie, but it was thoroughly entertaining for the majority and sets up a lot to look forward to in the upcoming movies. One thing that worries me, however, is the number of characters. Everyone got their moment in this film but with Marvel adding more and more heroes, yet being too afraid to kill any off, one can't help but wonder how long it will take before the MCU becomes too oversaturated with these characters. Hopefully, 'Infinity War' will be the solution.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was very excited for this movie, and was eager to see it and when I finally did, oh my gosh I was absolutely blown away! This was one of the best movies I had ever seen in my 14 years of living! Every MCU film is great, but this is by far it's most perfect! There is not one thing I disliked about it. Acting was awesome, CGI the best Hollywood has, it's shooting and lighting were outstanding. Everything worked for it! 110 percent effort was obviously put into this movie. Whatever Marvel's doing there nailing it every single time! Action scenes were very tense, very entertaining, and an on the edge of your seat ride. I cannot see anyone hating this movie at all. Every single scene had a surprise or was just pure amazing! Tom Holland as Spiderman is the best since Tobey Maguire! Homecoming is bound to be great. As usual, Robert Downey Jr was terrific as Tony stark same with Chris Evans as captain America I adored every second of civil war. It's a must see for sure. I recommend you see it as soon as you can. Bring the kids, your date, friends or spouse. And I promise you will not regret doing so. Best film or 2016!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best super hero movie to date.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I knew that the comic version of Civil War would not translate to the movie version, and I was right. But that wasn't the problem. In terms of other MCU or Capt. America movies, Captain America Winter Soldier was a more complete Marvel movie, and held by many as the best Marvel Movie for good reason. What was missing from Civil War is that the story line and villain that Marvel did go along with was not as well planned out or as important to the overall picture of the Marvel Cinematic universe as other movies or Winter Soldier. Without giving away spoilers, the ending and twist in the movie have no real consequence in the MCU, and one could argue that you're pretty much in the same position at the end of the movie as you were in the beginning. All this is besides the comparison of the comic to the movie, which would be endless.Having watched the movie in theatre, I can say I'm glad I did, and will be buying the Blu-ray once released. Marvel continues to do Justice to these characters, and its exciting what's to come in the near future with the Black Panther, Spider-Man, and Doctor Strange. Personally, I feel that the movie for me was 4.5 stars, definitely better than other reviews I've read, and better than Batman Vs. Superman. This movie did not disappoint, and was a worthy addition to both the MCU and Capt. America Franchise.</fullReview>

True there was a few mistakes in the storyline like how Iron Man had heard of Peter Parker never mind where he lived, and knew he was Spiderman. And also at the end where Zemo counted on Iron Man going after Captain America without being noticed. However even though Spiderman and Ant Man wasn't at all needed to the film I'm glad they was in it as I think they really added to the scene in both humour and action. And I think the ending was just a generally amazing fight. Overall I think it was a brilliant film true it had its mistakes but who really cares when there's some kick ass action and funny comments.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marvel's finest to date</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Superhero fatigue' is a phrase commonly batted around amongst critics and forum lurkers whenever a new caped crusader is unleashed into cinemas. Cries of Hollywood running out of ideas are often heard too. Despite all of this, the likes of Spider-Man, Batman and the Avengers crew have Hulk-smashed the box office for years. Most impressively, Marvel's ever-increasing 'Cinematic Universe' has been building now for 8 years and 13 films, films that occasionally claw in over a billion at the box-office. This is not down to audiences simply flocking to the promise of CGI explosions and wise-cracks, but Marvel's insistence on keeping the formula fresh.After a few years churning out average to above-average (and one excellent in 2008's Iron Man) origin stories for the individuals that would, in 2012, reluctantly team up to become The Avengers, producer Kevin Fiege was obviously wary of wavering interests. Marvel's work since 2014, since the mediocre Thor: The Dark World in 2013, has been exceptional, placing their heroes and villains in a variety of cinematic genres. Captain America: The Winter Soldier played out like a 70's spy thriller, casting Robert Redford to reinforce the tone, Guardians of the Galaxy often felt like bizarre B-movie with a bigger budget and a more talented cast, and Ant-Man, a movie many predicted to be a disaster, was a full-on comedy, bolstered by the presence of an effortlessly charming Paul Rudd.The latest - and by far the best - is the third and possibly final entry into the stand-alone Captain America series. Retaining The Winter Soldier's directors Anthony and Joe Russo and also much of the same tone, Civil War pits its second most popular superhero against its first, Robert Downey Jr.'s Iron Man. Also along for the ride is almost every other hero on the roster, along with a couple of new ones. But what makes Civil War very much a Captain America film and not The Avengers 3 is the Russo's remarkable grasp of their characters. With Bucky Barnes aka The Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan) back on the scene as a very wanted man, Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) finds himself torn between his loyalty to an old friend and being held accountable for his superhero actions. It is the friendship between the two that remains at the heart of the film.When Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) accidentally causes mass destruction in Lagos on a mission led by Captain America, the Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross (William Hurt) informs the Avengers that the United Nations are passing a bill known as the Sokovia Accords, which will see them under the control of a UN panel. Full of guilt over his balls-up with creating Ultron, Tony Stark backs the bill, as do War Machine (Don Cheadle), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Vision (Paul Bettany). With little confidence in the government, Steve opposes the bill, and is followed by Falcon (Anthony Mackie), Scarlet Witch, Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and Ant- Man. Tensions are raised higher when The Winter Soldier is accused of bombing the UN conference in Vienna and becomes a wanted man all over the world.What makes Civil War such a gripping film is its refusal to offer any easy answers. Depending on your own political and personal views, Captain America could be the antagonist of his own movie, causing a war between friends over his blind loyalty to a friend he knows is a mass-murderer, albeit a brain-washed super soldier experiment. On the flip-side, the character Downey Jr. has now immortalised and the hero to always receive top billing could become a knee-bending traitor seeking accountability for his own irresponsible actions during the events of Age of Ultron. More likely, and more interestingly, you will come to realise that there is simply no right answer.So it all comes down to who wins the fight. And what a fight it is. One of biggest flaws of Batman v Superman was its failure to come up with a believable scenario that would cause the good guys to beat on each other only to come to realise they are on the same side. Not only does the brawl feel organic, taking place at Leipzig airport with each character allowed more than one moment to shine, but it also refuses to offer any easy solution or a big bad for the team to unite against. The motivation and plan of the film's villain, Helmut Zemo, played with a remarkable subtlety by Daniel Bruhl, is kept a mystery until near towards the end. And just when you think you finally know where it's all heading, it side-steps you and goes in a completely different direction.The film's biggest flaw is the introduction of Spider-Man, who is finally back in the hands of Marvel after Sony's failure to re-boot the franchise with Andrew Garfield. Played by Tom Holland, who is the best Peter Parker yet, his entry into the fold feels shoe-horned and slightly awkward. But when he is let loose during the airport fight, he damn near steals it until Ant-Man shows his new friends just what he can do. The other newbie, Black Panther aka the Wakandan T'Challa (a gravelly Chadwick Boseman), plays a bigger role than you might expect, still learning and developing into the king he will become. Above all else, Civil War is simply a blast. With such care taken with its army of characters, each getting their own arc, its easy to become emotionally invested. So when Cap and Iron Man really get down to business, it becomes unbearable to think that one of them may not walk away. Bravo, Marvel and the Russo's.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Super Hero Movie Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Smart, emotional film. This one takes a look at the heroes from the layman's perspective and it's not a pretty view. This isn't a film with a traditional threat or single villain that needs to be overcome. This is a story about guys who passionately disagree with one another and their inability to agree on the response to certain issues leads to conflict and war. I love the way this movie managed to introduce and setup future Marvel films without seeming like too much of a distraction to the overall film. I love Spider-Man's quips and comments while meeting the other heroes. I love the way Black Panther does not have time for anyone and refuses to quip! He's a man on a mission and carries himself in a cool, calm, regal, and charming way that makes a stark contrast to characters we've seen in the past. The most interesting character in the movie are Spider Man, Black-Panther, and the Awesome RDJ AKA Iron Man. Sure this is a captain America movie , but the role of Iron Man was something else you can't forget. And at some point in the movie you sure wants to kill BUCK and CAP! This movie starts at full speed throwing the audience into the surprisingly intricate story without any warning. What I mean by this is that Civil War opens without any credit sequence, Marvel logo, or fun soundtrack to ease you into the chaos that unfolds. Instead this movie throws you right in and trusts that you'll stay afloat from the onset. Once the credits actually roll we're treated to a scene that both made me wonder how they stuck a young Ferris Bueller in my Marvel film and what sort of devilish deal was bartered to get RDJ seem so young. Like, seriously, this moment was utterly shocking!The plot of this movie is similar to other super hero movies but this movie finds a way to set itself apart with the attention and care of the characters themselves. The less you know about the plot the better but the conclusion of this movie ensures that the heroes in this movie don't walk away from this film with relationships unscathed. There are ramifications to the relationships that will likely carry on in future films. Civil War initially gave me some bad Age of Ultron vibes with The Avengers encroaching a mission without any backstory. Those concerns began to wash away when the film took it upon itself to remind me that this is the Russo's we're talking about and their concept of action is a lot more grounded and brutal than what we see in other Marvel films. This is a deliberate introduction that has a purpose that you'll understand as the movie progresses. The movie may begin with action but the action sequences are so good that they seem like they were lifted directly from a great Jason Bourne movie and Marvel has no business having sequences this well thought out or fun.</fullReview>

Clint, Vision as the most figure of changing their views, well we can say Vision as the most-wise character in this movie. but then, Clint is coming and bringing new figure which is "Gi-ant-man". well, the most interest point of this movie is the role of Winter Soldier itself and Zemo. Winter Soldier was coming into his home, his pal. and his role is connecting to the whole climax. how about Zemo? because of his role, the epic superheroes against each other appears. so then I could give 9 even 9.5 but I can't because I will miss captain until Infinity war and for me that's too long.. good movie, best in sequences, every character appear without oppressing to other, and for Zemo, your plan is succeeded?

		<fullReview>Captain America: Civil War a combination of the seriousness of Winter Soldier mixed with the ridiculousness found in The Avengers. It shouldn't work but it does, and is the best film in the MCU.There's an action scene in the latter half of the film at an airport that has been really hyped up that fits that profile. On paper, this is a scene idea that could break your movie. I can imagine that if I was the director of this movie and Marvel told me I needed to have this scene in the movie, I probably would have walked off the project. "That's just too much ridiculousness for me in one scene," I'd argue. Somehow the Russo's made it work and I commend them for that. It's not the best scene ever. In fact, I'd say it's just okay. Still, it didn't break the movie and I call that a success.Overall, the movie is solid throughout (though the beginning action sequence is sort of blah). People have said that the villain isn't strong as usual for a Marvel film. I'd argue the opposite actually. He seems sort of generic at first, but once he reveals his cards, he's actually pretty great. He's a sympathetic villain in my opinion and is probably the best superhero villain I have seen on film since The Joker. He's nowhere near that level of greatness. I'd say he's more along the lines of Doctor Octopus from Spider-Man 2. The only problem is that he's barely in the film.Instead, this movie is more dedicated to having The Avengers show off their powers and battling it out. That's the main conflict here and in the end it is sort of a weak point of the movie as nothing's really resolved morally.The movie puts forth that The Avengers should be held accountable for their actions and be controlled by the UN because of the collateral damage they cause. Iron Man and some Avengers agree with this. Captain America and his friends disagree. Eventually though Iron Man comes around. But why did he actually? There's really no justifiable answer. Besides Iron Man, you wonder did the other Avengers that sided with him change their minds too? That's not even answered. So basically the premise of the movie has no real conclusion. In fact, the movie just ends out of nowhere.In my opinion, this conflict is hard to resolve as I do see both sides of the issue. As a viewer though, I would have liked the movie pick a side and then justify why it was the correct choice.But in the end, it doesn't really matter because as soon as more aliens or whatever supervillains arrive, The Avengers are going to put all this bureaucracy aside and fight the bad guys in future installments.Side Note: The way the script is put together is actually similar to Bruce Lee's Return of the Dragon in that throughout that film, Bruce Lee put a lot of care and thought into it. It was quite brilliant in action and comedy. But for whatever reason, the movie's ending is dumbfounding. It's like Bruce Lee just got sick of writing his script and thought, "Eh, screw it. I'm tired. I'll just write some monologue that doesn't make sense and say 'The End'." That's what it feels the screenwriters of Captain America: Civil War did too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not really a Civil War, but a great Superhero-Fight nonetheless!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By a civil war, I understand a brutal conflict between several parties in an urban surrounding over a longer period of time, and this was rather a street fight between a bunch of superhero-friends, who once confronted with the political and moral consequences of their actions, realized that they disagree on certain basic issues and therefore argued it out using their fists and abilities, which was so much fun to watch that I will condone the misleading tag-line.Especially for a martial arts fan like me, the fantastically choreographed fist fights were the highlight of the movie and the reason why I would like to watch it again on Blu Ray as I found that the 3D technology wasn't developed enough to capture the fast velocity of their movements making them appear slightly jittery. The action scenes were really amazing and didn't seem overlong or bloated.What I liked about the story is that although it dealt with a lot of characters who all by themselves aspired to be in the spotlight as most of them would ultimately get their own movies like Black Panther for instance, it nevertheless kept a very good balance and followed a clear central theme so that it never felt over-fraught with unnecessary sidelines or was embarrassingly chaotic like "The Amazon Spider-Man 2" for instance which was a catastrophe. So I will excuse certain weaknesses that all Marvel movies seem to have which I will describe as a certain immaturity and incompleteness of the plot without giving away any spoilers. After watching it I always feel like I should read the comics in order to get the full picture. With the very popular German actor Daniel Brühl they also introduced a rather unusual villain who brought a new kind of stereotype into the genre, a very quiet manipulator with a tragic human side. It's also interesting to compare the many parallels of the story to the recent "Batman v. Superman" movie sharing some main ideas concerning the public control of superheroes placing them under the command of a specific political authority which is all inspired by A. Moore's legendary "Watchmen" and in retrospect I find "Captain America 3" executed this ideas far better than Singer managed to do with "Batman v. Superman".Another great plus are definitely the new recruits of the Avengers team starting with Spiderman and Antman, who are just marvelous and also the Black Panther and The Vision and Scarletwitch are superb and a rather personal compliment goes to - hot, hotter, - Scarlett Johansson who as Black Widow demonstrated her best performance so far.All in All I find "The First Avenger: Civil War" surpassed it's prequels and also marked a new great highlight of the Marvel cinematic universe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Marvel film yet but has to have fans worried for Infinity Wars</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This review will contain implied spoilers they will be in the second part of the review and I'll give a warning.So overall I really enjoyed the film. I thought it was great the way they included so many characters but still gave each some sort of progression during the movie. The action scenes were great and had more heart than most of the super hero films of late. Particularly the climatic battle. I felt over all it delivered the enjoyment of Guardians and Assemble but the heart, intelligence and stakes of Winter Soldier.It also gave us one of the few compelling antagonists of the MCU. Someone who was a genuine threat to the heroes and who did damage by the end of the film. The first time that has happened in an Avengers movie. Though Captain America has been blessed with the better villains of the MCU to date.In terms of performances RDJ and Chris Evans deliver their best to date. Tom Holland's awkward performance perfectly encapsulates a teen Spiderman who's abilities catapult him into a world he feels hopelessly out of his depth in. Chadwick Boseman likewise delivers a Black Panther that leaves the viewer desperate to see his solo movie. Whilst Elizabeth Olsen and Paul Bettany get more to do in this film than in Ultron.So why has this got me worried for the future of the MCU and in particular Infinity Wars? Well I've got some mild implied spoilers coming now so stop reading if you don't want any. In the airport fight scene one character jokes to another that they are pulling their punches. The problem with the line is that it highlights that Disney are doing the same with this film. #SPOILER ALERT# With no super hero deaths it feels like they are afraid to lose characters for future films. Which has me worried for Infinity Wars. If they continue like civil war then that movie will be robbed of it's impact. There really was no reason for Warmachine to survive and the film needed a death in the climatic battle to elevate it to the Dark Knight level. Which has me very worried for Infinity Wars particularly when paired with the near universal praise CW has received. #SPOILERS END#So please Marvel don't continue to pull your punches or it could destroy the franchise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thankfully, not a let-down</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Captain America Civil War is the Marvel movie I've been looking forward to for a while. I've lost interest in the Marvel Cinematic Universe after several forgettable films post the first Avengers movie, but this partially restores my faith. It's not a masterpiece like everyone's saying it is. I think people are just so relieved it didn't turn out like Batman Vs. Superman they're giving it ludicrously high ratings. It takes a little while to get going and the political themes are handled with the simplicity of a primary school politics lesson, but the emotional stuff is handled very well. The collapse in the Avengers alliance is believable and sad, the humour is still there, the action scenes are awesome and the Russo Brothers once again prove themselves fine directors. The performances are all-around excellent, with Robert Downey Jr. giving possibly his best MCU performance to date. I have a bad feeling that once the dust settles people will look upon this less favourably, but this is a very good blockbuster, and tells the story of a small-scale superhero conflict (In the comics the civil war seems to have been far bigger) with intelligence, humour and glorious pyrotechnics.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought it really was a lot better than I had initially expected. Despite it being swarmed with characters, it never felt overwhelming or bogged down in exposition or anything. The central political conflict was given a lot of weight and significance. The first half of it was simply brilliant, very reminiscent of The Dark Knight. Then some flaws started showing up in its second half. One of the things I've gotten so tired of with Marvel is the insistence of pretty much every film of theirs to be bogged down with comedy. That's something that I appreciated about the previous two Captain America films, even if only the 2nd one was good. Here, I never felt like humor started appearing... until the build-up and the first battle scene between the Avengers in the airport. All of a sudden, all of them started giving funny one-liners and sarcastic quips. Were the lines bad? Not at all, but with everything else going on, and considering they were now in a physical battle with their own friends, it just felt like a complete betrayal to the tone and the heft of the whole thing. I loved Holland as Spiderman, but an article that is floating online said is best- he was great in it and it excites me for his own films, but he had no business being in this film or being introduced at all. He and Ant-man, among a few others, just lighten the whole thing up at the exact moment when it should have gotten even more serious. Luckily, the film goes back on track after this battle scene. The battle scene itself isn't bad at all so I don't think it hurts the film significantly, but it does sort of try to change the tone and I don't think that was the right call. Overall, as flawed as it is and as someone who is not really a fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe at all, this was really great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Avengers 2.5: Civil War, better than Ultron</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Was disappointed with Avengers 2: Age of Ultron, though some new characters (Vision and Scarlet Witch) entered the MCU.Now you got 3 scene stealers here: Black Panther, Ant-Man and Spider-Man. Yes, Spidey back in thighs, but for a internal war.A tragedy in Nigeria forces General Ross the World governments to put a control on Avengers interventions around the globe. Since Tony Stark (Iron Man) agrees to abide the law, thus Steve Rogers (Captain America) does not agree at all, seeing a breach in liberties to do justice and help people. The two teams battle each other, while an enemy, Zemo, pulls the strings to see the Avengers destroy each other. And Captain America does his best to protect a former foe: the Winter Solder known as Bucky Barnes...The movie bears more action and interesting story lines than the Avengers last movie. Interesting to see how Ant-Man, Black Panther and Spider-Man fit well into this.If the phase 2 movies of the MCU had their share of weaknesses (except Captain America: The Winter Soldier), this time, they enter phase 3 in a bang and looks promising...And Disney in all this ? Pay attention, it has strong and tragic family references...Finally, good ol'Stan Lee makes a cameo as a delivery man. And this movie delivers...Stay tuned for more !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Marvel Film Since Guardians</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow. Marvel is not messing around anymore. Captain America - Civil War is the best comic book movie Marvel studios has put out since Guardians of the Galaxy, and may be better than the original Avengers film. Everything in this film was top notch from the character arcs, to the action, to the humor, and especially the story. After viewing Batman Vs. Superman - Dawn of Justice in March, I must admit until a few days ago I was not looking forward to watching this movie. I felt as though the genre was wearing off on me. After viewing Civil War, I now can see how wrong I was to judge a film by its genre.Civil War's story is the most sophisticated to date, drawing parallels to the real life issues about free will and public safety. Most will call this film a statement against "big government" but I think that that the issue is more complex than that. No matter what side of the debate each of the characters are on, we as the audience understand their reasoning and motivation on their opinion. Captain America is a great lead in this film. At no point do you question if this is anyone else's movie, it is clearly Cap's. His dedication to Bucky and the ideals of freedom make him the perfect character to revolve the film around. Iron Man was also awesome in the film. He foils with Cap to further explore this interesting relationship that was started in the previous Avenger films. Robert Downey Jr. brings his A game to the role as always. The rest of the supporting Avengers were also great, with Black Panther, Spider-Man and Ant-Man among some of the stand outs. Black Panther could have just been plopped into the movie to make toys but instead, the writers gave him a clear arc revolving around vengeance that parallels with Cap and Iron Man. Spider-Man' appearance also felt justified, and really made me excited for Tom Holland's future appearances as the Web Slinger. Lastly Ant-Man was better than expected. I actually wished that we got more of him. He brought a lot of humor to this film, and to see him turn into Giant Man was truly amazing. I must mention that while Zemo was decent villain considering that this is an MCU film, his motivation were much weaker than the other characters which did bring the film down slightly.The Russo Brothers have managed to improve upon their previous effort in Winter Soldier which only has me more excited for Infinity Wars. Civil War will easily be in Top 10 lists of best comic book films for years to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why the Heck Wasn't Spider-Man on the Poster?!?!?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I finally saw this movie! Gosh I feel like I was the one who hasn't.Spider-Man was in this movie.How was he?Holy crap this guy was freaking incredible.Anyways, I will stop fanboying and actually review this movie.Yeah this movie is splendid. Some people are raving this movie as the best comic book movie of all time. I think The Dark Knight still holds that title. But my gosh was this movie a close second. MARVEL is on a roll. I have no worries for the next Avengers movie what so ever. Because this movie was kind of the third Avengers. And the third Captain America movie. And an introduction/prequel to Black Panther. And basically a short introduction to Spider-Man too. All of this is crammed all into one movie but it's all handled so well that it truly feels like an Avengers movie. It was done so much better than a recent comic movie that has two beloved super heroes clash against each other... :)SPOILER WARNING...Obviously...So the first thing I noticed about this movie was the score. It seemed a little odd to me at first. It took some time for me to adjust, and then I got over it and kinda loved it. It was exciting especially at the end.I loved all the cool dramatic scenes with the Winter Soldier he was excellent. And we learn in this movie that Hydra also experimented and made several other Winter Soldiers, but he was the only to survive. I loved all the amazing action sequences they were all spectacular. All the super heroes shine in this movie it's so cool. And you totally understand everyone's motives. I was going into the movie saying "Team Cap." But during the movie I was like, "Oh yeah. Good point Iron Man." Everything makes sense in this movie. It all seemed like this could happen for real.And another cool person in this movie was Black Panther. I loved him and I cannot wait to see his own movie. I loved how real his motivation felt. I mean, Bucky literally killed Black Panther's father. And he witnessed his father die, which is one of the hardest things a boy can go through. OK I can't take it anymore. I need to talk about SPIDER-MAN!!!!!!He was the funniest part about this movie. I loved him. It's so great to see a Spider-Man that is actually funny. And interesting. And a teenager. And again you understand his motives. He's amazing. He also talked about Star Wars in this movie. Yeah. Spider-Man: my favorite super hero ever, just talked about my favorite movie series ever. Unbelievably amazing. Brilliant. Spectacular.Yeah and also Ant-Man turns big in this movie and is freaking hilarious. Not only that, but Spider-Man takes him down AT-AT style. Again. Brilliant. Splendid. Incredible. Ant-Man in general was just hilarious in this movie as well. He was awesome. But I especially love the Captain America Bucky Iron Man fight at the end. Literally one of the best super hero scenes ever. But don't get me wrong I loved the air port scene as well. Just this duel was incredibly entertaining. Iron Man basically hates Captain America after this movie. I can just see it in his eyes. I love the part where he yells that his shield is not his and that he doesn't deserve it. It's so tragic. Captain America drops his shield. This Spider-Man is the best Spider-Man I have seen so far. However. He does look very CGI, computer, animated like. And that kinda disappointed me. But that doesn't take away the fact that he was awesome in the movie. And you know the shot where the two sides run at each other? Spider-Man was added to that scene. Great, but, then why the heck isn't he on the poster?Overall this movie was spectacular. Possibly the comic book movie of the decade.9 stars!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE GOODStoryline is interesting with some really good writing, the interactions between the cast feel almost organic in nature and got the biggest laugh out of the crowd in my theater. The "I hate you but not really" thing between Falcon and Bucky Barnes (played by Anthony Mackie and Sebastian Stan) was subtle but very funny.The Movie Also gave us the best Peter Parker so far (played by Tom Holland) with him being an awkward teen just trying his best and a little star struck with all those big names around him.Introducing black panther to the marvel world actually added to the movie, he was beyond amazing and stole every scene he was in!Imagery, lighting and music all created an intense atmosphere.THE BADshaky cam... why the shaky cam all of a sudden when everything was perfect throughout the movie why suddenly switch to what looks like a hand held crappy phone camera in the bomb scene? The action scene in the beginning was speed up and in 3D was down right headache inducing, my eyes just couldn't keep up. This happens in one other fight scene and is just as annoying.... this one is a knitpick but there was a scene or two that was there purely as eye candy, I can see it as desktop wallpaper to be honest but because the scene leading up to it was so intense and full of emotions that final picturesque shot just cheapens things...THE UGLYWhy... in gods name is Aunt May a hottie? WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU RUSSOS!!! Nothing you say can justify this, it was there to attract the male population for the spidey movie, as if having the name "spiderman" on the poster wasn't enough!!!OK, I just had to let that one off my chest. overall good movie if you can get past the first 45 - 60 minutes. once the actual conflict takes place the movie starts getting interesting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best from Marvel !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the best Marvel movie yet, undoubtedly. It clearly surpasses The Avengers, Age of Ulton , all the Iron man movies , ant man , hulk , Winter soldier etc. Lets start with the story. The story is really well made. All the action in the movie seems to have a purpose , it does not look superfluous. Captain America and Iron man have a proper reason to fight. They are not fighting for some stupid logic and reason , unlike in Batman and superman. In BVS , Batman has flawed notions regarding superman and has no proper logic. The fight seems a waste. But this does not happen here. Secondly, kudos to the dialogue writers. All the dialogues are well written. Comic relief is provided in almost all the scenes. Action is flawless and is in huge quantities. In the entire movie i was wondering what the end would be. It does not disappoint. The end is great. There are so many superheros in the movie but it does not feel that a particular superhero has received less time. Its all perfectly made. No other superhero movies hold a candle to this one(except Nolan's batman trilogy).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Civil War was a blast and a hell of a ride, and even though it wasn't masterful film making, it was a beautiful comic book action film, teaming with coolness and jaw-dropping fight-choreography. However, it lacked something that the 2nd movie had, which in my mind, is the best Marvel film since the first Iron Man. The reason why those movies were so great was because they were paced better; had less characters crammed into the plot.Civil War dragged in the beginning because it treads on a topic that has been way overused in superhero films, and that is, of course, the debate on whether or not Superheroes should operate on their own or with government sanction. The villain in this film was no super villain, and had way too little screen time I thought. I actually thought he was pretty interesting, but seemed to serve as a sub-plot. His motives were unknown for most of the film, but when we found out what they were, I realized that his motives carried a real world gravitas to them, and felt similar to the motives of many of America's real enemies, or more generally speaking, the modern west's enemies, who resort to terrorism usually because their loved ones were killed in wars started by NATO countries;-or in this movie's case, wars started by The Avengers. I wonder how many villains exist out there in the real world, trying to destroy western countries from within. It was pretty frightening to think about.If you took all the Marvel films and viewed them in order, Civil War would be the filler episode. Yes, Black Panther was introduced, and a new Spider Man, but they only convoluted the story. I can't help but wonder how long this movie might had been if you took away all the action scenes. The entire plot could have been compressed into a single episode of Agents Of Shield. Spider Man was hardly relevant in this film. He was thrown into the movie for comedy only, and if he didn't matter enough for me to like him, despite the levity he brought to what was one of the gloomier Marvel stories as of late. Black Panther was fantastic, loved his graceful and unique fighting style, but he deserved to be introduced into the MCU with his own movie first. Black Panther's quest for vengeance was so unwarranted, given the fact that we already knew he was fighting the wrong guy the entire film, and in a sense, he also seemed to know it too, but still fought Bucky despite not having evidence that he murdered his father. Same goes for the new Spider Man. He had no motive to fight other than the fact that he was following Tony Stark's orders, and like Black Panther, they did nothing but make this film feel convoluted. I think my favorite co-stars were Vision and Scarlet Witch, who were the only ones who seemed to have a reason to fight in this movie. Paul Bettany was great as the stoic and wise Vision. Still, a fun film that I may see again. I thought there were way too many jokes during the airport scene, which was beautiful, but lacking in seriousness and tension. Seeing Hawkeye and Black Widow crack jokes as they beat on each other was cringe worthy at times. These are two characters that are so close, that seeing them fight over the reasons they did were just absurd. Nevertheless, the fights were so cool that I just blocked out the audio. On a positive note, the final act fight between Bucky, Cap, and Tony had much more drama, and like I said, was very heart breaking to watch. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This Captain America movie is a must see! There are many new twists exposed in this movie that add more gas to the already burning fire. There was much more focus on the character development, but not as their normal daily non super hero selves, but as the Avengers.There was much more of the Winter Soldier in this than expected. It really showed more of his two sides- good and bad. His strength and ability as that of Captain America was emphasized greatly. Scarlet Witch had a critical role to this story. Shocking and well needed! Falcon was more of a bad-ass then he was a wing man. Ant Man was massively hysterical! Spider-Man was ridiculously web swinging every which way, and he could not stop with his anxious young minded self to get out there and make a difference. War Machine still is number two to Iron Man, and will never be anything more than that. The Vision was annoying. Hawkeye is his usual self. Black Widow is hot and will knock you out. Crossbones was short lived and irrelevant. Baron Zemo could have been better.Black Panther was absolutely magnificent with his innovative fighting abilities, speed, agility, and strength. He also had a much more critical role to the story which will lead well to the upcoming Black Panther movie.Captain America... He cannot be messed with. His fight against Iron Man was intense and much better than anticipated. Iron Man was a complete and total prick and deserved to get whooped.Overall, this movie has a lot of detail in it that pieces together with a lot of history between Captain America and Iron Man. But in the end, one stands tall. Who's side will you be on?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Russo Brothers handle an ensemble excellently in another Marvel blockbuster but it wasn't without problems.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Captain America: Civil War has been called "Avengers 3" by some people because of the amount of Avengers that star in the film and it's a valid observation...until you see the movie. Somehow the Russo Brothers, with this huge ensemble cast, dealing with the Avengers themselves, adapting an infamous comic book actually make it still feel like a Captain America movie - which is great! I mean don't get me wrong, you see a lot of other characters and I loved seeing a lot of other characters but it really worked well continuing Cap's story that was left off in The Winter Soldier, which I really enjoyed because Bucky Barnes was one of the most interesting things about that movie and I enjoyed seeing him progress here.And talking of characters, there were quite a few to juggle about but the Russo's once again did an excellent job of not making it confusing or crowded. I'll just go through a few of them real quick. Captain America and Iron Man were great as always, Iron Man was not always his one-liner quip guy in this, he has a lot of stuff to deal with so it was interesting to see him in that light; now I went into this movie on the side of a particular team but boy if you don't start questioning your loyalties during this movie then something's wrong; there were points being made that actually made me see the other guy's side so I was happy to see both sides presented equally, after all it is a Civil War. Black Panther gets his movie debut here and what an introduction it was, he is a fantastic character who I cannot wait to see again, his motives were solid and clear and his third-party angle to the war made it really intriguing to watch, definitely looking forward to seeing Chadwick Boseman in his own Black Panther film. The two sidekicks, as it were, Falcon and War Machine were great to see again and do a lot more plot-wise I think so it was nice to see everyone used really well. Vision and Wanda were fine in their roles again, I think I preferred them in Age of Ultron for some reason, they just seemed more interesting then whereas here, although they were great to see again, I didn't feel as invested in their characters as I was others. Ant-Man was fun to see too and boy do we see him, I'm obviously not going to spoil anything here but he was definitely one of my favorite parts of the movie. Now during all this Civil Waring there is actually a villain in the movie and for me, he was one of the best villains Marvel have done in their Cinematic Universe; I felt his motives were valid, his intelligence was shown very well and his scenes were just really interesting to me.Just before I get into what I wasn't such a fan of I'll mention Spider-Man. Tom Holland is a great actor and does a great job in this, it was really cool to see Spider-Man interact with the Avengers and see him do his stuff. That being said, this Spider-Man was not quite what I was expecting; I don't read the comics so from just a movie-going viewer with the past five Spidey movies to go on, this incarnation was quite different in the way of how they handled him. I've been told it was the most comic-accurate Spider-Man and the best version they've seen of him on screen so I have no place to complain but for me it was a little jarring to see such a change from what I was used too. But I did of course enjoy seeing him on screen and really look forward to seeing him again.Now some things I wasn't so struck on. The first action piece; a battle near the very start of the movie just seemed off for some reason. I don't know what it was but it just didn't flow for me, I didn't enjoy who they were fighting and although it does set up something important a lot of it felt unnecessary. The first quarter of the film I'd say was very much a going from set-up to set-up sort of thing and was a little shaky script wise but the plot eventually straightened and it was great. Another negative I have was that once or twice the CGI was quite noticeable, in some of the action scenes and particularly Vision sometimes it wasn't great. And then something that wasn't necessarily wrong with the film but those darn trailers again. We'd go to one location and I'd instantly recognise it from the trailer so I knew what was going to happen, and that occurred nearly every time they went somewhere else; not all the time mind you, but quite a lot I was already knowing what scene this was leading up to.In the end Marvel roll out another blockbuster with one of the best ensemble casts and an investing, emotional story. For me it wasn't the best film they've done but a real strong shot from the Russo Brothers and set's up a lot of cool characters for the future.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is way better than i was expecting after the trailers. it simply took away the bad taste on my mouth after seeing Bat vs Super. probably one of the best action sequences ever made on a super heroes movie for sure. a really good storyline which bring not non-sense violence, it has important lessons to learn about people, friends, relationship,etc. It is indeed one if not the best Marvel movie so far. no character has a small role or an overrated role. girls awesome and stunning. Liz Olsen being Scarlet witch... super sexy. Scarlett Johansson? well what can we say, shes the hottest one anywhere around: Black panther and his father very very good, i can't wait to see the solo movie. in few word: the movie is more than worthy to be seen!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Avengers 2 That Should Have Been</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Truly and utterly one of the best superhero movies I've ever watched. It encompassed everything I had wanted for an Avengers movie, and it goes as far to a point where I would gladly call it my Avengers 2 movie that should have been.It was perfectly nuanced, showed all the abilities that each hero can bring to the table (except for Ant-Man, he was a bit too gimmicky this time but I'll let it slide, because duh, Paul Rudd). I found it hard to choose between Iron and Cap, despite the fact that I was rooting for the latter at the start.The last fight of Act 3 nearly had me tearing up because the whole morale of the fight holds close to my heart. It was realistic and relatable, just with a large dollop of superhero action added to it.To add on to that, the cinematography was absolutely incredible. Walking into the cinema was a little nerve-wracking for me mainly because of the bitter feeling that remained as I walked out of Age of Ultron. But within the first 15 minutes of Civil War, I knew this was going to be something different, something special.I honestly believe that this movie is the one to go down in history, and will be the benchmark for many other superhero movies out there that is to come. Absolutely well done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great film that does what Marvel do best, However...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers ahead....Great movie, with a huge ensemble cast, but Marvel clearly knows how to approach that kind of film by now, great pace. Great characters as well, loved Black Panther and Spidey, and RDJ showed a lot of emotional range.My one single complaint, which is one that REALLY bothers me by now is that fact that NO MAJOR CHARACTER, OR ANYONE EVER DIES IN THESE FILMS!!! kill someone already, otherwise it kinda feels like the stakes are never high :/ Still though 9/10 would have been a 10/10 had Rhodey or Bucky actually bit the dust.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I just didn't enjoy Civil War as much as I wanted on a personal level.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Technically it was a good film but to me it was really kind of boring overall. I will give it credit where it's due because they did a great job pulling it together (definitely better than they pulled Batman v Superman together) but personally I just didn't enjoy it as much as I wanted to.The story-telling was fine for the most part, felt a bit thick at times because of the merging story lines but I really wasn't a fan of the open ended feeling I got so they could keep in line for the next films in the franchise. The movies no longer carry a personal feeling like they are a smaller more intimate stories being told that just so happens to be connected to a bigger story. They really have started feeling a lot like bloated micro-advertisements or hooks to keep us baited until the next movie comes along but this unfortunately applies to any franchise setting up or carrying on a connected film universe, not just these movies.Overall I give the movie a strong 9 for the technical aspect of it and I give it a strong 7.5 for my own personal enjoyment. I didn't quite enjoy it as much as I did The Winter Soldier but fortunately, despite being bored most of the time I still enjoyed the movie. On a technical level it really deserves that 9 though. The choreography was really good, the character balance/development was on point and even though the fights lacked a good bit of tension and stakes they were well put together and greatly executed. I can definitely see some Oscar nominations and possible wins for areas of technical merit though.The costumes are really some of the best in the business so far. The X-Men franchise, outside of Deadpool could stand to learn a thing or two from Marvel Studios/DC in the costume department. The sound effects were amazing. Marvel Studios really has achieved and perfected the feeling of a comic book coming to life before your very eyes. Snyder could also stand to learn a thing or 2 from the Russo's when it comes to solidifying a story that's being told and ironing out the flow of a film's direction. It really does seem though that having 2 directors on board is a lot better than having 1.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unlike most people, the first Captain America, along with Thor, movie is one of my favourites (the sequels to both, less so), the Iron Man films my least favourite, and The Avengers films rank somewhere in between. While maybe not a popular opinion, I know what I like...and it *isn't* Tony Stark. So it's disappointing that he overtakes this third Cap movie quite a bit (as is news of him continuing doing so in subsequent films). Contrary to belief, not EVERYTHING has to be about Tony freaking Stark. RDJ may be perfectly cast, but I can't enjoy someone playing such a smug, egotistical, infantile jerk on screen, which is why Chris Evans' Steve/Cap was such a breath of fresh air in The First Avenger. Not only did that movie give us a different setting/feel, it also gave us a likable hero. This is why I'm firmly on Team Cap in this movie. In the pros column: Steve remains likable, despite the film's attempt to paint him in a less than positive light at times. I completely understand his position in not wanting to A) allow his friend, Bucky, to be killed over actions he had no control over, and B) Not wanting to allow his friends to be controlled by the government/have their rights taken away. The film begins with Steve, Sam, Wanda and Natasha as a team and THAT'S the film I would've really enjoyed. They work well together, and I especially liked Cap's dynamic with Wanda. He obviously understands her/what she's been through. Elizabeth Olsen isn't given nearly enough screen time, but does exceptionally with what she has, clearly showing Wanda's guilt over things in Age of Ultron and at the start of this film. Steve's loyalty to his friend, Bucky, is also admirable. Even when others join Cap's side later on, *they're* the ones I would've preferred to have seen the film centered around. Instead, it's divided up between them and Team Jerk. The only one on his side I care about is Natasha and, thankfully, she eventually sees things Steve's way. Theirs is another of the better/worthwhile relationships in the movie.Speaking of relationships, the so-called 'friendship' between Cap and the not-exactly-blameless Tony that the latter tries to guilt the former with towards the end is a total 'WTF?' moment. After two Avengers movies, I never saw anything between them other than begrudging tolerance of each other at best, but we're supposed to believe there's some great betrayal? Maybe there should've been signs of friendship between them before attempting a rift, as the only true friendships on display here are those between Steve/Bucky, Steve/Wanda and Steve/Sam/Natasha. Trouble stems from Tony's camp not listening to Cap's reasons for defending his friends and their rights.Characters debuting in this film are Black Panther and Tom Holland's new iteration of Spider-Man. I've seen elsewhere that these two have been described as the 'stand-outs' of the film, and while both have their moments, I'd hardly deem them the 'best' parts. Black Panther spends the majority of his time opposing Team Cap, which doesn't exactly make the best first impression, but eventually he comes around and admits he was wrong, which shows class. Holland's web-slinger is far more juvenile than we've seen before, and I'm not overly familiar with the comics version, so perhaps this interpretation is more in keeping with how he's supposed to be? All I know is I preferred Andrew Garfield's version. This one may be 'fun' for a while, but gets tiresome quite quickly. The jury's still out on him overall until his solo film (which Tony will also be annoyingly inserting his way into).Providing some of the film's humour is Paul Rudd's Scott/Ant-Man (whose 'fanboying' over Cap is more tolerable than Spider-Man's hero worship of Tony) and Paul Bettany's Vision going about normal things looking the way he does (his scenes/relationship with Wanda is also appreciated). While no one could hold a candle to Hayley Atwell's Peggy Carter, Emily VanCamp does well with what she's given as Sharon Carter, whose relationship with Steve is somewhat short-changed and is therefore rather unfair to criticize here. Peggy was the love of Steve's life, but she moved on, so shouldn't he? One of the funniest moments in the film is Bucky and Sam's reaction to Steve and Sharon sharing an intimate moment. She's definitely a Carter, though, given how kick-arse she is in the film. And it's so nice to see female characters like her, Wanda and Natasha kicking arse and taking names without it being labelled as part of some 'feminist agenda' or other such nonsense. They're every bit as powerful as the male heroes (in some cases, moreso), which is only fair. After the action of the film's opening, things feel a bit slow at times as it progresses, with a couple of sporadic action scenes injected to keep events lively. While some of the quieter character moments are appreciated, things do come to a somewhat screeching halt when Tony pays a visit to Peter Parker and his "unusually attractive aunt" (Tony's words...although, given it's Marisa Tomei playing the role, one can let it slide). Giving credit where it's due, the film does an admirable job of juggling such a large cast of characters, and the fight between both sides towards the end is one of the movie's best scenes. What the film's climax comes down to, though, is Cap/Bucky vs. Iron Man, and their tag-team kicking of his shiny metal arse is a thing of beauty. Not everything is resolved nice and neatly. Depending on which side of things you fall, coupled with who your favourites are and whether they get what you'd deem as 'enough' screen time in your eyes, will most likely determine your enjoyment of this film/influence your decision in how much of a success Civil War is. For me, the good and bad aspects were about even, though I'm sure many will disagree.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Avengers: Civil War</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For the past eight years, and a combined total of thirteen movies, Marvel has been doing everything right for when it came to CBM's. Even their less than stellar films (Iron Man 3 and Age of Ultron) still managed to bring the fun, because in the end that's what we want: something fun and memorable. I loved the new Captain America movie; however, I don't think the title is fitting. I think it should have been Avengers: Civil War, because honestly that's what it was. With Captain America in the title he should have the dominating presence of the whole film. Instead, each character has equal shared screen time. One thing that this movie does well is it brings on the emotions, and hard. As a friend of mine said once we were done watching the movie, "I never expected to cry this much during a Marvel movie." That's one of the biggest driving factors the movie has. You feel for every single character for different reasons. It's not only emotional for the characters on screen, it's also emotional for the viewers watching, maybe even more so because we're connecting with them all. The action and fight choreography is amazing. Watching Black Panther fight was like watching a ballet. Winter Soldier is an all-around badass. Everything he does (the good and the bad) leaves your mouth open in awe. Finally, we have a great villain. This man isn't just evil for the sake of being evil. He has a backstory that justifies what he's doing. He has a motive, and his motive is actually pretty rational, even though it's not right. Plus, he actually pulled it off. When you start sympathizing with the enemy, the filmmakers are doing something right. I had my reservations about the new Spiderman at first, but after watching him in action I can sigh with relief. Black Panther is hands down my favorite part of the movie. His character is strong- willed, he knows what he wants, and he sets out to do it no matter what. He's also very calm and rational in what he does. He's respectable, as he should be. Both Ant-man and Spiderman offer up some great comic relief. The way this movie was made is how all movies should be made, not just CBM's.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marvel's Best Movie Yet | Review of 'Captain America: Civil War'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is without a doubt Marvel's best film yet. First, let's applaud the writers here because they took a story and adapted it as best as they could to tie it into the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and they were able to do that without tarnishing the story. That right there is fantastic writing. That is spectacular writing and something Warner Bros. and DC could take a page from. This is one of the reason's Marvel movies are so popular because they bring to life a story and characters while keeping both of those faithful to the original creation. Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr. were perfect for their roles. Everyone was perfect for their roles. This is cast who not only understands their characters, but they also understand the character dynamics not just in the story but also regarding each other, and they are friends. Everyone here is friends with someone else, and it is believable not just because they are friends in real like but also because they have such great chemistry with one another. The foundation of the film is solid, and that is the key to a successful movie.The story is a little convoluted but only because Zemo (played by Daniel Brühl), the villain, goes through very elaborate means to bring the Avengers to their knees. He makes them turn on one another, and it's very strategic, easy to follow, especially when all the elements are laid out for the audience by the end, but, again, it does come off just a little contrived. Despite that though it was still thought out. This evil plan was without any holes, it flows and kept the underlining tension afloat. Of course, the relationship between Bucky (Sebastian Stan) and Captain (Chris Evans) did that all by itself.As mention above, the casting is fantastic. Civil War is full of talented actors who know the characters and how to bring them alive. However, Stan and Evans, their characters have such a long history and a remarkable brotherhood here, it's not just a bromance, they are family. These two characters, they capture that love, that intensity, and that friendship so powerfully, and for the trilogy, this element is what made this film spectacular. All the characters are intense, and as the tension rises, these friendships are put to the test. They are each fighting for what they believe in, and that is putting them all at odds. It's heartbreaking because the actors make it so. Yes, the writers did that in the screenplay, and yes, the director wanted that as well, but these actors were able to bring it all to life.This is all great and perfect to make an incredible film, but Marvel is magnificent at incorporating comedy with seriousness. This isn't just another superhero action movie, but it's also not just a drama like some movies *cough* BvS *cough*. No, this film has perfectly woven exceptionally clever comedic into it that just make everything so entertaining. Paul Rudd and Tom Holland, in particular, were such great additions to the movie because they brought out the light moments within all the seriousness. Yes, so did the other characters, but these two were phenomenal.Captain America: Civil War is the best Marvel movie (live-action) to date. Not only does it have an amazing story full of heart, but it also has great directors, great actors, and those two screenwriters, Christopher Markus &amp; Stephen McFeely, deserve some massive praise here because they adapted it to perfection.

		<shortDescription>Maybe Marvels studio finest film yet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well lets see. The movie flows smooth. The action is mind-blowing , the cgi is on a level that i never have seen before. Acting is great, no one could fit the role as Iron Man as good as Robert Downey JR. Chris Evans nails the role as Cap, and the chemistry between Iron man and Cap is the best. The story dos like this: A political rift between Iron Man and Captain America causes them to split up, meanwhile a man named Zemo is out with revenge. This is a avenger movie, only just whiteout Hulk and Thor. There were so many superheroes pressed into one movie. Heroes like: Black Panther, Iron Man, Black Widow, Captain America, Ant Man, Spiderman, Hawkeye, Scarlet Witch, Crossbones( All though he is not a hero), Warmachine, Falcon, Vision and The Winter Soldier. Is that a good thing. Well in this movie it was. But maybe in future Marvel movies, there will be too many for one movie. We will see. Of course we got to think of the bad things in the movie. It was not easy to find any thing, but if you nitpick you will find somethings that doesn't fit. Like the love story between Cap and Sharon Carter. If you've seen The winter Soldier, you probably know who she is. If you haven't you'll have no clue. Also the Avengers get blamed for all the death they have caused, but what of those lines they have saved. Nobody mentions that when the General( Played by William Hurt) brings up the accords. But its a great movie. Go and watch it now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's Not Perfect But It's a Damn Fine Follow-Up To The Winter Soldier</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Batman v Superman got to go first and now we get to see Marvel's counter punch in Captain America: Civil War. You can't help but compare them, collectively they're two of the three biggest movie releases of the year (the third is Star Wars: Rogue One). But I'll get into that later. I liked Avengers: Age of Ultron but the reality is that the reaction to it was mixed and Marvel/Disney needed to step it up for their next ensemble film. On paper, this seems like the story line to do it with, their own battle of titans, Captain America vs. Ironman, who doesn't want to see that? They brought their A game here too though, not only delivering on the action/adventure front but asking some unique philosophical questions. That's what separates the good from the great in this genre of movie, all of them have the big budget set pieces, it's bringing something different to the table that makes something memorable.*Minor Spoilers Ahead* We start in 1991 at a Hydra stronghold. We see The Winter Soldier aka Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan) being reanimated from cryo-sleep. They then activate him with some seemingly random code words spoken in Russian. He is ordered to perform an extraction mission and to make sure there are no witnesses. He performs a hit and run on a vehicle and kills the two passengers. He pulls 5 blue blood bags out of the trunk and delivers them to Hydra command.We then go to Lagos where some of the Avengers are tracking Crossbones (Frank Grillo) who's trying to obtain a biological weapon. Captain America (Chris Evans), Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen), Falcon (Anthony Mackie ) and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) are there to stop him and after fighting through his group of mercenaries, they recover the weapon and corner Crossbones. Crossbones tries to detonate a bomb to kill both himself and Captain America. Scarlet is able to contain it but only for a short amount of time. She deflects the blast into a building, saving some but killing others. The media shows the carnage brought on by the blast and it leads to many people calling for the Avengers to face regulation/justice.The subtext of the movie isn't necessarily anything new. It's very much a similar debate that existed in Captain America: The Winter Soldier. Freedom vs. security. But the difference is that it's expanded upon in Civil War. I think the movie does a decent job initially of showing both sides of that debate. Tony's obviously feeling guilty over the events of Ultron and is willing to accept that maybe his judgment isn't infallible overall. Steve meanwhile is still distrusting of oversight after the events of the Winter Soldier. The only gripe I had with the movie is that it doesn't really stay impartial the whole way through. I get it's technically Captain America's movie but the objectivity gets abandoned and it slowly shifts toward pushing you to Cap's side. I was actually on Tony's side for most to if not all of the movie (I don't want to really get into why, form your own conclusions but even if Bucky was brainwashed I don't think he should have just got free reign after what he did, psychiatric care should at least have been the minimum which Rogers won't even let him submit to). I realize that I'm coming from the minority though and compared to most superhero movies, this movie does a great job with the subtext.Next let's get the inevitable comparison out of the way. Yes, I enjoyed this movie much more than Batman v Superman but Batman v Superman wasn't all bad either. While both movies had impressive set pieces and great fights (I think that Civil War has the best superhero fight I've yet to see), I think Civil War does a better job of introducing it's new characters and shying away from shoving the characters it has already developed into type. Wonder Woman and Batman were great and I thought Black Panther and Spiderman were equally impressive here but they were also worked into the story more organically. I also think characters like Captain America and Ironman progress a lot more naturally in this movie as opposed to Superman who was even more unfeeling. To be fair, Marvel has had many movies to set things up where the DCU is just beginning. Lastly, I liked Zemo a lot as a bad guy because he was the opposite of Lex Luthor. He was much more understated, he used manipulation as opposed to force and his objective was completed through clear and concise means.I haven't even touched on the cast, all you need to know is that there isn't a weak link. Evans and Downey Jr. are both excellent, they have been playing these characters for a while and it shows. I also thought Boseman and Holland were great as the big new additions, I look forward to their respective solo efforts going forward. I would also give a shout out to Daniel Bruhl for helping form a solid Marvel villain (admittedly outside of Loki, villains have been a weak point when it comes to Marvel movies).This is one of those movies that had a huge amount of hype and it actually lived up to it. I think this is easily among the top 5 Marvel movies. It gives you the gigantic Cap vs. Ironman fight you want but makes sure there is enough of a plot so you're not hopping up and down till the next action scene. Go see this if you can, I highly recommend it.</fullReview>

This is not the type of movie I want to smash. It's too good. So I like it a lot. I want Chris Evans to be mine and I want to keep his safe. He gets so much crap this movie. His friend does too. But he's not as cute. I want to see Civil War 2. Not Avengers 3. Does that make any sense because it might not. I really hope this kind of movie is what Marvel wants now because it is so much better than the old Marvel movies. I want to see this more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If we're being honest with each other, I can't say I've enjoyed too many installments in the Avengers series since 2011's Captain America: The First Avenger. I mean, REALLY enjoyed them. I liked most of them, but not to the point of needing to rewatch them. The first Avengers film was very enjoyable. And so was last year's Ant-Man. But other than that, it's been growing a bit tiresome.And within the first ten minutes of Captain America: Civil War, I thought it wasn't boding well for this one either. There was a random action scene, which felt more like action for action's sake. We weren't sure why things were happening. It was more self-aggrandizing than anything else.But soon after, we realize it was supposed to be somewhat unimportant. Merely setting up the theme for the rest of the movie.The Avengers are trying to stop some bad guys in Nigeria, but kill some civilians in the process.Afterwards, the superhero team faces a lot of adversity across the entire world. The United Nations issues an act that will oversee and control the Avengers' missions. This divides everyone in the group. Some feel that not fighting every battle they hear of is a waste of their abilities, while others are affected more by the death toll of the innocent.I wasn't expecting the "civil war" to be much more than a verbal conflict, but it escalates pretty badly. You know something really catastrophic is going to happen as a result of this.Halfway through this movie, I've already realized that it's better than most that came before it.Here's why I like it: More than almost any Avengers film, there's no convoluted premise or overuse of impenetrable fanboy references. Everything here is clear-cut. There are no alien races trying to takeover the planet. Nothing here feels like it's beating a dead horse.This film also contains the best cast yet. Chadwick Boseman ups the ante playing Black Panther, as his acting abilities almost seem too good for this franchise. We also get some great character surprises, as well as a few minutes of Marisa Tomei.It's a refreshing mix of each character's personality and wit, without it sacrificing the film's intent or them stepping on each other's toes.Like any of Marvel's Avengers movie, this one has tons of charisma. But it's different this time, because it isn't forced. It becomes top tier in this glorified franchise, and moves into my top 3 favorite Marvel films since the series was launched in 2008--along with Iron Man and the aforementioned Captain America: The First Avenger.It isn't perfect, but it's pretty close as far as superhero movies go.It's also important to note that you should probably know some background on the whole Bucky-Captain America relationship or you might be a little lost. Also, for those of you who've never seen ANY Avengers film, this will probably all be lost on you.Twizard Rating: 98</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unfulfilling movie with unimaginative tropes and one big highlight</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As an intrigued follower of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and after reading several reviews, I had big hopes for this one. Sadly, I got (mostly) disappointed. Let me explain why.Movie Structure This movie has a very simple, uninspired structure. Action Sequence - Serious Talk Sequence - Light Hearted Talk Sequence - Evil Guy Does Evil - Action Sequence 2 - Dramatic Talk Sequence 2 - Light Hearted Talk Sequence 2 - Evil Guy Does Evil 2 until about the 4th repetition. There are no real surprises or even mood changes. Its just a ~30min cycle repeated four times.Character Motivation The main motivation for everything pushing the plot is grief and revenge. More than that, its all grieving widower, parent or orphan. Stark gets all cranky after being confronted with the death of some kid by his mother in Sarkozia which effectively makes him lean towards the supervision. Black Panther gets involved wanting revenge for the murder of his father. The bad guy want revenge for the death of his family and executes it by showing Ironman that the Winter Soldier killed his parents. Not only are those very unimaginative and repetitive motivations, there justification is also every far- fetched. Blaming the Avengers for deaths in Sarkozia is not plausible, as they averted a much greater disaster. But even more, blaming the Winter Soldier for his acts when knowing he was mind- controlled at the time makes zero sense and cannot be justified or explained by "grief rage".The actual dispute "Do we need to accept supervision or not" moves far to the background, with about 10 minutes worth of dialogue, and even that bit of debate mostly returns back to the grief motivations. Consequently, we don't get any satisfying explanations why some hero chose this or the other side and no one can be really surprised once someone changes sides. This would have been a fantastic opportunity for deeper psychological characterization of the Avengers and what type of hero each of them is. A missed opportunity.Fail Villain So the villain is all grieving human instead of immortal god, I get that. But he doesn't work as far as I'm concerned. He just doesn't live up to the combined might of the Avengers. Yea, he doesn't fight them directly, but manipulates them into fighting each other. But aren't the Avengers supposed to be a little smart themselves instead of just emotional wracks that gets played on the strings at the dozens? Shouldn't anyone have suspected something fishy?Even more, the whole plan of the villain is based on gigantic Batman Gamble. The final resolution only works if the exact three characters arrive at roughly the same time at the location of his baiting. But that those characters arrive is, as shown in the movie, dependent on so many uncontrollable elements that the whole plan revolves around a giant piece of luck. Of course, the villain is lucky enough to say at the end "This is all how I planned it". Well, it was a stupid plan and no reason it should have worked.Unsatisfying End The end of the movie was the most unsatisfying of all Marvel Movies I have seen so far. The end fight was the lamest fight of all, with Ironman, Cap and Winter Soldier just brawling for a while. And then, it just ends. Nothing gets resolved. But no one dies, either, so no dramatic impact at all. The Avengers are split in two fractions and that's it. It feels like a bad cliffhanger for a TV show. Alas, I paid 20 bucks to see it in IMAX and you want something more satisfying than "wait what comes next year" as a resolution for that. The movie simply doesn't deliver on its own, and that's a shame, because the plot is very promising.Highlights It wasn't really a Captain America movie and more of a (minor) Avengers movie and I liked that. You got to see a lot of cool characters, even though none of them got the deep characterization they deserved. The biggest highlight was definitely the 20minute fight sequence between the two Avengers teams. It was fun, bigger than life Madness and highly enjoyable. Very well choreographed and great, nerdy dialogue and one-liners. If the movie had more to offer than this great part, it could have been a highly enjoyable experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Winter Soldier is so rad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Often the discussion comes up about what's been the best Comic Book movie? My vote is these 2 Winter Soldier movies, then the Thors, then Xmen First class and Future past. Civil War was as fun as any comic I've ever read. Great direction, the action wasn't too drawn out. There were parts in the last 2 Avengers movies that I just went to bathroom for because they were boring and felt unnecessary. Not a lot of boring filler, family, stuff here. Some. I wanted to see Wanda showcase her Scarlet Witch powers more, and did. The cameos are terrific. A lot of fun despite the severity of the tone. And that brings me to the main thing I liked about it: there wasn't some world ending, galaxy shattering, sci-fi, global domination plot. I think a lot of people prefer grounded, gritty, spy/action stuff. I loved the Thor movies but I'd take submarines and fighter jets over rainbow roads and elves. I'll take robot arms and heroes from Queens over Vikings and games of thrones. Winter Soldier is just my style</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Magnificience by Marvel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the most awaited movies of 2016, I watched this movie in Imax 3d for better experience and damn it was too awesome. The movie was full of superheroes including Black Panther and Spidey. With great plot line and fantastic effects, Civil War exceeded my expectation and didn't disappointed the way BvS did. Star studded movie with fantastic dialogues and actions make this movie an outstanding achievement for Marvels. The only thing missing in the movie was a villain. The movie shouldn't have been a part of Captain America Franchise, rather it should have been next chapter of Avengers considering the Superheroes featured in the movie. Nonetheless the movie was an outstanding experience in IMAX 3D. It is one of the best superheroes ever made by Marvel Studios.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome visuals, acting, and script yet, no good villain (NO SPOILERS)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Characters: The movie shines with really great acting and decent character development considering having many of them. The greatest and most exciting characters are definitely the new comers, Black Panther and Spider-Man. You can see the effort done for portraying both of these characters.Visuals and fight scenes: GREATEST FIGHT SCENES EVER. It definitely beats those in The Winter Soldier and those were PLAIN AWESOMENESS. Every fight scene with Black Panther is especially captivating.Humor: So easy and funny and was very helpful to lighten up the tone of the movie. Spider-Man and Ant-Man are the funniest and you'd expect that. Ant-Man probably had the least scenes in the movie but managed to get many laughs out of me with every line.Plot: Now that's the reason I deducted a point. Civil war is a powerful comic book in terms of story and the movie version didn't live up to that in my opinion. Also, The villain is so poorly written and his scheme is so lame. I couldn't help to think that Cap is more of a villain than him actually :DMusic: Simply not as nearly epic as the movie.Finally: This is definitely the best Marvel Movie ever and I think if they had paid more attention to the story and villain it would have beaten The Dark Knight in becoming the best comic book movie ever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Hulk of the MCU, Civil War is a relentless powerhouse that entertains once the wheels start turning</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The cinematic equivalent to tossing dozens of awesome comic books in a blender with a heavy budget and pouring it out into celluloid, Civil War is not only a superb sequel and improvement to the Avengers films, but just might actually become the best MCU flick yet. And yes, the movie is extremely bloated. Yes, the movie becomes a bit of a downer especially after funnier offerings like Ant-Man and Guardians of the Galaxy. But once the wheels start turning and the conflict shifts into the second act you will be enthusiastically entertained up until the final scene.Civil War is honestly Avengers 2.5, but the half is only in terms of chronological order. In the third Captain America installment, the events from past Marvel offerings has the world afraid of the superheroes, and over a hundred nations want to be able to monitor and control where the Avengers goes and what they should do after an espionage mission gone wrong. This creates a rift between all the heroes, especially with Winter Soldier being a fugitive and another threat lurking within; and differing opinions on how to handle the situation. Civil War's biggest strength is the sheer amount of characters; as they bring back all the Avengers, and then threw in some new additions.Black Panther was flawless in performance, visuals, and execution. Second-billing favorites like Ant-Man, Falcon, Black Widow (who deserves her own movie) and Hawkeye make an appearance and also greatly deliver. Lastly, Spider-Man undoubtedly steals the show and he barely makes an appearance here. After 14 years of cinematic Spider-Man appearances, Marvel truly gets it right this time. Unlike what happened with Age of Ultron (entertaining yet forgettable), you will be excited for future features based off the new characters you meet within the 150 minute timeframe----especially Spider-Man. Sadly not all the Marvel personas get enough screen time, but it's part of the sacrifices made when there is such a long guest list to the motion picture party.The chemistry within the MCU is off the charts, and Civil War raises the bar even higher. What DC films are missing is this key element; mostly because we barely see any character development and consistent cast from sequel to sequel. The interactions between each of the heroes is what really allows this movie to go to the top tier of comic book mayhem, as even Bucky has his moments when involved with the others, especially (surprisingly) Falcon. The complicated relationship between Iron Man and Captain America is front and center, and both deliver spectacular performances as two guilt-ridden heroes desperately trying to avoid conflict even though all signs point to a clash.Helping Civil War maintain its bite is a strong (and rather gloomy) script and flawless direction from the Russo Brothers, who have impressed mightily since their debut with The Winter Soldier. The film honestly has it all: deep themes, lots of loss, plenty of surprises, tons of drama, tons of action, controversial decisions, and a good amount of humor to mix it all together---even though we really could have used more jokes in the first act. The action scenes range from clever to intense to downright entertaining. The Airport Battle will become a part of Marvel movie history, I promise you. The scene will be embedded in your memory if you are a fan of the comics. Then there's the incredible Bucharest Chase that's the best chase since Raid 2. At the same time, the final fight will break your heart.Painstaking amount of effort is given to not only making these characters come to life, but also making them likable and relatable. Marvel does a fantastic job picking the right staff behind the scenes, and does even better picking the actors and actresses to represent the MCU. Combine that with a proper budget and an extremely tight structure that connects all the films together and always leaves room for the upcoming sequels and you have a systematic series of films that resonates with the worldwide audience. Captain America: Civil War is now the peak result of this formula, as this is the first mega Marvel film since the original Avengers to appear to not pull any punches and maximize the content with the pieces allotted.As a comic book fan, there's no way you can walk out disappointed. And as a summer blockbuster fan, you will also have a lot of fun while simultaneously think about the events that occurred long after the final punch is thrown. Civil War is absolutely fantastic, and among the best comic book movies of all-time. DC, you need to watch this and take notes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Marvel installment so far</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the lukewarm Batman v Superman, Marvel restores hope for the superhero movie genre with Civil War. And boy, what an emotional ride this is. We start out in Lagos, Nigeria with the New Avengers battling a group of Hydra soldiers led by Crossbones. Right off the bat we get outstanding action sequences featuring Cap, Falcon, Wanda, and Widow. As crossbones blows himself up, Wanda contains the blast and throws him in the air, however the explosion hits a highly populated building resulting in many casualties. Because of this, the UN comes up with the Sokovia Accords and everyone takes sides. Meanwhile, the villainous Helmut Zemo pulls strings on the avengers to tear them apart even more. The story is gripping and cohesive. There are few plot holes. The only way to find a bad aspect of this film is to really nitpick to find little flaws. All characters are well written and make this film something BvS wasn't: Fun. Marvel brings in comedy, action, drama, and a truckload of emotion. The dynamic between Bucky and Cap is incredibly well-done and you really feel for the characters. Despite there being so many characters on the roster, we still get a coherent story with appropriate screen time for everyone. Black Panther is awesome. He was introduced perfectly into the MCU after Zemo killed his father. Chadwick Boseman's acting talent brings the character justice on the big screen. Every time he shows up it's like "oh crap this guy's back." He is such a powerful and graceful character and has a mystery element that makes me super excited for his solo film.SPIDER-MAN! Tom Holland delivers us a flawless incarnation of the web-slinger the way he should be. Young, nerdy, witty, these are all the things that Spider-man is and weren't completely attributed in the previous spider-man films. Spider-man steals the show every time he's on screen and gives off such a Spectacular Spider-man feel with his incredible humor. His powers are shown very well during the amazing airport scene. I am SO excited for his solo outing next year and think this character is the most perfect spider-man we've ever had.Ban Zemo was just another boring marvel villain. It would've been cool to see him like he was in the comics with his mask and vibranium sword but Marvel just gave us a normal man with a cliché backstory. However, his motives are clear and Daniel Bruhl delivers a fantastic performance, making him superior to Eisenberg's Lex Luthor. Civi War takes the cake and satisfies the whole that BvS left. Marvel really knows how to handle their source material and does so in a highly entertaining masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterfully done superhero movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>REVIEW (Non-Spoiler): Captain America: Civil War is an extra-ordinary feature film that consistently balances all the characters in the film. Every character has a shining moment and the right amount of screen-time. The actors have done a splendid job but few of them had outstanding performances like Robert Downey Jr. as Iron-Man/ Tony Stark, Tom Holland as Spider-Man/ Peter Parker and Chadwick Boseman as Black Panther/ T'Challa. The directors (Russo brothers) have delivered a thriller/drama superhero movie with such an intricate and well- written story, the introduction of new characters has been handled smoothly and doesn't feel forced. Marvel has always been prominent for it's action sequences and it delivers again with Civil War in both the second act and third act fight. The airport fight sequence is one of the best choreographed battle I've seen on a cinema screen and the third act fight is simply outstanding. It is justified, raw, emotional and full of wow moments. This movie doesn't have black and white characters, the audience gets to see both sides and also faces a tremendous difficulty in choosing a side. Both Captain America and Iron Man have logically sound reasons and the right motivation to fight each other. The villains of the MCU have been generally regarded as weak, Daniel Bruhl as Baron Zemo is no exception. The character's development could've been better, there were few areas that could be explored for this character but nevertheless he does a good job. The visual effects are well done but weak in certain scenes. These are some of the minor flaws in this movie. There are incredible twists and turns in this film. On a final note, this film has consistent story- telling, right doses of action and neatly placed humor. It is arguably one of the best Marvel movies and gets better with every viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a little better than Age of Ultron, But I liked it a little more than Batman V Superman. It seems to be the year of heroes vs heroes. I'm surprised it's not called Avengers: Civil War, instead of Captain America, cause like the Avengers it's pretty much a superhero ensemble.Performances by Robert Downey Jr and Chris Evans bring a sense of realism, what makes you understand both sides. Action scenes are special effects are incredibly good, seems to be topping themselves with each marvel film. Everybody else does well too. The battle scenes are quite epic, I mean this really delivers. Although Spider Man who is played by Tom Holland, don't get wrong he is good in the role, but he is brought in not for the sake of the story, but to introduce him in the marvel universe. I'm looking forward to seeing a new Spider Man movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unlike Ultron...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>CAPTAIN America: CIVIL WAR really delivers the goods, giving us a comic book movie with everything a good comic book delivers: a great story, compelling characters and incredible action. Unlike AGE OF ULTRON, this time you really believe the heroes are in real jeopardy, because the ones at their throats are their fellow Marvel brothers in arms. That is the genius of the Marvel Universe Stan Lee, Jack Kirby, Steve Ditko and all the others put together back in the 60's: it's all really one big family, and as we all know, there is nothing more bitter and furious than a family feud. In CIVIL WAR, Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury is nowhere to be seen, and without big brother Nick, all the other siblings in the Avengers have a tough time getting along.The plot hinges on an Avengers operation in Nigeria which leaves a lot of collateral damage, not the first time such a thing has occurred. So when there is a demand that the Avengers submit themselves to the control of the United Nations, there is real dissension in the ranks when Captain America refuses to follow Tony Stark's lead and sign on with the new arrangement. Things take a real turn when The Winter Soldier, aka Cap's childhood friend Bucky Barnes, is revealed to be responsible for a new act of terror; Tony Stark wants to hunt down the terrorist Bucky, while Cap doubts his guilt and wants to discover the real perpetrator. Thus sides are drawn as other members of the team line up with Team Iron Man or Team Cap. Bucky is tracked down in Berlin, and a race is on to get to him first. Before it is over there will be multiple confrontations and a brutal revelation at the end.The biggest thing CIVIL WAR has going for it is the action scenes, which are incredibly well staged with good use of CGI and expert stunt work. The confrontation at the Berlin airport, when both sides really square off had been justly praised as one of the finest fight sequences ever staged; it's over twelve minutes of sheer fun. What is so great about it is that it allows all of the super powered participants to really use their powers to the fullest, as it should be in a super hero movie. It's a huge cast of combatants and everyone gets their moment to shine, some more than others; it truly makes the movie. But for me, nothing tops the chase scene where Bucky grabs a speeding motorcycle in mid air and then mounds it and speeds away; second to that is when Cap grabs a departing helicopter with one hand and holds on to a hand rail with the other, his bulging bicep reminding us just what a super soldier can do. The special effects are never cheesy, even when a certain macro sized hero makes an appearance, an effect that often looks exactly like an effect in other movies.And as usual, the casting in spot on, with the returning Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr. as Cap and Tony, a pair of true brothers who see the world very differently. Evans has always risen to the challenge of making a straight shooting character from the 40's relevant in the 21st Century, never more so here, when takes a stand on conscience and refuses to back down. Downey's Tony Stark is showing the scars of battle and feeling the guilt for some of his actions, but he still has plenty of attitude left. Back are Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Anthony Mackie, Paul Bettany, Don Cheadle, Elisabeth Olesen, and Sebastian Stan in roles that have come to fit them like gloves. And it is good to see Paul Rudd back as Scott Lang/Ant Man.The real bright spots are the newcomers: Chadwick Boseman as the Black Panther and Tom Holland as Spider Man. Boseman does true justice to the African prince, T'Challa, an iconic comic hero brought to life on the screen for the first time. He's a most welcome addition to the MCU.Holland's Peter Parker, is for me, spot on, as this is his first appearance in the MCU after two movie incarnations of his own. Thank God we don't have to do the origin story again as this Peter already has his powers and is recruited by Tony Stark to fight on his side. It's the perfect take on his character, making Peter the nerdy high school kid he was way back in Amazing Fantasy #15. I'm not knocking Toby Maguire or Andrew Garfield, but it's great to have a Peter Parker who clearly having a great time being Spider Man. As for Marisa Tomei as Aunt May, they wisely make a point commenting on the obvious differences between her and the actresses who previously played the part.For me, the final fight between Tony Stark, Captain America, and the Winter Soldier is one of the most brutal things ever in a super hero movie as they go at each other with all their might and skill, no one holds back and for the first time in a Marvel movie, we are not sure how things will turn out. All praise to the Russo brothers, who pick up where Joss Whedon left off and really build on his work, and in the end lays out the groundwork for the next stage of the MCU, where Holland's Spider Man will get his own movie, same for Boseman's Black Panther. As for the future of the Avengers, Thor and the Hulk, (who amazingly, are not missed) are still out there, they could bring in the Secret Avengers storyline; why not some characters from Young Avengers as well?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Little things that matter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So, its almost summer and its MARVEL time! Who doesn't look forward to MARVEL movies these days? They have been delivering quite well in the recent past and they continue to do so with the new Captain America (or should I say Avengers?) movie: CIVIL WAR. One would have seen the trailer and promos and would clearly have gotten the point about the movie's plot. It is war. A war between two of the biggest Avengers, two of the best friends and two contrast personalities. So the movie wastes no time in creating the rift between Tony and Steve Rogers to initiate the 'war' and the remaining avengers split up conveniently in teams wit their differences of opinions on the matter of Avengers killing innocent civilians in their quest for peace. As a matter of fact one would have seen this coming, with hints about minimizing the collateral damage in Avengers, Age of Ultron. So superhero fans, bombing and crashing buildings, throwing cars are not just to boost the action sequences anymore.Although one can argue that the story is a bit out of focus at times while trying to focus only on the rift, the directors produce something brilliant or give out a little hint twist just at the right time. That's why its the little things that matter that lifts Civil War when its down and takes it to another level. If you though the Winter Soldier played his part in Captain America The Winter Soldier think again. Because, this is more of a Winter Soldier movie than the previous one. The film slightly tries too hard to introduce all the new characters and reintroduce old characters but doesn't take anything away in the way it has balanced it all. Chris Evans for me is Captain America all the way. He is so good every time he dons that costume and leads the way. You just can't seem to disagree with whatever the Cap says. Robert Downey Jr has a slightly darker IronMan role this time. Chadwick Boseman is impressive, Paul Rudd is once again exceptionally funny and Paul Bettany as vision is just too cool. Of course cudos to all the other actors portraying avengers as well. It has been a unique and Avenger-esque introduction for Tom Holland as spiderman and I hope MARVEL keeps the same tempo going. Daniel Bruhl is an exceptional actor and he has delivered nothing less in his role as Zemo. It was slightly disappointing to see Martin Freeman's talent waste in a role with the suit. You cannot compare Dawn of Justice and Civil War. Both are movies of completely different tempos. I personally liked both and what makes Civil War click specially, is those little things, those moments that you will only understand if you watch the movie.</fullReview>

Both action packed and full of powerful game changing moments that shake the status quo, this film makes sure the once solid superhero team will never be the same again.The performances are across the board excellent, especially newcomer Tom Holland as Spider-Man. Even Robert Downey Jr, six movies in, gives his best performance as Tony Stark. Civil War does everything that Batman v Superman tried to do, combining great action scenes, and making you care about the characters.

		<shortDescription>Felt like a mid season finale... A REALLY GOOD MID SEASON FINALE</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film served as a "mid season finale" to both the Avengers films, the Captain America Trilogy and the Iron Man trilogy.First and foremost, this is a sequel to Captain America: Winter Soldier. We see a clear impact of the events of the previous film on Cap and influencing very important decisions he makes throughout the course of the film. We also see character arcs coming full circle in the film. Cap's interaction with Bucky, Sam (Falcon), Natasha and the Carter girls really highlights and builds upon the relationships that had been established in the earlier movies.Secondly, this was a sequel to the Iron Man films, as well as to the Avengers flicks. We see Tony's character in a much different state of mind than he was when he was first introduced to us in 2008. We see how each of his actions, in the events in the films that led to this one, have taken a toll on him and made him more somber. We also see some form of resolution and expansion to the relationships he had at the end of Iron Man 3.Scarlet Witch and Vision really helped tie in the Avengers films' story into the story. I felt the interplay between the two was done really well, and the film just established Wanda as powerhouse. She was intimidating and just flat out overpowered. I LOVED every moment she was on screen. One of the best characters in the film. Furthermore, the film also ties in the catastrophic events that occurred during both the Avengers flicks.In my opinion, you need to watch all the Avengers, Captain America and Iron Man films in order to enjoy this film to its fullest and to be invested in the character motivations in the film. But even on it's own, this film rocks. Spider-Man's role in the film was so beautifully handled with love and care. He was the star whenever he was on screen. Spider-Man is essentially Marvel, and Marvel is Spider-Man. Ant-Man had some fantastic scenes. Black Panther / T'Challa just had a presence about him. Chadwick Boseman really highlighted the character's regal decent as well as the warrior aspect. Definitely another epic addition to the MCU. Black Widow was great as always, and by now has solidified herself as a legitimate badass.Overall, this film was brilliant. It had the perfect balance of emotions, humor, grit, and action. The action in this movie was so meticulously crafted, so well handled, I feel that this film is, hands down, one of the greatest action movies ever made. What really elevated the action, were the emotional beats as well as the humor that was peppered throughout the film. It never felt like it dragged on. One slight nitpick, that I do have, is the fact that the ending of the film felt slightly abrupt. I would've liked them to have lingered at some shots, to really let the moment sink in at the end. The villain served a purpose. He was functional for the film. I'd give this film a 9.7/10 You're in for a treat .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing Captain America Civil War I realize the Captain America trilogy is one of the best trilogies that there have ever been. The first avenger wasn't completely loved by everyone, but I enjoyed it very much and it was a great setup movie. Winter Soldier was a unique superhero movie that I thought was outstanding. Now... with Civil War it has done it again as this is emotional and powerful. The action scenes in this movie are jaw dropping. The thing I am most excited for after this movie is the fact that the Russo brothers are doing Infinity War. The focus on all the characters in this movie is done very well, even though there are characters I wanted to see more of, it was still the perfect way to focus on them. Overall, this movie had me on the edge of my seat as there is great focus and exhilarating fight scenes. Every character is this movie is either introduced well (Black Panther, Spider-Man) or has their character built in positive ways. It was hard for me to pick a side, because the arguments were valid and although contrary to many reviews I enjoyed the main villain. There isn't a superhero movie like this one... highly recommended!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Captain America:Civil War was everything BvS wanted to be but Warner Brothers didn't have the patience to let it become.It's tight with a coherent narrative, serious themes and real stakes. It's not concerned with world building because the world has already been built. When heroes come into conflict, we understand the ideological and sometimes personal reasons. Nothing is easily or even completely resolved. More importantly, though, is the fact that we've been with these characters for 13 films now, mostly with the same actors. This heightens the emotional investment. Watching these guys come to blows actually matters because of their long relationship with each other and with us.As far as the core conflict, one of the flaws in the original comics was that there was really only one side you could be on because too many crossover comics had Stark crossing the moral event horizon and basically becoming a villain. In this, you can at least see reason in both arguments, neither side is a bad guy. While Zemo is the ultimate villain of the film, he's really just the catalyst that forces the issues that have been brewing to the surface. This makes the fights that much more poignant. That said, I personally remain firmly Team Cap.For those who have read the original comics version, they've fixed the other problems that plagued it and included some awesome homage moments.Now for some of the fun stuff. Black Panther was excellent, the fights were epic, Spider-man was just right and showed he belonged on the same stage with the rest of these guys. I'm stoked for both their upcoming solo films, and damn Ant-Man is seriously cool in this movie.The Russo brothers have shown that they can handle a large ensemble cast of unique characters with a sprawling story and tell it in a serious tone with just the right amount of comic relief. They have my full confidence for Infinity Wars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best of Marvel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Marvel Cinematic Universe has had some ups and downs. With the last two movies being okay not great how are they going to bring their fans back to their side. Well you make a movie with the directors of the best MCU movie and that revolves around one of the best comic stories written. That is how you get fans back on your side. Now like all of my reviews time to go into both the good and the bad.The Good: The movie first and for most is a Captain America movie. Yes the Civil War aspect is a big part but this is a story about the friendship between Bucky and Cap and how this being put to the test. The introduction of new characters was well done and not forced. The acting was incredible from everyone. Chadwick Boseman as Black Panther was an incredibly bad ass character with impeccable fighting skills, truly incredible stunts. He was a very stoic and a very Jason Bourne character who will stop at nothing to get to his main target. Tom Holland was the best on screen Spider-man that is all I will say. The airport fight scene is one of the greatest action scenes put to screen. The choreography was stellar and the action was all in frame.With each characters ability counter-acting another characters abilities and showing just how destructive these heroes can be. Characters like Hawkeye, Scarlett Witch and Black Widow were all given something to do this film instead of just sit in the background fighting a mini army. The interactions between character was very well done with Peter Parker and Tony Stark, Scarlett Witch and Vision all interacting as if they had known each for years.The Bad: The villain Zemo was a little underdeveloped and didn't do much for the story.Overall Captain America Civil War was in my opinion the best Marvel film and the best superhero movie since The Dark Knight. If you are a fan of action movies, superhero movies, blockbuster movies or good movies in general I highly recommend this movie and I cannot wait to see what the Russo Brothers do with Avengers Infinity War.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The visuals and cinematic feel of this movie is amazing, although a few too many shaky cams so not top grades. The acting is absolutely amazing and the chemistry between the characters is great. Spiderman is fantastic and Elizabeth Olsen show us how great she really is, and Robert Downey Jr. is one of the best actors alive today. Only the Vision I am not so sure off, I was not sure after AoU and not sure now... I hope he is one of the characters that dies in Infinity wars.The story/plot is also very good. You will buy the premise and the stakes are very high. The setup at the end is just brilliant, and although this is a superhero movie, it has more in-common with Winter Soldier and spy thrillers then the Avengers.Entertainment-wise this might be the best ever made. There is always something going on, usually with a great sense of humor, and the movie feels very short because of it. The airport fight scene alone is the best entertainment you will ever see, but personally I believe the last fight is the best of all time. Let me repeat; once you are over the fight at the airport and you go wow and think you will never see anything better, you do.... A perfect score! If you are in it for action and entertainment, you will love this movie!In total a very strong 9. Not quite a 10, I almost never hand out 10s, but this is not far from it. Personally I believe this, all things considered, to be the best superhero movie ever made. After seeing the movie 3 times now I think this surpasses Dark Knight by a hair and is consequently the second superhero movie to make it into my top 20-list of all time. If you go see this in 3D, make sure you sit in the middle. The second time I saw it in 3D was out in a corner and it messed with my head. When I watched this in the packed Theater people were going absolutely bananas. Never seen an audience so totally into a movie before. People forgot to eat popcorn and I heard a few afterward saying they refused to go to the toilet since the movie was so great.Captain America civil war is a must see and if you only have money for one movie this year, this is where you pay up. Great, great, wonderful movie - not just great and wonderful superhero movie, this is a great movie and I would even go so far as to say that this deserve Oscar nominations. Go see it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not a Marvel fan and I don't really care for blockbusters, but I saw Civil War to see if it would maybe change my mind. It didn't. To say Civil War is a bad movie, though, is false. It's not a bad movie at all, it's a good movie, and that's about it, really. Just like most Marvel films - with the exception of Guardians of The Galaxy, their best - directing throughout most of the film is bland, generic, like the camera is there to show what's going on and that's it. Dialogues are shot in the most traditional and tasteless way, exposition is everywhere, editing is irritating and distracting, using way too many camera set-ups because, apparently, they think the average film goer has a 10 second attention span. Not even visually the film pushes any boundaries. There are, though, indeed good qualities to it all: the plot is very good and treated in a straightforward and interesting way, diverging from the traditional Marvel Formula plot we've seen in many movies before but wouldn't be able to hold a film of this size. Apart from that, the true standout here, where the film really is able to be a little more than expected, are the action scenes. Civil War has some of the single best choreographed fight scenes I've ever seen in American cinema, a level I had only witnessed in Korean action films, though most of the action in CW is downgraded by the frustrating Hollywood editing. In the end, even considering all the flaws, it's all very fun, and if you already like these characters, you'll probably love the film anyway.</fullReview>

WATCH ITMight be a minor spoiler... I guess. IDK: -This movie could be a great prologue for a Real Civil War movie. not an Avengers: Civil War movie but a MARVEL CIVIL WAR movie. In the comics Cap, along with some super powed pips, are against the Superhero registration act. They then formed a team and started helping people in secret (like Daredevil who is a part of Cap's team in the comics). Then the fighting and the civil war started. -THEY CAN STILL DO THIS. -They have @Daredevil and The Punisher on TV. They'll have Dagger and Cloak soon. Plus the inhumans in Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. -They could strike a deal with Fox to get the rights for F4 and some X-men characters. -THEY HAVE TO DO IT.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Civil War is a movie that contains literally over a dozen 'super' heroes who end up in conflict when the government wants to contain their powers (basically for saving the planet twice). ? support the government while the other ? protest this action. The next 2 hours of the movie is these groups fighting each other in various ways for unclear reasons, and other than a lot of cities/airports etc getting blown up, very little happens plot wise. The biggest problem is that they are all basically the same no matter which of the dozen or so they actually are. Captain America, the new Black Panther, Bucky, and about another 4 heroes all have virtually the same powers, motivations, fighting styles, and magic weapon (the distinction of course is claws vs a shield vs an arm vs a suit). The next set of about 6-8 are the suit guys who shoot missiles of some sort and fly and are otherwise just trained as ninjas. None of them have any weakness or flaw, they are basically all superman without the laser eyes. Either way, it is all so samey. How many times can Captain America and the Winter Soldier fight before they realize that neither can hurt the other no matter how many times they punch each other in the stomach; and no number of elite seal team soldiers/tanks/planes can stop them from accomplishing their goals however big or small they are. In one inane scene, the Winter Soldier defeats 20 odd elite forces soldiers without breaking into a trot to simply surrender to another small group of soldiers because? I watched this soon after two other super hero movies, Deadpool and Dawn of Justice. While all had their flaws, I felt in Super vs Batman and Deadpool I was watching something new, characters that had.. well, character. I didn't know what Deadpool was all about, and I was curious about how the fight between Batman and Superman would go. I never had this feeling with Civil War ? Iron man vs Captain, a lot of ninja rolls and nothing. Spidy vs Falcon, a lot of ninja rolls and nothing. Rinse and repeat. And all the while the character Vision is basically a God who could do anything he wants at any point and just punches people. I'm not sure why I was so disappointed, I mean I guess that is what a Marvel movie is. Each hero has their one liner, none are in any real jeopardy in a fight because they are all basically immortal, and when one is injured/defeated it just is so much stupider because you have seen them defeat Gods with ease only to be knocked cold by the 100,000,000 punch to the face for no real reason other than the writers need to eventually move on to another set piece action sequence. This movie is disappointing because it is so predictable. I enjoyed moments, the action is loud, and some, but it is shocking how bored I could be with a movie that manages to pack so much into it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's really Ironic that Captain America is fast becoming the most exciting part of the MCU, especially when his origin story was arguably one of the poorest efforts of the cannon.Then The Winter Soldier came out, and added a wonderful conspiracy Paranoia feel to it, just like Three Days Of The Condor and The Parallex View. Plus the action was that to rival Jason Bourne.And now we have Civil War, and although it's a Captain America film predominantly, Iron Man steals the whole thing from under Caps feet.....Pressure mounts to install a system of accountability when the actions of the Avengers leads to the loss of innocent lives. The new status quo divides members of the team. Cap believes they defend humanity without government interference. Iron Man disagrees and supports oversight. As the debate escalates into a war of nerves, The other Avengers must pick a side........After the debacle that was AOU, Marvel had a lot to live up to. Ant-Man was one of the most leftfield origin stories, but it showed that with a little kookiness, and not directly following the winning formula Marvel has, they can do something special.And this is pretty much what they have done with Civil War. Not only have they redeemed themselves for AOU, this is pretty much on par with Winter Soldier as the best MCU film released so far.The much needed humour that was sorely missing from AOU is back, and it isn't just Starks trademark sarcastic wit, Rudd has a wonderful extended cameo as Ant-Man, and he and Holland as the new Spider-Man just make that battle a laugh riot as well as thrilling cinema.But as exciting as the film is, it's one of the most humbling films of all the phases. Boseman excels as Black Panther, and not knowing anything about that character, it was surprising just how interesting the film makes his motivation.With so much going on, you would expect a few to be left out. And that prize goes to Hawkeye. It's a shame though, because I feel that he is the one who has always been given the bum deal in each MCU film he's in. Especially after that introduction in Thor.After the let down that was BVS, Marvel once again shows others how to include so many heroes, have them be an intricate part of the film and the narrative, but not only that, to have a coherent narrative despite all this, and to tie it all nicely at the end.Of all the MCU films, the storyline here has to be the most realistic, as the antagonist is just a human being, grieving for a lost family, and wanting vengeance.A truly excellent film with a stunning third act that is as surprising as having the best Spider-man ever in itEssential</fullReview>

And there have been some pretty great ones (The Dark Knight).The best part about Civil War,the action,considering Civil War is a superhero/action movie with the Russo Brothers at the helm this movie was no doubt going to have some seriously cool action sequences,and they were even better than I expected with Iron Man,Black Panther,and Spider-man,by far the best scene of the entire movie was of course the airport fight,with all the supers fighting the Russo Bros. made it look like it was straight from the comics page by page.(By the way Giant-Man was Amazing!).The summary of his movie,10/10 I say Marvel's best storytelling yet with great action and a lot of good acting by particularly Daniel Bruhl And Sebastian Stan.I suggest this movie to anyone who likes action movies or anyone who likes superheros or both.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Captain America: Civil War is very well done movie especially with action scenes. I mean who doesn't love Chris Evans showing off his muscles? My only issue was that awful white fonts that appears every time we go to a new place or used for flashback. It's distracting and there is far better option for that font to display the location or time. Otherwise, it is good with some annoying aspect of the story plot. It's predictable. Like hey, Iron man and Captain America disagree on political issue of how the Avengers should proceeds. Then Captain America goes off and becomes wanted man because of what he believes in. Tony Stark is stubborn to see his side of thing so he goes become conceited. Boom, there's a huge fight. Yikes, Stark is humbled now because he found out the truth. He goes help out Bucky and Captain America. Crap, he just found out that his parent was killed by Captain America's best friend, Bucky that wasn't even himself. So thus, end in dramatic fight. They are forever divided into two different group- The Avengers on tight rein by Government and The Rebel Avengers who can do whatever they want. Oh wait, there is going to be another movie about the Avengers. That must means Tony Stark will calm down about whole parent thing and calls Captain America for help to fight the huge villain that is about to come. Predictable, I say. If that doesn't happens, HAHA. Oh well, that would be embarrassing for me.</fullReview>

Even though i wasn't too fond of the fact that the team gets divided in the movie, but the ending took all my worries away.It's hard to watch when you haven't seen a lot of the previous movies, since there're a lot of references and names being used. But for a marvel fan it was perfect. The graphics were amazing and the relationships between the characters was perfectly illustrated. Even though I'm still not entirely sure what the exact goal of the villain was, it didn't really bother me. I would certainly recommend it to everyone, but i would also recommend seeing the previous movies before watching this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Captain America's third outing a very good film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Marvel studios has made yet another film that I really enjoyed as they continue to do a really good job telling their story and keeping all their heroes relevant and integral to the ongoing story. That being said, I was somewhat disappointed by this one as well. Perhaps it was the hype surrounding it as I was hearing that it was the best comic film ever and things of that nature. Not that it was a huge letdown, mind you, I am scoring this thing a nine, that is a very good score in my book. I just was expecting this one to get a ten, but as it is I enjoyed it more than the other hero versus hero film released this year, Batman V Superman, it only equaled the enjoyment I got from Deadpool also released this year. Deadpool's budget a bit over 50 million and this one 250 million. I do not know, I just feel it should have blew me away more than it did. Still, it had really good action, the story was pretty good too as they had to come up with a way for the heroes to clash and they did the best they could using the Winter Soldier as the main catalyst for Captain America and Iron Man butting heads.The story has the government wanting to take control of the Avengers due to all the destruction they had caused during the previous movies and an incident in this film that resulted in the deaths of some dignitaries from the country of Wakanda. Of course, if the Avengers had not intervened in New York the world would have been taken over by Loki, Hydra would be killing all those it deemed a threat by way of giant flying gun fortresses and Ultron would have easily wiped out humanity too, but everyone seems to ignore this stuff and the fact the heroes cannot save everyone so Tony Stark is fully on board for the registering of heroes. Steve Rogers is not, but this is not what sets them at odds, but rather the fact his old friend Bucky seems to have set a bomb that kills the king of Wakanda so a world wide search begins. Captain America gets involved as he does not wish to see his old friend killed and soon the heroes will clash as things deteriorate rapidly.The film features many returning favorites as Captain America, Black Widow, War Machine, Iron Man and Hawkeye return. Also, we get to see Falcon, Scarlett Witch and Vision do more in this film. Antman is also in this one and is a nice addition as he added some great comedy to the mix, I just wish he came in sooner. Black Panther makes his debut in a film and is a cool addition and then we also get the debut of Spider-man in a Marvel film and this is where some of my disappointment comes in. I thought now that Marvel had my favorite superhero that we would finally see the best representation of him yet, but while he is okay, they just did not do him justice. He could take any one, on either side of this one on one and could probably beat multiple ones in a fight, but here he literally loses a tug of war with Captain America which to me is just insane! Captain America's base strength is 800 pounds, certainly stronger than most humans. Spider-man's is 10 tons! He can also stick to any object and it was once explained in a comic that no physical force could remove him until he himself decides. Yet he is shown exerting a rather large amount of effort to pull Cap? There should have been no effort or any struggle! They also seemed to ignore his spidey sense pretty much like all the Spider-man films have done, I guess they just feel if your the hero you gotta be a punching bag. I enjoyed seeing him debut, but once again seems like they are not going to do him justice. Seriously, I have a comic where he beats down Iron Man and knocks his armor clean off.So, overall, I enjoyed this film. I did enjoy seeing the new characters and some of the ones that had not really done much up until now do more. Sure, I was not entirely happy with the web slinger, but this just comes from reading so many comics of him and seeing what he can do and fully knowing all his powers. I kind of wish Antman was in this one more as he was the funniest one in the film as up until he arrived the film was kind of a downer with the exception of some Falcon and Winter Solider exchanges. I have heard that there may be another Iron Man film, and I hope this is the case, as I would love to see Robert Downey Jr. do the role at least one more time. I am looking forward to what Marvel offers me in the future as this one was really good, just not quite what I was expecting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Was looking forward to watching this for a while, and enjoyed nearly every last minute of it. The film does very well to set the tone, coming from comical-comedy-action to very serious drama/thriller. The acting is portrayed greatly, although I feel there may have been too many characters for each to fully contribute to the film. Some great action sequences, as well as convincing passionate battles. Also does a great job at delving into moral issues that divide us. The writing was very convincing, great dialogue all-round. Effects were magical, done very well. Great film overall, not my favourite Marvel addition but certainly brings a harsher change to a fun-filled franchise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So good I saw it twice in one day.I have to admit that Cap's story has probably been my favorite to follow out of the Marvel character series. From start to finish, the story lines have been fantastically carried out, and Civil War was no exception. Even though there were a lot of characters packed into it, the movie didn't feel stifling or overcrowded. Each character, I think, was given enough screen time to match their purpose in the movie.The Plot: I haven't read the Civil War comic; I only knew the gist of the story and the issue within. And knowing the issue within, I went into the movie with a bit of bias as to which side of the issue I was inclined to support. As the plot continued to develop and other information was brought to light, however, I found myself a bit more sympathetic to the other side of the issue, even though my stance never changed. That was due in no small part to how wonderfully the movie was paced. We weren't given an overload of information in the first thirty minutes; everything that was involved was slowly unraveled for us, even down to the very last part of the movie. It was a heartbreakingly emotional movie that made you feel something for each of the characters involved.The casting, as usual, was right on point; I was pleasantly surprised with the additions of Chadwick Boseman as T'Challa/Black Panther and Tom Holland as Peter Parker/Spider-Man. I felt they both completely embodied their characters and brought something special to the film. I'm looking forward to seeing more of both of them.Overall, I thought it was an excellent film - visually stunning, riveting story line, superb acting... it even had those wonderful little moments of humor in the form of lighthearted snarkiness and wit. Very rarely do I feel good about spending fifteen bucks on a movie, but this one was so good that I saw it twice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best of the Avengers Films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is probably the best Avengers movie I've seen that's not called The Avengers. Honestly, despite the huge number of Avengers that show up in the film it really does focus more on Captain America and the lengths he's willing to go to in order to protect his friend Bucky, also known as the Winter Soldier. I had a feeling this movie was going to be awesome and it easily delivered in every way. There's plenty of action and laughs to be had but I also thought the story was a bit better this time around. There were definitely a few characters that felt like they were forced in a little bit but everyone is so likable that it's hard not to enjoy seeing them. The Russo Brothers are quickly becoming Marvel's secret weapon when it comes to making awesome films. Let's talk about the story.The movie starts off with a bang as Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), otherwise known as Captain America, and his team of Avengers intercept a chemical weapon from a group of terrorists. Unfortunately, things go awry as the battle results in civilian casualties which forces the United Nations to take a more active role in the administration of the Avengers. This is supported by a large number of the team including Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) who is feeling guilty that his actions and weapons have inadvertently lead to the deaths of quite a few people. The team is split between the two but things really get personal when the Winter Soldier is seemingly involved in a terrorist attack on the UN. Now, Captain America has to protect his friend from Iron Man's group of Avengers by using his own group of Avengers. Chaos and cool action sequences commence.Most of these characters are returning from previous films but needless to say they're still doing a great job with their performances. Chris Evans has always done a great job at the goody two shoes Captain America but I'm also happy to see that Robert Downey Jr. is on top of his game here. I was afraid that he might start phoning it in after so many movies of playing the same character but he continues to give a phenomenal performance. I also really enjoyed the new villain Zemo played by Daniel Bruhl. This guy is conniving and willing to go to any lengths to get what he wants but I ended up feeling sorry for the guy at the end of the film. I'll try to avoid too many spoilers though. Somehow we managed to get even more characters in this film than the previous Avengers movie but it felt like everything moved along perfectly for the most part.Like I said, the film doesn't have too many hiccups but it does seem that Spider-Man was a last minute addition to the movie because it doesn't really feel like he belongs at all. Fortunately, the character, played by Tom Holland, is so likable that it's easily forgiven but the story does deviate for a little while in order to give us a quick rundown of our new Spider-Man. This is in contrast to the way Black Panther was introduced organically and added an important part to the plot. Just a little nitpick but I think Spider-Man easily added more than he took away from the film.I always expect Marvel movies to give us plenty of laughs and decent action but this movie seemed to dial up the storytelling and the action quite a bit. It was incredibly fun to witness all the characters fighting one another in the airport scene but what really got me was the final confrontation of the film. If you've seen it then you know what I mean. This fight was more brutal and heartbreaking than anything else I've seen in a Marvel movie before. I thought it was incredibly well done. As far as the storytelling goes, I enjoyed how both Captain America and Iron Man have decent arguments to back up their positions and it feels like there are actual consequences to this story. I'm eager to see how they eventually kiss and make up.I really enjoyed this new Captain America and I'm eager to see the Russo Brothers give us more craziness on the upcoming Avengers films. I could nitpick this film if I wanted to but it was so enjoyable that I'll just skip all that and give it my wholehearted recommendation. It's easily one of the best Marvel movies yet and it makes the wait for the next one that much more difficult. Next up, X-Men!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The best superhero vs superhero movie of the year (*cough* Batman v Superman was nowhere close *cough*) Following the hugely successful, mini avengers movie Captain America and the Winter Soldier, the Russo Brothers step it up a gear by basically bringing us the next Avengers movie. Or at the very least giving fans a great deal of confidence in the next two official Avenger films.Thor and Hulk (and thankfully Pepper Potts) are nowhere in sight, but its OK because the Russo brothers pull out a whole arsenal of superheroes to fill there place. Although many are literally there to kick the asses of hero's they haven't been formally introduced to yet, its still extremely epic to watch Spiderman, Ant man, Black Panther, Ironman, Captain America, Black Widow, Hawkeye, Vision and Scarlet Witch battle it out while at the same time delaying a lot of peoples flights. Those Heroes never learn.The film is far more than just a superhero movie. It's a thought provoking psychological thriller with a juicy twist near the end. Who's side are you on? Tony's? Steve's? Debates take place on numerous occasions with both sides given the chance to express their point of view. I personally sided more towards Iron Man due to the more selfless reasons for his vote, but I was never 100% behind anyone. Even though this is a Captain America film, we as an audience are positioned more alongside Iron man, unveiling the truth as he does and even learning so much more about his character than the title character. This may have been called Captain America Civil War but it's Ironman who the film is really about.The motives of the characters are much more emotional than they have ever been before, making this the most human MCU movie to date. Whether its the almost sibling rivalry of Steve and Tony or Daniel Bruhl's back story, everyone has a personal motive which just adds to the tension and drama, gripping you to the characters and the action they encounter.The Action was good. The Airport fight scene is where the whole film has been crafted around and it pretty lengthy too, every hero gets a decent amount of screen time making it a really satisfying sequence to watch. Some sequences were a bit quick especially if in more claustrophobic settings but that's more of a harsh nit pick to be fair.My only real issue with this film was its villain(s). Although I had no problem with Daniel Bruhl as a villain its more how on earth he got access or knew about anything which I'm sure would have been top secret? Being a normal guy who lost everything due to the events in Sokovia, there is little explanation as to how he was able to do the things he did, I guess he's just really really really well connected.Daniel Bruhl is a great actor and all but the fact that the main villain is just an average guy is a little underwhelming even if it does pose an interesting reminder that the Avengers are not worshipped by all. Frank Grillo's Crossbones looked awesome and would have been a great villain... But he is sadly wasted in the film. It's a real Smaug in The Battle of the Five Armies scenario. He doesn't even last 10 minutes.Overall, the Russo's have done it again. Captain America Civil War ends the Captain America Trilogy on a high making it one of the best superhero trilogies/ series ever. This political psychological thriller reminds our heroes the human cost of war and brings in new dimensions to characters we love, whether its via film or comic book. I have full faith in the Russo's as it has been made clear to us that Infinity War is in good hands.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An appearance of many Marvel figures.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>-Captain America: Civil War is a 2016 American superhero film featuring the Marvel Comics character Captain America, produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures. It is the sequel to 2011's Captain America: The First Avenger and 2014's Captain America: The Winter Soldier, and the thirteenth film of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The film is directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, with a screenplay by Christopher Markus &amp; Stephen McFeely, and features an ensemble cast that includes Chris Evans, Robert Downey Jr., Scarlett Johansson, Sebastian Stan, Anthony Mackie, Don Cheadle, Jeremy Renner, Chadwick Boseman, Paul Bettany, Elizabeth Olsen, Paul Rudd, Emily VanCamp, Tom Holland, Frank Grillo, William Hurt and Daniel Brühl. In Captain America: Civil War, one year after the events of The Avengers: Age of Ultron, an act regulating superhuman activity fractures the Avengers into opposing factions, one led by Steve Rogers and another by Tony Stark.-Development of Civil War started in late 2013 when Markus and McFeely began writing the screenplay, which borrows concepts from the 2006 comic book storyline Civil War. The Russo brothers were brought back to direct in early 2014 after positive reactions to test screenings of The Winter Soldier. The film's title was revealed in October 2014 and Downey was added to the cast, with additional cast members joining the film in the following months. The film began principal photography in April 2015 at Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayette County, Georgia and the Metro Atlanta area, before concluding in Germany in August 2015.--Critical response-The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 94% approval rating based on 83 reviews, with an average rating of 8/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "Captain America: Civil War begins the next wave of Marvel movies with an action-packed superhero blockbuster boasting a decidedly non-cartoonish plot and the courage to explore thought-provoking themes." Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 81 out of 100, based on 17 critics, indicating "universal acclaim".-Justin Chang of Variety called it "the most mature and substantive picture to have yet emerged from the Marvel Cinematic Universe." Sheri Linden of The Hollywood Reporter said, "Call it 'civil war' or call it brand extension; call it a 'cinematic universe' or a corporate behemoth - the latest Marvel extravaganza furthers the studio's cross-pollination of action franchises in a way that's sure to satisfy devotees." Robbie Collin of The Daily Telegraph wrote, "This is the cinematic superhero showdown you've dreamt of since childhood, precisely because that's everything - and all - it wants to be." Catherine Shoard of The Guardian called it, "a huge aspartame rush of a film: a giant irresistible snack, not nutritious, but very tasty. --Future-According to Feige, Civil War is the conclusion of the Captain America trilogy that began with The First Avenger. While it is the final standalone Captain America film in Evans' contract with Marvel Studios, Evans stated in September 2015 that he was open to extending his contract past the two-part Avengers: Infinity War, the final films on his contract at the time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The MCU has grown up and is tackling mature themes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is by far the MCU's darkest and mature film. The action has become more gritty, realistic and violent. The acting has gotten more serious with some humour thrown in for comic relief. Themes are no longer childish and involves terrorism, death, betrayal, politics and vengeance. The writing no longer panders to children, but to all demographics. Overall, the quality has improved drastically from previous MCU entries in writing, acting, direction and technical aspects. However, the film isn't dark and serious like Nolan's Batman because it sticks to its comic book roots and is able to distinguish itself, and not become generic. This is up there with The Dark Knight and Spider-Man 2 for best cbm ever made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Without any question this is the best Marvel movie ever made. Its perfect paced with emotional parts, dark parts, funny parts and the thriller elements. The action looks just awesome and the new characters are SO good i can't tell you how good they are. I'm totally happy with the end of this perfect movie and i think infinity war is in good hands.The sad part about it... The DC fan boys show us their character with the 10% 1 star ratings. I saw a user who rated Civil War with 1 star and BvS with 10 Stars and the best thing about it is that he writes about the Marvel fan boys in his CW review...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inedible plot accompanied with barbarism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If I am the one who opposes to Captain America: Civil War out of thousands of other cinematography fanatics, and even I was an easy- goer in the beginning, then I am not going to let my guns down. I was utterly disappointed with the whole plot errors. The previous two films were roaring success for other to follow its pattern. However, this one just pales into comparison with the others. Captain's actions from all the start was sheer apology in an ironical way (which did not work, sadly). What he did was to defend against what he did, and even if he was above the law, then combating with Iron Man in such fatal manner was the sign of barbarism. Regardless of the ingenious plan of Zemo, his reaction was, in a way, inhuman. I could not understand how could one succeed in his plan to separate the Avengers would like to kill himself after an old recordings of his families? Is he feeling guilty, then why he stated in the near end of the film "did it". I feel so sorry for people who goes for Captain America, but this time what he did was inhumanely repulsive and reverent. Iron Man was deeply bruised all over his mental well-being after seeing his team separated, seeing the horrible tape. And guess who did all these stuffs that may have been avoided by a discussion? The one who got his name in this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was a bit apprehensive based on all the negative reviews and went to the movie without any get expectations, just to kill a Saturday evening. But I was pleasantly surprised. Captain America Civil War is a decent movie and deserves a 7 star rating. By far it was the best Hollywood flick I saw in the past 3-4 months I guess.There is a story, a twist, some good witty dialogues and a cameo by Marisa Tomei too.If you have no other great movies lined up to see, then Captain America Civil War will help you pass 2.5 hours with some light and quality entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No movie is perfect, but this was close</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was warned before going to see this movie by friends that it "wasn't what it was hyped up to be" and for them it was kind of a let down. While I agree that this movie wasn't perfect, I have to say that I absolutely loved it. I'm a big marvel fan and this met my expectations for the most part. I went into the film, firmly on "team cap" and left entirely neutral. Black Panther was amazing! He was the best part of the movie. I'm all the more excited for his upcoming film. He was a wonderful character, very well acted and the groundwork laid in Civil War for his movie is encouraging. Adored Tony's character. I was surprisingly frustrated with Cap throughout the movie. Loved Sam and Bucky; please get these guys their own movie. I could have done without the Sharon and Steve romance. Frankly, I was really grossed out by it. You can't kill of a guy's former love interest, reveal his new love interest is in fact related to the former love interest, and have guy and the new love interest get together in the same movie. It was just very forced and awkward. Actually, I got the impression that the writer's viewed Sharon and Peggy as interchangeable. "Sure,the girl who you loved just died but hey, no worries, cause here is her totally hot niece who is just like her". It didn't help that the actress and Chris Evans seem to have little chemistry if any, something that carried over from 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier'.Needs some tweaks, but otherwise, great movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sometimes, We Can't All Just Get Along</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So far, the first star-studded blockbuster of the summer is on the receiving end of more backslapping than the Avengers are fists to the face ? which is saying something. And, as someone who whole-heartedly agrees with much of the effusive praise coming in, I'll do my best to preserve the experience by limiting plot reveals and potential spoilers when sharing my thoughts.The backdrop of the film is actually pretty straightforward (and all in the trailers, so this isn't much of a spoiler): over the course of their existence (and several films), the Avengers have left a wake of collateral damage as they try to save the world from increasingly formidable threats. Following the events of Avengers: Age of Ultron, world governments are pushing for the ratification of the Sokovia Accords ? an international law that would limit the unilateral actions of the Avengers.There some on the Avengers, led by Tony Stark aka Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), who are ready to accept the limitations, both to possibly lessen guilt for past actions and to stave off a worse alternative. As I'm sure you've guessed there are others, led by Steve Rogers aka Captain America (Chris Evans), who see the accords as political interference that is potentially damaging to the effectiveness and morality of the Avengers.This division is just the beginning of the rift.Captain America has always been the straight-as-an-arrow superhero, sticking to his metaphorical guns and remaining fiercely loyal to his friends. Unfortunately, that includes Bucky Barnes aka the Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan). The victim of Hydra brainwashing and a perceived enemy assassin, Bucky becomes a sticking point that only drives a wedge further between Cap and Tony.As the conflict, driven by a mysterious new player, comes to a head, the rest of the Avengers are forced to side with either the man in the suit or the man with the shield.At this point I'll ask: can't we all just get along?In short, no ? but for good reason. What sets Captain America: Civil War apart in the superhero genre is its willingness to get its hands dirty on a more human level. The film really digs into painful character memories and creates all new friction, testing the bonds of friendship, romantic relationships, and so much more.The reason this is technically a Captain America film and not another Avengers? I'd say mostly because Cap is central to the biggest tests. Cap and Tony. Cap and Bucky. Cap and Carter. You get the idea.With so many characters and an endless supply of action packed into two and half hours, the film (and attempting to review it) can seem daunting. But to their credit, the Russo brothers were up to task.Having previously directed the widely regarded second Captain America film Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Anthony and Joe Russo only reinforced their reputation as some of the best in the genre, artfully blending fisticuffs with feelings. Writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely also returned (having worked on both of the first two Captain America films), lending the continuity, storytelling style, and occasional levity that fans have come to identify with the Captain America franchise.Somehow I've grown long-winded with nary a mention of the slew of new characters. The biggest introduction of the bunch is the cinematic launch of T'Challa aka Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman). A skilled warrior from the technologically advanced African nation of Wakanda, T'Challa is forced to take sides following an encounter with the Winter Soldier (even though he's not an Avenger). We're also reintroduced to Peter Parker aka Spider-Man (Tom Holland), with Marvel opting to use a younger version of the character to great success. Much more a kid, complete with a kid's sense of wonder and view of the world, Holland's Peter Parker offers some well-timed levity. Not to be forgotten is Daniel Brühl's Helmut Zemo, but I'll let you meet him yourself.As for the rest of the cast, extensive though it is, everyone has their own special story arc to avoid being lost in the fray. Natasha Romanoff aka Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) continues to be the most pragmatic and cool character on screen, which is no doubt part of the reason Marvel has finally committed to giving her a standalone film. Sam Wilson aka Falcon (Anthony Mackie) remains the steadfast Cap supporter, ready to blindly trust his friend. Similarly, on the other side, Rhodey aka War Machine (Don Cheadle) is ready to make the sacrifices necessary to stand by Iron Man and the government. Clint Barton aka Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) is ever the wildcard, and Scott Lang aka Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) is ever the understated comic relief.*Potentially very mild spoiler ? feel free to skip this paragraph until viewing* I mentioned earlier the Cap and Carter relationship test, which pitches Sharon Carter (Emily VanCamp) into an interesting position, but one of the most intriguing relationships is that of Vision (Paul Bettany) and Wanda Maximoff aka Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen). When we last left Vision in Avengers: Age of Ultron, there were still more questions than answers. Mainly, he's not human, but what does this really mean? He's some type of being, and he's undoubtedly powerful and hyper-logical, but does he experience things the same way as a human? Does he have emotions? This issue is explored in regard to Wanda, whom he feels a connection with ? even protective over ? as someone unsure of their own powers. Because although Wanda proves herself quite powerful, she too is still figuring out what her power means. ***A quality film overall and among the best in the genre, Captain America: Civil War is a must-see for fans. Just keep in mind: whose side are you on?</fullReview>

In addition to what you'd expect to this kind of "action" movie, the characters have a depth that is very palpable adding a psychological side to the story. The screenplay is nicely tied up, the action scenes very well choreographed and there is an amazing chemistry between the ensemble cast. Great acting too, the characters were spot-on! This movie is not your average good versus evil movie. It's much more a fight between ideologies which was really interesting to see. You see the Avengers split into two different sides and it is interesting to see the complexity behind their respective approach toward saving the world. I love the Marvel movies and this one is by far my favorite.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Russo Bros Does It Again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Captain America: Civil War is the 13th film in the MCU. It stars the cast from Avengers Age Of Ultron and The Winter Soldier, Paul Rudd from Ant Man with newcomers Tom Holland, Chadwick Boseman, and Daniel Bruhl as Spider-Man, Black Panther and Baron Zemo respectively. Once again the Russo Bros did a fantastic job with film and is definitely in my top 10 best MCU films of all time. However, like all other movies, it isn't perfect and had some flaws. But before I get discuss those flaws here are the pros: 1. Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr gave the best performance as Cap and Iron Man, respectively. The conflicts between the two was well developed and I was really invested in them. And the ending...my god...the way Tony was angry at Cap and Bucky after Zemo showed a footage of Bucky killing Tony's parents years ago was freaking amazing. The ending fight scene was the most dark and serious moment I have ever seen in the MCU.2. Tom Holland is hands down the best Spider-Man/Peter Parke. I had a huge smile on my face whenever he appears. His humour and energetic personality were spot on. Now I am really looking forward to his film.3. Chadwick Boseman was amazing as T'Challa/ Black Panther. His accent was also spot on and every time he appeared, he stole the show. Definitely excited for his film now.4.Paul Rudd was also great in the film and just like in Ant-Man, he never ceased to amaze me. When he became Giant-Man my jaw dropped and I almost squealed in the theater.5. The story line was also well done and had one of the best character arcs in comic book movies.Now here's the con: 1. I didn't have a lot of expectation for Baron Zemo as Ultron from AOU left a bad taste in my mouth and considering how most of villains in the MCU films were generic or crap (with the exception of Loki and Red Skull) I didn't know what to except from him. But after watching the film I will say this: he was way better than Ultron and Mandarin but he was very underwhelming. For example, every time he intimates someone, he didn't feel threatening and looked more of an average guy trying to threaten and rob someone but fails horribly. I just think that Daniel wasn't given enough strong source material to make his villain shine. Also his reason for why he pitted Cap and Iron Man against each other was cliché at best. (His family death made him hateful towards the Avengers. Haven't we seen that type of reasoning done so many times already? C'mon Marvel, be more original) Hopefully, Marvel improves his characterization and make him more menacing. It's high time they step up with their villains.2. Their were some moments when the jokes kinda disturbed the momentum of scenes that were serious. Their were other jokes that fell flat; particularly Falcon's.3. I know this might seem very minor to people, but the whole big, white text was stupid. Every time the movie shows a setting in a country, it always display the name of those countries in this format. Whoever thought this was a good idea during the making of this film needs to be fired from the Marvel Studios.Despite these problems, I still a great time with the film and I am really excited for the future films of the MCU.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Captain America:Civil War is an excellent superhero flick,with a nice story and awesome action sequences with a powerful editing.Story:With many people fearing the actions of super heroes, the government decides to push for the Anti-Hero Registration Act, a law that limits a heroes actions. This results in a division in The Avengers. Iron Man stands with this Act, claiming that their actions must be kept in check otherwise cities will continue to be destroyed, but Captain America feels that saving the world is daring enough and that they cannot rely on the government to protect the world. This escalates into an all- out war between Team Iron Man and Team Captain America while a new villain emerges.The movie has several entertaining moments and not a single dull moment,which keeps you intrigued throughout the entire movie.The direction is excellent.The screenplay is water-tight.The editing is powerful.The action sequences was just awesome.Performances:Though the movie relies heavily on the shoulders of Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr.,but th the scene-stealer here is Tom Holland,whose portrayal as Peter Parker gives a new yet entertaining image to Spiderman.He is truly wonderful.Chris Evans is excellent,while Robert Downey Jr. is efficient. Scarlett Johansson,Sebastian Stan,Don Cheadle,Jeremy Renner,Anthony Mackie,Chadwick Boseman,Elizabeth Olsen(who looks absolutely stunning) and Paul Rudd lend excellent support to the cast.Overall Captain America:Civil War is an excellent treat for all superhero flick fans.A Sure-Shot Blockbuster.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How to make a superhero movie 101</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If Captain America: The Winter Soldier wasn't enough proof that the Russo brothers are some of the most capable superhero movie directing of our time, this is. Captain America: Civil War is possibly one of the best directed superhero movies ever made. The story is very well thought out and does justice to the characters, while simultaneously developing said characters beyond what we've seen of them in previous movies. It's surprising that even though this is the fifth movie starring Chris Evans as Captain America, there still seems to be things we can learn about him. I was never the biggest Captain America fan, and as I went in to the cinema I was decidedly on Iron Man's team, but you cannot help but feel very conflicted between the two from start to finish. The Russos' keep you gripped for the entire movie, and there really isn't a dull moment. Perhaps that's because of the constant flow of action sequence after action sequence, which felt overwhelming at times (pretty much every ten minutes or so another giant fight took place). However in my eyes this was undoubtedly the best action in any superhero movie (the sequence in the airport is nothing short of mesmerising), from The Avengers to The Dark Knight. The story is also surprisingly thought-provoking, as it not only explores themes never before seen in a Marvel movie but also continues to show the Russos' talent for storytelling. What Civil War does particularly well is manage the great cast of characters it has, both new and old. This has often been a problem in previous Marvel movies, for example both Avengers movies always kept some characters sidetracked. However there was none of that here, and each of the many, many characters in this movie had some very memorable moments. Past supporting characters such as Vision and Falcon were given lots of time and energy, although ultimately once again it was Captain America and Iron Man who took the spotlights. This movie is really a sequel to 2014's The Winter Soldier, and was heavily focusing of Sebastian Stan's Bucky, and his relationship with Captain America. The main new editions to the cast, Black Panther and Spiderman, were thoroughly well-written, fantastic characters that by the end you will be very excited for their upcoming movies. Tom Holland did a great job as the most realistic, grounded Peter Parker we have ever seen - suddenly everyone is glad they didn't bring back Andrew Garfield. Although for me, Black Panther was the most interesting and the character I enjoyed watching the most, due to his fantastic place in the story and of course Chadwick Boseman's great portrayal of the character. The only other person really worth mentioning was Daniel Brühl's Zemo - a surprisingly well fleshed-out villain who instantly surpassed any of Marvel's other (usually very forgettable) villains. Forget Batman Vs Superman, is the true movie that the fans wanted.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfect movie to kick start Phase 3! This is it people!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Marvel first announced they will be adapting Civil Wars for Cap 3, many fanboys out there like myself were completely blown away by the very idea of Captain and Iron Man fighting each other on the big screen! While I was very excited, I can't help feeling skeptical about it as many of us were worried that it might become an Avengers 2.5 rather than a Cap centered story. Marvel certainly didn't disappoint, in fact it is the perfect movie to kick start Phase 3! Continuity is getting more and more important in the ever expanding MCU. Cap 3 serves as a direct sequel to both Winter Soldier &amp; Age of Ultron. Unlike Age of Ultron which in a way ignore the events of Iron Man 3 &amp; Thor 2, it builds on top of the events from all previous films. Many people complained that these movies are no longer just about the titular character instead it is now very common to have an ensemble cast. After all this is the idea of a shared universe right? Spoilers aheadThe film started off in 1991 where the Winter Soldier was sent to intercept an automobile carrying a case of super soldier serum and assassinate its occupants. We all know that it is Howard Stark as it was pretty much hinted in Cap 2 when Zola said "when history did not cooperate, it was changed. Accidents happen." Of course this was shown during the climax of the film. We then fast forwarded to modern day Lagos where the Avengers were on a mission to prevent Rumlow (Crossbones) from stealing the biological weapon which devastated a nearby building, killing a number of innocent people. I didn't like the treatment towards his character, felt like a waste really. Despite the dramatic entrance, he was only there for 5 minutes and only to be seemingly killed. Hopefully this won't be the last of him, he "temporary" killed Cap in the comics! Just want to add on here, if I am the editor of the film, I would actually start off the film with Rumlow which builds up intensity of what's coming later similar to how Cap 2 started with the rescue mission in the Lemurian Star. Back in the Avenger's headquarters, US Secretary of State Thunder Ross informs the Avengers that the UN is preparing to pass the Sokovia Accords which will establish an international governing body to oversee the Avengers. Welcome back to Thunder Ross, we last heard from him in the Incredible Hulk which I am not sure if it is still considered canon. The team is of course divided where Tony Stark supports oversight because he feels responsible for creating Ultron and the destruction of Sokovia, while Rogers has more faith in his own judgment than the governments after what happened with SHIELD. This officially kicks start the ideological battle between Cap &amp; Iron Man, similar to this year's Batman v Superman except this was carefully planned out since the first Avengers back in 2012. Black Panther and Spider-Man are the latest addition to the MCU, not only they were able to steal the spotlight from Cap, they are actually integral to the story (more for Black Panther). Together with Marvel, Sony is finally able to do Spider-Man justice by casting Tom Holland as the young Peter Parker. By now I am sure audience are getting tired of seeing all the origin stories so Cap 3 was the perfect way to set up these new characters. The story of Captain America is one of honor, bravery and sacrifice. It started from how he became the world's first super soldier who fought in WW2 to a man out of time, struggled to be relevant again in the modern world after being frozen for 70 years and only to be betrayed by SHIELD, the only people he can relate to. The Russo brothers were able to redefine Cap's character and had us emotionally invested into these films. It is also the perfect way to close out the story arc for Cap and I am genuinely looking forward to what they have installed for us in the Infinity Wars.</fullReview>

The stunts were great especially the airport fight deserves special applause even though it is more of a cliché but again the director makes it rollicking . And coming to Chris Evans ,I believe no one could ever impersonate Captain America better . he always gives us the good honest guy feel and does what he feels is right. On the whole civil war is an wonderful experience for any fan who loves superhero movies and who doesn't like it when two of the favourite heroes clash against each other when the film is made this good</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hi this is Sachin, I'm not gonna bore you with my lengthy plot so I am making it short. So whether you want to go with the storyline or acting or CGI this movie won't make you think that you wasted your money,Don't know how they find their directors who make the Marvel's comic franchise most watched and most profitable movies of the year whenever they are released, next movie Avengers the infinity war is really in good hands. We watched Ironman aka Robert Downey Jr. peak performance acting in most of the Marvel's movie he still acted very well in civil war movie but it is Cap and Spidy (Tom Holland),who steal the show.As we all know that there is another boom entry of Black Panther(Chadwick Boseman), through this movie which was adequate. Synopsis: When the government introduced the system of accountability where every Avenger would come under UN supervision as they wanted to,but decision was confronts by Captain America(Chris Evans) and wants to every avenger should free from this system,but from opposite side the Iron man (Robert Downey Jr) had great feeling to stay with that system,so when the issue was mounted ultimately which created a rift between Cap and Ironman,and dragged them to collateral damage.I recommend you should buy ticket without any hesitation.I'm giving 8 out of 10 to this movie for astonishing CGI and action Scenes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>War ? It's kind of funny (but not really) how the word "war" pops up and everyone gets a little on the fidgety side. It's like something is wrong every time when war strikes and all hell breaks loose. That's in our world. That's in our society. But we don't live in the fantasy mind of Stan Lee. We were taught that war or violence, for that matter, solves anything. (Yes, this is how I wanted to start out with this review.) In 2011, we were introduced to a young man who lived in Brooklyn with nothing more than the shirt on his back ? Steve Rogers. All he wanted to do was to fight the bad guy. He got his shot when he was recruited by S.H.I.E.L.D. to become the first superhuman fighting machine, to bring down a ruthless enemy who was plotting an evil that could break the mold of extinction.In 2014, (just 3 years later), Captain America was synonymous, in the very sense of the word in the hearts and minds of every American. That same evil that he fought as The First Avenger, has now infiltrated the government of the United States of America and corrupting the world system.In 2016, we thought we got rid of Hydra, but we were dead wrong. The very existence of the organization was to wipe out the world so they can take over and plot against the Avengers. Over the course of a few years' time, Hydra has stopped at nothing to plot against the existence of mankind. In Captain America: Civil War, we see two sets of teams ? the government team vs. the heroes. I am not going to say too much about this movie except this ? WOW!!!! That's the word I am looking for. Led by an all star-studded cast ? Chris Evans and Robert Downey, Jr. lead a cast of incredible talent that could make the world think twice of waging war against one another. It was all because of a little brainwash. (Oops, said too much already).Joe Johnston who started all of this was just the beginning, but when the Russo brothers (Anthony and Joe) took over ? well let's just say that they took this series to a whole new level.Now, if you have not seen this new movie, then I will not spoil it for you, but I will say this stay a little after, because there is a post-credits scene that you do not want to miss.All-in-all, Captain America: Civil War exploded! And it will continue to explode.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not going to spoil anything on this review, because it is best to go and watch this movie without knowing anything. Bear in mind that it's a long movie, but it never lets your interest flow away, not even for a second. Now, for the review: Plot: Not a single complaint. The story catches up from The Winter Soldier and Avengers: Age of Ultron, and tries to tie up what happened to the Winter Soldier, uncover some things about his past, which weren't shown too much in the previous Captain America movie, and show the devastation that the events in Age of Ultron left behind. Every character has his story and reason behind their final decision to side with either Iron Man or Captain America, and they never deviate from them. Everyone has a part, and the movie ties them all in a splendid, seamless way. Cinematography: You'd think you were in the fights and conversations yourself, right beside the characters. Many different places are used, and they all contribute to the general drama/action feeling of the movie. Every fight is just amazing, more so than the Avengers.Acting: Flawless. From everyone. Especially Sebastian Stan, Anthony Mackey, Chadwick Boseman and the ever amazing Robert Downey Jr. I was really glad that the Russo brothers did not use RDJ in a way that would eclipse the other characters. Daniel Bruhl is a chilling Zemo, driven solely by vengeance, and even though he's not the true villain of the movie, he is definitely the catalyst behind the Civil War.Make no mistake; this is a Captain America movie. It revolves around Cap, his relationships and the aftermath of the decisions he takes when it comes to his closest friend. However, it is done in such a way that you are not fed up by him, or any character. This is a humorous, action packed, plot driven movie, that raises the Marvel bar even higher.10/10 is not enough for this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Charming of Captain America Civil War</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Captain America is most charming for its calmer moments, and for its more personal embellishments, similar to Scarlet Witch's capacity to make modest tongues of fire jump from fingertip to fingertip, or even only the way Evans' Captain America, solidified in the '40s just to be defrosted in a peculiar, present day world, dependably watches a little groggily strange, as though he'd truly want to listen to Sinatra. What's more, there's a sublime new expansion, Chadwick Boseman's Black Panther, an African sovereign turned confounding crime fighter. As both man and feline, he's patrician and cleaned, a touch of class cushioning discreetly onto the scene. Like him, Civil War, taking care of business, is blessedly light on its superhero-booted feet.Watch the movie and enjoy your time. Please visit http://moviecaptainamericacivilwar.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>MCU at its BEST</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Its the best M.C.U movie ever created. Russo Brothers have done it once again. Properly interwoven which has ultimately resulted in a visual as well as intellectual wonder.To sum up, it's a MUST WATCH. It was the one of the best in the Avengers franchise. I can't wait for Doctor Strange, Infinity War 'cause it will set up a new world for the M.C.U. According to me, the movie should have been released only in 2D &amp; IMAX. Other than a few popping-out-of-the-screen moments, the 3D does not add a lot to it. But once again I will recommend you fans from MARVEL as well as DC that it is one of the best superhero movie ever made.N.B:- Deadpool is some other thing, don't compare with it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Avengers: Infinity War is in safest hands.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Civil War was nearly flawless. The Russsos did a great job with the combination of sub-plots that were leading to the main plot of the film. A glimpse of overall character backstory and brief introduction for Black Panther and Spider-man was well-done. Every single character deserved a decent amount of screen time, with Bucky's arc and character development being one of the significant elements that led to the string of events that help triggered the tension between Steve and Tony. Steve and Bucky's reunion was the heart of the film and the Russos managed to use that to fuel the fire between all the other characters from both opposing teams, which led to the war. The fighting sequences were extremely flawless and one of the main strong components of the film because they were something that I've never seen before. The highly-anticipated airport scene was so much fun to watch and it really showed how strong characters like Scarlet Witch and Spider- man were because their abilities manage to surpass others at certain points. The only thing I slightly disliked was how Steve and Sharon got together, I just felt like the timing was somewhat inappropriate. However, Steve and Natasha's relationship was what intrigued me instead because you can really see how much they've grown together as a duo from the previous films and it didn't feel foreign at all. Also, I felt like the overall portrayal of Baron Zemo was spectacular, he is probably one of the most sympathetic yet malicious villains Marvel has put out so far and I honestly can't wait to see more from Daniel Bruhl.You might pledge your allegiance to a specific team but after seeing the film, you will probably re-think about which side you've chosen and see the characters, especially Steve and Tony from a different perspective. The post-credit scenes will also give you a glimpse of how much impact Bucky and newbies Black Panther and Spider-man will bring to future Phase 3 films. Overall it was a great film, 11/10 for me. Highly recommend to watch it twice to fully absorb what goes on in the film. After watching this, you'll automatically know that Infinity War is going to be phenomenal.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked most parts, especially the plot, the cast, the characters, the visuals and the spectacular action sequences. Indeed, I was blown away by some action scenes. We are dealing with incredible CGI and good fight choreography. And we did not see the best parts in the trailer. I love that. The mood was fitting and the humor toned down a bit (fewer one-liners than in AoU. I loved that the movie seemed to address every single movie in this universe. I cared about the conflict and felt invested. Even though the movie was ridiculously long, it was intense and exciting.But a few things made me cringe. Ant-Man, Black Panther and Spider-Man felt shoe-horned (people are right to say this) into the movie in a shameless way; it was all so superficial. Scarlet Witch, Hawkeye and Vision were as awful as ever.The actual civil war bit was also a tad disappointing. It felt obvious that none of the heroes were in any real danger, and that none of the combatants were trying to harm each other seriously. Yes, some of them gets hurt - but we can never fully view this as actual damage done with intent. Not until the very end did I feel that someone could easily die from this situation; and even then news of future movie releases had spoiled who will NOT die. The MCU has again spoiled the fun for the viewers by announcing upcoming movies too soon.The conflict between Rogers and Stark was believable. Even though I was hoping for a different outcome to the final conflict, I didn't feel cheated.Like I said, seven out of ten. It is a reasonable grade. I will probably acquire the movie later for a re-watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Outstanding Triumph</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Captain America: Civil War is the culmination of the Cap legacy (just with a bunch of other heroes thrown in too.) What started with the First Avenger now ends literally 100 years in the making as Cap now finds himself at odds with Stark and a certain division of his team. As usual, life is breathed into the character thanks to the awesome performance of Chris Evans, who turned the disaster of the Fantastic 4 around and made Captain America all his own. Robert Downey, Jr. is always great as Iron Man, but seems to work better when he has other heroes to bounce off of versus doing a solo film. Both have equal opinions about why they're right, which makes it very hard to distinguish who's right and who's wrong, which is great film-making. Anthony and Joe Russo have clearly shown how to handle a Marvel film. Even if Spider- Man hadn't made the final cut, it still would have been a greatly hyped film. Even though the film is not directly adapted from the comic book altogether, Civil War is an outstanding triumph in every way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marvel's Best Thus Far!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is without a doubt, the best film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe at the moment. Usually, I require a re-watch to decide on how great the film truly is, however, with Civil War, the initial screening was more than enough.Everything from the story to the action sequences were executed brilliantly. The Russo's did a fantastic job fitting all these characters into a powerful and entertaining film. Not a single character felt unnecessary or out of place, with each one adding to the overall point of the plot. Speaking of characters, I won't spoil too much but Black Panther was unbelievably awesome. Chadwick Boseman nailed the African accent and his reasons/morals for being involved in the story were very compelling. Then of course, there is the much anticipated Spider Man. The characters introduction to the MCU was always going to be a tricky one but unveiling Peter Parker in this film were both well-timed and incredibly refreshing. If there was one type of character arc the MCU needed, it was a young, out of place individual. Tom Holland executed his role to perfection. It is clear from his (surprisingly non-brief appearance) that Peter is still unclear on what it really means to be an enhanced "superhero", while still maintaining the character's smart, comedic nature.Many similarities can be drawn from the Russo's previous Cap film especially with the fighting style and preference to less CGI usage. Seriously, if there is one thing that can spoil a good story, it is the over-usage of CGI. There are some standout hand-to-hand combat scenes that will blow you away, very similar to Cap and Winter Soldiers fight scenes in the previous film. Just be prepared to see much MUCH more of them in this film.Overall, this is an absolutely fantastic film and gives a lot more to think about regarding the future of the franchise. It is safe to say that with the Russo's on board, Infinity War will be spectacular and less hurried and overcrowded which was the case with Age of Ultron.Captain America Civil War will highly satisfy Marvel fans and most definitely entertain the casual movie-goer. I will definitely be seeing it again and pre-ordering the Blu-ray version. Oh, and please stick around for the post-credit scenes (notice how I said SCENES!), they are very important to the story line and quite awesome as well.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A solid production of an already solid cinematic universe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Civil War certainly presents a conflict, and it presents it in a MARVELous way.The third entry in the Captain America trilogy, Civil War gives the audience what they hope to see in an already known universe. It definitely is a worthy sequel, and it is bound to engage the audience throughout the majority of its duration.Taking on a more mature tone than what the MCU is known for, Civil War delivers an intriguing story that is told coherently and lets almost nothing escape its grasp. It tackles the criticism people have come to raise for the MCU and does not disappoint in that sense: a more adult-like narrative leaving out unnecessary humor.As it is to be expected from the name, there is a fight, a conflict, and a clash of ideals that set in motion a series of action sequences that could arguably be the best in the franchise so far, though it does seem to overuse some camera techniques that have become popular in the last decade; can you guess what I am talking about? You probably can. Other than that, the action is nothing short of awesome.The story is one of the highlight of the films, making you question whether there is a right or wrong answer in the characters' decisions, which is something fans of the franchise can appreciate. It is well told and the editing is distinguishable. However, I must say that some of the characters' motivations felt seriously forced, which makes me think that a few more minutes of running time and some adjusting in the writing could have been a boost on an already great production. Some of the dialogue could have had some tweaking as well.Although the action sequences are also a highlight of the film, especially the airport scene which I believe no one can deny was great, I feel the excessive use of the shaky-cam also makes them seem artificial, but overall, I would assert they are a step up from previous films of the MCU. The CGI could have received some polish, but it was decent even it its worst parts, and the musical score was forgettable, standing perhaps as one of the worst parts of the film. The pace of the film is also admirable, leaving almost no moment untouched by its robust storytelling.Acting was a mixed bag; Downey Jr. does a wonderful job as Tony Stark as always, as do some of the new additions to the MCU, but the rest of the cast did not really stand out, and in fact, some of the characters' accents sounded a little too fake to not notice.Despite some of its flaws, Civil War stands out as one of the best of the MCU. It just is.Recommendable? Go watch it now!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fun ride, DCEU really need to step up their game</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll just point out every good things in this movie by listing them 1. How Chris Evans brings Cap to life always just blows me away, he gets better and better with every movie 2. The chase scene which involves Bucky, Cap and Black Panther is definitely better than the trailer. 3. Chadwick Boseman is T'Challa; strong, tough, resilient and a king material and also a man with a few words 4. Spider-Man.....what can I say Marvel Studios, you just created the best and most entertaining Spider-Man, good job. I didn't hate the 2 former modern Spider-Man, but really just none of them has ever gotten the Spider-Man feel as Tom Holland did. 5. The airport fighting scenes were absurdly unbelievable....in a good way. It is not the epic fight as it was in the comics, no....and if you're expecting that then I guess you just don't know how to appreciate these people in bringing these characters to life. 6. I can see the spark between the distracted Vision and Scarlet Witch portrayed very well. What's amazing though is how this movie can picture the beginning of their love between in all this mess. 7. Daniel Bruhl as Baron Zemo; he just seriously exceeded my expectations. A typical Cap villain, well done. There are reasons why I gave this a 8/10 1. Iron Man's team is too OP, I mean you have Vision, Spider-Man, Black Panther and Iron Man himself. Maybe it was for plot reasons, but I can't even imagine Iron Man and his team losing 2. What is supposed to be Crossbones role here? I mean sure, Wanda killed him with dozen other innocents killed in collateral damage...there are thousand others killed in Sokovia, and the one in Lagos is the one that broke the camel's back? I'm sorry I just don't see it 3. Vision is way too weak here, I mean this is the first Vision right? Not the Young Avengers Vision. 4. The end was surprisingly weak, I was probably expecting Cap to die for some reason or maybe heavily injured that he cannot fight anymore, I thought Crossbones would be the one to do him in. 5. Lastly, Cap almost signed the SHRA!!! WTF Marvel?!!! What's more absurd is what's coming after, he then rejected the offer because Wanda is locked up....in Stark's luxurious apartment!!! Okay, I'm not expecting a straight off-comic movie....but I just can't see the reason to call this a Civil War because what makes a Civil War is the difference in principles between two sides which is: what is right, and what is legal, and guess what....Cap and Stark did make up for a while before his parents problem kicked in again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great blockbuster! (Non-spoiler review)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see the first screening this morning, and it's a great movie (with some flaws). Let's start with the good things: The actors absolutely delivered, Chris Evans &amp; RDJ are amazing in their respective roles, Spiderman &amp; Black Panther were wonderful (couldn't have hoped for a better introduction for either of them). Scarlett Witch is great too (we get to see her power better now); and even Black Widow is an (much needed) improvement over AoU! It's an action-packed movie, with emotions, humour.. Anything a blockbuster should be. The cinematography was great, good storytelling, hats off to the Russo brothers. The Captain America trilogy finishes on a great note.However, it is not without flaws: The main issue is that once again, Marvel didn't get the villain right. He was completely useless &amp; I believe the movie would have been better without him. His plan was surrealistic &amp; couldn't possibly happen. The humour was sometimes inappropriate, in the way that people wouldn't crack a joke when getting beaten I praised the action-scenes earlier, but they dragged and in the end, you are left quite tired. Then.. the relationship between Bucky &amp; Cap, while enjoyable some times, felt forced -- but that is minor. The soundtrack was okay-ish, nothing memorable (like most Marvel movies) Last but not least, I felt the movie is.. forgettable. It doesn't stay on the mind, all the movie's depth comes from the characters, not the story itself.. and in the end, it has no impact at all.----- To sum up, even if it has some issues, I believe Civil War is a highly enjoyable movie, and is worth every cent of the ticket!</fullReview>

Packed with action, right dose of humor, amazing acting and truly breathtaking battles.When during such a movie you really feel like you're playing a video game yourself and you are cheering with excitement, then this is a movie well made. Having taken one for the team with the not so nice "Batman VS Superman", this was actually a movie worth watching. The plot was there, the story was captivating and all the elements that someone would look for were present. I adored the fact that all the superheroes were treated as equals (although some may overpower others in "reality"). The fights and the way that the pros and cons of each one came out, was really nicely done.My personal favorite was Spiderman. Although this franchise has been a bit torn and abused so far, this guy seems quite legit. It would be nice to see a good spiderman movie after that.

		<shortDescription>SuperHero Movie with Heart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like the what the makers of the Marvel movies have done with the Captain America series. &nbsp;While most of the other movies in the "Marvel Universe" are big, expansive, special effects driven explosion- fests, the Captain America movies have been a bit more character-driven. &nbsp;Make no mistake, there is still plenty of special effects and explosions, but these movies takes their time to delve into characters and this is what sets them apart.Such is the case with CAPTAIN America: CIVIL WAR. &nbsp;This could easily have been called AVENGERS: CIVIL WAR for it follows a rift in the Avengers over the freedom to do what they need to do as they see fit with no oversight. &nbsp;And while the movie inevitably leads to a battle between the two factions, as big a part of this film is the human cost of these battles and the internal battles some of these heroes wage over the cost of keeping the planet safe.And, for the most part, this film succeeds in telling both tales - the smaller "personal" film wrapped inside a big, special-effects laden summer blockbuster.At the core of this film is the conflict between Chris Evans' Captain America and Robert Downey, Jr's. Iron Man. &nbsp;Consequently, this film will fail or succeed on the performance of these performers and the tone that they need to set. &nbsp;Fortunately for us, both Evans and Downey know these characters and the tone very well so it was like watching two veteran boxers duking it out in the ring. &nbsp;It was fun to see them put back on the costumes and go at it.It was also VERY fun to see almost the entire gang back on screen, if it is on opposite sides. &nbsp;Black Widow (Scarlett Johannsen), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), Scarlett Witch (Elizabeth Olson), Falcon (Anthony Mackey), War Machine (Don Cheadle) Vision (Paul Bettany) and even Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) are all back at it. &nbsp;They are ably joined by newcomers Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and Spiderman (Tom Holland) and the scenes where all of these are together was liking watching a great jam when the band got back together. &nbsp;There is going to be standalone Black Panther, Black Widow and Spiderman films and I am looking forward to each of them. &nbsp;Of course, I'd be up for a Hawkeye stand alone film, so I guess that makes me a fan.Is it a perfect movie? &nbsp;Well...no. &nbsp;The plot, as is often the case in these types of films, is paperthin. &nbsp;The franchise, rightfully, takes Thor and Hulk out of the picture (they will be together in the next THOR movie) for if either of those characters were around (especially THOR), then you would have a strong 3rd party to break the tie.But they aren't and the Civil War raged on. &nbsp;I liked that there were consequences to the actions (one SuperHero ends up with life changing injuries) and the central dispute remains somewhat unresolved at the end. &nbsp;It would have felt false for it to be tied up in one nice, neat bow.I do have a few quibbles. &nbsp;William Hurt's Secretary of State is too heavily written and acted and the first hour (of this 2 1/2 hour epic) drags in spot. &nbsp;But in the end, the movie does it's&nbsp;&nbsp;job and is very entertaining with parts action, parts human emotions and parts FUN (hear that BATMAN vs. SUPERMAN?) and that makes it well worth seeing, if you like these sorts of film.And, I do.8 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (of Marquis)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing. Full of incredible dialogue, emotion, and suspenseful action</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Marvel Cinematic Universe's newest action extravaganza proves once again that the MCU can create a masterpiece of superhero cinema. Much courage and loyalty is put into this film by the writers and directors, and it shows. Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely's decision to delve deeper and darker into the plot, thus exploring thought-provoking themes like revenge, friendship, and betrayal, work wonderfully. Also the work of the directors, Joe and Anthony Russo, provide for large amounts of emotion in the dialogue and intensely gratifying fight scenes filmed at the right angle. This is not your typical superhero flick with action and an interesting plot, it is a movie that pits incredible set-pieces and choreography against life-changing choices, while throwing superheroes into the mix. At its core this film acts as three movies combined: a sequel to "Captain America: The Winter Soldier," a semi part three Avengers movie, and the introductions of popular characters Black Panther and Spider-Man. This film is guaranteed to satisfy casual movie goers, Marvel fan boys, and the toughest critics to please.Marvel has once again changed the way superhero movies are to be filmed. With their superior and supremely creative executive producer Kevin Feige at the helm, also a large array of visionary directors and writers, and a more-than capable cast, Marvel seems to have a record of this. Starting with their original movie "Iron Man" which kick-started the universe, to their excellently crafted team up "The Avengers," and others such as political thrillers and space sagas like "The Winter Soldier" and "Guardians of the Galaxy," the MCU has always enticed audiences. This is certainly the case with "Captain America: Civil War" as they continue this trend of newly crafted and original films. Not only does Kevin Feige bring something new to the MCU table, but he also considers the repercussions of the Avenger's actions while delivering a psychological thriller dealing with political interference, which splits the sides of the Avengers in two. Another superhero film at Warner Bros. Studios attempted a plot similar to this ("Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice") but ultimately failed. It seems like Marvel has observed and payed attention to their rivals at DC and took some notes as to the right film-making strategy. All joking aside, Marvel Studios has clearly made a spectacular film that constantly keeps your brain moving, whether it be the incredible action scenes or the perceptions and viewpoints of every hero.There are many examples in "Captain America: Civil War" that signifies that Marvel Studios has a firm grasp on their heroes and plot. The first instance is the phenomenal action sequences in this film. From Black Panther versus Bucky to the New Avengers Team versus Crossbones to the titular and praiseworthy airport battle, the choreography in this film is definitely spectacular. The second example is the mind blowing ideals of all the heroes. Every superhero in this film gets valid screen time to demonstrate their views on the matter, and in this way there is really no main villain. This movie creates so much emotion within their characters and conflicts that affects the audience in turn. The third and last case are the ambitious entries of beloved Marvel heroes Spider-Man and Black Panther. The way that these two characters fit almost flawlessly into the plot instead of being shoehorned in is quite a fete. Black Panther definitely has the advantage over Spider-Man in the way that his character is more involved and better introduced in the plot, but Marvel still successfully pulls it off. Laying the groundwork for further hero's solo outings is a strategy that Marvel has done in the past. While most times it works pretty well, in this film it works terrifically. Even at the beginning of the year, it can be said that "Captain America: Civil War" will be one of the best films of the year, and that Marvel Studios has pulled off a rather gutsy and ambitious move.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two Words: Airport Battle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While watching Civil War, I couldn't help but think of DC / Warner Bros.'s desperate failures to catch up with Marvel's unstoppable success, specifically the recent disaster Batman v. Superman. Both films are about allies finding themselves on opposing sides, only Marvel actually succeeds on every level DC fails. Where BvS botched everything from the basic setup (why are these guys so angry with each other?) to nearly everything else that followed, Civil War soars with nuanced clarity: allegiances will fall / form, friendships will break / build, and summer entertainment will be had. Civil War finds tentpole-heroes Captain America and Iron Man at odds, each coming to grips with their power and position on the global scale on starkly different sides. Neither side is clearly right-or-wrong. Instead, we are presented with a familiar world, in which "good-and-evil" are not black-and-white, but largely grey. Even the de facto villain, one of the better in the MCU, finds sympathy through his heartbreaking and understandable motivations. These disparate sides are each so nuanced and logical, I found my loyalty swinging back-and-forth like Peter Parker at an air show. Speaking of which, Holland's turn as the webbed-crusader is easily the greatest in cinema: young, witty, wiry, and wide-eyed. Our first view of him is a standout, even while placed within the larger context of the marquee "airport battle", maybe the greatest superhero melee ever. The Russos, who have taken Whedon's place as go-to directors for Marvel, have such a strong control of humor, story, character, and action, they've even managed to better their fantastic Winter Soldier here. With them at the helm, any assemblage of Avengers is one to anticipate.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Captain America review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Captain American is a Marvel action hero movie that explores The Avenger's role in relation to the rest of mankind. It begs the question at which point do super heroes overstep their limits and disregard their actions' impact on the rest of humanity. In an age where superheroes have an unlimited amount of power, The UN tries their best to bring back the balance of power by establishing a treaty that puts the superheroes under the authority of the UN. Robert along with a host of characters try to protect this treaty by fighting against Captain America. Subsequently, the Avengers have a "Civil war" in which they destroy each other, with each feeling as though they are doing the logical and ethical thing. Ethical decisions come into play as captain America risk his own life to rescue his friend, and Robert Downey Jr. later risk his standing with the government by trying to help Captain America. The movie begs the question "Are superheroes exempt from responsibility?"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From a Nigerian's perspective</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was a great movie! But am Nigerian and I live in Lagos. The first setting of the of the movie was Lagos, Nigeria and that didn't look like Lagos, Nigeria. The buildings the people, the roads, in fact that's not how Nigerians would act if they saw Anthony Mackie as "The Falcon" or Captain America himself. Trust me we would run, no one would be outside! And the way it was pronounced in the news wasn't correct its more "lay-gus". There's no place called "T'Chaka" or "Wakanda" and we have kings but they are very traditional so they don't do politics that often. We run a democratic system of Government in Nigeria, we have a President and Governors and even Local Government Chairmen. If anybody is going to represent Nigeria it's gonna be the President not a King. At the United Nations conference in the movie he said something like "kosi" which should mean "thank you", although we have so many languages in Nigeria and Lagos is like a "united state" or a metropolis everyone comes to do business here, I may not know all the languages but Lagos is known for these five languages namely; English, Yoruba, Hausa , Igbo and Pidgin (our own version of English, its like a not so fluent version of English with modifications. Its common among illiterates but we have all come to understand and use it informally both literate and illiterate alike.) but the language used in the scene seemed like Yoruba if it is then its wrong the right word would have been "Ose" pronounced "Oshay". Okay it's cool that the black panther's character revolves around Nigeria. Despite all that it was still a great movie. Thumbs up!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely fantastic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Marvel/Disney is a monstrous force in the film business with their superhero movies. They have set the bar so incredibly high that you almost can not compare these movies to other films because they simply trump the competition unless it is of their own brand. With that being said, 'Captain America: Civil War' met my predictions perfectly. I absolutely loved this film. Never before have we seen a superhero movie where so many of our beloved character are not only in the movie, they are fighting each other in all their super- powered glory and for longer than 5 minutes (Yes, I am looking at you BvS). The introduction of new faces were fantastic and even beyond the much anticipated arrival of Spider-man. Black Panther, Spider-man, Ant-Man, Scarlet Witch; all of their screen time felt natural and needed for the movie, as well as the returning faces we all know and love. The villain behind the scenes was great. All of his/her actions were methodical and evil and it was almost as if he was the puppeteer beyond the true Civil War going on. Beyond the plethora of pros this film had for me, I do have simply one comment for the cons. The humor did seem too much at times. Although hilarious at every moment, there were times where they could have done without it and simply let the action carry the movie on its own. Regardless, as I spoke of before... While most can critique this movie, when you put it up against other Marvel movies, it can be easy to say what was better or what was worse but when it comes down to Marvel vs. other typical movies: Marvel wins each time. 'Captain America: Civil War' will not disappoint. It is a movie for all viewers and of all ages. This is a must-see movie for 2016.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Batman v Superman done right</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So I watched Captain America: Civil War, and guess what, it's a one hundred times better version of Batman V Superman. If you break down the plot you get the exact same story. The differences are: - This movie has a very good build up. The internal conflict happens after the team is formed in a previous movie, instead of before. - The guest star is Spiderman. Everybody loves Spiderman and on top of that he was portrayed beautifully. Nothing close to Wonder Woman, a walking pair of breasts nobody would give a dime about if she wasn't there. - Although the reason the heroes begun fighting each other was still rather weak, it was an amazingly long and well choreographed battle where a dozen people with various powers cause havoc, unlike just Batman and Superman punching each other for 10 minutes. - The reason the heroes stopped fighting was not silly such as their mothers having the same name. They realized things got out of hand when some of them got seriously hurt. - The final boss was not a dull troll. It wasn't even those 5 super soldiers that they were hinting throughout the movie. It was yet another internal conflict, this time not for ideological reasons but for personal ones. - As for the main villain, although he also had no relation to the comic book counterpart, at least he didn't irritate me like Lex Luthor did. And his motivations made sense. I even felt a bit sorry for him at the end. And even if I see it as a standalone action movie instead of a sequel to Avengers 2 or the better version of Batman V Superman, it's still an overall good superhero movie. It may feel slow at points but the payoff was worth every minute of it. Is it a masterpiece? No, it's not. But it was a blast for what it aimed to be and it didn't anger me for any particular reason. Marvel rules, DC drools.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Captain America: Civil War. A dream come true for superhero movie lovers.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched it yesterday, and I want to watch it again today. For how many movies can someone say this? Very few. That's how good the movie is. DC will have to buckle up if it wants to compete with Marvel. Batman vs Superman :(The action scenes are bloody awesome. I love the Black Panther. I did not expect it to be so damn close to the real thing.Check out Winter Soldier vs Black Panther. Some of angles at which the shield is thrown by Captain is out of this world. Scarlet Witch is powerful. I thought no one could control Vision. One chase scene was whoohoo -running out of adjectives. Black Panther after Winter soldier, and Captain after both. Spidy is pretty good too- especially with his lines (linees)With such a large crew of superheroes, things could have gone wrong. But it turned out otherwise. The movie picks up from the Sokovia incident, and Captain tracking his best buddy. There is a parallel plot to destroy Avengers in which Bucky is a pawn. The plot almost succeeds with the formation of two teams- Team America vs Team Iron Man. The two teams fighting with each other is just epic- Spidy with his lines, Ant man with his ANTics, a true Black Widow, Hawkeye who never misses etc etc. Among all this chaos, the real fight lies somewhere else and a truth is learned that changes the dynamics of Avengers forever. Hard to find faults.A must watch. Waiting for the next movie in line.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The War of Heroes! Captain America - civil war Made in 2016 Directors - Russo brothers 5 star rating Before I watched the film I wasn't expecting much but after I watched it for the first time the first thing I thought was this film is phenomenal! This film is a science fiction, fantasy, adventure, thriller, and an action film. Captain America ? civil war is about a team of extraordinary super enhanced heroes who help the world from evil. The team is split into two (Captain America's team and Ironman's team) after the government try to control them by making them sign the Sokovia accords, this would mean that the government could decide when they can help and when they can't. Captain America and his team think that they shouldn't sign the accords as they need to take responsibility for their actions and what if someone is in trouble and the government say he can't go help? He would never forgive himself for going nothing if something bad happened. Ironman and his team think that they need to be put in check so that less innocent people are hurt, he thinks the way to do that is by signing the accords. I liked the film so much because there wasn't too much of one genre, there was just enough to keep me at the edge of my seat. There wasn't too much action, there wasn't too much adventure and it was very well spread across the film. My opinion might be a little biased as I have been a big fan of comics and superhero's since a very young age, but even if you're not a fan of superheroes I think you would like this film just as much as me. In my opinion the film is flawless. The main aim of the film was to entertain the audience and I think they definitely achieved this, so much so that I have watched the film 3 times. My overall opinion on this film is that it was unbelievably amazingly spectacular.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Arguably the best movie of 2016</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Wow" - This one word would describe the movie aptly. After the disappointment of BvS (shame on you DC), the Avengers sequel checks all the boxes for a well made movie. Great acting, Amazing story, jaw-dropping action, well written humor, and great characters. Unlike the previous Avengers, (still a little confused as to where Ultron and Vision came from), this edition has a solid ( i mean rock solid) story line. The intro of all new characters into the Avengers fold is very well done. As the trailers have shown, Cap and Iron-man go at each other, and this is probably one of the best parts of the already awesome movie. Superb action, superb acting and great humor thrown in between. With all these, you could not possibly go wrong!!!!One peeve though, I feel the movie name should have been Avengers - Civil War and not Captain America - Civil War. Because this movie is as much about avengers as is about Cap.This is a must watch for all movie goers, a solid 10/10. I cant find a single flaw in this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfection in movie form</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wrote a glowing review on here for Age of Ultron, and I watched it again recently and it wasn't as good as I remember. So I wanted Civil War to be better, and it's better in every single aspect, from the plotting to the action scenes. The plot is that collateral damage from an event divides the Avengers, and it ends with civil war. That is a very broad summary but I don't want to spoil it. The plot is considered, well planned and intriguing with many elements pulling together to make a thrilling plot with surprises along the way. Unlike Avengers 2, the story isn't messy and it's more interesting as it doesn't hinge on huge action scenes. So a perfect story. The new characters are very nicely introduced, such as Black Panther who is important in the story and isn't crowded out by the other members of the team. The fact that all the characters feel more connected and he makes a valuable addition to the Marvel Universe. The only thing missing is a comedic connection, but this is made up for with some spectacular action.The action scenes are stunning. The one at the airport is one of the best I've seen, as it's so well directed and it shines with the new additions to the team. The film isn't all action though and some of the more touching, character driven moments really ring true through the fights. The whole film, from the way it's directed, to the action, to characters is all perfectly played and perfectly done. I can' really think of a single fault, the lack of comedy isn't really an issue as the film flies along at a great pace. The film doesn't feel as long as it is, and that is always the sign of a perfect film.Overall, all elements of Civil War are stunning. There is nothing wrong with it and it's certainly the best Marvel film to date and we, as superhero movie fans, couldn't of asked for anything more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Captain America VS Iron man right VS wrong.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>CAPTAIN America :CIVIL WAR Is a great movie. fine acting all around. and a solid story. People are going to think this is a retelling of the Cap Vs Iron man comic book event civil war. It is not. there are similarities in the comics The Super heroes are forced to a Registration cat that forces anyone that has powers to become a government agent if you refuse they go to jail. This is done after a hero VS Bad guy conflict goes wrong and destroys a city. Cap refused to sign and Tony headed it up. Both sides did not see the wrong in their actions. The Comics took a matter of three years to resolve the aftermath of the civil war. In a series a great to less then great story arcs. This movie does not have that privilege. The story here in the movie is more or less Civil War MCU style. and it raises a lot of interesting questions.After a mission in which the Avengers are trying to stop the last of Hydra wrong. a building gets destroyed And The Scarlet witch is blamed. The Nations of the world unite to bring an accord against the Avengers the accord makes them a body under the control of the UN. Captain America disagrees. He likes having a free hand. And he does admit the actions of the Avengers has resulted in destruction of cities and loss of lives but the alternate would have been worse. "The safest hands are still our own" Cap declares. but Tony and General Thunderbolt Ross disagree. Ross tells Cap the world owes them a huge unpayable debt but their is a percentage of the population is scared of them. they need to be reined in. Cap is scared of being turned into a weapon and being sent to places they might not want to go instead of going to places that they might need to go. then Bucky Barnes as the winter soldier reappears and complicates matter for Captain America. And once again Cap chooses right over wrong after the Avengers are ordered to being him in, But Cap finds out there is more to this then even Tony and his Avengers even knew. And it doesn't always come down to right or wrong but in loyalties and the courage of your convictions.The film is a great entry in the Captain America series but not as good as winter soldier. In looking at the movie in terms of right VS wrong for a movie that tries to show us the areas of gray. It tends to force the point. I found the villain Baron Zemo uninspired in comparing him to his comic book counter part. Zemo is simply wasted. As the Mandarin is in Iron Man III. A lot of potential ruined by a script that should have been so much more. but in what we were given the movie is more then enough. Spider-man in his first Marvel movie makes it special. tom Holland claims the role in such a way that Garfield and Mcguire never did.Of course the film ends on a sour note and in such a matter that you know it is going to be resolved in AVENGERS :INFINITY WAR or whatever the Russo's are going to call it.Civil war isn't perfect. but it delivers the goods .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like the recent DC movie, Batman vs. Superman, this Marvel movie has hero pitted against hero, in this case-Captain America against Iron Man. The conflict was handled more believably here than there. Other superheroes also participate including yet another new version of Spider-Man. This was mostly awesome from beginning to end unlike the DC movie which didn't make sense some of the time. Also unlike B vs. S, this one didn't seem too long even though it's only about 5 minutes shorter than that one. Oh, and Stan Lee makes another amusing cameo here, too! Plenty of great action abound so on that note, yes, Captain America: Civil War comes highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first came to see the reviews before watching the movie. And when I saw that most of them were above 8/10 I said this is a must see movie. But while I sat down watching it I told myself WDF is happening.!The story line is too girly. Lots of people crying. Always too much care for the humans. Yeah they will die, yeah there will be collateral damage, but what if the heroes didn't help at all. One scene you will see Vision reading on a paper, to prepare some food, a receipt. While he has the brain of a Super Computer and can be connected throughout the world, babysits a girl who will send such a powerful being 100m under the earth! WHAT, seriously this guy has an infinity stone for nothing! Some fight scenes are so stupid. Captain America holding a helicopter down with his bare hands while standing on a heliport. I didn't know he weigh 20tons! Ant man being a giant but when he throws a kick it is in slow motion! Spiderman got younger and more stupid!All this to end up with a guy who wanted to destroy the avengers just for revenge and got Iron man,Winter Soldier and Cap America in a bunker to show him a Video of who killed his parents. Couldn't he have just sent a simple mail. Very very bad movie!! Watch this at home,doesn't deserve your time to go to the Cinema!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although did slow down a bit at times but for good reason and seemed like 2 movies within itself which is an appropriate way to define it. Civil War is partially an introduction to both minor and major recognizable marvel super heroes, although handled extremely well, one character in particular did seem a bit shoe horned but due to his immense contribution to the film in what little scenes he was in, it is completely forgiven. The threads Marvel has been sewing within the years have finally met their resolution in this film and by god it is amazing, a fight truly fueled within the years through build up has finally erupted and it is magnificent to see. This movie can be considered crowded but is a perfect example of how to handle all aspects in a way that looks seamless. Civil War was every thing I expected a sequel to Winter Soldier to be. With scenes that literally have you on the edge of your seat. I'm so happy I can now watch Captain America as a successful trilogy within itself, with each gradually bigger and better then the previous in my opinion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just saw Civil War in 3D. I think the movie was great. I loved Black Panther (obviously). I loved the combos by Captain America and Ant man. I'm sure everyone did. I was cheering for black panther to just beat everyone up and I was expecting to see Stan Lee and of course he came out of nowhere. I was expecting many deaths you know from the comic book. Captain America died in the "civil" war in the comics. I really appreciated how the movie took it's time and how Spider-Man was formed through Iron Man. I also really liked the new costume for Spider-Man but I know for a fact I won't be watching Spider-Man reboots at all. Seems pointless by this point, but anyway this movie was great 9 out of 10!

		<fullReview>Right from the beginning, we see Captain America and his team trying to stop Crossbones and his team of mercenaries who have stolen a vial of highly infectious virus to sell to the highest bidder and when finally getting caught, Crossbones (Frank Grillo) tries to blast himself, Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) user her power to push the impact of the blast up in the air and the explosion destroys the seventh floor of a nearby building. While this was a mere attempt to minimize casualties, people still lost their lives. It was neither their fault, nor it could have been avoided anyways. The situation was the main culprit to blame.This is what Captain America : Civil War (2016) is all about.Team Avengers have saved the world from technological demons like Ultron, extraterrestrial threats like Loki's army, have dismantled Hydra outpost commanded by Baron Wolfgang Von Strucker but lost keeping count of bodies unnecessarily wasted in the mayhem. As previously said, they couldn't have been avoided. But as the Moses said in Numbers 32:23 of Hebrew Bible that "Be sure your sin will find you out!", nemesis in the form of Zemo (Daniel Brühl) comes for The Avengers to count on the sins they have committed without any choice and deliberation.The Story is based on the clash of intellect between Captain America (Chris Evans) &amp; Iron Man (Rober Downey Jr.) when political interference in Avenger's activities bring a situation of unrest among the members due to unethical rules, boundaries and limitation imposed upon the Avengers. They are told to sign the Sokovia Accords proposed by UN that suggest certain boundaries in the work culture of Avengers and show uncertainty where Captain-America-Civil-War-Art-Iron-Man-Team-Bruno- AlvesAvengers might be posted for work. Before the contention regarding this was over, Captain's old friend Bucky Barnes aka Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan) is held suspected for the blast at a conference in Vienna which takes the life of the Wakanda King T'Chaka (John Kani). His son, T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman), furiously seeks revenge and returns as Black Panther to eliminate the man behind his father's death.As the story escalates, when everything seemed to be under control after Bucky's arrest by the Shield, Zemo disguised as Dr.Mueller, a psychiatrist makes an appearance over there and brainwashes Bucky into creating a ruckus again to make things worse again. Captain America gets a hunch of the conspiracies behind all of this and with Bucky, tries to reach Zemo but is tried to stop by his own fellow Avengers as he is considered a fugitive now. The experiences get much more bitter and finally, the curtain rises over the real matter which is entirely something else. Everyone has done a great job especially Chris Evans as Steve Rogers and Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark. Steve Rogers is the most matured, brave and gentleman of the whole Avengers team. In civil war, we see his side where he is extremely sympathetic towards his old friend (which was also there in Captain America : The Winter Soldier) and a devil-may-care attitude just to stand aside justice. We also see a rather emotional side of Tony Stark, psychologically the most complex character of Marvel, and how Sokovia incident (Age of Ultron) changed Tony's perspective towards panache heroism and gave birth of judgment of setting limits in bravery. How his parents's death affect him mentally didn't really show that much potential but the try was commendable.The two big surprises are one on Team CAP that is Paul Rudd's hilarious cameo as Ant Man. Two awesome moments including Ant-Man's entering Iron man's suit through his FINGERS, and the other when he becomes gigantic, were extraordinarily entertaining. Now comes the more hilarious part of when a much younger, childish but fast as hell Spiderman (Tom Holland) marks his entry and constantly entertains us like anything. This might be the best cameo ever in the history of any Marvel Studios produced movie. Tom Holland is stupendously charming and wicked and in the race of best Spiderman ever, my money's on him, he was so damn impressive.Now, I would like to put some light on how Chadwick Boseman's Black Panther was about to steal away the show but lack of screen presence and script presence did not let that happen. This particular character is one of the most interesting ones in MCU and it seems appropriate justice will be done. The movie about him is soon to arrive and that is already teased by Marvel in the first post-credit scene. And by the way, yes, those scratch marks in Captain's Shield will remain that way now.My most favorite performance from the movie was by Daniel Brühl as Colonel Zemo. I know, this might be very weird choice of words I'm using and halfway through the movie, you will not understand why but as soon as the curtain raises from the actual matter, you will feel bad for this character deleting old recordings of his wife's voice and at the same time feel awestruck thinking about how a commoner like him jeopardized the harmony among Avengers single-handed. Brilliant, absolutely brilliant.It's monumental how Captain America : Civil War doesn't limit itself in being just another Superhero movie and pushes the limits by its unprecedented realistic plot where people are unable to completely deal with Superhumans, Monsters and other things beyond their beliefs. Full Marks.</fullReview>

The depiction of each character is remarkable. You can really understand why they chose their side, with solid reasons, so that everything makes sense. The interaction between each character was a highlight as well, with occasionally funny moments, bringing this film to a next level. The soundtrack was amazing! The music really add on emotions on each sense, whether it was intense, troubled, or depress. The only part wasn't that satisfying was the part of Zemo. He didn't feel like a character full of personality, which he should be. He seems to be there only because they need someone to be at there spot, not for a strong reason.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Marvel Cinematic Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw Winter Soldier, it showed that Marvel had changed their cinematic universe and now after seeing Civil War, has now completely changed the way I see its two main heroes, Captain America and Iron Man. Civil War is a true master piece that is on par with Dark Knight and Empire Strikes Back in terms of continuing the story. While their isn't that much of a global threat, the film increases the stakes on a personal level with each character having clear motivations for choosing their sides. Politics are this time used as backdrop to push theses characters into confrontation with each other.Many say this feels like an Avengers sequel but feels like a true expansion on the political landscape that was setup in Winter Soldier. While in Winter Soldier the Russo brothers dealt with political espionage and security vs. freedom themes with a Captain America take on it, the directing duo take it a step further with adding super- powered individuals to the politics. The film constantly explores the idea of consequences in the MCU from the politics. From when collateral damage happens on international soil to the characters's own choices as well as certain things that are a product of past events in the MCU are firmly address. But this movie would be nothing if it didn't have fleshed-out characters that each were thoughtfully executed. Cap is the heart and sole of this movie. Evans continues to show his character's struggle within the modern political landscape while being weighted by personal ties to the past. After the shocking discovery in Winter Soldier, this is a Cap we now see against the system that he swore to protect in The First Avenger. He is now willing to risk everything because he can no longer trust the government. And there maybe at times he has a bit of doubt in the consequences his actions create but he is still highly motivated to continue fighting and that mostly comes from the believable friendship you see that he has with Bucky. While I am not the biggest Robert Downey Jr. fan, this was probably his best performance as Iron Man even though this is technically not an Iron Man film. This is a Tony different from past Iron Man films. Not only do we see that the events in Age of Ultron play into him signing the Sokovia Accords but also ones personal to him. Downey does still use his occasional quips but also plays it very emotional and serious. And while I am still on Team Cap, I can't help but feel very sorry for Tony once the movie ended. Black Panther is probably one of my new favourite characters in the MCU. Chadwick Boseman's performance truly shows T'Challa as probably one of the most psychologically compelling characters in the MCU films. He is a guy you do not want to mess with but has this great arc that he goes through in the story. It would be silly of me not to mention that the best part is Marvel finally having their own Spider-man. While I liked Andrew Garfield from the Amazing Spider-man, Tom Holland takes it a step further with his portrayal of the iconic character. He nails the awkwardness of Peter Parker and the fast-talking of Spider-man while still adding his own flavor by just geeking out when he meets the other Avengers. Elizabeth Olsen was the one I was the most surprised by performance-wise. Her Scarlett Witch is further expanded as we see her sense of emotional vulnerability and insecurity fleshed out while still being extremely powerful. Vision, played by Paul Bettany, also gets to expand from his Age of Ultron role when he states that the Sokovian Accords are the most logical step with a growing number of global threats. Zemo was a villain whose plan didn't really make much sense in the beginning with but by the third act you see how manipulative he can be while there still being this emotional back-story that makes him more developed then the usual Marvel villains.Civil War probably has some of the best action I have seen in any superhero movie. The choreography has taken an upgrade from Winter Soldier with truly showing how grounded but still epic and brutal these characters are when they fight. This movie probably has at least major 4 or 5 big scenes. The key highlight is the airport fight. It is a moment that is impossible to forget once you have see it. It is pretty much an open tag-team fight barely loses any steam. And the beauty of that fight is that I am rooting for the both teams to win. My favourite part of the fight is two words: GIANT MAN. The third act fight with Cap, Bucky and Tony defiantly offers the most emotional punches. It is the moment when politics are tossed aside and it just becomes so personal. It becomes the point of no return because when that fight was going on. I wasn't sure if I actually wanted to see a winner knowing that the relationship between the characters would never be the same again.When I came out of seeing Batman V Superman this year, I felt a great sense of disappoint that Warner Bros. failed to tell a compelling story of two superheroes going into conflict with one another. That movie suffered from being mostly setup and little payoff. Captain America: Civil War is the exact opposite. Captain America: Civil War succeeds in every category that BVS failed at. The movie is not just another great addition to the MCU but a true masterpiece with huge political themes, great characters and some of the best action that even tops that stuff that Zack Snyder does. And unlike Batman V Superman, has made me excited some for the future of Marvel films like Infinity Wars, Black Panther, Spider-man: Homecoming and Ant-man and The Wasp.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marvel fans are just blindly drinking the cool-aid. Cmon folks let's be honest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warning: Spoilers ahead. I thought judging by money wasn't the "right" way to judge a movie. If we're judging according to what matters.. It was typical Marvel / Disney. Bright and colorful with a few laughs and some drama. The score was the same ol same ol. Story was simplistic: A man who lost his family and wanted revenge. Thats it? Really? After Black Panther (who was actually bad-ass) caught the guy, then the end of the movie just hurried it's way along. Not very deep or complex, but then Marvel isn't trying for that audience. The 15yr olds - thirty somethings have plenty of money to spend. The action scenes were great. The freeway scene was very fun. IF you liked age of Ultron, then you'll enjoy this. Age of Ultron was better the second time around. Civil war? Well... lets just say I absorbed it all quite easily and there's no real urge to see it again. Overall it was enjoyable and worth watching but please.. stop saying best Marvel Movie ever. Thats utter nonsense. Winter soldier was deeper and had more of an adult seriousness to it in terms of performances and the writing. Guardians of the Galaxy was a better movie IMO.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The the best superhero movie that is the most mature out of all the marvel films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Captain America: Civil War" is an action/adventure movie directed by the Russo brothers and stars Chris Evans, Robert Downey Jr., Scarlett Johansson, Sebastian Stan, Anthony Mackie, Don Cheadle, Jeremy Renner, Chadwick Boseman, Paul Bettany, Elizabeth Olsen, Tom Holland, and Paul Rudd. The Story centers the Avengers whose worlds are turned upside down when a Political interference in the Avengers' activities causes a rift between former allies Captain America and Iron Man. This Movie is not only the best Marvel movie ever, but it is also the best Superhero movie ever made. It's very thought-provoking, emotional, action-packed, and very Mature. right off the bat you get the impression that this movie is going to be a very serious film with dark images, and very shocking scenes in terms of an emotional drama. this movie throws an argument in the story that is very relevant to the plot and crucial to not only this movie but to past marvel films as well. it isn't very one sided and you do see both sides of the argument coming from both Captain America and Iron Man. that is only a piece to the brilliant movie that has a very realistic and gritty tone.Visually it's spectacular. the CGI does very well at blending two things together and making the fight scenes more believable. Speaking of fight scenes, The action segments in the movie are amazing to look at especially the airport fight scene which is filled with moments of awesomeness. The characters are very well developed here just as they were in the comics. Two characters that steal the entire show are Black Panther and Spider-Man. Black panther (played by Chadwick Boseman) does a very great job at playing a character that feels like he lost everything and is looking for vengeance. he did a great job and will probably get awarded someday for such a talent. the real winner is Tom Holland as The Amazing Spider-Man. He shines in this role and not only brings something new to the character but he brings plenty of old and nostalgic parts to his character as well, such as the costume. the actor did a great job at portraying a teen which is what Peter Parker is supposed to be. The rest of the Avengers all have a moment to shine especially Scarlett Witch (who is much better developed here than in Avengers: Age of Ultron). Iron Man and Captain America are very well developed and directed when the emotional moments kick into high- gear. The villain, while very relate-able is pretty forgettable.Overall this movie is amazing and is very incredible. I highly recommend it if you want to watch a great film. Watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A little disappointed that the theater I went to see this in 3D was not working. Still enjoyed the story line and the action. I'm on Team Iron man. It was great to see the new Avengers and the surprise visit from another one of my favorites. I haven't missed a Marvel movie since they started, this was another good one. It lived up to the hype. My two guests and I enjoyed it. Will go again to see it in 3D. The Black Panther appears to be a great addition to the Avengers Squad. The Disney/Marvel collaboration is working out real well. When will we see or will we see Black Widow in her own movie? And we now have another Spider Man? Will the Hulk ever return?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Captain America: Civil War</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the excess of superhero movies coming out these days, I wish they were all as complex and thought provoking as this one. When I say this is the best superhero movies since "The Dark Knight" I mean that, and it's undoubtedly the best of the Marvel movies. This is because of genuinely interesting, believable, and flawed characters that all have understandable motives. Now if you're like me and, during climactic superhero scenes like the one in the avengers, always wonder "What about the people in those buildings the 'heroes' are smashing up? Aren't they killing thousands of people right now?", then you will love this movie from the get go. Because in this film, the heroes begin to start facing the consequences of the actions, and start to feel genuine guilt for what they've done, besides Captain America, who seems to believe that he needed to sacrifice these people for the greater good of others. Seriously, while in almost all superhero movies there is a clear good guy and bad guy, in this one I genuinely couldn't decide who was good or bad. Even the man who at first seems like the stereotypical bad guy is revealed to have much more behind him. He will make you realize that that some of our so called "heroes" aren't much better than what seems at first to be a stereotypical villain. The morality is grayer than most action movies of the past 20 years.Its not only got great writing, but its got the great action we've seen in the last Captain America film, but cranked up to 11. There are many great action scenes in this film, but the ones that stick out the most are the car chase scene, and of course, the big fight between Captain America and his gang, and Iron Man and his gang. The latter is a fantastic scene, all of the superheros using there specific powers against each other, while occasionally another would chime in to help someone else out in a fight, and so on and so on. But it's handled with such grace that it never becomes excessive or confusing. All of the camera movements and cuts make it easy to understand what is happening while also handling all this action and all of these superheros at once, going from one battle to the next, and yet they still find time to put genuinely hilarious moments in all of this. It's incredibly impressive, and these great action scenes are already on top of the great writing. Possibly the only part of the film that I felt was unnecessary was the romance between Steve Rogers and Kate, and that is a minor complaint considering how little that portion of the movie is.It's an ensemble character driven film like "Boogie Nights", mixed with the usual humor of a marvel movie with action from "The Bourne Supremacy" but with superheros, but also with the moral complexity of "The Dark Knight" (although just not really as good as "The Dark Knight" or "Boogie Nights"). And if that's not a recommendation, then I don't know what is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw "Captain America: Civil War", starring Chris Evans-Snowpiercer, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World; Robert Downey Jr.-The Sherlock Holmes movies, Gothika; Sebastian Stan-The Martian, Hot Tub Time Machine; Chadwick Boseman-Gods of Egypt, 42 and Tom Holland-In the Heart of the Sea, How I Live Now.This is the third movie in the Captain America solo series-not counting the Avengers movies-but it is almost like an Avengers movie because of all the heroes in it, both old and new ones. The story starts out with the search for Sebastian/Bucky/Winter Soldier. It seems that the government agencies are upset with the Avengers collateral damage they have caused in their fights with the villains and want to put restrictions on the heroes. Basically, limit their actions and make them register-including revealing their identities-becoming super powered policemen, answering to the governments. Robert/Iron Man is all for it but Chris/Captain America is not. This difference of opinion leads to the Civil War, with the Black Panther, the Vision, Black Widow, War Machine and Spider-Man on Robert's team and Bucky, the Falcon, Scarlett Witch, Hawkeye and the Ant-Man on Chris' team-Thor and the Hulk do not show up. Chadwick plays the Black Panther-he has his first solo movie coming out in 2018-and Tom is Spider-Man-his is in 2017-both doing excellent jobs portraying their characters here. This story is based on a 2006 comic book series by the same name. There is also a villain by the name of Zemo that makes an appearance but he is not a major threat. Something happens between Chris and Robert-besides having a different opinion on how to operate as a hero-that changes their relationship. There is a knock down, drag out fight scene at an airport between all the combatants that is fantastic-I can't wait to see the movie again. I had heard something about a hero dying in the movie, and there is a funeral in it, but it is not for an Avenger. Oh yeah, Stan Lee makes his usual cameo; look for the Fed-ex delivery man. As the end credits start, there is a scene. There is also one at the very end, after the end credits. It's rated "PG-13" for violence, action and mayhem-lots of mayhem-and has a running time of 2 hours &amp; 27 minutes. I really enjoyed this movie and would buy it on Blu-Ray.</fullReview>

The actors and actresses were outstanding, particularly Chadwick Boseman, Tom Holland and Scarlett Johansson. The tension between Captain America and Iron Man was pure perfection. This is how you make a superhero showdown movie. Lots of intense and incredible action. I can't wait to see where they go from here and how they will resolve the still feuding differences between them. The running time may have been a little longer than I wanted but it was worth it. And Zemo is the best villain since Loki. I'd say for DC to take notes but I've given up on their movies since BVS. I love how they set up the Black Panther and Spiderman movies as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Aside from the fact that its a movie based on Superheroes, It really is a great movie! Unlike a lot of these kinds of films, there is an actual plot. The characters here feel real. They are complex and deep.You actually get emotionally pulled into the story and care about what happens instead of staring at your watch every 5 minutes. I loved all of the actors in this movie. Chris Evans as Captain America was good as always. Tony Stark aka Ironman is my favorite but Black Panther was everything! The guy is a total BADASS!!!I loved all of the superheroes in this movie.A lot of other Hollywood hacks could learn a thing or two from the Russo Brothers on how to make real movies. For me one of the best movies of 2016. Just saw it today and will be going back tomorrow with a friend! I cant wait!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No spoilers here either. The film was action packed from beginning to end. With a movie this good, it's hard to pick a side in this Civil War. Whether you're a fan of Cap or Stark, you will find plenty to enjoy in this movie. I was pleasantly surprised with the latest Spiderman and Marisa Tomei was perfectly cast in the small role of Aunt May. As always, there are moments of comic relief from The Avengers, especially Spidey and Ant-man. Leave the younger kids at home though; lots of heavy action scenes and language inappropriate for the little ones who will beg to see it.Bravo to Marvel for making this one of it's best offerings yet!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Captain America: Civil War is a fantastic movie with a very well developed storyline and a stellar cast. Just one year after Avengers: Age of Ultron, Marvel manage to deliver another movie that is just as big, just as bold, as we see the Avengers split sides, no one is an antagonist, we get to see both sides and determine who we think is right for ourselves, but neither are portrayed as villains, you can understand both, which I really liked, it was well written politics. The only thing I felt the film was lacking in was suspense, the last twenty minutes are very intense and somewhat traumatic, and I wish there were more moments like that, though I love Marvel's sense of humour, there were certain scene that I felt should have been handled in a more serious manner. I also found the Vision and Scarlet Witch underused, they are introduced in Ultron and I was looking forward to seeing them in action even more, however, their unique powers are never properly showcased. The cast shines, delivering the goods as always, Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr. face off after much friction since the first Avengers, their chemistry as foes is irresistible, its very personal, like two brothers fighting. They are joined by long time members Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Don Cheadle and Anthony Mackie, recent additions Sebastian Stan, Elizabeth Olsen, Paul Bettany and newcomers Paul Rudd, Chadwick Boseman and Tom Holland, all shining in their roles. There may be a lot of characters and a lot to get out of the way, such as the main story and setting up future movies, but the film never manages to feel overstuffed, all thanks to the talented Russo Brothers, who will hopefully do just as well with the Infinity War, all characters have an established arch. Action packed, funny, engaging, filled with likable characters and a fast paced story, Captain America: Civil War is one of the must see movies this summer, I would recommend it to Marvel fans and to anyone looking for a good action or adventure. Captain America and Iron Man end up splitting sides between the Avengers after a superhero initiative comes in, putting all superheroes in control of the government. Best Performance: Robert Downey Jr.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My all time favorite movie, set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. One of the best superhero movies, of all time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Captain America: Civil War takes place after the events of The Avengers(2012), Iron Man 3(2013), Captain America: The Winter Soldier(2014), Avengers: Age of Ultron(2015) &amp; Ant-Man(2015). When the Avengers cause another international incident, most of the governments of the world, think they should be held accountable for their actions. The United Nations comes up with the Sokovia Accords. According to the Accords, the American government is going to take control of the actions of the Avengers. Steve Rogers/Captain America(Chris Evans) is against it but, Tony Stark/Iron Man(Robert Downey Jr.) is for it. This causes a major confrontation between the two former allies. The rest of the Avengers, are obligated to choose sides. Meanwhile, Zemo(Daniel Bruhl) has his own nefarious plans. Captain America: Civil War is an outstanding movie. Marvel has hit the jackpot, yet again. Directors Anthony &amp; Joe Russo have made another masterpiece, after Captain America: The Winter Soldier(2014). In fact, this film surpasses the previous Captain America solo adventure. The future of the Marvel Cinematic Universe is in good hands, with the Russo brothers. The visual effects are mind blowing. The 3D is eye-popping. The action is breathtaking. The airport set piece &amp; the climax of the film, are some of its highlights. Before watching this movie, I was worried that Captain America would be sidelined in his own film, due to the presence of almost all the Avengers. I didn't have to bother. This still feels very much like Cap's solo adventure. Don't worry though. The rest of the Avengers like, Iron Man, Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow(Scarlett Johansson), Bucky Barnes/Winter Soldier(Sebastian Stan), Sam Wilson/Falcon(Anthony Mackie), Lieutenant James Rhodes/War Machine(Don Cheadle), Clint Barton/Hawkeye(Jeremy Renner), T'Challa/Black Panther(Chadwick Boseman), Vision(Paul Bettany), Wanda Maximoff/Scarlet Witch(Elizabeth Olsen), Scott Lang/Ant-Man(Paul Rudd) &amp; Peter Parker/Spider-Man(Tom Holland), still get plenty of time to shine. This superhero showdown truly becomes flawless, due to its power packed performances. Chris Evans is spectacular as Steve Rogers/Captain America. Evans showcases different layers of emotions, both subtle &amp; not so subtle, with panache. Robert Downey Jr. is fantastic as Tony Stark/Iron Man. Downey Jr.'s supreme acting ability finally comes out, in his sixth portrayal of Iron Man. This is because, Stark showcases various emotions despite his trademark wit &amp; sarcasm, this time around. Scarlett Johansson is superb as Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow. Sebastian Stan is awe-inspiring as Bucky Barnes/Winter Soldier. Anthony Mackie is awesome as Sam Wilson/Falcon. Don Cheadle is great as Lieutenant James Rhodes/War Machine. Jeremy Renner is effective as Clint Barton/Hawkeye. Chadwick Boseman is brilliant as T'Challa/Black Panther. Paul Bettany is excellent as Vision. Elizabeth Olsen is good as Wanda Maximoff/Scarlet Witch. Paul Rudd is hysterical as Scott Lang/Ant-Man. Tom Holland is amazing in his Marvel Cinematic Universe debut, as Peter Parker/Spider-Man. I am looking forward to Holland's solo Spidey movie. Daniel Bruhl is mind blowing as Zemo. Apart from Loki, he's the second most memorable Marvel Cinematic Universe villain. Emily VanCamp is great as Sharon Carter. Frank Grillo is effective as Brock Rumlow/Crossbones. William Hurt, Martin Freeman, Marisa Tomei, John Kani, John Slattery &amp; Hope Davis are impressive in their small but significant roles as, Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross, Everett K. Ross, May Parker, King T'Chaka, Howard Stark &amp; Maria Stark, respectively. Captain America: Civil War is a must watch, for pretty much everyone. Whether you are a superhero movie buff, or not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Captain America Civil War Review (Minor Spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Captain America Civil War ReviewOK so I saw Captain America Civil War last night. The movie was great. Marvel started off phase 3 both a bang. The Russo's are back and they've added a few new characters. First and foremost this is a captain America movie. I know there was a lot of hesitation with EVERYONE (minus Hulk and Thor) showing up. Most of the avengers are cameos. The additions of Black panther and Spiderman to the MCU had me overjoyed. To see my favorite web-head in the same scene as iron man and Captain America had me overjoyed. I've said it since I heard the news and from previous recasting a but Marvel makes the best versions of their characters.(sorry Sony) and Black Panther is a badass. He's great fighter and a fast runner. The airport sequence was great. I won't go as far to say BEST ACTION SCENE EVER like so many others have but I will say BEST ACTION SEQUENCES IN A COMIC BOOK MOVIE. this 20 minute set piece had me drooling in my chair at all of the mayhem that was going down with Heroes fighting Heroes and the scene doesn't disappoint. This movie isn't perfect(which was disappointing for me with all of the hype surrounding this film) I expected to absolutely love it it which may be showing my cards a bit but let's talk some of my problems. The CGI. we are in 2016 and they can't get iron man with RDJs head to look right? It looked like a poor photoshop job and it took me out every time he took off the helmet. It looked better in the iron man movies 8 years ago. But the big problem and a lot of people have already stated this in their reviews but the villain was unnecessary to this film. Zemo was a waste and I'm a defender of the marvel villains. Now Daniel Bruhl was great with the role he had but Zemo(who was only Zemo in name only) should not have been here. Now sort of minor spoilers I guess but he is the cause for the civil war and what he does to cause it is great but they keep cutting back to him and it feels his story and the main civil war are two separate story's until the end. There is a twist in this film which SPOILERS is connected to the opening sequence, I won't say what it is but unlike my whole family I knew what the reveal was and waited for confirmation the whole Time. I got half of it right. The performances were great all around the board, from Evans to RDJ, who's was especially heartbreaking with what he went through in this movie. Chadwick Boseman was perfect as black panther and I already stated Tom Holland is the perfect Spiderman. Nice little cameo by Stan lee. The score by Henry Jackman, who by the way is my favorite composer working today, made an outstanding score. There is one scene where captain America and Sharon (SPOILERS) Carter meet up and Bucky and Sam are in the car and their back and forth was just too funny. This movie isn't as good as the first avengers or the winter soldier not even as good as the first iron man and maybe that's what disappointed me. I've shared all the love I had with this movie but it was disappointing that it wasn't the best or even second best MCU film. It's 4th in my opinion. I'm gonna give CAPTAIN America (because it is his move) Civil War a 9/10. It's a great movie and I want to make that clear. It's a great movie and a great comic book movie but it's not the best and that's where my disappointment lies. Rating: 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Why do we need a war to solve a problem". The question that will pop up in your while watching the Avengers follow-up. Captain America:Civil War was entertaining with high-class 3D effects and stunning CGI along with riveting performances which turned out to be a solid follow-up to the Avenger series.As the new Superhero Registration Act is proposed by the United Nations which lays out the plans to deploy Super-heroes only when required. This political interference by the government causes the rift between two good friends ? Captain America, who believes that Super-hero should be have freedom to act and "not obey order", and Iron Man who believes that Super-heroes should be answerable to a neutral body based on their actions.It would have been really challenging for Russo brothers, Anthony Russo and Joe Russo, directors of Captain America : Winter Soldier to make a film by assembling all the superheroes in one flick but to my surprise they did a fantastic job and turned the comic-story into a must-see film. Of course, if you would have followed their original parts then this will be easy to continue. The differences between the characters has been portrayed ecstatically. 1st half boast of some path- breaking action sequences. The opening fight scene with Scarlett Johannson's Black Widow is pretty impressive, the introduction of each super- hero character has laid out accurately and fight scenes will keep you engaged. Second half loses the steam with so many stories interwoven under the same umbrella.Couple of scenes that easily stands out are conversation between Captain America and Iron man, the new characters like Black Panther and Ant-Man are highly likable. But the most impressive is the introduction of Spider-man which is played by a Tom Holland. Climax fighting scene is well executed. Screenplay is effective along with punching dialogues. Cinematography is enthralling. The CGI is magnificent with thrilling visual effects.On the flip side , any superhero movie is supported by electrifying background which is clearly missing here. Nevertheless, it is compensated by powerful performances by rest of the starcast especially. Robert Downey Jr who clearly stands out in his portrayal of Ironman and witty one- liners. The supremely talented actor goes deep inside a broken super-hero character who is left by his girlfriend. Chris Evans emotes better compared to the previous series of Captain America as if it is tailor-made for him. Scarlette Johanson does what she is best at ? kick some ass. Paul Rudd will surprise you as Ant- Man.Overall, Captain America:Civil War is a solid follow-up to the Avenger series and nice sequel to Captain America films. Go for it. Excellent 4/5?

		<fullReview>Honestly, Civil War is like a huge roller coaster that gets you super high and never has a big drop. Entertaining, yes, but annoyingly predictable, absurdly convenient and cheesy as hell. Annoying shaky cam, annoying one liners, annoying forced jokes amid fights and no high stakes. No depth. No emotional weight. Just loop after loop after loop. In the end, it was fun but not challenging. Seriously, at some points I was actually calling things before they happened. And at this point I thought they had learned to stop making it seem like something's gonna happen and then they back pedal from it, like they're not willing to take risks in the story to make you go "wow, I can't believe they went there." And in the end all kinda falls flat, like all the development and tense build up lead to nothing big. It's just a puddle they drag through for a while and then they come out at the other side conveniently squeaky clean. I can't get emotionally invested anymore in these marvel movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The sequel to 2011's Captain America: The First Avenger &amp; 2014's Captain America: The Winter Soldier, 'Captain America: Civil War' is Popcorn Entertainment! Its fun, engrossing &amp; watching the Superheroes fight it out between them, is a sight to be seen. This is how a Superhero Film should be.'Captain America: Civil War' Synopsis: Political interference in the Avengers' activities causes a rift between former allies Captain America and Iron Man.'Captain America: Civil War' is not perfect, its not even close to it. But what it is, in totality, is an arresting Superhero film, that shows Marvel's most prolific Good Guys fight it out. And I'm gonna say it again, the Sequence involving Team Capt vs Team IronMan, is exhilarating. Just a month ago we saw a STINKER involving Superheroes, but the real gift for fans like me, is this one.Screenplay by Christopher Markus &amp; Stephen McFeely is mostly arresting. Although, its a bit too long &amp; a bit too busy. I did not particularly enjoy the final 20-minutes, I felt the "final showdown" could've been sharper. But otherwise, I ain't complaining. The narrative slowly builds up &amp; the reason why the good-guys go against each other, makes sense. Its involving &amp; undoubtedly entertaining. Anthony &amp; Joe Russo's Direction is superb. They have handled this blockbuster, with flourish. Cinematography is top-notch, while the Editing could've been crisper. Art &amp; Costume Design are perfect. Action-Sequences &amp; Graphics are FANTASTIC. Henry Jackman's Score is great.Performance-Wise: Chris Evans as Steve Rogers / Captain America, delivers a committed performance, but its Robert Downey, Jr. as Tony Stark / Iron Man, who steals the thunder. This is a more serious Stark we see here &amp; its a welcome change. Sebastian Stan as Bucky Barnes / Winter Soldier, is in form. Daniel Brühl as Helmut Zemo, is solid. William Hurt as Thaddeus "Thunderbolt" Ross, defines command. But The Highlights, however, are Tom Holland as Peter Parker / Spider-Man &amp; Chadwick Boseman as T'Challa / Black Panther. Holland is scene-stealing good, while Boseman is electrifying. I personally can't wait to see their standalone films in the coming future! And Paul Rudd as Scott Lang / Ant-Man, shines. Others lend good support.On the whole, 'Captain America: Civil War' is great fun! Do Watch!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'CAPTAIN America : CIVIL WAR' REVIEW :- We all loved Marvel's previous Superhero flicks, this is another addition to that list. Makers tried to add more fun this time and they have succeeded in it. Obviously if they are making sequel that means audience deserve more fun than the previous one, this must be the thinking of Makers when they decided to make this movie. Marvel has a separate movie for each superhero then they made Avengers to bring all superheroes together and Civil War follows same idea. Too many superheroes, 2 teams and their face off. Wow sounds great no? Movie starts with kick ass action sequence. Keeps you hooked for first 30 minutes then some necessary scenes to set a plot which gives you loo break. Then after Interval movie is bit of slow but then last 40 minutes are brilliant. Spidey's entry and his presence made it more entertaining. End is quite Emotional (not actually) and bit disappointing or exciting, depends on your choice how you take it. Film wins your heart by its special effects and those scenes are eye pleasing in 3D. Screenplay could have been better but it is not bad either, usually this kind of films are not made to entertain you for complete 150 minutes and you know it. Runtime looks 10 stretched. Story is good and bit a confusing but it ends on satisfying note. Acting is perfectly showcased by all leading stars. Sound work is good too, especially in action sequences. Cinematography is something to clap for. As a whole Film entertains you, doesn't make you feel bore and won't let you think that you wasted money on it. Go for it, enjoy this another Money making entertainer by Marvels. 7/10 stars by me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Civil War - Marvel's one of the best movie .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie was very very good and Captain America is the best trilogy of Marvel leaving first one meh . Movie is not very like comics but still it is done so great that we don't even miss comics and can be viewed by everyone and not only comic fans unlike Batman v Superman which I think it was their only mistake . Every Avenger was used perfectly except Vision but Vision has nothing to do in this . At every superhero entrance the hall cheered especially at Black Panther's and Spider- Man's. Black Panther has its moment and they are all awesome , the more you look at him the more you want from him .Tom Holland is perfect as Peter Parker and as Spider - Man by far and he definitely steals the show in Airport fight sequence and so do Ant-Man but they both have small roles in this but Anthony and Joe Russo used them perfectly and I think Avengers Infinity War movies are in good hands . The last fight is good but not that emotional as people are saying but both Captain America and Iron Man were right in last fight so you cant really pick sides on that , other than that Captain is right in this and you will get to see . The only think I don't like is that Marvel still can't get emotional even after 8 years that is the only thing I don't like with Marvel . But this is definitely one of the best Marvel movie till date . I am definitely going for second time tomorrow and everyone should also after their first time .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny, Smart, and Great Character Development</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Captain America: Civil War is in my opinion the best Marvel Studios film to date, I do not say that lightly. I loved Captain America: The Winter Soldier and The Avengers, but Civil War does everything that Marvel has needed to do for a while. Civil War is perfectly written, crafted with care and heart, and feature brilliant character development. All things considered Civil War is a feat, because it finally shows that Marvel is willing to take some risks, all the while remaining true to what has made their films so enjoyable.When looking at Civil War, in specific the story, it's almost perfect. The story serves as a culmination of all the events that have occurred in the ever expanding marvel cinematic universe. The great thing about this film is it's the first comic book film to intelligently address the issue of how do people respond to the seemingly endless carnage created by the main characters. Such a simple idea is perfectly applied create a thought provoking movie where every action has a repercussion.The brilliance of this film can't be understated, because the politics within the film are fictional, but feel realistic, and are dominated by shades of grey. The film finds a way to be more brave than any of the previous marvel films by taking risks and attacking deep issues, but keeps the iconic sense of humor marvel has become known for. It should be noted that the film's not dark or anything, but it does attack complex themes, and conveys a surprising amount of emotional depth for a summer blockbuster. When you consider the density of the story and the amount of characters featured it's amazing that the film worked as well as it did.That brings me to what I consider the most impressive element of the entire film, the character development. It's difficult to have a film with as many characters as this film has, and make every character feel well developed, but this film does that, more so it makes you feel for characters who are brawling with each other. The acting was one reason the characters feel so well developed as the actors brought small nuances that sold the characters that much more, and while Chris Evans is great in this film the real superstar is Robert Downey Jr., who brings so many emotions to his performance in this film. This is in my opinion the best portrayal of Iron Man since his original film, but the irony is that the show stealer is Spider-Man who marvel nailed.For those who enjoy films that are funny, touching, action-packed, or just good stories this film won't disappoint. This film is what Batman v. Superman should have been, however is even more impressive because the film finds a way to juggle so many different tasks, and does it well. Captain America: Civil War is one of those great films that everybody can watch and enjoy for different reasons. If you like movies of this genre, check Civil War out because it's one of the best in recent memory.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Captain America: Civil War</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What the hell is next after Captain America: Civil War? Well, I guess I know what's next... the Phase 3 of Marvel Cinematic Universe, which will go through deep changes in the characters and the continuity which started 8 years ago, when Iron Man was released. What I didn't expect was the ending of Phase 2 to be so... I don't think I can finish that phrase not revealing more than I should, so I will limit myself to mention the reasons why I enjoyed Captain America: Civil War so much. The fans of the epic comic saga Civil War will recognize the same story in broad strokes, even though its dimension was considerably reduced. However, I don't mention that as something negative, because it was obvious that a 146-minute film wasn't going to be able to contain the hundreds of characters and sub-plots which integrated that "crossover" (not to mention the copyright nightmare implied by the legal rights of such many characters scattered between multiple studios). I will even say that the abbreviation of the conflict to a dozen of characters distillates the main ideas of the tale, making them more potent and forging not only an exciting and hugely entertaining film, but an appropriate punchline to the events which have been gestating since 2008; in other words: this was the ideal moment to make Captain America: Civil War... when we already know the characters very well, and we share their uncertainty on the mission of "avenging" the whole world. Besides, on a more visceral aspect, we already know what each hero is capable of doing, so when the unavoidable fights come, it's a pleasure too see them measuring their abilities, exchanging demolishing punches and fulfilling the fantasies of uncountable "fanboys" (like me), who many times wondered "who would win" in hypothetical fights with infinite permutations of opponents. But the most remarkable thing is that, even with such familiar characters, co-screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely found the way of surprising us with twists and unexpected tangents, while perfectly integrating the new heroes and villains to the narrative flow. The only thing I can say against Captain America: Civil War is that the tendency to the "shaky cam" obstructs the excellent choreography a bit during some of the action scenes. But despite that small complaint, I liked Captain America: Civil War very much, and I found it one of the best films from Marvel Studios (I would personally place it in the TOP 3, along with Captain America: The Winter Soldier and Guardians of the Galaxy). I enthusiastically recommend it to the fans of Marvel's and those who like action cinema with a good dramatic endorsement, because Captain America: Civil War places as much importance on the characters and the story as on the action, instead of exclusively focusing on the special effects... which had exactly been one of the main problems of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You just gotta love Marvel.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know why but everything Marvel puts it's hands on succeeds somehow. 'Captain America: Civil War' is the third "Captain America" stand-alone movie and the first of Marvel's Phase 3. I've never been a comic-reader nor am I a big Marvel-geek, but the MCU has in the meantime become a part of my annual movie visit's. And I'm not yet tired of them, especially not after Marvel's supposedly best adaptation to date.With 'Civil War', Marvel reaches new depths and significance. Apart from the typical Marvel humor we are offered a side that proves high demands as well as some seriousness as we have seen in 'Winter Soldier'. The Russo Brothers here, too, prove their skills and show us a new, more grown up side of the MCU. First and foremost ascribable to the grounded story, that does not only put the Avengers to test but will also get every Marvel enthusiast into a conflict. The discord between our otherwise well attuned superheroes is the core of the story and the reason for the imminent "war". But we aren't pushed in an alleged right direction. Both sides are justified in their individual views and comprehensible in their motivations. The conflict, which is the incentive of the entire movie is inarguably clearly to be felt and appears most of all plausible. Every fan that chose a side will find himself questioning his decision, if he allows himself to.&nbsp; But not only do the motivation of the torn Avengers seem reasonable but also those of the antagonist Zeemo, though they are maybe held a little too simple. Besides all the old characters, 'Civil War' also introduces two new characters: Black Panther and Spiderman, who finally returned to the MCU, last year. I can't even put into words how incredibly awesome both are portrayed and how much I'm looking forward to seeing both their stand-alone movies. I don't even want to say much more about them. You simply have to see and enjoy them on the big screen yourselves. All the characters appearing in this movie fit into the storyline and are in no way incoherently presented to us. Not for one minute does the movie feel crowded or simply disorganized. Even though not all of the characters have the same amount of screen time, everyone has their shining moment and reason to be in the movie. The interactions throughout the movie are especially great to watch. Partly pretty hilarious and entertaining but also severe and emotionally touching. In general this movie has throughout alongside the unique humor much more grown up and serious parts. Not only palpable through the stunningly written script, but also to be seen in the nerve-racking fight sequence of the last act, that will thrill but also shock everyone watching. The tension that is build up in those few minutes is incredible. Needless to say, that the action scenes are well choreographed and beautifully filmed just like they were in it's predecessor. 'Civil War' probably delivers one of the best on screen action in the history of Marvel.&nbsp;Conclusion: 'Civil War is Marvel's most mature movie and in addition has a big emotional impact, that I haven't seen in any Marvel movie before. In combination with the for Marvel typical humor the movie seems to be well balanced and atmospherically harmonious. 'Civil War' is without doubt Marvel's most grown up movie to date. Whether it is the best, that's up to you to decide. It's definitely far up on my list, because just thinking or writing about it makes me want to go back to the movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At first before you walked into the cinema all you could think about is whom you'll support. Captain America or Iron Man.That's what happened to me too.But once you sit there in front of the screen and let the storyline flow as you let yourself into it, you slowly changed your mind. Now all your concern is not about who will win between the two team, or who is wrong who is right.This is the movie where you can see those superheroes are also 'human' and has their ego, which is also relatable to our daily life where every big problems come from persistency and selfishness. In this case, you couldn't hate Steve because you know he's just trying to do what is right, you can't either hate Tony, because you realize he is just trying to keep the team away from problem, and just feel emotional of things that happened.Absolutely the BEST marvel movie so far, which all you see is not superheroes kicking bad guy ass, but that sometimes even the mightiest force on earth can also have the emotional tension between them. This movie is so thrilling, exciting, yet emotional. The Russos has done an incredible job bringing the other team member featuring the movie yet it still taste as Captain America's movie just like how the title said. Standing Applause.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Avengers was the pinnacle.....Cap Civil War now is.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From a fairly low key start, Captain America has gone from strength to strength. I liked the first movie, thought it was a decent origin story, and it wasn't done in a jingoistic "America, rah, rah, rah" way either.The second movie was a big step up, and having the added bonus of Robert Redford come onboard got everyone thinking about what the quality must be like for him to come out for it, and we were all rewarded with a great movie, full of heart and action, and Captain America as a character really growing on people.Civil War? Damn, its better than The Avengers if thats possible to believe. I saw Batman versus Superman with my son, we are in no way DC or Marvel fanboys, we go to see lots of comic book movies, but whereas BVS was a pretty miserable experience where Superman was even more brooding and downbeat than Batman.Civil War tempers the misery with humour, excitement, and a decent mature storyline inbetween all the ass kickery. And there's LOTS of characters in this movie, but do you know what? Other than maybe The Vision and Hawkeye, I felt that none of the characters were sidelined at all. Spider-Man had probably the best introduction any character has had in a comic book movie. Not only were his scenes pretty damned good, it was funny as well. Speaking of funny, Ant-Man, fairly short amount of time in comparison to other characters, but hilarious as well, and one of the stand out scenes in the movie was attributed to that character.Falcon got developed more, Hawkeye did well, Scarlet Witch was pretty good, Winter Soldier/Bucky Barnes was great, and the new addition of Black Panther, again, new character, but great screen presence and plenty of screen time to be fairly interested in his movie when it gets released.Black Widow had some of the best fighting scenes, a few genuine moments of "cool" and some of the action set pieces, especially when Winter Soldier is attempting escape from the German police in the apartment block, just so much inventiveness in the fight scenes, not one of the fight scenes was boring.I'm just amazed that the Russo Brothers were able to craft such a well put together movie, with so many characters, and deliver a story that was so much more than just the action scenes.I like the theme of repercussions for the Avengers actions, I like that in a movie full of fantasy, it at least grounds itself in a normal reality where if superheros were real, they wouldn't be allowed to do what they want without reprisals. Its something BVS got close to trying to emulate, but then they blew everyone up when Superman arrived, so Civil War was able to tackle those issues better.I hope that this isn't the end of solo Captain America movies, because the character is really growing on me. But if this is the end of the solo movies, what a way to end it all.If the Russos can do this for Cap, their take on Avengers is going to be a must see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just watched CA:CW. Off the bat, I would like to say that I'm not prone to superlatives...always preferring a balanced outlook. With that out of the way...IMHO, CA:CW was the best one yet! Previously, CA:TWS was the benchmark, followed by The Avengers. The Russos have hit the ball out of the park with this one.It is packed with characters, plot-lines, conflict, action...yet manages to walk a fine line of coherence, fun and real stakes. It is a story you can easily follow with characters from both sides of the aisle you can sympathise with - both Cap and Tony make compelling arguments...and the audience is caught in the grey middle. No one is right. No one is wrong. In short, nothing is either black or white.I actually care for these characters and you can sense the deeply fractured relationships are about to be torn apart at any moment - yet there is some inner motivation in them to try and preserve their comradeship in whatever form. Somehow, every character got a chance to shine. I'm not sure how the Russos managed to pull that off. Baron Zemo was fantastic. So too Black Panther.As for Spider-man...I think this is the best live on-screen realisation of the web slinger that I've seen. I clapped and laughed at so many scenes that I lost count. They also did great justice to Scott Lang's Ant-Man. He was literally and figuratively AWESOME. Yet equally I was in dread of Tony finding out the truth about his parents and what his resulting actions would be and how violently berserk could Bucky get?So many scenes looked like they just popped out straight from a comic- book panel.However, this wasn't just a great comic-book movie. This was a great movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>12 movies that your model of cinematic universe, Marvel Studios is showing a coherence logic and narrative to teach in many sequences and movie universes that are being planned, all culminating in Captain America: Civil War, a film that is both long a fanciful sequence Captain America: Winter Soldier, "a sequence" Avengers: Age of Ultron, an introduction of two characters pivotal to the house of the ideas that are the Black Panther and his All Star, Spiderman, how to this in a movie with so quality? The Russians Brothers could not only that, but made the best film of Marvel and say more, is by the Dark Knight as one of the most important works of the genre, with fantastic action scenes (especially one that takes place in an airport, where each character can make a more epic thing to another, using fine powers) the downtrodden whole script in vigilantism, almost post Snowden references, Robert Downey Jr justifies its very high salary and his best performance as Iron Man, a performance as magnetic as charismatic, Chris Evans creates a Cap full of nuances and layers, we feel how their decisions weigh on his journey, the new additions of the Avengers are spectacular, Tom Holland simply creates the best Spider-Man the big screen, Bosseman embodies the Black Panther with all power and majesty that the character deserves and Scott Lang Paul Rudd with his comic taken almost always well- aimed. Although sin in your villain not giving developing the character deserved and some small mistakes and lack of courage here and there, the stage is Captain America and Iron Man, with his motivations, views and his power of influence, this makes the movie relevant and opens a new range to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. 9.6 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Civil War is among the best additions to the Marvel Universe. It is quite easy to notice that Marvel movies have been getting progressively darker and more thematically diverse. And this is for the better since it all adds up to being more than mere macho men throwing punches at each other. First off, Capt. America and Iron Man. That these two have had a borderline conflict since the very beginning of their collaboration is very well known, and here we see them up in arms over the manner in which they must function, now that Shield has collapsed and the Avengers have literally no one to answer to. A very compelling aspect of this movie is the way the different viewpoints of the Capt. and Iron Man are allayed to each other and to the viewer. Points made by both sides are potent and definitely need more debate and deliberation, which is precisely what the Avengers don't seem to have time for, considering that there are men out to seek glorious revenge(Read Zemo). On the one hand Iron Man is right in that it is unreasonable to think that the Avengers, as righteous as they might think they may be, have no one to answer to, and so it is their duty as a force committed to saving humanity, to sign the accord and make known their allegiance with the Governments. On the other hand, Capt. too is right in that by submitting to be monitored by the UN, the Avengers lose their ability to take on crucial operations due to their being ramshackled in the quintessential political propaganda and such; and thus the Avengers could end up being a mere tool in the promotion of said propaganda. Furthermore, the Captain's POV can be understood in that his having witnessed the failure of Shield has convinced him that the Avengers are most effective when in charge of their own matters. So with this well fleshed out exploration of conflicting idealogies explored in what was a good, but not great first half, the movie knocks itself right out of the park in the latter. The second half has an exciting mix of comic exaggeration and dramatic exploration of themes and characters. The Airport fight scene is, while I concede hardly a practical realistic battle in that a group of "fashionably dressed" super-people happen to chance upon a conveniently deserted airport and fight each other while actually enjoying themselves while consistently smart-talking is well, possibly frown-inducing, yet one of the most exciting action sequences in CBMs, with hilarious exchanges between the many characters. The whole sequence breathes goofy gleeful cherry blossoming abandon, and is after all a coming together of all our favourite superheroes and their collaboration in riding on each others' abilities to execute great action sequences. Ant-man and Spiderman were simply great. Post the Airport scene, the Capt-IronMan-Bucky showdown in Russia has surprising dramatic heft for a Marvel movie. The plot twist that it provides us adds for a searing intensity in the fight scene that follows, all with the character motivations, if not justifiable, definitely understandable. All in all, Civil War was brilliant in that it combined all the elements of the summer blockbuster that we have come to expect, as well as providing us a fairly commendable foray into the political and emotional conflict that arises out of being a superhero. There is a lot of fun to be had here, but of course you're going to have to concede that it is after all a comic book movie. The Russo brothers have done a great job in adding whatever 'realism' is possible in a world with alien gods, green monsters, computer-humans, insect men and what not. From a filmmaking standpoint these kind of movies may not hold for much, but that's precisely the point, they exist not for technical prowess but for the, shall we conclude, glory of cinema.</fullReview>

If you thing of joining a side of the two team I mean team Cap or team Tony Stark then you must be amazed by your decision but after watching the movie. Every character has played their specialty in this movie. Sometimes except starting felt little boring but some immediate action makes thrill &amp; shout you loudly.

		<shortDescription>My personal FAVORITE comic book movie ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I believe The Dark Knight is the best overall comic book film ever, but Civil War is my personal favorite. The balance of drama and serious tone and humor just works. What's funny is that most of the humor comes during the 17 minute airport scene. Other than that, there is actually very little humor in this movie. From the moment the movie starts, the action is stupendous. The Russo brothers are adept at creating memorable action sequences. Yeah, shaky cam can be a bit annoying in some scenes, but it doesn't compromise the whole of the experience. Their action sequences are top notch, and amazingly choreographed. You sense the impact and brutality of each hit. And because these are superheroes, the impact and brutality is even greater. Winter Soldier and Civil have hands down the best action of all Marvel movies. It's nice to see action that's not all shoot lasers and blow stuff up. Some gritty, down to earth action that seems like it can happen in real life really amps the experience. Each character gets their moment. The Russos did a great job of balancing the stories of so many characters. You get a sense of motivation and development of each character, even if they are not in the movie too long. You are not jumping from one character moment to another at random times and at warp speed, each moment starts and ends appropriately and tells what it needs to tell. The movie is two and a half hours long, but it did not feel that way, and that is such a hard thing to pull off. Kudos to the Russos for maintaining such a coherence in character story telling. I have no clue why people are complaining about Zemo. He is the most cunning and charismatic villain this side of Loki. People want to complain the movie didn't need him??? Really? When the bomb at the UN goes off, it sets up a whole bigger conflict that involves Bucky. The last two hours of the film only happens BECAUSE of the actions of Zemo. Anyone who says Zemo is unnecessary, is either really overstating things and didn't even remotely pay attention, or they are disappointed this isn't some big, menacing, powerful villain who poses a threat to the world like Loki. Zemo is just a regular guy, but with tragic intentions. His whole family and everyone he loved was killed in Sokovia, which drove him to try and tear the Avengers apart. Those who say this motivation sucks, look at this. When T'Challa's dad was killed during the bombing at the UN, he is so angry, he seeks our revenge and goes after Bucky. That's just his DAD. This was enough to set him off. When Tony Stark learned Bucky killed his parents towards the end of the film, this was enough to be filled with rage and try and kill Bucky. Both T'Challa and Stark lost at least one of their parents, and this was ENOUGH to send them into an emotional rage. Zemo lost his dad, his wife, AND his son in Sokovia. Imagine how he feels. His motivation is completely warranted, because he really lost everyone. He spent over a year decrypting leaked Hydra files to study and gain an upper hand. He said himself he has, "Experience and patience. When a man has those two things, he can do anything." That is powerful stuff. Having MULTIPLE people you love get massacred is enough motivation and completely understandable from Zemo's perspective. Spider-Man and Black Panther? Ugh, absolutely amazing. Both actors completely nailed their roles. Tom Holland is the definitive Spider-Man, and is the age of Peter Parker most people know in the comic book. The perfect combination of young, awkward, nerdy, but super confident and cocky when he puts on the suit. Chadwick Boseman NAILS Panther. He brings that regality and authority, making him a force to be reckoned with, even over Cap. His accent was so good and on point. I can't wait to see his solo film. Both character's intros weren't forced and fit perfectly for the story at the moment. I can't wait for BOTH solo films. The only true gripe I have about this film is the ending was a bit anti-climactic. I really thought someone would die, and that likely would've had a greater emotional impact from the audience. I think a lot of people expected someone important to be killed, and when it didn't happen and everyone turned out sort of okay (except half of them being fugitives now), it was a bit of a letdown. Had at least one person died, the effects would've been more memorable. Overall a great movie, and my favorite CBM so far. I can't wait to see the Infinity Wars. It'll probably leave me literally breathless!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>First time I ever watched a Superhero film twice in theaters.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>YES! YES! YES! OH GOD YES! Now that's entertainment! You have no idea how much I needed this movie! After watching Batman V Superman, I was this close to swearing off of all superhero/comicbook movies. Just so you know where I'm coming from. I loved Avengers, thought Winter Soldier was just okay and would rank Age of Ultron as just okay as well. But Civil War is great. The first hour is a little too much like Winter Soldier for my taste but after that, it was like a rocket of awesomeness that just kept giving you amazing action and an outstanding emotional roller-coaster of a story. There are so many good things about this movie. Black Panther is great. If I had to choose between watching a Batman solo movie, Avengers 3 or a Black Panther solo film; I would choose to watch Black Panther in a heartbeat. His character is just that entertaining and badass. Both his superhero persona and civilian character are interesting and engaging. Whoever that actor is, he's owned the role and I literally know nothing about Black Panther and I'm fanboying out about him. Next, Spider-man is freaking awesome. I'm not going to lie to you, they did force his introduction into the movie. It was totally forced but, the actors sold the scene. And the directors of the film were smart enough to give us a good amount of Spider-man in the movie which helped to make him a well rounded character and worked very well into the second half of the film. This version of Spider-man, as far as his attitude and mannerisms when he is in costume and fighting people, is the most truest adaptation to date. As far as his Peter Parker persona, it isn't like the comics but more like the Peter Parker Toby Maguire played in the original Sam Raimi Spider-man trilogy. In other words, they're going with a formula that works, and I'm more than okay with it. What I like most is how powerful they make Spider-man, he is a relatively new hero but is able to more or less kick both Winter Soldier and Falcon's respective butts. But they didn't make him powerful enough to handle Captain America, which is smart because it leaves room for growth. Next, that amazing fight scene.The fight all the Avengers and heroes have against each other is literally worth the price of admission alone. For the first time ever, War Machine felt just like an actual war machine with all the heavy ammunition he was using. That scene where he pulled out a million guns and destroyed the airport staircase Ant-man was swinging at him was great. Speaking of Ant-man, he nearly stole the show with that scene of him shrinking down and going into Iron-man's armor and then the scene of him growing big and kicking butt. Dang, just dang. Civil War lives up to it's name, it was a war because some of those heroes were not pulling their punches. Now let us talk about the villain of the film, Zemo. Zemo's character was probably the smartest thing about the movie. Nearly every Marvel, or DC, or Fox studio superhero film, the plot concludes in the most generic way possible. In other words, some super-powerful, final level boss bad guy is going to release an army and destroy the world, or set off a bomb and destroy the world, or pee in the waterhole and destroy the world. This film was smart enough to give us a bad guy who's sinister brain and strong willpower, was enough to carry the film and make it interesting. Some people are complaining about the fact Zemo didn't have a superpower or crazy suit and blah, blah, blah. All that jazz would have been boring because we've seen it a million times before. This film had a lot of heavy lifting to do, in that it had to juggle so many characters while giving us great action and introducing Black Panther and Spider-man. And it delivers. Anyway, my final score of the movie is an 9 out of 10. If you're going to watch just one movie this year, this is the one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>http://www.metacritic.com/user/SeanVincentCaptain America Civil War exceeds expectations to everyone waiting for this film for a long time.It's the year's best superhero film so far,out of all superhero films that will be coming out.Captain America third outing brings emotional weight and seriousness and it feels more mature than any Marvel film.The action scenes were great and executed well especially the last scene and also the airport sequence.Characters are well written and gives time to shine especially spider-man,who in my opinion the best Peter Parker/Spider-man ever put on screen even if he appears for 20 minutes in length and Black Panther who is such a great addition to the franchise .The story centers in Sokovia accords and also Bucky- Steve friendship,those two plot lines were pretty much well handled and didn't feel out of place.The Villain was good in my opinion, he was given a clear motivation and you can easily follow his plans,well some people may think he is just boring,for me he is interesting.The only problems is that some scenes,The CGI is noticeable. This film can be a mess like the other film that ha the same premise but because of the level of confidence and love for the film makes this a well written,well performed,well balanced,well paced,well edited and a fun blockbuster film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Everything 'Batman V Superman' Should Have Been!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love both Marvel and DC movie companies. I'm not one of those people that say 'this is better because of that' I like mostly all superhero flicks. When Batman V Superman came out, I was half disappointed with it. It was overly dark, dreary, random Lex Luthor side stories and weird dream sequences. The battle between Batman and Superman didn't last too long. In comes Captain America: Civil War.Civil War was the definitely the best Captain America movie in the trilogy. I remember being bored with Captain America: The First Avenger. The action scenes are great and the battle between the heroes is epic. There are so many surprises, that I don't wanna spoil them for you, but trust me when I say all the fight scenes are amazing! A year after the fight in Sokovia and dealing with Ultron, Steve Rogers, Natasha Romanoff, Sam Wilson, and Wanda Maximoff are on their own mission trying to stop a man from stealing a biological weapon. Things get disastrous and everyone blames them. The Avengers are forced to sign a Bill called the 'Sokovia Accords' stating that from now on, the Government will control all the Avengers' actions. Tony Stark agrees with it, and Steve Rogers doesn't. Pretty soon, they are all divided and begin to fight each other (mostly over the Winter Soldier) Like I said, this is what Batman V Superman should have been, but it wasn't. Civil War was a more enjoyable experience. If you love epic action and superhero movies, you'll love CAPTAIN America: CIVIL WAR!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Captain America: Civil War is essentially like a battle royale between superheroes like one has never seen before. And that too, in a way that doesn't bludgeon your senses into numb submission, like some other superhero films we've seen of late! It's full of sensational action packed scenes which prove to be an eye treat for action and the comic lovers! Iron Man and Captain America's showdown is just one of the many that will keep you absorbed in the movie. This fast-paced, intimate film is full of happy surprises; Tom Holland's Spider-Man is one. The scenes with Tom Holland's Spider-Man and Chadwick Boseman's Black Panther are some of the best in the film. They lead up to their individual movies and prove Marvel's true superpower is its casting. The movie perfectly vindicates the awesomeness of Captain America's trilogy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>AVENGERS PART 3! What BVSS should have been ..but failed to do.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Captain American 2 was a great movie, one of my favorites in the Marvel world. The fist Avengers film was a fantastic one as well.. .this one surpasses both in a way that defies convention. The plot is different in that it is adult and strong in theme. The characters are established and so we are invested in what happens to them. Usually a 3rd outing of a film is weak and disappointing, so imagine my surprise when i see this EPIC ACTION film better than the last 2 captain America movies. Which is a rare thing to do in the cinematic world. I don't want to give spoilers away, but SPIDERMAN steals the show, and BLACK PANTHER or whoever Mr. Catwoman is lol is pretty cool. At the core of the film, the theme is friendship and loyalty. Watching Iron Man VS. Captain America fight, its inevitable to not compare to that other little film that came out this year where 2 male superheroes were pinned against each other.. and one can see this IS WHAT that other film should have been. The action sequences looked incredible, the special effects fantastic and the dual loyalty we have between both teams is an excellent psychological sell for it makes us root for both teams, understand both teams and ultimately cry for both teams (no I did not cry lol) but man was i ENTERTAINED ! As the final entry in the CAP AME. trilogy, this is going out with a damm BANG!This is the definition of a blockbuster film. (ps. ANTMAN WAS KIND OF AWESOME)Final Grade A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Loved it- most entering film made for a while</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Civil war is one of the best Marvel Films made. It's just so entertaining. If you want to be entertained by awesome fight scenes, this is defiantly the film for you. If you want some sort of emotional impact along with awesome fight scenes and quick humour, Civil war should be the first film you see. It's interesting, emotional and awesome. All the characters you already have met on the silver screen- Ironman, Captain America, Antman etc... are great. They are looked at from all perspectives- we see their flaws along with their powers. The new characters are a bit of a hit and a miss. Black Panther was my favourite character of the film, and was really nice to see him fight it out on the big screen. However, Spiderman was less of a spectacle. Tom Hollands version of Peter Parker is oddly irritating, and actually made me despise the character, just wishing he would leave the screen. The look of Spiderman was fine, but every time he spoke and said something utterly stupid, it made me want to shoot the screen. But besides Tom Hollands Spiderman, the rest of the characters are interesting and accurately portrayed.The filmmaking skills displayed by Joe and Anthony Russo are brilliant. But don't expect anything too flashy as this is a blockbuster Hollywood film. But they certainly do their job well, and should be credited more for the films success then they have been. Ian Johnstons Captain America: The First Avenger was good, but it lacked an epic feel that the Russo brothers then gave to the Winter Soldier. Coming into civil war, we shouldn't have expected anything better then the Winter Soldier, but we did get better. The epic Russo vibe was clearly evident in this film, and for this 'vibe' alone, Civil War is the superior film to Batman VS Superman.Personally, I don't see it as "Marvel VS DC". I see them all as just comic book movies, even though I'm more inclined to enjoy DC films then Marvel. I loved Dawn of Justice, but Civil War tops it. It has more well constructed action sequences, and compared to Dawn of Justice, we love both of the heroes clashing(Ironman and Captain America) as they both have reasonable heroic reasons for their actions, compared to Supermans selfish, almost villainous ones. But having said this, both films are brilliant, and great in different aspects.Overall, Civil War is an amazing film, and quite possibly the most entertaining film of 2016, and one of the greatest marvel films ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This One Owns the Hype</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Long story short, Civil War delivers on expectations in a way that one might be hesitant to hope for. It's basically everything that it needs to be, and those are a lot of things. Wrapping up the excellent Captain America trilogy with heart and integrity; evolving the Avengers as a team; and introducing new characters Black Panther and Spider-Man in ways that build momentum and interest for their own respective, upcoming films.This is one of the most packed, busy films that I have ever watched, so much so that it could be a point of criticism if it wasn't handled so well, if the many parallel stories weren't woven together with such grace and sensitivity. Terrific job by the writers, directors and editors. This is how it's done, and even though it is a Captain America film, it's also the best Avengers film yet.Action, humor, philosophical discussions about superheroing, tension, emotion, it's all here. I might not be disposed to hand out a perfect ten/ten score, but really I emerged from this screening satisfied by the experience and energized for the next one. It's beating a dead horse to say so, but a certain other big film this year failed hard to elicit those two things in me. Civil War, on the other hand, gets it done with style and substance. Very good stuff.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In just a word it was the best movie in the captain America trio, but the sense of humour in the movie was a bit awful...I mean to say, the UN how can blame Avengers for dying of innocents, during their fights? Every one knows with whosoever with the Avengers are fighting, no one in the world can, if the Avengers won't save them there would be much more causalities, is it not good if they get save a fraction?I accept that they let Ultron destroy sokovia, but if they have not took an action everything might have end..so there's a bit sense lacking that such a big organisation like UN would actually not do, blaming Avengers, instead of seeing what they have done for all.I'm with Cap.All hail Cap!Got really amazed at the end when it came to know that bucky killed Howard and Maria Stark, and it was the only sense part of the movie for Tony getting angry and beating Buck.But overall the movie lacked sense, they prisoned the mighty heroes who saved the world.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Captain America: Civil WarCaptain America and Iron Man have to very different ideals about how the avengers should work. Iron Man wants everyone to be in check since they've killed so many people and he feels bad. Captain America knows what happens when good people do nothing and doesn't want government telling him who to save and who to not.The Russo brothers directed both this movie and Winter Soldier, the precursor to this movie. I've only see that and The Community, and so far they've done nothing wrong for met yet. The direction of this movie must have been a massive undertaking and for that I applaud them.Christopher Markus must have done a ton of research into the Civil War event because there are so many amazing shots in the film that he must have wrote in. I can't wait for Infinity War since he's also writing the screenplay.The cast in this film is a mile long and a mile deep. Each character gets their own screen time but not without taking away from this being Captain America's movie. It all felt like this was his story and yes there are other characters and here are what they're doing. It didn't feel like a three act movie but more like 4 or 5 almost. Leaving the film I felt almost exhausted with details to think about.Newcomer Black Panther, played by Chadwick Boseman. I first saw this young actor in Draft Day and man he played that part well, he's showing his range and why he deserves to be in the avengers. Tom Holland was by far the definitive and best Spider-man we've had. I say this having loved Andrew Garfield's performance, but he felt too old and not funny enough. Tom Holland encapsulated what I felt was a genuine performance and quotable spider-man.Emily VanCamp kinda disappointed me. I don't want to say this film is flawless and she along with Daniel Bruhl also were some of the downfalls that keep this film from being the best Super Hero movie. I kept waiting for Sharon Carter (VanCamp) to do something and it all felt mute in the end.The Easy list. Best Captain America. Best Winter Soldier Best Falcon Best Scarlet Witch A great Iron Man A great Ant-Man Meh Black Widow Meh War Machine Meh Hawkeye Disappointing Vision Disappointing Crossbones.Verdict: Everyone should watch the film. There's barely any cursing and the violence is not over the top. Some scenes are: "what's the importance of this?" few scenes later, "Oh, okay well that makes sense."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun superhero action adventure goes out with a bang</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's that time of the year again when the theaters flood with the mega-budget summer blockbusters that scale the mountain at the box office, and Marvel superhero flicks are no strangers to this. After the successful but disappointment of DC's 'Batman Vs Superman' early this spring, many fans were hoping to see a comeback in the superhero genre, this third installment of the highly successful Captain America franchise pays off not only defying expectations but even improving upon its predecessor. With Joe and Anthony Russo turning to the directors' chairs, this superhero action flick sees Chris Evans reprising the role of the titular character along with Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man, Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow, Anthony Mackie as Falcon, Don Cheadle as War Machine, Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye, Elizabeth Olson as Scarlet Witch, and Paul Bettany as Vision. Taking the place after the events of 'The Avengers: Age of Ultron', the team has fallen under massive political scrutiny by the government for all the damage resulted in their battles against the threats. In response, the government passes a bill that puts limits on the superheroes actions requiring them to work under government surveillance. Tony Stark (Iron Man) and the team agree with bill and sign it, Steve Rogers (Captain America) in the other hand disapproves of it and chooses to go outside the law. When Steve Rogers refuses to turn in Bucky Barnes (played by Sebastian Stan) who is wanted by the government, this leads an all-out conflict between the team. Newcomers joining the cast include Tom Holland as Spider-Man, Paul Rudd as Ant-Man, and Chadwick Boseman as Black Panther. The film bears strong similarities to Batman Vs Superman in terms of plot as deals with the tension between two heroes, only Civil War manages to execute the plot more effectively and cohesive. As the plot sets in, the heroes come face-to-face with government officials who give an disheartening inside look of all the damage caused by their actions and the lives lost in result of the battles. In many superhero flicks, mass destruction of a city has become a gimmick in the genre. But the first time in the genre, this gimmick is actually acknowledged by our heroes who grow genuine sympathy for the damage that costs. From there on, the story dives deep into the politics of managing the team and the debate that ensues when Captain America develops a cold shoulder against the government's decisions and the team's agreement. In the end, whether you agree with the government's plan to impose the limit on the superheros' action or Captain America's disapproval for the plan becomes the question. Thanks to our brilliant writers, the story does a great job at balancing the dispute between the heroes and the inference of the political actions to the point where many will find it easy to see both sides of the argument. Furthermore, the film strives some incredible, prolonged action sequences while leaving enough room to flesh out most of the characters. The humanity in the characters is put on the spot, and made to be believable. Yes, this film is a bit crowded in its roster of characters but with it's smart screenplay it manages to work.When comes a superhero actioner comes some of exciting, pulse-pounding action sequences sparkled with not only tense special effects and CGI but powerfully choreographed stunt work. As viewers come expectations, the action scenes are fun to play watch, and serve as the biggest eye-catchers. And no one should the forget the incredible special effects or even the outstanding fight choreography featured in a scene with Black Widow in one scene at the beginning. No one can argue the stunt doubles' amazing talent in some of the fight scenes. Arguably the best scene in the film takes place at an airport where all our heroes engage in an all-out battle filled outstanding FX and some hilarious dialogue thrown out by the characters, particularly Spider-Man who is given much more comedic portrayal than in the previous Spiderman entries. The actors are quite clever in their roles as ever, and do almost nothing to disappoint. Tom Holland is surprisingly good as Spider-Man considering the roles in his last filmography. Whether his portrayal is better than Andrew Garfield's or Tobey Maguire's is debatable. Nonetheless, he nails it.Captain America: Civil War is a fun and outstanding start to this summer of big-budget blockbusters, and another astounding achievement in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. This film is destined to reach massive numbers at the box office, even by those who may not be grown fans of the Marvel superheroes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Captain America: Civil War" is an exciting and very satisfying entry into the Marvel Cinematic Universe.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Marvel sure has things figured out (which is a statement likely made in recent years by many a Movie Fan ? and the folks at DC ? with a few expletives thrown in for emphasis)! If there were any lingering doubt, it has certainly been erased by "Captain America: Civil War" (PG-13, 2:26). While the DC Extended Universe has had moderate success with their early films featuring and bringing together their stable of comic book characters, the Marvel Cinematic Universe began Phase Three of its grand plan with "Civil War" (the 13th MCU movie) and is making money almost faster than the government can print it. While the first two "Avengers" movies sit comfortably in the top 10 on the list of all-time box office champs worldwide, DC's "Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice" doesn't even make the top 40. "Civil War" made over $250 million worldwide before its first full day in U.S. theaters ? and even before opening in huge countries like China and India! The film's opening week receipts in several countries is second all-time only to "Avengers: Age of Ultron", and its trailer is second only to "Star Wars: The Force Awakens" in online views. But? does this Captain America film deserve such attention and success? "Captain America: Civil War" is the third (and planned to be the final) Captain America feature, but also feels a lot like a third Avenger's movie, with its many characters ? and its plot, which continues story lines from the most recent installment of each of those film series. This film picks up about a year after the Avengers defeated a populicidal sentient computer program which Tony Stark accidentally unleashed in "Avengers: Age of Ultron". Captain America / Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Falcon (Anthony Mackie) and Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) are in Lagos, Nigeria trying to stop Brock Rumlow (Frank Grillo) from stealing and making off with a dangerous biological weapon. In the ensuing melee, one of the Avengers, trying to save the life of one of the others, accidentally causes the deaths of several foreign aid workers.After all the death and destruction inadvertently caused the last time that the Avengers were out saving the world (from Ultron), Lagos proves to be the proverbial last straw for worried world leaders, and their planned remedy bitterly divides the Avengers. The U.S. Secretary of State, Thaddeus Ross (William Hurt), presents the group with an ultimatum ? sign the newly-negotiated "Sokovia Accords", putting the Avengers under the control of the United Nations ? or retire. As they discuss their options, this disparate group of superheroes quickly divides into opposing camps. Tony Stark / Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr.) speaks for Lieutenant Rhodes (Don Cheadle) and others who believe they should submit themselves to this international oversight. Cap speaks for Falcon (Anthony Mackie) and those who believe that they can only effectively protect people when they can operate unfettered. So, the battle lines are drawn.Almost 200 nations (and some of the Avengers) sign the agreement, but it's quickly put to the test when a bombing compels some of the Avengers to act. The accused terrorist is none other than Cap's old (very old) friend, Bucky Barnes, aka The Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan). Cap wants to bring Bucky in safely before any of Bucky's trigger-happy pursuers catch up to him. Cap gets just enough help to accomplish his goal, but it turns out that Bucky is merely a pawn in a much larger game run by Baron Zemo (Daniel Brühl). As the plot unfolds, the Avengers duke it out with both old friends and new ones joining the fray."Captain America: Civil War" is an exciting and very satisfying entry into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The movie has plenty of high-stakes, globe-trotting, hero-on-hero action, and it also has a lot of heart. If you think back to the first individual MCU films with Iron Man and Captain America, it may seem counterintuitive for Stark to support restrictions on the Avengers while Cap refuses to "be a good soldier" and get with the program, but we see that each of them have very clear and very personal motivations for taking the positions that they take. The same is true for the other frenemy combatants, some of which elicited cheers from the audience when they first appeared on screen. Of course, if you paid attention to the film's ubiquitous trailers and/or took a good look at its posters, you know which Avengers are present, which are missing and which are new, but just in case you don't know? I won't spoil it. All I'll say is that Marvel has cast and established all of these characters exceptionally well.The action, acting and directing are all top notch, but this film's main strength is its smart script. The characters' personalities, powers and previous activities are remarkably consistent in their presentation and are seamlessly blended in a big, but simple story which makes sense and gives each character his or her due. The dialog is a great combination of insightful, fun and funny. The movie seems to borrow from the "Bourne" movies, certain revenge flicks, and "Escape Plan", while the story is similar to DC's 2016 hero-against-hero film "Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice", but "Captain America: Civil War" does it better and has a dynamic and tone all its own. It'll entertain fanboys and average Movie Fans alike. "A"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie helps set up phase 3 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and shapes the relationships between the main heroes. The fight scenes in Civil War are amazing. The airport scene was greatly choreographed and performed (although 1-2 shots were really bad - Ironman and War Machine clearly standing in front of a green screen)The use of Antman, Spiderman and Black Panther helped the movie quite a lot. Without them, the movie would be average.One thing I did not like was the use of the villains in the movie. Although Daniel Bruhl portrays Zemo good enough, his character plan and the final section of the movie are solely based on luck. How could he know what would happen during the fight between team Ironman and team Cap, and that later on Tony, Steve and Bucky would all turn up where he was (In Russia). Crossbones was underwhelming during his short appearance. Overall it is a really good Marvel movie, but it should have had a different title since the Civil War comic is on a different level.</fullReview>

The history, the acting, the action was very well done and consistent, from the car chase scene to the GIANTMAN reveal and final battle,kept me smiling throw the movie. Zemo is one of the top villains of the MCU more human and not like the average villain which tend to have the same powers as the heroes, he's a mastermind that does not steal the show but is key to develop the movie. This villain has plausible motivation, and succeed to damage the avengers more than any other villain ever. Spiderman ant man, and black panther were great but needed a little more development . At the end you can feel how this universe is different, the impact of War Machine accident is devastating for Ironman definitely a great choice, a death may ended up to be another irrelevant death like quicksilver's. I give it a 9 because the beginning could've been better, and some characters like Antman, Spiderman and Black panther were good but didn't have the best approach.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>(Spoiler Review) The greatest (all-stars) action sequence of comic-book movie history.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Characters (Pros &amp; Cons)Captain America: (Pro) The very self-less and righteous man turned toward his own way and in the end, protecting himself and those he counts on above an ever changing propaganda, we see Steve Rogers' proclaimed stature throughout the movie with enough evidence to uphold his ideology. (Con) His character strayed upon a different route that confuses audiences at certain times.Iron-Man: (Pro) Tony is forcefully taken to a position to agree to the terms of what he initially declines with, he inclines to create a trustworthy opposition to accept the problem and creates his own ideal plan for the future. (Con) His character embodies the very emotion that grips the audience's mood with the other given character that has his name on the title (Captain America) and overwhelms it completely.Black Panther: (Pro) T'Challa's character is introduced in an interesting approach, he has his own agendas throughout the movie, although the audiences see him as a ally of Tony, we get reminded that he is passively moving on his own. (Con) We did not get any acclaimed scenes of him creating connections with the rest of the Avengers we already know, but we have yet to see his true potential until Black Panther's standalone movie comes out.Vision: (Pro) We get his view of his trusted allies, especially with Scarlet Witch, we get a intimate relationship being kick started which gives the question from the audiences that 'Can synthetic and organic live through a sacred trust?' (Con) His involvement with the Avengers in terms of abilities and power are exponential and incomparable, because of this, his runtime are limited with the actions he takes.Scarlet Witch: (Pro) Possibly a great improvement from the last movie of her connections and her personality. Her involvement with having no full control over her power re-evaluates her own position to be feared and to be prosecuted and ideally this creates catastrophe. (Con) The same as vision but in a lesser way, her powers limits to how she has an impact on the movie in the action sequences.WarMachine: (Pro) Rhodes' character develops greatly in this movie and he gets the right runtime he deserves to complete his own severity and how he is imitated to be law-abiding and very justifying. (Con) The writers did a great job with Rhodey, and I have no problem with his character in this movie.Falcon: (Pro) Sam Wilson's character continues to be a great asset in this third installment, the way he interacts with each character, either giving his own opinions or suggestions greatly justifies his character within the main story. The actions sequences he is in really puts entertainment of a superhero to another level. (Con) He places a great deal of position within Captain America's way to act and I saw no flaw upon to which he may have shown in this movie.Black-Widow: (Pro) Natalia as a character, continuing from the last of which saw her, undeniably creates a very juxtaposed aura upon our main characters and the way she acts throughout the film really dignifies the very connections as to how the entirety of the Avengers' relations are very grounded. (Con) Due to the lack of new gadgets, she didn't seem much of a threat to the opposing team of Captain America, and she plays her role as a standard human being without any new upgrades for the fight.Hawk-eye: (Pro) Clint's character isn't shown very long in the first act of the film, but when he is introduced in the movie, a very emotional impact drops upon the various characters that has trouble in dealing with each other's responses of the mistakes they have done. (Con) We did not get to see any improvement of his connection with dealing Wanda's adolescent nature and I would have loved to see his comedic relationship with Black Panther (although we do get to see the very start of how they met in the comics).Winter Soldier: (Pro) Bucky's internal struggle with his past and his present really resembles different outages of ideas to the audience's choice of sticking with Iron Man's decision or Captain America's. His character plays a centric point to Steve Roger's life after the passing of Peggy Carter. (Con) We did not get a very linear explanation as to how he recovers his memories in the movie but explains it systematically in different times and in different scenes.Ant-Man: (Pro) Scott Lang's character is introduced mid-way through the film when both team's lack assets to go against each individual motives, he is entrusted to be a part of the Avengers to go against 'Psycho-Assassins' and his comedic style appropriates other character's reactions. (Con) We didn't get to see his character's potential to meet Iron Man's team but his future involvement will possibly be unraveled in the upcoming 'Ant Man and Wasp' Movie.Spiderman: (Pro) This character is very much as to why a lot of people decided to watch Captain America: Civil War, Tom Holland's impersonation and his personal take on the character blew the audiences away with flying colors. His way on creating a very profound yet eccentric Spiderman squeezes the audiences for more and really gets us to become impatient until 'Spiderman: Homecoming' comes out. (Con) I did not see any flaw to this character, he is pretty much the character we see in the animated TV series but he grabs enough grounded level of spider-wit and teenager shenanigans to grab hold to how Spiderman really is shown.I had to delete Baron Zimo, Cross-bones and Agent 13 in this review because of the stupid 1000 word limit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my humble opinion, this is the finest super-hero movie made to date. Is it perfect? No. Does it come close? I think so. I found it superior to both Avengers movies (which I loved), and certainly far superior to Batman vs. Superman: Dawn of Justice. I think that DC still have a way to go to match the MCU. The fight scenes in this film are exciting, and the action seems to flow seamlessly. The storyline is good, and there are a couple of good twists. Even though so many super-heroes appear on screen at the one time during the main fight sequence between the two sides, it never seems as though the audience has been given too much sensory input. My advice to you super-hero fans out there is to make sure you see this movie on the big screen.......twice! After the movie was over, the fan buzz was overwhelmingly positive.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Marvel movie ever( Both Marvel Cinematic Universe and other unofficial films)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have just seen Captain America: Civil War this morning and i have to say, it was amazing! I am just going to mention some aspects of the film, so this won't be a long review. OK, here we go. Firstly, it continues to bring the thrills from The Winter Soldier( A great movie!), which I really appreciated, and the joy like other Marvel Cinematic Universe movies. Yes, Civil War might have been quite tense, but the humor still blended in and ease the tense( I am talking about you, Parker!). Second, the plot was very impressive. It continued to deliver the story like Winter Soldier did: Easy to understand, but full of surprises and elements that can make the difference( The video that showed how Tony's parents were murdered, the weird red notebook of Hydra,...).This plot is way better than that of Batman v Superman( Sorry, DC fans, but that movie sucks). More impressive, Civil War's story line had a bunch of characters, but the way each appeared didn't mess the movie up, they only make the movie better. And finally, the action sequences. They were stunning! I loved the battle scene at the airport, especially when Ant-man enlarged or Spider-man showing off his amazing skills). However, this movie seems to be more like an Avenger film rather than Cap film. I know I haven't really shown how awesome Captain America: Civil War is, but I just want to make a suggestion for anyone looking for a good, no, a masterpiece in theaters: This movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Action Pack Marvel Movie &amp; Captain America 3 Is The Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First I have to say big thanks to the Russo Brothers for doing a fantastic job directing this film as this film contain lots of very good action pack scenes mostly the fight and chase scenes and bring lots of Marvel's top character's together for one of Marvel big Comic issues. The Russo Brothers did a great job turning Captain America saga around with the huge success of Captain America 2 the Winter Soldier and now this film big time. Marvel have once again done a great job with bring Their version of Peter Parker aka Spiderman as he is so funny and half the time is so childish because of his age and just stupid. Kids are going to love Spiderman big time, so please if you have kids go and take them to watch this film big time. In the comics and the animated fox kid show, Peter Parker is very childish and likes Captain America and also likes Tony Stark. I was so wrong and glad as Tom Holland does a great job acting as young Peter Parker and Spiderman. Also Marvel thank you for selecting Chadwick Boseman to act as Black Panther. He was very good, had some good fight scenes between him and the Winter Solider. Oh man and how can I forget Paul Rudd who acts as Ant-Man. He was just as funny as he was in the Ant-Man movie. I loved that part where we get to see Ant-Man bigger. The main reason to watch this film is for the big marvel battle. The battle of freedom between Captain America and Iron Man. Tony Stark VS Steve Rogers. Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr. are very great at acting together and bring both these two Marvel character's to life. Having read the graphic civil war novel and watching this film, Marvel have take some elements from the comic and put it in this film. The fight scenes between Captain America and Iron Man was just too good for me and stress as one minute it looks like Captain America is going to win and in the next minute Iron Man is going to win. The amount of emotion thrown into this film pretty much told the story of this film, we can to see a more serious Tony who does not want to do this but has no choice while Captain America does not want to follow the new rules and always goes by his gut feeling.Do you need to watch all marvel films to understand this film ? Yes and No, you only need to watch Captain America to know who Steve Rogers and Bucky is. In Captain America 2 you find out that shield has gone down and you learn that hydra have always been there and you really do understand why he is against Tony in this film. You should watch Iron Man 1 to know who Tony Stark is and also watch Avengers 1 and 2 to know who the rest of the character's and to fully understand what the government takes action against the Avengers.I am going to give this film 5/5 Stars as this film was brilliant and awesome.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Captain America: Civil War (spoiler free) review Director(s): Anthony and Joe Russo Distributor: Disney Cast: 2 time Academy Award NomineeRobert Downey Jr.*, Chris Evans Elizabeth Olsen, Scarlett Johansson,Sebastian Stan, Anthony Mackie, Don Cheadle with 2 time Academy Award Nominee Jeremy Renner** and Chadwick Boseman.Plot: Political interference in the Avengers' activities causes a rift between former allies Captain America and Iron Man.Director brothers Anthony and Joe Russo return with the sequel to Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014). This film is action packed from start to finish and with a story to hold it all together. Another amazing entry to Marvel Cinematic Universe.After the Avengers fell apart in last years Avengers: Age of Ultron with that Captain America and Iron Man form their own team to fight for justice, although Thor and Hulk are nowhere to be seen.Here are the reasons why this is a must see: Blistering Action: Theaction scenes are very spectacular throughout with new moves from each of the heroes. The action is very fast paced and and loud which is to be expected. Which all leads up to the outstanding final fight.No Disney feel: Although this film is Disney because it is part of their MCU franchise this is more serious than the other ones, it still has the funny dialogue.This film is the start of phase 3 of the MCU and it is a wonderful start. Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman), Spider-Man (Tom Holland) and Crossbones (Frank Grillo) all make their first appearance but they don't go amiss because they make a massive impact.The dialogue is kind of slow but it is very intellectual but it's all worth it because the final battle is just extremely fun and makes the whole film worthwhile.Does this final film in the Captain America trilogy end winningly? ABSOLUTELY With blistering and mind boggling special effects this truly is a film that cannot be missed.Captain America: The Winter Soldier is I hate to say this but there nothing to this. This truly is a Marvelous spectacle to behold. 10/10 excellent not to be missed.Verdict: Definitely worth the wait and and excellent start to MCU's phase 3. Action packed from start to finish.*Best Actor in a leading role, Chaplin(1993), Best Actor in a supporting role, Tropic Thunder (2008) **Best Actor in a leading role The Hurt Locker (2008) Best Actor in a supporting role, The Town (2010)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A superhero film to enjoy, not endure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unlike a certain other superhero film recently released, 'Captain America: Civil War' is unlikely to polarize opinion. It's a Marvel film, you see, and despite being the relative newcomers to the 'film your own characters' school, they're rapidly risen to top of the class, knocking out hit after hit by simply understanding what their fans want. Civil War is no exception, and is unsurprisingly much more than a 'who would win in a fight between...' punch fest.Although Cap gets title billing here, Civil War is basically Avengers 3, following directly on from Age Of Ultron. We open with The Avengers kicking are as usual, but again as usual it's impossible to avoid civilian casualties when there's guns and bombs all over the place. One explosion later and the team are basically ordered to become an official task force, answerable to that most despicable of things: a committee. Tony Stark sees the sense in this, whilst Cap doesn't trust people to not have self interest and also to allow them to react quick enough. There's only one way to settle this...So the scene is set, as The Avengers split into pro and anti factions. To actually get fists flying, however, you need a reason. Enter The Winter Soldier, last seen disappearing after saving Cap in The Winter Soldier movie. With Bucky seemingly to blame for a terrible international incident, Cap decides to grab him before the officials can, setting him squarely against Iron Man, now firmly doing what he's told. Cue stand off...As I said earlier, this is much more than a simple series of hero on hero scraps, although the main one is a doozy. Not only do we get our usual Marvel suspects, but there's also the introduction of The Black Panther and a certain kid in a red and blue onesie. Both are handled exceptionally well, and you will be gagging for the Black Panther movie by the end, not to mention 'Spider-Man: Homecoming' in 2017. Add to this a nice return to the screen for Paul Rudd's Ant Man and the two and a half hours (yes, really) will fly by.Much like the last Captain America film, Civil War gives a damn about plot, and a decent amount of time is spent actually having one and talking about it. The Winter Soldier is once again the device that gives the plot momentum, and poor old Bucky looks like he'll never escape his Hydra brainwashing. Whilst it's a Captain America film, Tony Stark and Iron Man are given plenty of screen time as Stark's demons are fully explored, pushing him towards an inevitable showdown. Again, it's a pretty serious film, but unlike a certain other film it finds time to make you smile as well. I mean, who'd make a two and a half hour superhero film without any light moments at all? Oh yeah....Bold, bright, brash and brilliant, 'Captain America: Civil War' stand up alongside Marvel's other movies, and whilst some have said it's the best yet, I'd say it depends on what you're looking for. The joy of the Marvel movies is that they each tend to have something different, and to compare this to, say, 'Guardians Of The Galaxy' is pretty daft. Suffice to say it's faults are few and far between, it maintains a large cast without short changing anyone, and it's not full of plot holes. Chris Evans remains as perhaps the best piece of casting in the superhero genre, with new Spidey Tom Holland and Black Panther Chad Boseman each owning the screen as nervy kid and moody warrior respectively. Once again, when asked what kind of comic based films work best, the answer is 'make Mine Marvel'. Excelsior!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Civil war shows how an ensemble comic book hero movie SHOULD be done. The CGI in this movie didn't look like CGI - the airport scene - shows how a superhero movie with multiple main characters SHOULD be done! No doubt you've read all the critics reviews, and by and large they are RIGHT!But CGI alone cannot carry a film (again one of the major flaws in BvS). The story itself is compelling. You can watch this film and enjoy it without watching any other Marvel movie, but it is SO more satisfying to get all the backstory!Words wont do this movie justice - WATCH IT - ENJOY IT - you won't be disappointed!It gets 9/10 because NO film can ever be perfect!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly a "Captain America 3", not a "Avengers 2.5"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For those of you who complain about screen time for some characters, look at the title one more time. It's called "CAPTAIN America: Civil War" for a reason. Sure it features a lot of Marvel heroes, but the conflict between Cap and Iron Man is the main deal here and it's really awesome. And the trailers barely scratched the surface. Near the end when you think there's gonna be hugs and kisses, the plot twists again and on a WERY personal level. And you don't get a happy ending this time. This movie shows that a small wery personal and emotional battle can be just as good or even better than a big epic battle where cities get leveled to the ground (or dropped from the sky).And personally i loved the villain, Zemo. He might not get much screen time, but again the conflict between Cap and Iron Man is the main deal here, and thats exactly what Zemo wants, as he knows he can't stand up to them himself. And his motives is much more down to earth and realistic which almost makes you feel sorry for him in the end.Infinity War is in good hands with the Russo's.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never thought Marvel Studios could set the bar this high. Captain America Civil War is a total package. Entertaining, action- packed, humorous and an emotional ride. It's just a bonus if you've invested your time starting from the first Iron Man up to now to get attached to the characters, but it's not necessary.The airport battle royal between our favorite super heroes is the crowning moment of the film. The action sequences in that particular scene, plus the surprises, is one of the best I've seen in a comic book movie. Although every action sequence throughout the movie is nearly on par, if not on the same level. It's just that seeing a lot of characters going at each other is much more enjoyable.Black Panther, Spider-Man and Ant-Man were also highlights of the film, but everyone did an amazing job and had their deserved screen time. Some will definitely disagree with me on this one but as for Zemo, his role manipulating and working behind the scenes worked for me.For others saying this is Avengers 2.5, I didn't feel that way. I still felt this was a true sequel to Captain America The Winter Soldier (only partly, AoU). The conflicting ideologies of our two main heroes is still the focus of the whole movie and everything was balanced perfectly.To sum it up, this is arguably Marvel's best movie to date, and one of the best CBMs of all time. I can't wait for the solo outing of Black Panther and Spider-Man, and how the world of the MCU progresses from here.P.S. Honestly, I'm now having doubts that they can top this one with their line-up of upcoming solo movies, until maybe Infinity War. LOL!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lives Up To Expectations While Setting New Ones</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With fourteen box office successes to work off of, Marvel brings in their entire roster of superheroes (minus a few notable green and godly ones) to battle it out. Unlike DC's Batman v Superman, both sides have reasons, instead of just intentions, to fight, all heroes were highlighted just enough to be enjoyed, and newcomers (the fantastic T'Challa and AMAZING, if I may, Spider-Man) are balanced out just enough to be spotlighted, while still setting hopes high for standalone films. Besides a plethora of heroes to experiment with, this film also offers a brand new villain, Zemo. Quite different from his inspiration Baron Von Zemo from the comics, this villain is the first villain in the MCU (besides the never-ending god of mischief) to have survived his first film. Altogether, this film is enjoyable to anyone who stumbles upon it, but seeing all Avengers- storyline films will help some plot holes.I haven't scratched the surface of this film's excellence, but it sure is one you won't want to miss.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Captain America: Civil War was a phenomenal movie. It's perfect blend of Action, Comedy, and Adventure made for a great story. The key to this film was the perfect combination of the plot and all star lineup. Many movies lack a good combo of both, however this movie is an exception. The story of the movie will keep you guessing, laughing, and wide eyed the whole time. My fear was that it would be hard to follow for a person who hadn't watched the previous movies. This is a movie where previous knowledge will help, but isn't completely required. The movie is enjoyable for anyone. The cast complemented each other well and the new additions (hint hint) were great. For action i give the movie a 9 on a scale of 1-10. For the comedy aspect I give it a 10. A 9.5 would be more accurate for the rating. For my recommendation i would have to say........ go see it ASAP! Don't wait for it to come out on DVD, go see it in the theater and enjoy what I believe is the greatest movie of the year thus far!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Robert Downey, Cartoonish Action and Logic, Dumb Finale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*Spoilers ahead*The Good: 1. Robert Downey steals every scene he's in. 2. Vision is interesting. 3. The recruitment of Spiderman was funny and the highlight of the movie.The Bad: 1. Too many characters with no character development, motive, or dialogue. Probably used to sell more toys. 2. A civil war where nobody dies, nobody dislikes each other, everybody going through the motions. Felt like watching a cartoon from the Disney Channel.3. Nonsensical fight scenes. For example in his fight with Captain America, Iron Man doesn't use his capability to fly nor does he shoot straight. If logic was too be followed, Iron Man's suit would overwhelm Captain America's shield. And didn't he have a whole army of Iron Men to help him. What happened?4. Government is just too dumb and clueless. They can't even hold prisoners in a fortress in the middle of the ocean. Pleeaaase!5. Big ending let down. The whole point of this elaborate (and probably expensive scheme) was to show a video. Why not just send Iron Man a Youtube link? Dumb!!Summary: Story is better than Avengers Age of Ultron and Iron Man 3 (which is a low bar). However action sequences are more cartoonish than the first Avengers and a recent superhero movie. Don't believe the critic ratings which make this appear as a better film than the Godfather. Its not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marvel delivers it's trump card!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Civil War is a standalone movie drenched in a stupendous show of power, ideologies and action weaved into a meaningful plot and crafted with finesse by the Russo brothers.Oh Captain! My Captain!Captain America is the luckiest Avenger in the Marvel Cinematic Universe for three reasons. The number one being he never ages (Come on man! that's pretty cool. Imagine what you would do with that!), Secondly, he had to deal with only one real villain in his entire trilogy of films, and that also was kinda non existent (Red Skull was as ugly as he was stupid), and thirdly and finally, because two of his three films were directed by two visionary directors who appreciate the very aesthetics of Comic Book movies, and are not afraid to challenge the formulaic plot boiler; The Russo BrothersCaptain America: Civil War is a blockbuster, in every sense of the term but not because of Captain America or his prehistoric ideals, it is because of the dangerous and colorful array of characters that join him in this movie. Each scene and subplot are taken care with sterling craftsmanship, and not for even once you are made to feel that the story exists only to give mold to the action sequences. (Zack Snyder, are you listening?). Age of Ultron shoved a tremendous amount of information into our faces, which the Russo brothers slyly avoid. You can separate between the arc of story you should be following and the one that is on a need-to-know basis. The distinctions between the ideals of Captain America and Iron Man are clearly stated from the first arrival of either characters. We all had a little concern over how they would fit Bucky as the reason for the entire devastating stand off, but as it turns out, the film is actually Captain Buchanan Barnes: T'Challa War. Because both The Winter Soldier and Black Panther had a lot more to add than we were promised in the trailers. And nobody's complaining!Chadwick Boseman as Black Panther has been a perfect example of casting. His grave, ideological approach to the Civil War is often needed, as he is the only character who supports neither Tony or Steve, but is dead set on his set of notions, which he carries on till the end. Tom Holland does a beautiful job as the new Spiderman. His quick witted replies, inquisitiveness in this hyper mumbo jumbo is often veered towards caricature but that is actually what Spiderman is all about. He is the guy who jokes about the Infinity Gauntlet as an 'old fashioned glove' on Thanos' face. So clearly we finally have a Spiderman which is much closer to the comics, not disagreeing to the fact that Tobey McGuire will always have a special place in our hearts. (Come on, Andrew Garfield was ehh!)The tiff between Steve and Tony is something that will really claw you nerves. Even if you are steadfast on a single team, several moments will question your own decision making? Is Captain actually right? Does Tony actually mean well? there are moments when the singular line of their motives are blurred but each of them are stuck with their own set of beliefs, something each responsible and powerful being must do.The airport fight sequence is hands down the best superhero action sequence you will ever see. And kudos to the duo for taking even a handful of characters from the universe so vast and creating such a perfect film. The only problem which I had with the movie that it was supposed to be the end of a Captain America trilogy; but honestly Steve reaches nowhere near closure. Maybe that was intentional, something to ponder upon, is a concrete ending necessary or is the legacy of Captain America as vast as his courage?Captain America: Civil War is a magnum opus, something which changes the way you approach something fictional by incorporating it into the part and parcel of the world, and yet it does it with such splendour, you often wish it was true!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Up for the title of "Greatest Comic Book Movie Of All Time"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie gave me everything I wanted and more. It contains the greatest action fight scene in any superhero movie without a doubt (Airport scene). All the heroes had a time to shine, with Spiderman, Antman, and Black Panther stealing the show in my opinion. The plot was complex and deep, with Zemo being a pretty good villain, despite not being anything like his comic counterpart. The comedy hit hard when it needed to, but this movie contains the most heart and deep conflict compared to any MCU movie. The acting was phenomenal from the spectacular cast. Chadwick Boseman played an amazing Black Panther, but it was Tom Holland aka THE GREATEST SPIDERMAN OF ALL TIME that took my breath away with his performance. This was the film we had all been waiting for and it exceeded my expectations, becoming my favorite comic book movie of all time, which previously was the Winter Soldier and the Dark Knight. I give all the props to the Russo brothers and completely trust them for Infinity War. I give this movie a 10/10 and I can't wait to watch it a couple more times.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So we have captain America 3 is a avengers in disguise minus Thor and hulk that would drop any film down from ten to 8.5 but we have fine comic and action paring in the new incarnation of spider man and a new character of black panther to bring the film up 2to 10:out of ten. this film improves on Ultron even though that was a marvelous film but this is a lean and busy smart story which is also very strong indeed the jokes are left to the new characters as the main story is brilliant so no need for them here as it's a civil war as captain America played by ever evolving Chris Evans he is the spiritual leader of the avengers but he jealousy of iron man tony stark who buys everything. so he is being undermined by him so with that out of the way we have a James bond style opening where we have captain America the black widow falcon and a drone chasing targets in Lagos so with hydra trying for wmd and there bad on the loose causing issues for the team chasing these targets a mishandle effort causing collateral damage the UN and world leaders want to reign in the superheroes only do dived the team in two iron man, black widow war machine on one side of the accord then on the other other captain America Scarlett witch hawkeye falcon and the vison and ant man and the newbies introduced get some of the comic relief in between the action to cause a stir but as captain America thinks he being boxed in and no freedom Tensions start to flare and to make he is emotional due to a loss of a figure head in the founding of shield. and things get worse, in that the Captain's old friend Bucky Barnes aka The Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan) appears his mind gets altered like he hypnotized so he lining up another high profile assassination. The ensuing chaos quickly drags the rest of The Avengers into the mix as everyone starts to take sides in a fight no one wants to be having. Both characters make a big impact both in their introductions and their roles in the plot as it unfolds. The story itself also makes some clever twists and turns along the way. Just when I thought things were getting predictable and eye-rolling cheesy it all changed and created a new dynamic of for the characters involved. Fight scenes are scattered throughout and serve to dazzle and amaze with a surprising amount of humour thrown in along the way. So with winter solder being captain America old alley his background has changed his mind alters like a switch and captain America side with him causing a few twist in this film takes his vengeance out causing captain America to save his friend ultimately leading a 2 on 1 situation causing no end of harm a and also a old figure head in captain America life gone changes his belief and alters his taught process. and old fashioned car chase ensues with the with the having his own agenda black panther chases the winter solder and captain to fight it out during the chase with the law not far behind. after this a past haunts and hurts iron man down to his guilt and that cause grief so much that he takes his vengeance out causing captain America to split the team as hydra suicide bombing in Europe and so with law enforcements chasing around trying to bring justice reign in the collateral damage and when the sides come together to get there points across to look for a peacefull resolution, as we get the civil war choosing who side is who on but there's a pivitol moment in the film when the side realize that 2 against one who will stand and fight for a friend or who will fall and die trying or will the political motivations get the interfere. with Marvel films in 2016 is that this is now the 13th film in their current ongoing cinematic universe. Your enjoyment of any of the Avengers films or this Captain America film will largely be affected by how many of the previous films you have seen and paid attention to. The character development is great but it takes place over a number of films and isn't suited to anyone looking to drop in for a quick superhero flick. With this being the last "main" story film before the third Avengers movie in 2018, a lot of things are left open. Not everyone gets to live happily ever after, and that's a good thing, but with two films every year Marvel movies are going from strength to strength . Whether or not they can keep the momentum going again through a number of solo films remains to be seen. Captain America : Civil War is now showing in every cinema imaginable and is absolutely recommended viewing, but only if you've actually seen some of the recent ones. the story lines are big the big wow moment is here is well 2hrs17 Min's and two end of credits sequence stay right to the end as well the characters are a strong as ever 10/10 ill leave the spoilers out as impacts on the story.</fullReview>

If you were to ask me to rate the comic book movies of all time I'd put Dark knight in number 1 position and rest of the comic book movies at number 2 position. But after watching Civil war, I'm changing my list a little. Captain America civil war to be included in number 1 position along with Dark knight and rest of the comic book movies at number 2. Reason, why? Well you gotta watch the movie to understand. Antman and Spiderman steals the show with ease. Every frame where they appear is simply awesome. Black Panther character is highly justified with almost near identical costume as how he appears in comics and Boseman's Panther steals the show. Giant man does appear in movie but why he becomes a giANT man, sorry guys, can't spoil that. Wait till the end of the movie to catch the glimpse of homecoming. My fav is TeamCap but I don't think it matters. At the end of movie, when you finally walk out of theatre, you'll fall in love with every single character, especially Winter Soldier.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hey guys! I'm come from Thailand ,so sorry if my English isn't so well. But I just watched Captain America: Civil War and I wanna write some reviews to you. This is one of the best movie that I've ever watched. It makes me feel like when I watched The Avengers but the different thing is in this movie,there isn't any villain. I think that both of them are true. No matter who you like because you'll hesitate when you come out of cinema that whose side are you really on?! The action scenes are so incredible.I really adore The Russo Brothers! So the last thing that I wanna tell you is...please go to cinema and watch it,I know it'll be worth it!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Lit Up Marvel Cinematic Universe movies &amp; The Best Superhero Movie of 2016</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Captain America Civil War had made me cried during the end fight. There are aspects which is totally awesome by Joe Russo and Anthony Russo film.1. StorylineWay to go . The storyline is superb compared to Age Of Ultron which is kinda messy and it is slightly better than The Winter Soldier. Plus, the total 'tear them from the inside' by Baron Helmut Zemo is really getting my nerves.2. Acting Yeah Lord Robert Downey Jr. did the best as usual as Iron Man as well as Chris Evans. I'm quite shocked because I actually underrated Tom Holland act as Spider Man and the result is fascinating because HE DID WELL AS SPIDERMAN AND TRUST ME HE'S THE BEST SPIDERMAN EVER COMPARED TO ITS PREDESSOR3. 'The fight scene' The fight scene at the airport are WAYY UP HIGH . But for me, I really enjoy the final battle which Iron Man face off Captain America and Winter Soldier. That battle really makes my nerve cold and honestly I cried when Cap didn't even kill Tony instead he destroyed the reactor when he deliver the final blow *goshSo far, Civil War is the greatest MCU movies up to date and surpassed The Winter Soldier. I have no problem to rate it 10/10 because I watched it 3 times and still can feel the hype in this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Russo Brothers strike gold again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had high expectations when I saw the trailers of this movie, and the hype surrounding Spider-man, and I wasn't disappointed. The best part of the movie is that they finally address the collateral damage that is done when the Avengers fight the bad guys. Marvel had been criticized for not showing civilian deaths in Avengers and other movies, unlike DC who are more realistic and like to go dark, but this movie addresses it.The government wants The Avengers to sign an accord, so that their actions aren't unchecked anymore. Everything they would do would be under the orders of the government, but Steve Rogers isn't pleased about it and wants the Avengers to remain an independent, private body. That's the main theme of the movie. And it's executed well. Two conflicting opinions, over who's right; Tony or Steve? Both bring up strong points, so it does really get hard to choose, but after watching the movie, you'll side with Team Cap. The action and the special effects were brilliant as usual, and this movie was better than Winter Soldier. The Russo Brothers proved that they can make good, solid, mature movies, something that is uncommon typically in Marvel movies, because it's targeted at a younger audience. Tom Holland as Spider-man was funny, as he's in the comics, and almost every character gets a good amount of screen time. Bucky's a morally complex character, who feels the guilt for all he's done, and as he says in the movie to Tony, he remembers everything he's done, and that guilt is eating him away. I'd like to see how he deals with the guilt in the future movies. This one is a solid 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everything about this movie is beautiful! The acting, the story and the action! Marvel does it again with balancing out humor and seriousness when it's needed. Some characters like Spidey, Ant-Man, Iron Man and Ant-Man are supposed to be humorous. Meanwhile characters like Black Panther and Winter Soldier are serious! I love just about everything about this film and I trust in the Russo's for the next lot of Avengers films. The Airport fight scene has to be one of the best action scene in Superhero Movie history! I highly recommend this movie as it is Marvel's best movie to date! I was TeamCap before seeing the film and I walked out being torn apart.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Critics Overrated a very mediocre Civil War adaptation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, not explains why they called this film "Civil War", but it is faithful to the comic and definitely not risk killing any of the heroes. This title implies that the Capitan America should die, just talk about Domsday in Batman V Superman involving the death of Superman, which Snyder run faithfully while this might displease the critics but definitely please fans of DC.The initial history is boring and meaningless, trying to justify a fight between two sides which at the end is a fight between children with pillows as many have expressed it well. They have no conviction or motivation to do so, they have heroes who don't have no motivation, rather than obey the Capitan America and Iron Man.Spiderman is the best movie, but at the same time makes no sense that participates in the dispute which definitely can not be named as a "Civil War".In short is a mediocre film made for the pleasure of children, to which Disney knows as squeeze them tickets.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Avengers continue to fight to right wrongs, but devastation follows in their wake: New York, Washington, Sokovia, and now Lagos. The powers that be seek to put the Avengers under external control. Tony Stark, feeling guilty following the Ultron fiasco agrees, but Captain America doesn't, and the group splits. Winter Soldier/Bucky Barnes, still under conditioning, is being manipulated, and Cap seeks to protect his old friend, another factor leading to the group being fractured. Where will it all lead? Captain America's 3rd "solo" outing is an Avengers movie in all but name. There is a comic cover trope which has almost become a cliché, which shows two opposing groups of characters facing off towards each other from left and right of the cover: the Marvel Cinematic Universe has now brought us sufficient characters for that image to be given to us in the course of a film, as a dozen heroes face each other in two opposing groups.The action is great, with three or four spectacular set pieces, but this film is about much more than action. Some of the best sequences are emotional and thoughtful ? Cap's reaction at a death, Tony Stark's difficulties in dealing with assorted issues and, most of all, the discussions between the characters on right and wrong, responsibilities, and the conflicted morality of doing the right thing in the wrong circumstances. There is real meat on the bones in this one.Factor in the introduction of a couple of new characters, both of whom get substantially more than cameos, and this film rises to the top 3 of my list of favourite Marvel Cinematic Universe movies. I loved it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Russo brothers did it again, the Infinity War movies are in good hands with the Russo's. Like all marvel movies it has its comedic moments, but they mix that very well with some amazing chin dropping action. Performance-wise every actor delivers their part excellent. Standout performance being Chadwick Boseman as Black Panther. If you have been waiting for a 15 year old kid Spider-Man, well this movie won't disappoint on that front either. I also want to say the villain in this movie is one of Marvel's best so far, with exception of the Winter Soldier in the previous Captain America movie. If you are worried that the movie has to many characters, don't. All characters in this movie fit into the plot and is used very well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great way to start Phase 3</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Captain America: Civil War, revolves around the government requirement of making the Avengers a sanctioned group.Several of the Avengers are in favor of this regulation, while others oppose it. At the helm of each side, Tony Stark / Iron-Man, and Steve Rogers / Captain America.The movie also has to deal with the introduction of a new character to the cinematic universe: Black Panther; and the introduction of the newest Spider-Man to this universe. It does both in a way, that not only serves the general story of the movie, but does not feel forced or shoe-horned in. It works within the context of the movie, and because of the way its laid out.This is the way you do a film that needs to handle several things at once.The most forced inclusion in my view is Paul Rudd's Ant-Man. He's cool, and we get an extra surprise there for comic fans, but it did feel a little forced. Not too much.Getting into the movie a little more, the Russo's bring back a character from an unexpected place to play somewhat of an antagonist. General Thaddeus Ross, last seen in the Incredible Hulk movie, is again played by William Hurt now as Secretary of State, and promoter of the accord to sanction super heroes.Captain America, opposes the accords, and goes on the run, to try to find Bucky a.k.a the Winter Soldier, after Helmut Zemo re-activates Bucky's brainwashing at the hands of the Russians, to get information out of him about the Winter Soldier Program, and the other subjects that still exist in a bunker somewhere.After helping Bucky escape, Captain America and his team go to an airport to get a Quinjet to go after Zemo, who is thought wants to thaw the rest of the Winter Soldiers, and reactivate them for some nefarious purpose.The entire super-hero bonanza is unleashed as Team Cap, and Team Stark duke it out at the airport. Eventually Cap and Bucky make it to the Quinjet, and take off.The rest of team Cap is captured and imprisoned, by Secretary Ross.Stark, realizes that Bucky was framed, after the real doctor's body is found in a hotel, and Zemo's Bucky disguise is found. Stark manages to get Falcon to tell him where Cap is going, and immediately leaves for Siberia.As they arrive, Cap and Bucky, discover that Zemo has killed the frozen Winter Soldiers, as he never wanted to activate them, he was preventing any more super-powered beings from roaming the earth. As he believes it the super powered ones that caused his family to be killed during the events in Sokovia with Ultron.Zemo, plays a video where Bucky as the Winter Soldier kills Tony Stark's parents in one of his missions. This sends Tony over the edge, and he tries to kill Bucky. Cap intervenes and again they duke it out. Eventually Cap and Bucky overpower Stark, though Bucky loses his cybernetic arm in the process.Cap leaves with Bucky, and Stark takes Zemo in, after Black Panther prevents him from committing suicide.The movie really shows how you can juggle several threads, and dozens of characters at the same time, without seeming detached, forced or awkward. In the end it does not really set up much for the next Avengers movie, but delivers a fun experience overall. Even though its 2 and a half hours in length, it never feels boring or dragged. It even manages to give a heartfelt farewell to Agent Carter in the middle of everything.Yes, DC / Warner Brothers released their movie Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice just a few weeks ago, and Marvel just schooled them on how you do a superhero fight movie properly.The overall setup is the same, two powerful people duke it out, for different reasons. Dawn of Justice tried to throw too many things there instead of sticking with the main story which was their fight. Captain America: Civil War, focuses magnificently on what is driving both people, and it never seems forced, or artificially manufactured. There's also the dialogue. Captain America, always tries to talk to Tony and only resorts to physical interaction when there's nothing more to do.In all respects this is a much much better movie than BVS:DoJ. It handles its plots well. It does not go out of its way to create a fight. It gives each new character enough time to get to know them and even has focus scenes for both Black Panther and Spider-Man to showcase what they do.I wasn't so sure about another recast of Spider-Man, as I felt Andrew Garfield had done a great job with it in both films. But that second film again tried to do to much and tried to set up too much. However, I was pleasantly surprised at how well Tom Holland works with the character, and am really excited to see the stand alone film with him as Spider-Man in 2017.All in all, I think this movie works great, its a lot of fun, delivers in a lot of aspects, and still has time to not take itself too seriously, joke around a little, and gives a sold new entry into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Let Phase 3 begin.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What Batman v Superman should have been</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Captain America: Civil War is the third Captain America movie with a similar theme to the more hyped up Batman v Superman. While Batman v Superman was an enjoyable movie it failed to live up to the hype. So it was up to Captain America: Civil War to redeem the theme of superheroes facing off against each other, and I'm glad to say it did that.It has a better storyline and it delivers it much more systematically unlike Batman v Superman where it was very slow. It was also able to utilise other Marvel superheroes in a much better way than Batman v Superman. We also get a bit more background behind the characters portrayed in the movie. And the action is a lot better compared to your typical superhero movie.I really enjoyed Captain America: The Winter Soldier and thought it was the best movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. But Civil War manages to just about match it. The Russo brothers have once again managed to do a fantastic movie. The good news is that they will also be directing Avengers: Infinity Wars Parts 1 and 2 so I'm really hoping that the Marvel Cinematic Universe will be better from here on. As for DC, standards seem to have slipped since Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy. Either they need to get Nolan more involved or take a leaf out of Marvel's book if they want Justice League to be successful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Civil War: Best of Marvel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well its finally here! Many people have waited for this film. Me included. This film seems to have everything. The humour in this film hit spot on! I laughed every time. I have had enough of DC fans saying that if it's funny it can't be dramatic. Thats all bullshit. This film goes from hilarious, to (Mostly in the final act) extremely dramatic and heartfelt. Even though I am a Marvel fan boy, and I would have seen this film anyway, the main reason I had to see it so early was Spiderman. I am a massive spidey fan and to see him in the MCU was fantastic. So obviously spidey was my favorite part of the film. I think Tom Holland got the perfect balance between dorky as Peter and confident as spidey. The one thing that took me off slightly was the slight overuse of cgi for spidey. I can overlook this though and I had a great time with him. Cap again is great, but Downey showed us a whole new side of Tony which was fantastic too see. He was so dramatic and at times angry. It was new and exciting. It seems that the one problem everyone had with the film was the villain and how he was wasted. Because people had said this I was expecting some random villain to show up in the final act like Doomsday for BvS, but that wasn't the case at all. His plan was interesting and well worked and we really got a good insight of the character. For me this was one of Marvels best villains put to screen yet. And the airport scene... well what can I say. Again spidey stole the show for that too. If you thing you have seen the airport scene through the trailers, you are so mistaken. You've seen nothing yet. Black panther for some reason I thought I wouldn't like, but I really did. They some how got me to love him. The characters all got a good amount of screen time and they all got a good story arc. The action is just so much more enticing because we have motivation behind it and a good story. Overall this is my second favorite comic book film (1 being dark knight. There is just no beating that) and defiantly my favorite Marvel film yet. This is a film I could watch 1000 times and never be bored. This isn't just a fantastic comic book film. It's a fantastic film. Period.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Civil war...hold onto your seats people,because this movie is mind blowing.I personally do not watch many super-hero movies.I have a few names to mention when it comes to it,The Dark Knight trilogy still remains the best super-hero series for me.Now,I know I seriously should not be comparing DC Comic and Marvel universe,but this is exactly the case here.This movie has totally lived up to its expectation.The release of the teasers and trailers did not reveal much of a plot,but it was really well edited and subsequently became a back bone to the success of the film.The story of the film is simple and it stays simple to the very end.There are less elements of suspense throughout the movie which isn't necessarily a bad thing.For this movie,an expectation is panned out in every scene,but the director has given much more than we expect.The director has completely won in every department to capture the audience attention.The highlights of this film is the action scenes.There are three major action scenes in this film.My particular best is the fight scene at the beginning of the movie.Scarlett Johansen has rocked in some action sequences more than the others.The screenplay of the film is brilliant,I honestly did not feel time passing by while watching this 150 minute long film,in fact quite puzzled on short it was.The compelling scenes in the film makes it more interesting along the way.The music was magnificent.Kudos to the music director for understanding the script and composing great epic music.All technical aspects were well handled.Amazing cinematography and perfect VFX made this a greater level of visual experience.Final say,I watched a DC Comic movie this year,and I was totally unimpressed,now I have watched this,and it has become one of the best super-hero movies of all time,in my books.Don't go for a war,go home and watch Civil War...</fullReview>

Most of the time I had to remember he reasons that made me choose the side I was supporting, but since the movie is VERY different that the comic it was hard for me to take a desicion based only in the movie(s). The conflict is real, I felt that whatever they decide it was going to directly affect me. The only bad thing about the movie was the unnesesary villain, that actually helped to have a bigger issue than super-heroes out-of-control but his part was awfully shown.

		<shortDescription>An example on how conflict between heroes should be portrayed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Captain America: Civil War is a spectacular, character driven story that fulfils the promise of the splitting of the Avengers. Yes, it falls into some of the MCU tropes but as a film its among the greatest of the Superhero genre, and here's why:1) Action sequences - Extremely well choreographed, extremely entertaining, hilarious; the action is the quality you'd expect from Marvel by now, and the fact that the heroes are against each other makes it all the more awesome. The scenes don't take themselves to seriously and yet is serious when it needs to be whilst being extremely well-paced.2) The Villains - For once, I think Marvel nailed it. Zemo is a great villain with clear, believable motivations whose convoluted plan is probably makes just as much sense as the Joker's; Crossbones was a welcome, albeit short addition to the film.3) The new additions - The best part of the film IMO was the very well handled introductions of Spiderman and Black Panther, two fantastic heroes who I can't wait to see on screen again; I promise you will not be disappointed - Particularly Spiderman, as I am not a fan of the previous Spiderman films but this ones a keeper.4) The story - The biggest failure of BvS (and yes, it is fair to compare them) was there was no compelling motivations for the fight to make sense. In Civil War, the battle takes place because of ideological and personality differences. The previous Marvel features support the character choices and further add to and support the experience. Apart from a few inconsistencies with the plot, the script was pretty solid. 5) Humour - Marvel continues to excel at sprinkling humour where its needed to make these films lighthearted and more self aware, but further credit goes to Civil War as it knows when to stop the jokes and to support the emotional core of this film and get serious.Unfortunately, there are a few flaws:For me, the ending was rather rushed and I left the theatre with almost a weird 'that's a shame' feeling. There was a huge build-up and okay payoff yet things seemed to be wrapped in a neat bow, which isn't horrible, just kinda disappointing for a film called "Civil War". I liked how it wasn't a 'we need to save the world' type conflict but the stakes felt a little too low, probably due to the fact Marvel is stuck in a no consequence world (a trope of all Superhero films to be fair)Overall, the positives were so bloody positive that it pretty much shone out most of the negative. I can't wait to see this movie again and further analyse it. For me, it's about the 3rd/4th best Comic movie I've ever seen, yet also hold up as a solid entertaining film.8.8/10~The Moustache Triggerfish</fullReview>

Weeks before this movie was released I was wondering how they would fit every characters role on screen but I was excelled at how good it was. Each character had an perfect amount of screen time. The movie was very well paced so it kept me extremely interested throughout the whole movie. Also the story line was brilliantly produced that I could not have imagined. Chadwick Boseman and Tom Holland played Black Panther and Spiderman beautifully which was a relief. All in all Captain America Civil War Was a great movie and broke a lot of expectations ! Can't wait for the rest of the marvel movies :) !!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw the movie earlier and i was just blown away! This maybe the best Marvel movie yet or comicbook movie yet. Very well paced and well written, you won't feel a couple of hours has passed. The action sequences alone is worth the money - particularly airport scene was just pure joy and jaw dropping.With so many characters and superheroes, everyone still got a chance to shine.I was particularly happy with the appearance of Spiderman, Black Panther and Antman! Can't wait for their solo movies in the future, definitely checking them out.This is a MUST watch! Will probably watch it again a couple more times!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marvel at it's best...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**Warning may contain major spoilers**I'm gonna compare Civil War to a few things here as I feel it's only right to. Especially as the year has opened with hero against hero which creates a good base for any superhero movie. There has always been that debate, #whowillwin when matching heroes against one another and I believe the hype over Batman V Superman was greater with regard to who wins but Civil War had more hype overall. Is it really a Captain American movie? Robert Downey Jr. has been quoted saying it's Iron Man 4. In my opinion it's another Avengers movies which centres around Rogers and Stark disagreement to be put into check. Only Thor and the Hulk are missing and you can understand their absence. Though the Russo brothers have done something rather incredible, and that's a perfect balance between all the characters. It's a super busy line-up yet each and every character gets decent pieces, each having their own moments. It's almost like Vision has devised a formula calculating the percentage each character should have and divided the 147mins perfectly. The debates between Rogers and Stark creates an unnerving tension which eventually tears them all apart. There's a basic agenda there but understanding both sides of the argument it's hard to pick a side, even when knowing certain truths you can still sympathise with the other. As a whole, it's like they've stripped everything back to basics and built it back up whilst letting the heroes tear it back down again. It's not just the characters they balance so well either, but the action versus downtime and comedy. This has some of the best fights out of all the marvel movies put together and I believe that to be as a result of it being mostly hand to hand combat and some web to shield. The staircase fight was Bournish but with super strength, the airport showdown is epic beyond measure again, everyone getting their piece of the action. The foot-come-car chase was clever too and just when you thought you've seen Natasha kick-ass before, she goes and throws all that about. A lot of very imaginative action without it going silly; in fact it's the most believable fight scenes I've seen in a Marvel movie. The comedy element is there and yet again, everyone else having their moment giving the audience so much to talk about, which I reckon most of would be unfortunately lost during the adrenaline rush. It isn't just Stark that throws the witty one-liners and cheesy comebacks, Sam, Clint gets some in and even Bucky shows his sense of humour for a brief moment. This is down to excellent script writing and there's a lot of clever dialogue to go about. We see the familiar heroes, Rhody, Sam, Wanda and Scott Lang having a small BIG part with his quirky uncomfortableness. Clint obviously returns and it seems he has a lot more to say. Or it feels that way; I'm not doing any word counts here. But they introduce two more characters from the marvel universe, one of which is already a major player on the field and the other being T'Challa, the Black Panther. Chadwick Boseman does an superb Black Panther and really makes his presence known. He can punch and kick with the best of them. And what is really great about the introduction of both these characters is that there really isn't one. No origin story for either so not to derail and insult the audience. Like Spider-Man needs a background story. (He's always been one of my favourites)Your friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man is recruited in comic fashion and what he brings to the arena is nothing short of amazing. Not sure if Tom Holland has the Peter Parker look but it's refreshing and his boyish chatter is brilliant, actually complimenting on his enemies abilities and attributes whilst giving them the slingshot and web bashing. It was his part I was most worried about hoping they wouldn't ruin him or just give us a hint. It works. Thank You. I'm not sure about Martin Freeman and as much as I love him as an actor I'm not sure he fits in. I don't think his part was wholly necessary or to have him play it. Maybe they should have dressed him up to be more like Agent Coulson. William Hurt's character yes but Emily VanCamp's Carter could be seen as a weak link though she has more than one purpose in this fight. Now, it does lack the major bad-ass super villain but there's no need and even though there's a hint of one or a squad of them, there's a clever twist and like Batman V Superman, it involves mothers. (Hmm, was that one below the utility belt?) It totally works and allows the story to finish with the ending it deservesOther things to note are the baseball cap disguises everyone seems to wear and of course everyone being on first name terms. You can't see everyone going about calling each other by their superhero names when sat around desk. It actually adds some humility to each of them. And yes Stan Lee makes his usual comical cameo with some lasting effect thanks to Rhodes. Is it to comic book lore? Well, after consulting my comic hero expert it's better than the comics "fleshing out their storyline". Is it better than Dawn of Justice? Yes. So much better on so many levels. Is it better than Avengers? Definitely better than Age of Ultron, it's like a separate movie all together and my current mood is saying it's even better than Avengers Assemble. I think it's because this time it's personal and not so over the top. It's marvel at ground level and at it's best. 94% 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Marvel's Best Efforts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Trying to write a spoiler-free review (although I ticked the box just in case.) Civil War is a terrific movie; indeed I found it better than Age Of Ultron, which though good felt a little crammed to me. The Russo Brothers have managed to master the art of making a throughly compelling multi-super hero saga. This one proves just as enjoyable as Winter Soldier with some marvellous action stuff thrown in.Would Marvel do a good job of bringing The Black Panther into the fold? And, most importantly, would they give us a Spider-Man that totally works? And the answer is a great big yes to both questions. The Panther is cool and Spidey is at last the character as he was in the comics, although I have to reserve full judgement until Homecoming is released, as he is the icing on the cake here rather than the cake itself. Looking forward to seeing Tom Holland in his own Spidey movie. On this evidence he will be the best one yet.Robert Downey Jr probably gives his best performance as Stark in ages, adding depth and emotional pain to the character. But he does not, thankfully, overshadow Chris Evans. It's still a Captain America movie and Evans nails it.The cast all get something great to do. Again trying to avoid spoilers but Ant-Man - just awesome. I never saw THAT coming. Sebastian Stan as the tormented Winter Soldier scores big here and Paul Bettany is a great Vision. Elizabeth Olson again is fine as the Scarlet Witch. Even the Stan Lee cameo is very funny this time out.The only real quibbles (and very minor ones) is that Zemo is totally different to the comic book character - I wish they'd retained at least some of his traits, and Martin Freeman needed more screen time.But the central fight is just a great example of how to do super hero battles in an imaginative way. It's everything I hoped it would be.Great job Marvel. Movie number 13 ain't no bad luck number. Keep it up!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Action-packed, humorous, well balanced and well acted; Captain America Civil War is another insanely good addition to the MCU courtesy of Winter Soldier directors, the Russo Brothers. With a hero cast that greatly outnumbered any of its predecessor, one of the highlights of this battle of the titans was the inclusion of two new MCU characters, namely Tom Holland's Spider-Man and Chadwick Boseman's Black Panther; who in many ways stole the show. Credit must be given to the full team-up confrontation choreographed in the airport scene briefly depicted in the trailers, which without a doubt introduced us to a gladiator match like never seen before. With plot twists that will divide fans and general viewers alike, Civil War inspires us to seriously consider how the events leading up to this mammoth conflict have drastically transformed some of our biggest and favourite MCU character, building primarily upon the events that occurred in both the Winter Soldier and Age of Ultron. Identifying weaknesses were minimal as the movie manages to reconcile what was maybe a very fast paced and almost confusing first half with a momentous and emotionally driven finale which justified the need for thorough detail in the beginning. While the film tingled my nerd senses throughout, delivering just about all that I had dreamed of witnessing on the big screen pre-release, I give this title a 9 and only a 9 (I wouldn't of given it quite a 9.5 if it has been an option) was the noticeable structural weaknesses in the first hour in terms of pacing, but also the ever so slightly under-whelming opening act which saw the new Avengers team taking on one of their first big threats. My own personal highlights in terms of specific characters in the movie would go to both Cap and Ironman, but also the short but amazingly sweet appearances of both Tom Holland's Spider-Man and Paul Rudd's Ant-Man.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You can not get a better Super Hero movie then this!! First of, let me be clear. I was looked forward to Batman V Superman more then i was to this. Avengers 2 killed the excitement i had for this. but after seeing it on the opening night I can clearly appreciate everything Marvel does.This film focuses on balancing the act between all of its Super Heroes, which is a far greater number then DC has, and it does it perfectly. You never feel that one character has more screen time then another, even though you see Captain America all the time, you still feel the presence of other super heroes. It's not like they appear out of no where and you go "Hmm, wonder where they were for the whole film?"The story is pretty great too, the whole situations is similar to what was portrayed in BvS but just done with much better style.The fight scenes never got boring for me. This is really important, because as a critic and a movie fan I feel that sometimes feel can take the easy route and that is once they come up with 3 or 4 cool fight scenes they will just re use them, but just shoot them with different angles. It was all different here.This film works on every level. Spider-man does a perfect job of being the comic relief as does Ant-man and even Falcon has more then a few catchy remarks to other heroes. Iron-man is as always brilliantly sarcastic and full of himself.The drama that Captain America creates is felt through the whole film and is quite good. Black Widow and Black Panther add more tension and help the drama play out through the entirety of the film, which is brilliant as it gives the film it's heart.Like i wrote in the beginning. This is what films should strive to be. Especially DC movies, if they want any chance of catching up to Marvel Universe.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You might be wondering why the strange title. It is because I went in thinking which side to support, but it was never about that. It was about understanding the wrongs in both sides and making amends. This movie is probably the best movie which has come out of Marvel's long list of movies. Major credits goes to the Russo Brothers and to the casting director for bringing together such an amazing cast. It is awesome to see your childhood super-heroes being portrayed on screen by these people who are all on their A-game.I actually have nothing to criticize, which is evident from my rating but if I allow myself to be a nit-picky then I can only say that Vision was supposed to be a deus ex-machina, just like Wanda and I think he was under-played a bit, a bit, just a bit. With that off the list, now I can talk about all the things I loved.I loved the action set-pieces. They are not just hollow and CGI jizzing. It is emotionally driven due to which you feel the pain of the punches and you actually care. The length of the movie is long on paper but the length has been used so efficiently to show-case every character and put very necessary plot-lines. There is a good balance of light and dark. Baron Zemo being the darkest of them all. Even though we don't see him suit up but he plays the most darkest element in the movie. He is almost an organization himself. Daniel Bruhl knocks it out of the park. We have two new inclusions on the hero side, Black Panther and Spider-man. They are the show stoppers. I have seen Chadwick Boseman in '42'. He plays T'challa like a boss. He shows how even a King can do dangerous things when driven by vengeance. Tom Holland's Spider- man is probably the most comic accurate Spidey we are getting on screen. We have always wanted his one-liners during a fight scene and it is incorporated in it very well.The rest of the Avengers' cast has always done excellent. Robert Downey Jr. is probably irreplaceable as Iron-Man, and that is saying something. Marvel will obviously find a replacement but it won't be RDJ level good. He is fantastic. Chris Evans has always looked the part but in this movie he looks to be at his most vulnerable state. He suffers many losses and Bucky being the last link to his past life, he pulls all the stops to hold on to him. Sebastian Stan takes on the iron hand and punches his way through the movie. Mackie, Bettany, Olsen, Renner, Cheadle, Scarlett all reprise their roles and they are excellent. Like I say, nothing to criticize. Paul Rudd being one of the underdogs in the whole cast, according to me was also born to be Ant-Man. His role is not as big as Wolverine's or Deadpool's so nobody is talking about it but Paul is amazing and has come a long way from playing generic comedic characters.I can probably right an essay on the film and still it'll not be enough. So I'll just say GO WATCH THE MOVIE. It is awesome.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best comic to movie film ! good job Evans and Downey</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the magnificent film I ever watched about comic become reality. I often red back the comic book and realized they put some comic ingredients to action style, like Cap defend himself with his shield from Ironman laser beam at dam, or when ant-man flying with Hawkeye arrows, so comic book references. Overall story so marvelous and suspense. The only problem is just the villain, Baron Zemo should be strong and cunning. But this time, he just a casual ex-army man without superpower.I think the Russo's want us to understand that this is the final film for Captain America series (exclude the Avengers itself), so maybe they want to straight up to comic that Civil War is the separation between 2 iconic marvel superheroes because of the ideology.The point is, even your best buddy sometimes do the bad thing, friendship is above all. You'll save your very last friend you ever had till the end of the line.Score : 9,5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An epic super hero clash</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was easily my most anticipated film of 2016 and I am happy to report that this film truly delivers with epic proportions. The premise of the film sees after multiple catastrophes the avengers are told to they work for the governments of the world. Some super heroes led by iron man agree with this, whereas some of them led by captain America don't, This cause a massive rift in the avengers. Chris evans reprises his role as Steve rogers/captain America and he is fantastic in this film. He brings such depth to this character and you truly care about him and you are behind him as this film progresses. However, then there's Tony stark/iron man played by Robert Downey Jr who is so great because you are truly torn between who to root for because he is so likable and you understand both of their points of view. This film sees the introduction of black panther played by chadwick boseman who is phenomenal, you see his character develop so much throughout this film and you see just how much of an awesome interesting character he is. This film sees the return of Sebastian stan as the winter soldier and he is such a tragic character in this film, you sense the difficulties the character has been through and you want to help him like cap does. Everybody does a great job from falcon to scarlet witch to vision to black widow but I loved ant-man and spider mans roles in this film. Ant man added allot of really well placed humour to the film which was needed and this is probably the best on screen representation of spider man ever, enough said about that. The story involves allot of conflict and based on previous films you understand why the events are happening in this film. The conflict is handled very well and there is a villain who has a plan that I believed and understood. The script is great with a fantastic blend of humour and drama that other comic book films don't know how to do. The style has great action scenes that show off the powers of each character. There is one sequence that is the greatest superhero brawl ever put on screen. Also the film is long but I thought the pacing was great and the film flowed very well. Overall I loved captain America civil war and believe it will be hard to find a better film this year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marvel did it better than DC</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I'm glad that Indonesia had the chance to see this movie one week earlier than U.S.A, and after spending 2 and a half hours watching this movie, I can guarantee you that the wait is worth it..I must gave all the praise to Marvel for doing this movie way much much better than what DC did with Batman and Superman.. Clearly Russo brothers know how to make a movie about our favorite superheroes battle each other.. Even though it is a multi cast movie with a lot of our favorite stars and character just like Avengers, but the character development for everyone is fair and square with the scene-stealer goes all the way to our young Spider-Man with the wonderful performance from Tom Holland.. Russo brothers did it all, with a really simple story they can develop each of our superhero character proportionally that they can shine on their own.. Such as Black Panther which is for me Chadwick Boseman did an amazing job portraying it..Overall, it is a superb opening to the Marvel Cinematic Universe Phase 3 and definitely can't wait for the Avengers back in action again together in Infinity War</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a GREAT film and everything an adventure movie should be!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Captain America: Civil War is everything an adventure movie should be, and more. It's the best film in any comic book movie universe. What I liked is that there's a serious subtext to the story and it leaps out of the very first moments of the film. The movie gets just about everything right. The plot and shades of gray give much to chew on and think about. This installment perfectly picks up where we left Steve and his new team after Avengers Age of Ultron. It also follows up with Tony Stark perfectly. Yet, you need not even have seen any of those other films to enjoy this one even though it greatly adds depth to the overall story. Another huge strength is the casting. Evans again finds his pathos and his chops in this film. Robert Downey Jr. certainly has the acting chops to hang with anyone and he is again shear perfection as Tony Stark. Chadwick Boseman as Black Panther is no one dimensional character even though it easily could have been. This may also be Spider-Man's best turn on screen that we've seen and young Tom Holland is great. Sebastian Stan is again spooky perfection. Scarlett Johansson is AGAIN every bit the wise yet sexy female mainstay and a match for any male on screen. Emily Van Camp and Elizabeth Olson are smaller supporting characters but they simply shine with strength and depth. Anthony Mackie as Sam Wilson certainly adds to the casting perfection. Every interaction and relationship works well and is certainly one of the many highlights of this remarkable film. Again, this movie gets everything that matters right.</fullReview>

A lead in for another sequel which will in most likelihood be worse then this one?Well they win on choice #1 because there were a LOT of us who plunked down hard earned money to see this mess of garbage so we lose...however, the movie producers better have invested the money made from this movie because those of us who wasted our money on a ticket this time will have a bad taste left in our mouth from this nearly 3 hour of garbage and won't be seeing the next one. Lord knows there will only be 20+ sequels. Don't, just don't waste your time or hard earned money on this extended version of garbage. BTW - underoos is in reference to a silly under-aged Spiderman used in this go round. Yes, Stark literally calls him this and it's not funny. Not even close. It's an insult to those of us who look forward to Tony Stark's smart alecky comments and this isn't one. It was said as though the writers know they need to throw something in and didn't care to give it any thought whatsoever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Unforgettable, Thought-provoking Experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sequels have always been a hit-and-miss area in Hollywood. Sometimes you get The Godfather Part II, but it seems that, most of the time, you end up with something that is unable to hold up to the quality of its predecessor.I am elated to report that this is not the case with Civil War. This is an amazing film, and is arguably the greatest entry in the MCU to date.This film contains awesome cinematography, and some of the most amazing action scenes I have ever seen in a comic book movie (and any other action movie for that matter). The Airport scene in particular will likely go down in history as one of the most epic sequences ever put to film. All of the fighting is gritty, intense and masterfully choreographed.The characters are exceptional. To start off, Steve Rogers and Tony Stark are really fleshed out in this movie (even more so than in previous films). You learn more about what drives them ideologically, and you are able to sympathize with both of their points of view, which makes for an extremely thought-provoking narrative that really speaks to the amazing talent of the writer.One of my major problems with Batman V. Superman was that many of the characters just felt shoehorned in (don't get me started on the "email scene). In this film, the new characters are introduced in ways that feel very organic and contribute to the plot. I won't say much here, to keep things as spoiler-free as possible, but you can expect a solid foundation for these characters that paves the way for future solo films.My only issue with the film is the villain, Baron Von Zemo. His character really didn't contribute anything to the plot, and his "master plan" made no sense. To be honest, this is a problem that Marvel has with most of its film villains, with the exception of Loki, but they can't rely on him forever. Overall, though, I don't feel like his character had a major impact on the experience.In my opinion, this film sits right next to "The Winter Soldier" as one of the greatest superhero movies ever created, and is an unforgettable experience.4.8/5 (96%)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>NON-SPOILERS REVIEWThis is absolutely the best movie in the MCU and maybe one of the greatest superhero movies I've seen, it was absolutely brilliant. Russo brothers did it again. The tone was serious but at the same time it had the jokes and the fun, the script was organized, they show you the character motivations and let you choose side and I have to say that this is was I was expecting in BvS, the tension built and the subplots were correctly approached and the fight scenes were SPECTACULAR, the airport scene was the best action scene I've seen in my life. The acting was brilliant, special mention to Elizabeth Olsen (Wanda Maximoff). The introductions to the new characters were good executed and they didn't feel forced at all, and talking about that I have to say: Spiderman was awesome in the 2 or 3 scenes he shows up, Black Panther was incredible and I can't wait to see his solo movie. I don't have anything to complain about this movie, perhaps the villain felt unnecessary but the rest of the movie was brilliant. Look, I'm a HUGE Batman fan and I wanted BvS to be a 10/10 but sadly it wasn't and some of the reasons were that they seemed forced to introduce new characters and the script had some flaws, and this is how it has to be executed, the script was brilliant because the simple fact that they show you correctly the characters motivations and build the conflict to let you choose which side do you agree more and the way that they introduce Spiderman and Black panther was intelligent and accord with the movie's development.Everything said, if you love comic book characters go to see this movie, if you love action go to see this movie, if you love thrillers go to see this movie, if you love good movies go to see this movie!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almost Perfect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's almost perfect but I gave this movie a score of 10 just to eliminate the bad reviews.Basically this movie is awesome. It has a solid story line and logical cause-and-effect scenes. The characters showed personality when they had to choose sides. That is, to believe that Bucky is the bad guy or believe that he's framed for things he didn't commit.The addition of new characters is also wonderful. There's the Black Panther and Spiderman. But sadly, the Spiderman character is not what viewers expect. Viewers would expect him to either be the character from the first Spiderman Trilogy or the second Spiderman Dilogy. Instead, there's this new guy, who's supposed to be the "Young Spiderman" but it doesn't make any sense because at that young age, he wasn't Spiderman yet. Or at least, the studio could use the actor from the Spiderman teenager. But they didn't. So it's a disappointment.Another disappointment is when they all fight each other at the airport. The most climatic scene and supposed to be the best scene in the entire movie has a major flaw. Vision's superpower would have been astonishing. But somehow, he was missing from the entire battle, and then reappear just at the end of that battle. Where did he go? Other than those two flaws, the movie is PERFECT !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of The Best Movies Of All-Time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie will surprise a lot of people with its heart while sacrificing none of the thrills. All too infrequently, a much hyped blockbuster hits the mark right on the spot. Captain America Civil War is such a movie. It's the best big budget movie that I've seen since Avengers. It hits a high standard of excellence by combining an intriguing plot, breathtaking action sequences, a heavy dose of self discovery and realization, charisma, a dash of true patriotism, honor, duty and puts it all together in one amazing package. The inner turmoil worked well, the beautiful thing is that we can relate to each character. They turn convention on its ear by making Steve Rogers' flaws more apparent in this film and at the same time making Tony Stark's journey and growth very sympathetic. Steve's never say die attitude and heart of a champion makes him a true hero but those traits can lead to something not as noble. As in real life, never say die can turn in to painfully stubborn in a hurry. Both these character's motivations and journeys are more interesting then most. Can Steve remain the "good man" his creator instructed him to be in the very first film even through the most trying of times? Can the once cocky Tony Stark continue to learn and grow and work to humbly serve others even thorough anger and his own selfish tendencies? This movie delivers on all that and on every level. It does so with great emotional moments and it's a movie that lives up to all the hype it has generated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>With two big sides taking place, Captain America: Civil War sets up for an awesome superhero movie and story about friendships.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though we're still a few weeks into the release, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice seems to be setting itself into the position on "how to NOT make a superhero crossover film". While I didn't hate the movie as much as some are really making it out to be (some are even calling for director Zack Snyder to be booted from the upcoming Justice League movie that is still good to go), it was still overstuffed with a ton of stories that either needed to be their own movies or cut entirely. Warner Brothers will need to try and model Disney with what the latter has been doing with Marvel Comics and their heroes.Not only does Marvel allow their stories to pace themselves over several movies and bring in a more playful tone, but they seem to try and actually bring in modern day issues that have been controversial. Captain America: The Winter Solider managed to mirror the real life events that have surrounded the NSA and their surveillance on the general public. The American people are split over the upcoming election with extreme rights and extreme lefts about to burst into an electoral civil war. The Avengers too burst into their own struggle in Captain America: Civil War. It seems that the events of The Avengers, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, and The Avengers: Age of Utron have become a bit of a nuisance to the Untied Nations with the amount of damage caused by our heroes. While Captain America (played by Chris Evens) is leading some of the avengers on a mission in Lagos, an accidental explosion strikes a building, hurting many people. This seals the deal for U.S. secretary of state General Ross (played by William Hurts) to set up a UN panel that would oversee the Avengers and decide when to be called upon. This is called the Sokovia Accords. This puts the entire team in a divide. Tony Stark (played by Robert Downey Jr.) feels that U.N. intervention is necessary as that they need boundaries and that this could prevent further villains from emerging. Steve Rogers sees the Accords as a bureaucratic headache that would keep them from helping everyone. When the Captain rescues Bucky Barnes (played by Sebastian Stan) from UN's arrest for a bombing in Vienna, this creates sides. The Captain gets the Falcon, the Winter Soldier, Scarlet Witch, Hawkeye, and Ant-Man to join his side while Iron Man gets War Machine, Black Widow, Black Panther, Vision, and Spider-Man to join his side. Both sets of heroes fight while a Sokovian terrorist Helut Zemo (played by Daniel Brühl) plans for a bigger attack.With all the heroes shown in Captain America: Civil War, there is a lot of hype to deliver. Amazingly, it manages to both satisfy those that wanted to see an all superhero melee and paints a great story about friendships. There was a huge risk trying to put in all of these heroes yet remain a story for Steve Rogers.The focus is where it needs to be as it shows a guy who's got to figure which friendship is more important; Bucky or Stark. Both newcomers Black Panther and Spider-Man are welcomed warmly into the Marvel Cinematic universe as they get plenty of scenes. The actual battle in the civil war is twenty five minutes of pure joy that show why movies were made; to see moments like that come to life!Now how is the rest of movie supposed to go on after that scene? It's difficult to say because the third act does falter towards the end. We get one more big fight between Captain America and Iron Man that's great, but does not top the civil war sequence. I'm not sure if the solution is to make the final fight bigger or tone down the middle fight. I think that after such a rush of amazing, it's difficult to even continue. I'll give this nine battling heroes out of five. Captain America: Civil War makes for a great start to the next phase of Marvel movies. If not uneven, it's at least exciting. I'd hate to be the one that misses this hero epic in theaters, so don't miss out and pick a side.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrific</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In short the movie was terrific. In spite of the big cast, the story has been built up beautifully. Every one has had their chance to make a mark in the movie. The fighting scenes were shown beautifully. It was planned and made perfectly. This marks the beginning of the 3rd phase of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and Marvel did it with style. The 3rd phase already got a kick-start. The story had a different theme here. Marvel has always launched a solo film of every superhero before adding them to a cast in the big banner movies. But this time they did well and experimented by adding Black Panther to the cast who hasn't yet had a solo movie. Apart from all the brilliant performances, the addition of Spider- Man to this Universe was welcoming. Hope this phase also builds up the story of Infinity War slowly and steadily. And the road leads to the end in an interesting way. Also waiting for the rest of the movies of the third phase, especially the new heroes that are to be introduced to the Universe. Hope they also does well and the story is connected.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Complete Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wondered what new and fascinating storyline can Captain America come up that will overshadow the flaws of MCU's Phase-2 especially Age of Ultron.Just saw the movie &amp; I feel nobody talking about the emotional aspect of the movie which I feel appealed the most. When Captain America confessed to Tony Stark(not as Ironman but as a friend) that he knew about the murder of his parents was committed by his beloved friend Bucky, I was shell shocked &amp; equally felt betrayed and sorry for Tony Stark. I could easily relate to suffering and decisions of each character in the movie. I was punched right in the heart with some pretty emotional scenes towards the end, that was purely new for a MARVEL movie.It had every element from humour(if u think Antman was funny, u gotta watch this one) to emotions to purely flawless and jaw dropping action sequences(the infamous airport scene is absolutely great to watch nd equally full of humour).This is the best MARVEL movie till date with some great direction, cinematography, new characters and kick- ass action.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is simply exceptional in every way. The edge it has is delivering the best, grittiest action the genre has ever scene and characters that are as complex as the are fun. Why do I say that? Well... It's Marvelous. I loved Marvel movies very much. I thought it was smart and the impressive cast really delivered! I really appreciate the Russo brothers for making a fantastic film for the audience and the Directors carrier also.The action and fight scenes in the movie are just awesome and there is plenty of action to keep you entertained throughout the entire movie. There is also enough humour to balance all this. The CGI and Visual effects are awesome. The characters like Chris Evans, Robert Downey, Sebastian Stan etc are fantastically delivered their part very well. Every character fit right and at no point did the movie feel crammed with superheroes. In my opinion, the two heroes that stole the show was Spider-Man and black panther. Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) is quite amazing no word to say and I am eagerly waiting for the Black Panther movie release. The movie got a awesome climax also. So guys, go for this movie.... You'll love it. It is a perfect start of summer blockbuster and one of the best movies of the year without doubt..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Captain America: Civil War is an abundantly-entertaining piece of blockbuster entertainment which gives lie to the notion that an adventure film with lots going on must devolve into chaos. Following the events of Avengers: Age of Ultron, the world has become understandably concerned about gangs of super people destroying bits of the planet every so often. When Bucky Barnes (Stan) is finally brought out of hiding, he becomes the catalyst to allow Tony Stark (Downey Jr.) to bring the world's super people under control, starting with Steve Roger's (Evans) Avengers.Ostensibly an excuse just to get loads of super people to wail on each other for our amusement, Civil War takes the opportunity it has to delve into the people who make up its world while also at least considering the real-world problems actual superheroes (and by intimation, real-world superpowers) would pose if they did whatever they wanted. And it really makes with the super people wailing on each other.A big part of Civil War's strength is its insistence on avoiding the trap of cameos even when many of its characters only show up for two or three scenes. Instead it gives everyone something to do ? from Vision (Bettany) and Scarlet Witch's (Olsen) slow bonding to Spider- Man's (Holland) introduction and brush with the big leagues to Black Panther's (Boseman) dogged mission of vengeance ? and something to feel (so that we feel it, too), creating a joyful smorgasbord of superhero action that is the most Marvel thing Marvel has ever made.The list of such character-based touches is almost endless and fantastic ? Falcon and Bucky's forced partnership, Tony Stark flirting with Aunt May to Peter Parker's extreme horror, Vision trying to figure out how cooking works ? with new elements melding seamlessly into the new. Spider-Man and Black Panther are organically accepted into the whole, particularly Panther who is well connected to the main plot, as the various characters work not only within themselves but as part of the whole.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A really good 3rd captain America movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw Captain America and i've got to say that this was a really good movie, not the best comic book movie ever but a very good. What i like best on this movie was of course Spiderman (he was the main reason that i saw this movie) and i was really curious and very impressed about Black Panther. I'm not very familiar about this character, don't know his origin and basically don't know anything but he was a very interesting character who plays a very important role in this story.I believe that almost everyone know the storyline so i'm not going to say anything about the movie or going to spoil it for the others but some facts. At first and maybe it was only me but i was really disappointed about spider-man's costume, maybe they are going to going to get it much better on Spiderman: Homecoming but at this point on this movie i didn't like it. And second thing about this movie and mostly for the 'fans', please guys don't compare it with BvS movie, Civil War was a very good movie with lot of action and drama and good humor and Russo's tied up the Winter Soldier and Age of Ultron really good on this movie and this gives us the view that Marvel has a plan and develop their characters movie by movie than BvS which was the just the 2nd movie of the DCU. So guys just don't compare it. Now my score for this great movie is 9/10. I really enjoy it, it's a MUST SEE movie and i believe that the ticket price is well spend and no one going to regret it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As Good As It Gets</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw an advanced screening last night and what a treat it was! Once again the writers for Marvel do it right. The Avengers was done so well and then Age of Ultron was a bit bogged down trying to squeeze characters in but Marvel learned from it and wrote a fantastic film that was able to include so many old and new characters but didn't give that "crowded" vibe. My favorite scene has to be the scene that is teased in the trailer were our heroes are split into two factions and are forced to come to blows. You had fun banter between the characters and of course cool fight scenes, my only noticeable omission in this scene was the lack of Vision activity. For being as powerful as he is he doesn't really do much of anything positive during the battle.The final scene between Iron Man, Cap and Bucky (which again is teased in the trailer) is such an emotional roller coaster cause at that point you had decided which side you were on BUT a plot twist puts you all out of whack and you just see three characters you genuinely like having to fight each other, but it was another well choreographed scene and very cool!Do yourself a favor, be sure and watch Winter Soldier and Age of Ultron as a refresher before going and you'll love it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The structure of Batman v Superman done RIGHT.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The irony with both film franchises is how a newly established continuity (DC cinematic universe) prioritises the expansion of subsequent instalments, with more emphasis on defining further projects with no structure or cohesion. As opposed to MCCU, consisting of various films, with becoming the most financially successful franchise to date. Despite the marketing aspects of MCCU and the attention to detail on upcoming instalments, there is genuine intention to make a well written, coherent, and overall enjoyable stand alone instalment. For simplification, everything that Batman v Superman failed at was perfected in Captain America Civil War.This review is based on a recent viewing, and skepticism was present by the MCCU debut of Spider-Man and the variety of characters. But despite initial skepticism,this movie turned out to be a solid edition to the franchise.Character interactions, one of the best aspects of the previous instalments, continue to impact the film. The action sequences were well directed and felt necessary in the context of the film's narrative.The majority of the film's humour was at the end of the film, which is hardly a flaw as the tone is very well balanced. In terms of characterisation, the highlight is Tony Stark/Iron Man, with a flashback and emphasis on his past, implying more emotional investment to the character and as a result making his final confrontation with Captain America a deserved climax.Spider-Man's appearance in the film was done very effectively. He wasn't overly emphasised and despite some humorous moments when he almost stole the movie, it didn't negatively impact the focus on the main narrative. For Tom Holland's performance, he was a worthy successor to Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield, and it felt like his own incarnation of the role. I anticipate his further involvement in the franchise and the standalone film being released next year.To elaborate on minor flaws, some of the supporting characters felt unnecessary. With such an extensive cast from both previous installments and feature length debuts, some characters did not receive adequate screen time to impact the film's narrative.Ant-Man had some humorous and memorable scenes during the airport sequence, but Hawkeye, Vision, Scarlet Witch and even Black Widow served no real purpose to appear in the film aside from appearing in the action sequences. Black Panther's debut was a nice addition to the MCU, but had no real stand out moment. The expansion for his stand alone film in the mid credit scene still provided some intrigue for his characterization and further involvement in the franchise. Regardless of minor flaws, it was one of the best instalments of the franchise to date and is overall a solid standalone film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some have called it Avengers 2.5. Make no mistake, this is without doubt Captain America 3.After the last Captain America film (The Winter Soldier), expectations were sky high for the next instalment. The Winter Soldier was an extremely high quality film that introduced the titular character to us in a compelling way as well as cementing the relationship between Cap and Bucky. Then we moved on to the destruction of Sokovia, brought about because of Tony Stark. We explored the increasing divide amongst members of the Avengers team during Age of Ultron.This is effectively where we pick up in Civil War. Team Cap vs. Team Iron Man. One team is all for an overseeing body of people to keep the Avengers in check; this is the Iron Man camp. While the other team if absolutely against the idea; this is the Captain's camp. Cap has already put his trust in a governing body in the shape of S.H.I.E.L.D. only to be betrayed and find out it was Hydra all along. After watching all the promos, you may has chosen a side. But you will constantly be changing your mind while watching this film.You may also have worried about how high could the stakes be. The promos may have not convinced you, but you have nothing to worry about. I genuinely feared that we may lose one or two characters. Whether we do or not is for you to find out.I only have one negative so I'll get that out of the way. It is an ongoing struggle with the majority of Marvel movies; the token 'bad guy'. Maybe it is just me, but the villain's agenda seemed a little convoluted. He didn't really have much to do. In the end, it serves the plot so not too big of an issue overall. After some thought, I may even go as far as to say that there could have been other ways to further the story making this villain unnecessary. It just means there is more time to focus on the struggle between Team Cap and Team Iron Man. I appreciate that neither of those camps were portrayed as right or wrong - it goes back and forth making it a constant struggle.The performances are outstanding. To think that some of these actors are playing their respective characters fifth or sixth time and yet bring their A game every single time and add a layer of nuance every time is fascinating to me. It just goes to show how well these actors now know their characters, how comfortable they are with each other and how much fun they must have making these movies to continue to improve film after film. The newcomers are very impressive too; so was their introduction into the story itself. It all felt organic to the story. Chadwick Boseman brings a sense of gravitas to Black Panther which makes me very excited for his solo film. And then there's Spider-Man. The one people have been most excited to see. I won't say much at all except that he is one of the highlights of the entire film.The other highlight...an absolutely phenomenal action set piece at the airport. You haven't even seen a tenth of it in the promos. I was filled with a pure sense of wonder and cinematic joy while watching it. You will see things you've never seen before. Quite possibly the best action scene I have seen in a comic book film.I could continue to wax lyrical about this film. But in short, although it is still fresh in my mind, Captain America: Civil War is tied with Avengers Assemble as my favourite Marvel film so far. They nailed the drama, they nailed the action, they nailed the humour and most importantly they balanced all of that while giving all the characters their due. The Russo brothers and the writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely have done a masterful job. This is the 13th outing from Marvel in their cinematic universe and they have absolutely knocked it out of the park; surely this is unprecedented. Bring on Infinity War!!My Score: 9/10Review from: www.pratikrambles.wordpress.com</fullReview>

This isn't just a treat for Marvel fans or comic book fans, this is a treat for ALL film fans.I'm glad to see the response to Captain America Civil War has been very positive. I've noticed that sometimes expectations are unreasonable or some fans are too attached to their comic book preconceived notions. Sure Cap stays close to the spirit of its root origins but the fact that people are judging it as a film first is great to see. Whatever the reason, it seems everyone enjoyed it as much as I did. Visually it is a sight to behold and that goes for the special effects but also for the cinematography and grit of the film itself. Every scene was captivating, whether it was full on action or the developmental down time. Isn't that what movies are suppose to be about?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, as a massive comic book fan I have always found the Marvel, DC movies a bitter pill to swallow mostly because I thought the comics where better . . . Well, not in this case.Sure, Civil War is really not like the comic, certain characters aren't there and the teams are different, but OMFG, this movie is amazing, from beginning to end, it's just a bomb of great dialog and amazing fight scenes!! Steve Rogers! Tony Stark! Both amazing as per usual, I walked in there as Team Ironman, then when i saw the difference in the story I actually was emotionally torn between them! It was a hard thing to watch and that alone proves to me the depth in this movie!Their fight scene in the airport is potentially one of the best fight scenes I have EVER seen, some of my favorite comic heroes, Ironman, spiderman, black panther and scarlet witch all just throwing down! MY GOD! . . .Only "downside" if I had to pick at something, was some of the fight scenes had so freaking much going on it got a little hard to follow with the shaky cams! OH and I wish they had made a better fight scene with Widow and Sharon Carter VS the Winder solider, that would have been bad ass! But this movie borderlines perfect for me and they 100% deserve the 10/10. Congrats guys.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With so many heroes in the pot, you could make a strong argument that this should be Avengers 3. Yet impressively, Chris Evans does earn the limelight more than his co-stars. For the sixth time as Cap, he shows himself to be the pinnacle of mankind, physically and morally. And it's for this reason we root for him.It's not as simple as that though. The premise is cleverly double sided - it's made clear that both sides of the coin have equal value, which is rare for a superhero movie. Not only the plot, but the characters are rich, deep and detailed (including newcomers Black Panther and Spider-Man), each with their own opinions and traits fully fleshed.Before it all sounds too political, let's not forget why we're there - the action. Although the sped-up footage in the first battle scene is uneasy to watch, the majority is brilliantly choreographed and written. Each fight feels justified, and the climax between Cap and Stark is as emotionally powerful as it is physically impressive.Civil War perfectly collates all the great bits of the MCU - characters, action, humour - and melds them together into an exciting and engaging (albeit slightly too long) experience. Team Cap? Team Iron Man? I'm Team Russo!5/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having watched the triple bill of the Cap movies last night, I came away from watching Civil War with a smile on my face and thinking about the characters and the path they had been through. Chris Evans delivers an amazing performance here and really showcases why he is CAP. RDJ puts on his best performance as Tony, at times you hate him or you feel sorry for him. Sometimes you can understand why he's doing what he's doing with choice.The Russo brothers have delivered two amazing MCU films. Following on from TWS would have been daunting and challenging but they surpassed themselves and gave us a superb movie. Whilst in my opinion I still prefer TWS, I had a lot of fun with this movie. Civil War has it's flaws like every other movie but it's damn good fun. The writing and dialogue is great. The characters here are represented beautifully and the actors have great chemistry together. Sebastian Stan delivers an heartbreaking performance as Bucky Barnes, scenes that will sometimes leave you shocked and tearing up. The humour works well and isn't forced upon you. It's generally funny in parts and has some really cool references. Paul Rudd is on fine form as Scott Lang. As is Tom Holland as the new Spider-Man. Black Panther is a fine addition to the MCU franchise as well. It's obvious from here that the MCU's future is going to be a bright thing for everyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is hands down the best in the MCU, the fight sequences are even better than Winter Soldier. Although leaving the cinema leaves you empty feeling with its rushed ending.After seeing what critics gave BvS and Civil War, THEY ARE NOT TO BE TRUSTED. They hated the flashbacks of Batman's parents, two (very) short ones but have no trouble seeing flashbacks and clips from Iron Man's parents around 4 times. They don't like the death of Superman or his funeral, but Peggy Carter (a useless side character) deserves an entire funeral scene. Tony Stark is completely neutered, after Pepper and him are having some trouble and a woman blames him for her sons death, he then believes the Avengers need to be locked down... although Batman fighting crime for 20+ years and seeing those close to him die isn't enough for a man to give up his no killing rule? Critics hate Snyder for the destruction in MoS and BvS even though it's justified but the destruction in Civil War is justified somehow when just friends are trying to K.O. each other. Baron Zemo/Lex Luthor push the heroes towards fighting. Lex believing Superman is too powerful and should be killed, after the countless dead in MoS isn't as good as Baron wanting the Avengers dead after his family is killed in Age of Ultron. I'll admit there is much more humor in Civil War but that's mostly Spider-Man, but is that really enough to give it a +65% higher rating on RT? I honestly loved both films, but the fights in Civil War are just entertaining, in BvS they are intense - you fear for your heroes. After Civil War you have nothing to talk about, except how critics are biases. After BvS there is so much left to debate, how Superman will come back, the usual how Superman went easy on Batman etc. BvS&gt;Civil War</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Captain America: Civil War</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Political interference in the Avengers' activities causes a rift between former allies Captain America and Iron Man. As the third Captain America entry jump-starts the summer movie season, and so called Phase 3 of the MCU, its box-office muscle is beyond question. When the Avengers first assembled four years ago, it felt like a grand culmination, THE Ultimate Marvel superhero event. Since then, the studio's ever expanding Cinematic Universe has delivered sequels or varying quality and introduced new heroes in stand-alone movies, but it has never quite matched the ensemble-balancing finesse and Earth- quaking action scale of Joss Whedon's initial assembling. Not until now. This is not some hastily assembled battle to sell more movie tickets; these two have been quarreling over the course of two Avengers movies - one of their first conversation includes Captain America telling Stark "Put on the suit, let's go a few rounds". It's all been building to this; with hashtag-powered marketing campaign, prompting True Believers to pick a side. This film is build around a bigger conflict that, despite the title, does place it as a direct sequel to Age of Ultron. While Bucky and Cap friendship being the core of the film, makes it Captain America Three rather than Avengers Two and a Half. Captain America: Civil War might be the best Marvel Studios move yet. There, I said it. It does what the best Marvel films do: juggling between characters so each is allowed to shine in a story that pushes forward the series continuity and while also forming and concluding its own plot. Forget Batman v Superman. Here you get Ant-Man v Spider-Man, Hawkeye v Black Widow, Scarlet Witch v Vision, The Winter Soldier v Black Panther and Captain America v Iron Man, all rolled into one film. And that is what you call THE Ultimate Marvel superhero event. What could serve as the detriment to some hero-stuffed movies, actually works to the advantage of Civil War. Part of what is so delightful is how easily the characters, the majority of which we've come to know over the course of thirteen Marvel Studios movies, interact and play off each other. However, it all comes to these two characters, ultimately Captain America v Iron Man and their own beliefs, personalities, neuroses and paranoia coming out to play. For both of them, the bonds of friendship are shown to run deeper than any commitment to the greater good. Steve defense of Bucky is questionable: he may be his childhood friend, but now he's a lethal, robot-armed killing machine forever in danger of being reactivated. Sebastian Stan remains, for the most part, as blank and frosty as he was in Winter Soldier. Chris Evans meanwhile, further hones a role he has effortlessly owned for five movies now; pushing Rogers to impressive new depths and reminding us that his straight arrow still has a dangerous edge. He's perfect. The stoic heart and soul of the MCU. There's little doubt why anyone would risk being branded as fugitive to follow him into battle (I VOLUNTEER!). And as perfect is Robert Downey Jr., who shows a completely different side of Tony Stark. He's more the elder statesman here than the witty merchant; reflecting on the consequences of his actions and looking to make amends. The brilliance of Downey Jr. sympathetic performance is that even if (like me) you are resolutely #TeamCap you can still (obviously) feel for him. As you might expect, it's one of the MCU's more serious entries, tonally a world away from Age of Ultron. But that doesn't mean it's humorless; far from it. Anthony Mackie's Sam Wilson can be relied upon for laugh-out-loud one-liners wherever he's on screen, Vision stylish new wardrobe is comedy gold and Paul Rudd's Scott Lang is "HUGE" fun in relatively brief appearance. Moreover, Black Panther gets a lot of shine too. Going in I didn't know much about the character, so this bing my strong introduction to the character, I really liked him. He works for this story and situations in many ways ( I can't reveal in a spoiler free review). Now let's get into what everyone seem to be waiting for - except me, because I've never really been a huge fan - 19-year-old Tom Holland's Spider-Man. he might be the best Spidey so far. His Peter Parker is great: nervy, goofy and instantly endearing. In the airport fight, in which he's truly spectacular, using his webs in entertaining and creative ways; while his wit couldn't be better. I have to admit that I'm in love and I can't wait to see more of Holland's Spider- Man. And no Loki or Ultron equivalent this time. Who needs a villain when you have Steve and Tony? Both protagonists. Both antagonists.Civil War is rises above the series' greatest weaknesses. In a movie that has an almost literal army of superheroes, it's remarkable that a film this big can still feel intimate. Reflecting the material's comic book roots, the Russos keep the film's action heavy. "It always ends in a fight", says &gt; You could read more on my blog</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is absolutely the best Marvel movie so far, or even the best superhero movie ever made. The story was so perfect with outstanding performance from the actors and actress. Joe and Anthony gave a new perspective for those who think superhero movie is only about action. The story of this movie was also strong, and the conflict that was made is so real and natural. Remarkable. You think you see it too much already from trailer? You're wrong. There are still so many surprise hidden on this movie. Perfect action, perfect story, perfect conflict, perfect in many ways! Marvel is unstoppable. Thank you Joe and Anthony Russo, infinity war is in good hands.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is simply amazing. I was worried that I was expecting too much but this easily fulfilled and then exceeded all my already lofty expectations. I just loved it. The action sequences are spectacular and the story-line keeps you riveted from start to finish. The first act grabs you and eventually drops your jaw right to the floor. From there, the story has you and it's one big roller coaster ride to the heart rendering finish. I honestly believe movies like this are exactly what the cinema is for... a well structured and smart thrill ride.I have a feeling that the writing and intelligence of this film is going to surprise those that don't know any better. They think this must be a silly "comic book" film and don't realize that the comics are indeed deep, textured and intelligent. This is everything that is complex and cherished in years of quality comic book runs.Thank God literally that we all get to watch something this good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Marvel Cinematic Universe has grown and matured in all the right the ways throughout the years. Establishing a shared universe with rich characters is no easy task, let alone succeeding, without compromising the quality and ethics in such a grand undertaking. Before watching Captain America - Civil War I was very skeptical about how anyone would be able to properly handle this amount of characters and high quality actors in a balanced and meaningful way. My expectations were sky high, having genuine respect for the creative handling of century old comic book characters that has been done so far is truly formidable. From start to end the movie gives you a thrill ride of untold proportions. Never was there a moment through the movie that i found useless or not helping the plot. Best Marvel movie to date, without a doubt!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>being a marvel fan for me this is one the best marvel movies it has fantastic character arcs, great action and really good acting. and my god SPIDER-MAN!!!!!. just seeing peter parker interacting with the other avengers made my day and also he does awesome stuff with his web shooters. i think to say tom Holland is the best spider-man is to soon but i think he will be after we see is standalone film next year. and also Chadwick Bozeman nails it as black panther he has a personal goal in this film and you fully understand his motivation and his action is the best in the film. the performances from Downey and Evans were great and it was such a emotional film because you've seen these characters grow and you have history with them. Anthony Mackie stays awesome as falcon and has a couple standout moments. Sebastian Stan as Bucky Barnes/winter solider is fantastic a great and strong performance from him. and i also want to point out that Elizabeth Olsen was much improved as scarlet witch i thought she was a bit underdeveloped in age of Ultron but she had a fantastic arc in this film. the airport battle is phenomenal one of the best superhero action set pieces seriously it's crazy i couldn't believe what is was watching. there is only one thing that was bad about it which has become very familiar in marvel movies the villains. once again marvel makes a another generic and disposable villain in Baron Zemo its a shame because Daniel Bruhl is a really good actor. but i look at it that he wasn't really a villain this film didn't need a villain it was a family dispute between the avengers. but other than that overall it was a very good and entertaining movie which makes sure the marvel train keeps on rolling 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Words can't describe my love for this film so, in one word, just like Spider-Man: Amazing!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>8 years ago, some of the greatest characters in comic history had a whole new world opened up to them thanks to 2008's Iron Man. Nobody thought the film would have the impact it did, including me. Now we are in 2016 and we have reached Captain America: Civil War. It boasts the most characters in a Marvel film, the best film in the entire Marvel franchise and also the greatest action scene in any superhero movie ever, but we will get onto that later.So the film serves as not only a new Avengers story but also a solid sequel to Captain America: The Winter Soldier. It would be easy to make a film with so many characters sideline the Captain America story, but this film really is at it's core a Captain America film. Sure there is a lot to cram in but it is done so well and fits in so well as part of a trilogy. I saw this film as a midnight screening and saw it along with the other two films beforehand. It really is a good idea to watch both Captain America films before and notice the detail put in to incorporate these stories. Cap is my all time favourite Avenger and seeing the development all three of these films has give him really is amazing.The basic plot without spoilers involves the Avengers causing a huge disaster on a mission in Lagos which results in the government devising the Sokovia accords which they must sign in order to operate under them. Tony Stark feels guilty about the casualties and destruction but Steve Rogers wants to keep operating freely and saving the world. This results in a divide between them and the other Avengers are forced to decide who's side they are on. Whilst this is happening Cap and Falcon are still on the hunt for Bucky Barnes which does play in to the start of the Civil War but i will leave it at that. So already there is a lot going on and we also get the introduction of Spider-Man and Black Panther as well as Daniel Brul as villain Baron Zemo. It would be easy to make this film a complete mess like Batman v Superman but it was not. It is hard not to compare the films because they are quite similar, involving destruction etc. But this film does it so much better.The airport scene in this film where the two teams fight for the first time is perfect. Tom Holland's introduction as Spider-Man happens just before this and his personality even when fighting is perfectly nailed. Black Panther also feels the same way, just the way these characters are on the big screen is a dream come true. Seeing Ant Man (who is awesome by the way) interact with Vision and Spiderman interact with Ant Man and Black Panther interact with Captain America etc. It is perfect. I also have seen the film and still don't know which side i am on. You want to be with both Steve and Tony on this because they are both right and have valid points. But seeing the personalities of every character clash and play in to every scene they are in is just brilliant. The villain of the film, Zemo, is average at best though which is the only small gripe. Crossbones as well barely has any screen time, but Zemo's plan almost seems like something that the teams could have fought over themselves.At 2 hours 20 mins there is a lot to cram in but in the end as a Marvel film this one is the best by far. It is emotional, hilarious and most importantly awesome. I cannot recommend the film enough. I have seen it twice already and that won't be the last time. Films don't get much better than this.</fullReview>

The action was so good! the acting was good. the story was a lot better than batman v superman's story. it is everything that bvs wanted to be, but couldn't because snyder isn't as talented as either of the russos bros and the writers are better as well. civil war is the perfect comic book movie. dc lovers suck on that. even dc fanboys will cry because this movie is that good. thismovie doesn't have flaws, because.. it isn't a dc movie of course and it is absolutely perfect. Verdict: if you hate mediocre superheroes movies, don't go to batman v superman, but if you love good superhero movies then go to civil war. it's perfect in everyway. I made this review as compensation for some idiots thinking they can bring down the score of civil war before it comes out!</fullReview>

The story was great also.In conclusion, Captain America: Civil War is another great Marvel movie. It's a great movie filled with the right amount of action, comedy. thrill and excitement!

		<fullReview>Captain America civil war is a great action scenes and a thrilling story. Its problems , however, involve multiple underdeveloped characters (scarlet witch, vision, black panther and Spiderman...also crossbones and baron zemo) scarlet witch is developed in this film and we see her struggling with her powers so she gets ticked off the list in this film. Vision isn't really developed much and the only development his character receives is in his relationships. Black panther, as a new character he hasn't been developed, was devolved slightly and we see his passion for what he believes in play out. Spider-Man is amazingly developed and the new Peter Parker is best one so far. Crossbones and baron demo are so horribly boring that they are probably the worst marvel villains so far (which is saying something). The plot was really intense and the action scenes were amazing so the good &gt; bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was truly a great film, it made sense, was accurate and was what you expect from a Marvel Movie. The action was intense. The characters chosen for this film suited the way the film wanted to be done, in despite of all the seriousness of the movie, it had its funny moments to draw back on to kind of release the tension like all Marvel movies before. It provided a good ending to make future films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe have a purpose and direction for the future. I guess in ways it could've been slightly better, but to be honest I don't really how exactly it could be improved but you always think in some ways a movie isn't exactly perfect but this was pretty damn close. It fulfilled the promise of what I was expecting and I am looking forward to future films now to continue with this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a great movie. Last years Avengers had a ton of build up, but it was just OK, cause cities don't fall from the sky. This movie also had a lot of built up, and it was all well deserved. This movie was great. The only thing I would change is that the Black Panther would have helped Iron verse Captain America and Bucky. Iron Man would have beaten Captain America one on one, but of course Bucky with one are comes back to help Captain America win. The new Spider Man was also cool, he was really really young. The Black Panther was probably the coolest thing about the movie, and I cant wait for his own movie to come out next year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Civil War is a Masterpiece...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am quite impressed with Civil War, because beyond being a simple movie of superheroes, is a Solid, perfect, mature and dark drama. Who is the one who has the reason? That is the question I asked myself while watching the movie. Civil War is a roller-coaster of emotions, because unlike the comic, which all the time favors the Captain America, in the film both sides are defended with various arguments, so much so that you get to have great sympathy for the team of Iron Man.The film is a drama, pure and solid, quite political, I dare to say that it is the movie of the Marvel universe more mature and serious that I have seen, in effect, follows this humor characteristic, but on this occasion it is not feel forced.The action is spectacular, the choreography of each battle is very well developed and the battle at the airport is epic, fun, Brilliant and amazing, accompanied by a good soundtrack. The CGI may be the least impressive of the film, because sometimes the characters looks like a 3D animated cartoon. but those scenes are minimal (thank god) Civil War is a masterpiece. The best film of the whole universe Marvel and probably the best film of Superheroes that I have seen.My Rotten: http://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/972761642/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great movie dedicated to all DC fan boys butt hurt about how mediocre BvS was!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen Deadpool and it was great. I've seen Batkill v Supersad Dawn of Martha and was a mediocre, dull of a movie. Now get ready to be amazed! This movie pushed the boundaries in terms of superhero films. The Russo brothers did something I did not expect, exceed The Winter Soldier and make not only the best Marvel movie so far but the best movie in its genre so far. Civil War not only offers great action but also very good character development, strong performances from each member of the cast and more than enough screen time for everyone. From a technical standpoint the movie is, just like The Winter Soldier a delight. Practical effects, very good implementation of CGI, beautiful camera work and choreography, sound and a solid script. The globetrotting plot kicks off in Lagos, where Cap and the new-look Avengers are on a mission to take down Winter Soldier survivor Crossbones. Civil War starts as a muscular crime movie in the mould of Michael Mann's Heat, the Russo brothers significantly upping their game in terms of high-impact, shield- slinging action. The mission is a bust ? the latest in a laundry list of collateral-damage catastrophes from the battle of New York to the near-apocalypse in Sokovia, leading to the creation of the Sokovia Accords, a decree to put the super crew on ice unless an international governing body gives the green light. Having lived through oppressive times, Cap takes a stance against the agreement;Tony Stark, wrecked with guilt over the creation of Ultron, sides with Ross and the Accords. Battle lines drawn, matters are further complicated by Bucky Barnes, who's implicated in a terrorist attack that puts both sides, and a certain Wakandan prince, on the Winter Soldier's tail. If The Winter Soldier was about SHIELD being ripped apart from the inside, Civil War pulls the same trick with the Avengers themselves, screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely carving out satisfying character arcs. Crucially, despite the colossal cast of characters and sprawling runtime this isn't just Avengers 2.5 holds true, it's also a Captain America movie through and through, further exploring The Winter Soldier's major theme ? the cost of freedom ? while Bucky is even more integral to the plot than he was in the film that bore his own name. As you might expect, it's one of the MCU's more serious entries, tonally a world away from the party-time antics of Age of Ultron. But that doesn't mean it's humorless; far from it. Anthony Mackie's Sam Wilson can be relied upon for laugh-out-loud one-liners whenever he's on screen, the Vision's stylish new wardrobe is comedy gold and Paul Rudd's Scott Lang is huge fun in a relatively brief appearance ? utterly enamoured by Steve Rogers and overjoyed just to have been invited along. As a piece of superhero storytelling, it doesn't bring anything particularly innovative to the table either ? the idea of a thin line between heroes and vigilantes is invoked again, for example. But importantly, given the callous loss of life going on in other comic-book movies, the human cost of the Avengers' actions is keenly felt and addressed in a meaningful way. It makes DC's efforts to tackle the same idea with Batman v Superman seem thunderously dunderheaded in comparison. Chris Evans is dependably superb as Steve Rogers ? the stoic heart and soul of the MCU. And though he doesn't have as much to chew on here as he did in The Winter Soldier, there's little doubt why anyone would risk being branded a fugitive to follow him into battle. Even better is Robert Downey Jr, who shows a different side to Tony Stark. He's less the swaggering snark merchant of movies past here and more the elder statesman, reflecting on the consequences of his actions and looking to make amends. "I'm trying to keep you from tearing the Avengers apart," he pleads. The brilliance of Downey Jr's sympathetic performance is that even if you're staunchly Team Cap you still feel for him. As for the other players: Bucky is more tortured soul than Terminator this time round, and though he can still feel more MaGuffin than character at times, you buy why he's worth saving because Sebastian Stan and Chris Evans sell their life-long friendship so well. Scarlet Witch struggles to deal with the implications of her immense power; Hawkeye comes out of retirement in a satisfying continuation of his Age Of Ultron arc; Falcon gets to show off what those wings can really do; and War Machine takes the hardest line for the Accords, ever the iron patriot. More importantly: how do the MCU's new supers stack up? Chadwick Boseman's Black Panther has a bigger role than you might expect. Arriving fully formed, Boseman plays the prince of Wakanda with regal airs, charm and forceful determination. For Very Important Story Reasons he's quite sullen in Civil War but in his vibranium suit T'Challa is just as capable and acrobatically dazzling as any of the MCU's super-folk, with a set of razor-sharp claws that even Cap's shield can't withstand. Better yet is Marvel's all-new Spider-Man. In asurprisingly substantial appearance, 19- year-old Tom Holland not only makes a case for being the best screen Spidey so far, but also threatens to steal the entire film. His Peter Parker is perfect ? nervy, goofy and instantly endearing. In the airport fight however he's truly spectacular, holding his own against the best the MCU has to offer, using his webs in entertaining and creative ways, while his motor-mouthed (and charmingly naive) wisecracking couldn't be better. Civil War isn't just a damn-near-perfect popcorn crowd-pleaser; it doesn't offer any easy answers for its combatants, or the world going forward. Team Cap or Team Iron Man? The real winner here is Team Marvel."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, saw Civil War two times already here in Peru, the second time just yesterday April 30th with my 73 years-old father that really loves movies since he was young. He knows and loves everything Superman-related, and even so, he couldn't help but snore through BvS (almost the same with MoS back then). But oh boy! yesterday at the theater i saw my father laughing and even clapping like he was a 13 years old kid watching the "serials" he sometimes tell me about! It was that good!. On my first watch on April 27th (first screening), the theater was packed and the crowd reaction was the best i have seen since the first Avengers movie, but that was nothing compared with seeing my old man's reactions. I just wanted to share this because if any movie deserves to be ranked top just by the sheer joy it causes, is this one. An excellent movie, full of surprises (I have seen just the first trailer prior to watching the movie, and avoided spoilers like the plague). Acting-wise, the characters were spot-on, some of the best moments were the ones without any special effect, and the ones that used them were wisely edited. About the villain: a superb and realistic plan (within the boundaries of their universe). Only minor gripe was Martin Freeman overacting. Otherwise, the introduction of characters (new to the universe or to the Captain/Avengers films) was perfect, and rest assured, this is the best on-film version of the web-crawler yet! Recommended 100%, just go and see it spoiler free if you can.</fullReview>

The story of the film is okay take a deep breath and is scary and backed film all right is heavy and you absorption and you in to see the film could not move. Directing the film also all right is great and the overture magnetized. actors game okay normal and attractive body man will tremble as especially Tom Holland House. Music videos okay great and attractive. Im not gonna spoil one single thing, since this movie should be seen by only the two trailers you probably saw. Don't watch any TV spots after the second trailer or whatever! Im gonna touch a few aspects and rate them. Acting: Of course it's amazing. The characters we were waiting for were black panther and of course SPIDERMAN! Both were done amazing! Spiderman has a bigger role than I personally expected and it's done with grace. Love it. Black Panther was such a good character with great motivation why he's doing what he's doing. The acting per usual from the other characters were great! 10/10 Story: Now where another (let's leave it) unnamed superhero movie failed this year, and no I'm not talking about dead- pool.., was the story. Now this story is what I expected from the other unnamed superhero movie. I didn't know what side I wanted to be on; cap's or iron man's. I was so conflicted and even while they're fighting you don't know who to root for. The villain in this movie felt a bit, not really out of place, but unnecessary in my opinion. But Marvel always struggles to find a good fleshed out villain except for Loki &amp; kingpin in the series. 10/10 Black Panther, Antman y Spiderman, they are just amazing and interesting characters in the film. Visual effects are amazing and the battles are really good. I thought that marvel will never do a very good movie like it was winter soldier, but i was wrong, i was totally wrong I don't like to compare, but i enjoy this film more than batman v superman. It's obviously that it is not perfect, that's sure but for me this is the best marvel movie, and i cant wait for the infinity war, the MCU is in good hands with the Russo brothers. You already know that this is one of the best Marvel movies to date. You already know that this movie has an all star cast. You already know that this movie has great directors. You already know that this movie is adapting one of the most iconic stories. You already know that this movie introduces two great new characters. .... You may already know that this Spiderman, is regarded as THE defining PP and Spiderman. You may already know that this Black Panther is a Badass. You may already know that the action scenes are new/inventive and great. You may already know that this movie has a lot off heart and emotion. .... You can predict this movie will cross the Billion mark. You can predict this movie is a movie for all fans and not just the comic fans. You can predict that only DC fan boys/girls will not find this review helpful.</fullReview>

But as the accord is getting signed Caps mate Bucky blows Vienna up. Tony Stark thinks that the Avengers need to be controlled as they are doing a lot of damage and killing hundreds when they make a movie. This has to stop as some woman showed him a photo of her American son and he feels guilty. Of the thousands of Sokovians who died (or would of if it was a real place) he could not care less.Captain discovers a dastardly and also ridiculous plot to revive an army (well 5) super Winter Soldiers.So he and Iron Man are at odds on what to do so they meet to 'discuss' things at a German airport and a bit of fighting breaks out with them and Ant Man and Spiderman and some other men including two woMen and they do their usual picking up jumbo jets and hitting each other with buildings. The airport was supposedly evacuated but they pay no heed that a cleaner might have been having a nap in the control tower or someone might have gone back for the cat and just blow it to oblivion just to show how cool their weapons are.Billions of euros of damage later the Cap and Bucky fly off to prove his mates innocence. Suddenly we are in Siberia where the puppet master is revealed and his dastardly plot unfolds. Not to let loose an army (5 of them) of super villains but to cause a civil war (hence the title) between the Avengers. More fighting an blowing up things and we are all set up for the next instalment.I used to love all the characters back in the 60s but they are pretty dull now and have not one iota of realism regarding the relationship with themselves. They speak in one liners and have no personality. Even the end fight was totally contrived by a ridiculous video tape the Puppet master could never have found in a million years.Everything happens to set up the next action sequence which are pretty dull themselves. We have seen it all before. Hulk had a spat with Thor ad infinitum. Agents Of Shield is a very likable series. The main reason for that is it has a bit of heart and does not involve this clueless crew of super clowns.Maybe the next Thor movie will end this cycle of dross. Blowing things up may work for the uninformed American audience but I like a bit of a script. I gave it 3 for the explosions.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>And, the Black Cat! Bucky Barnes "The Winter Soldier" can't get a break. There seems to be a string of words that when spoken, makes him compelled to follow certain orders.But something happened in 1991 that one weak chinned individual really wants to find out. It's locked in Bucky's Brain. But there is one other person who would want to know this secret: Tony Stark. Except he doesn't even know this secret exists.This is the time of "The Sekovia Accords", the Avengers can't do a simple job without bunches of people getting killed and mass destruction abounding. Not their fault, bad guys are all over the place. Hydra is still being Hailed, but we don't see too much of them lately. Getting tired of Hydra anyway. Now, the world as a whole wants to have "oversight" over the Avengers. Tony Stark favors this, Cap America does not.It's as simple as that, but nothing is simple anymore. And now, The Scarlet Witch is having a moment because she could not prevent something bad from happening, and The Vision, is he simply babysitting her, or keeping her locked up at The Avengers Mansion? Because there is an even better floating prison for super hero types who have gone off grid.This disagreement between Stark and Cap causes an Avengers Rift and puts Cap on the other side of the law for once. All for Bucky's sake, wouldn't you do all you could for your best friend? But many people want to see Bucky dead. Others don't want him dead, just what he knows.The question is, why? There is only one person who knows that, and he's well prepared to rip the Avengers into tiny kibbles and bits to find out about something that happened. On December 16, 1991. Look for William Hurt as Thaddeus Ross, a jerk, this guy could cause severe problems in future movies.Each one of these Marvel Movies outdo the previous ones, and I thought Deadpool was great, except for that CGI Colossus. So many Marvel Superheroes have been established, and now, more and more of them are appearing in every Marvel Entry. It's like they are writing Lord of the Rings as they go, and doing a fine job of it. This is like the Battle of Minas Tirith, and everybody shows up to play. Including Ant-Man, who shows us yet another Dimension, also true to the comics.I was halfway expecting Tony Stark to be killed off, but that didn't happen. It is part of Marvel Canon, he was killed off and then resurrected by bringing his younger self into the future, this was a story arc from the Mid 90's. Actually I was expecting X-Men Apocalypse to be the "Age of Apocalypse" arc from around 1994, which lasted about 6 months, during which time the whole Marvel Universe had been turned inside out, Apocalypse controlled everything, Logan had his hand chopped off, and Magneto was the head of The X-Men. The "M'Kraan Crystal" which held the fabric of reality in check, had been broken by "Legion", who was Charles Xavier's son. But in these current films, we keep seeing these "Infinity Stones" that can twist realities apart showing up. And one of then is in The Vision's head!I have seen plans for a "Legion" film as well. There are already holes in the X-Universe due to "Days of Future Past" which I thought was done well, and now with the handing off of the X-Men principle actors to their younger counterparts, how long before this happens with our Avengers? We're selfish, we want to see more and more with these same actors playing our beloved characters. It is too bad that it takes so long for these films to be made, I just hope that RD Jr keeps playing Iron Man, Cheadle keeps being War Machine, at least for a while, these actors are all in their prime and could probably finish the whole arc with no problem.This film gives us yet another rendition of Spider-Man, I really liked the Toby Maguire version, and I also liked the Garfield version too, he was good in that role. Should have used the same guy here, but I like this new Spidey. Odd to see Spidey as one of the Avengers, but that too, is Marvel Canon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great film, well-rounded plot; confusing at times</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Captain America: Civil War is the third and final film in the Captain America trilogy. But I don't think of it as the third film, rather the thirteenth film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, or MCU. This film has a rich plot which will leave viewers entertained and thrilled, alongside the further development of the main characters that have graced the screens since the start of the MCU, including the title-character Captain America, and impressive action scenes. Yet this film struggles to keep Captain America in the limelight, with a plot those unfamiliar to the MCU will find confusing. Once you get into the film, although not as good as The Avengers films, this is a thriller and a must-see movie for 2016.The basis behind the movie is simple; set one year after the horrible events in Avengers: Age of Ultron, the team must sign a UN treaty which effectively denies the Avengers any rights of free movement, stripping them of their ability to fight crime around the world and create a path of destruction along their way, as has happened in the other movies. Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) or Iron Man, who has had to deal with the burden of having created Ultron in Avengers 2, decides it's best if the team signs this treaty. Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), who is Captain America, disagrees and believes that signing the treaty is not the best thing for the Avengers.This entire concept of two of the most powerful men in the Avengers team against each other forms the basis of the film; a Civil War, namely between the individual Avengers themselves. Perhaps a little conveniently, half the team sides with Stark, half with Rogers. And so begins the war, each side fighting for what they believe in.What I liked about this Civil War idea was how it leaves the whole ''bad guys, good guys'' allocation to the audience for quite a portion of the film. We are aware that Tony Stark is a good guy, having seen the other MCU films, but so is Steve Rogers. Hence, while it soon becomes clear who is ''right'' and who isn't, having two ''good'' guys and two ''good'' sides opposing each other opens viewers up to a different kind of enemy, one of which is harder for viewers to pinpoint definitively.However, in reality the entire basis of the film is not just the Civil War, but also encircles that of the Winter Soldier, James Barnes (Sebastian Stan), returning from Captain America: The Winter Soldier. He plays a pivotal role in the movie, the audience's perception of him being changed from Captain America 2.Returning from Avengers: Age of Ultron are the Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen), alongside other characters from the MCU including Falcon, Ant-Man and War Machine. New appearances include the Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and Spider-Man (Tom Holland).All these characters star in the fight scene, featured in the trailer, which is easily one of the best fight scenes in the MCU, almost outshining those in the Avengers, simply for its ever-so simple concept; a Civil War between the Avengers.On the downside, it is this huge line-up of characters that forms part of the problem with this film. It drowns Captain America away as the title role in the film. He isn't completely submerged, with the film still able to identify him as the main protagonist. However additions such as Tony Stark have the inherent ability to dim away Steve's voice in the film. As the film progresses so too does Captain America's role diminish slightly. While fears of the film becoming Avengers 2.5 or Iron Man 4 before its release were thankfully not realised, this movie did still struggle to keep the limelight focused on Captain America himself.More notably is how the film struggles to find focus. It shifts between the Civil War of sorts, and the underlying protagonists of the story, attempting to give each character some attention. This was to some degree a mistake; while this will entertain those who know the MCU universe well, those purely watching for Captain America will be confused for sure.But I must digress; if you are going to see an MCU movie, any of them, it is best to at least know some basic background information about the timeline, to help your understanding of the film. This flaw of confusion is not intrinsic with this film but the fact that the MCU flows less like a collection of movies and more like a series, with each one flowing on to some degree from the last. Watching Captain America 2 then moving straight to 3 is not a smart choice, at the very least, watching Avengers 2 is necessary.To an extent the movie struggles to find its voice for half the film, as the building blocks are slowly put down for the film. This can be good too, though, allowing for more character development. Unlike the Avengers films, this movie is not teeming with fight scene after fight scene. Rather they are more spaced, and rightly so; any more fight scenes and this movie would have been indistinguishable from any other Avengers film.Having watched the other Avengers films, this movie doesn't quite live up to them, though it would be disappointing if this film outshone the Avengers. Instead, this film allows for an almost side-conflict set aside from the battles the Avengers are usually fighting together, instead exploring the consequences when a series of ''enhanced humans'' turn on each other.Captain America: Civil War is a stunning film which has helped withhold the reputation of the MCU. It is a film that has been well-developed in almost every important aspect, and certainly has helped hook viewers and set up for a dramatic conclusion in Avengers 3: Infinity War.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's easily on par, if not better, than the first two "Avengers" movies.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Captain America: Civil War" (2016) is nearly everything I hoped it would be; it's easily on par, if not better, than the first two "Avengers" movies. (And I can't help but think of this as the third "Avengers." Yes, Cap's name is in the title, but this is necessarily an ensemble story about the divided superteam.) I'd give it a 9 out of 10.I honestly just need to be very vague in this review ? this is such an eagerly awaited film, and I want to be extra cautious about spoilers. No, there are no twists in the movie, but there are surprising character and plot elements.The movie surprised me in a couple of ways. One, this film appears to follow the original 2006 comic book crossover only very loosely. (I have not read it, but I know the story.) There is no "Superhero Registration Act" that would directly affect countless people in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It's much narrower than that ? a demand by the United Nations for direct oversight of The Avengers.Two, this is definitely the darkest and most adult outing with The Avengers so far. Don't get me wrong ? the levity and gee-whiz comic book fun that is the MCU's trademark is still there, and it's no Christopher Nolan movie. But the movie's central story device is set in motion by the question of who should be held accountable for civilian deaths. And so many individual major characters are motivated by grief or rage.This is notable throughout the film, for example, in the characterization of Tony Stark, and his portrayal by Robert Downey, Jr. He's no longer a wisecracking billionaire playboy who all the guys want to be. Instead, he's a troubled, pensive leader who often seems out of his depth. We watch as his team and the events surrounding him spin out of control, and we no longer want to trade places with him. He's more sympathetic. But he simultaneously fails to engender the viewer loyalty that he so quickly and easily won in every other Marvel movie he's appeared in.And yet ? he isn't, as I had suspected, a cardboard adversary for Captain America's underdog to stand up to. There are some sad things going on in his life, both during the events of this movie and in "Iron Man 3" (2013), and his failings and poor decisions are perfectly understandable. (I won't say more, besides that viewers will definitely get a different spin on "Iron Man 3" after this movie.) And Downey displays a great range in playing this far sadder Tony.One character in the movie even makes a quip about "The Empire Strikes Back" (1980), and it feels like a meta reference, as that film is regarded as the darkest in the "Star Wars" original trilogy. (And their are story structure similarities as well.)But don't get me wrong ? "Captain America: Civil War" still brings loads of fun. It's an effects-laden, geeky, hero-against-hero, superteam gangfight that is straight out of every Marvel fan's dreams. (And, needless to say, it's far better than its analog this year from DC.) Tom Holland might be the best Spider-Man yet. The action is damn pleasing, and the one-liners made me laugh out loud. ("Made ya look.")The bromances (including the broken ones) seemed real to me. I found myself liking and caring about ? Winter Soldier, of all people, and I kept hoping things worked out with his friendship with Cap. (Sebastian Stan impressed me in the role for the first time.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best marvel movie yet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1 year after the events of the avengers age of ultron movie, sets events in motions that can forever change the avengers forever. After an accidental incident involving Wanda's powers, there comes a decision involving Thaddeus Ross once again played by William hurt called the solkovia accords which would basically be an oversight regulating the avengers. Tony supports the accords feeling regulation is needed and also partially die to the ultron incident while Steve opposes it feeling it is another way of spreading fear and losing their freedom to do things their own way. I will say the newcomers involving Daniel bruhl as zemo, Chadwick boseman as tchalla and tom Holland as spider-man are quite goodThere is a good blend of action and humor without it being over the top.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>WAYYYYY better than Deadpool. Best of the MCU.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm more of a DC fan, but this movie had me excited and pumped for most of the way. I hated Avengers, Iron Man, Thor, (and their unnecessary sequels) Marvel has shined in Guardians of the Galaxy, and these Captain America movies. Its gritty action, and good story was very well done. The acting for most of the characters was well done. But it still suffers from all of the characters being slated for more movies until 2033. So the stakes are lost. And they still unnecessarily shoehorn unfunny quips and jokes that take you out of the scene. Like the humor from Spider-man and Ant- Man alone worked amazingly. If they kept it to them, and whenever other characters had to react to them, it would've been a much more intense movie. To keep this review short I'm going to say that this is the best of the MCU, the only MCU movie in my top 100 favorites. A great time. It ends kind of abruptly for me, and I left wanting more. So, terrible performances from Jeremy Renner, Anthony Mackie, Scarlett Johansson, Scarlet Witch, and Agent 13. The rest I thought were great character performances. A good time at the movies. Overall rating: 8.4</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The CLAW here, bringing you another, should you see it in theaters, or wait for the DVD. Here we go: Captain America: Civil War, and what a civil was it was! Winter Solider so far has been my favorite superhero movie, sorry DC fans, and this one ups it even more. This movie executes on absolutely every single level. The action is amazing. The Russo brothers do a great job of using practical effects, and it definitely shows. The fight and action scenes look more realistic than any other superhero movie. The story, once again changed the MCU forever. Who side are you one? I'm Hail Hydra(and so is Captain America, apparently). Some people are calling this, Avengers 3, since so many characters are in it, which is true, but at its heart and soul this movie is about Captain America and Tony Stark. The other characters are just pawns in the showdown. Some chose to be over watched by a governing committee that will now doubt become corrupt, and some choose the side of continuing being a non governmental entity. What caught me in this movie was in my opinion the best villain to date. He was cool, subtle, and had a layer of loss and revenge. He wasn't out about world domination, but rather to destroy the Avengers world, which was a nice change of pace.I am going to end my review here. Why? Because do you really need that much convincing or insight to go see this movie, absolutely not. This is one of the best movies this year, and by far the best Marvel Movie. So stop reading this, and go WATCH IT NOW!!! Recommendation: See in Theaters!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely incredible!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I absolutely loved this film. I saw it twice in the theater. This is my second favorite MCU film, and in my top 3 favorite comic book films. My top 3 MCU films are: 1. Winter Soldier 2. Civil War 3. Guardians of the Galaxy I do slightly prefer Winter Soldier, but I have seen that movie about 15 times, and I have only seen Civil War twice, so my ranking might change. Right now I cannot choose if I like this or Batman v Superman more! I love both so much that I just cannot choose. I honestly think I like Civil War a little bit more though, but I love both of those films. Now onto my full Civil War review! This is one of the best comic book films ever made! It has great story, great characters, fantastic action, and good humor! I feel like this and Winter Soldier are the best at balancing dark and light tone out of all the MCU films. They do that really well! I was extremely happy that the movie still felt like an actual war, it didn't seem like an argument. Even though they threw jokes into the fight scene, it still felt like there were high-stakes. The scenes still felt intense! This film was just incredible. I honestly have no problems with the film! Everyone that has seen this film has probably picked a side. Team Cap or Team Iron Man. I definitely without a doubt am on Team Cap! Cap's side of the story made much more sense than Tony's did. To me, Tony was an idiot in this film. How does Tony think that signing with the government will help them? The government would take away The Avengers rights! How would Tony think that would help them?! Also, if the Avengers hadn't been in those battles, EVERYONE WOULD HAVE DIED!!!! The Avengers did help the people! Like I said, if The Avengers hadn't been there, everyone would have died! Also, Tony was stupid when he attacked Bucky and Cap! I can understand that Tony's upset that Bucky killed his parents, but Tony was going to kill Bucky! Tony was going to regret doing that! It was not even Bucky's fault that he murdered Tony's parents! Bucky didn't know what he was doing. Sure, I can understand that Tony wanted revenge, but he shouldn't have taken his revenge out on Cap or Bucky. Overall, I absolutely loved this film! I give it a 10/10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Avoid the 3D Version (IMAX/Real3D), otherwise pretty okay</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie itself is okay, entertaining, although a bit slow at times. I found the camera-work a bit annoying, as very often the director chose to film past a near object or person, creating a blurry out of focus item that covers up to a third of the screen. For the 3D IMAX Version that means a 3D blur in the foreground. The Shaky Camera Action and extremely fast cuts (1 second or less per perspective) during Action Scenes make it hard to focus on anything in the 3D Version, but i guess it works fine for 2D.I am happy to see Daniel Bruehl (Goodbye Lenin, Joyeux Noel, Inglorious Basterds, Burnt) in this movie, he has come very far!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A 6-on-6 (or whatever) Avengers is not Civil War...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am reviewing this movie because I feel that a lot of people are liking it due to the wrong reasons. Here goes:- Firstly, I went into the movie expecting a chaotic country with people being divided. That, for me, is civil war. It's not 10 guys fighting on an airport away from the country. Civil war is what happens within the country. This was the first let down. Secondly, the last fight between the iron man and captain America which was tried (yes, it wasn't successful) to be portrayed as a war of the two ideologies was merely Tony being angry at Steve for not telling him who his parent's killers were. Though, the movie tries to show it as if it was that bad guy's master plan (sorry, forgot his name). Actually, the Sokovia accords did more damage to the friendship than that guy who was actually useless. Also, there was a very rare chance that the only avengers that would go to that cave were Cap, Tony and the WS. How convenient for the director, eh? The bad guy was tried to be shown as a common man from a civil war, but to no good (watch The Wednesday (2006)). Lastly, balancing screen time for the actors is the biggest challenge in ensemble casts. It was as if the whole point of the movie was to bring together avengers to fight in that one scene. Characters should be given the opportunity within the story to develop. This was missing in some - like vision. Take a look at Bryan Singer's two latest X-Men (DoFP and Apocalypse) for some good character utilization. Yet, this movie is overall actually good but not that good as the mass opinion currently is (8.3 !!!! Top 250 !!). The cameos are all good and funny. The Avengers MCU is increasingly focusing on laughs and the fun factor leaving behind the core of these movies (Deadpool first and now this). Due to this, Civil war always holds you and entertains you. I personally would prefer Winter Soldier to Civil War because it had a better script. Thought these were some important points to think about before blindly giving a 10/10 just for the sake of entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As complex as the division line between Democrats and Republicans, the division of the Super Heroes in Civil War...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As complex as the division line between Democrats and Republicans, the division of the Super Heroes in Civil War - the conflict driving force of the plot- comes from the question, "How do we hold the heroes accountable for their actions;" a question posed soon after the massive destruction from the previous Marvel movies, which is answered by Iron Man and Captain America as they head up the two opposing factions attempting to answer that question with their own: "to accept government oversight... or not." Marvel, in my humble opinion, has proved its superiority over DC in the realm of live-action movies for the current generation, posing real world, thought provoking questions such as "Is security worth sacrificing freedom?" Particularly in Civil War, where that question is posed to the super heroes who take up a place in the fantastic world of Marvel where they can give security without taking away freedom... or so it seemed, until their actions resulted in the recent destruction of major cities in Avengers, Avengers: Age of Ultron, and even Thor, Captain America: Winter Soldier, and Thor. Though DC posed religious and social questions in Batman V. Superman, whilst simultaneously trying to keep up with Marvel's rigorous pace of pumping out super hero movie after super hero movie as it heads towards the most ultimate of ultimate super hero team-up movies, it cannot compete with Marvel's combination of Quantity AND Quality. In this movie, viewers can enjoy wonderful fight scenes, a near-perfect pace that is only somewhat hindered by having to take what was presumably a 4-hour movie worthy script and editing it into about a 2 hour long movie, and a star-studded cast (as they say) who all have trouble playing well with others on screen, but seem to boast a wonderful collaboration off camera.The only down-side is that character development is all but removed from the script, for the sake of moving the plot along towards it's wonderful conclusion. This is understandable, however, since Marvel has had all of Phase One and Two to set up the characters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another Marvel movie. An awaited one this time. It was good, but not as good as one of the Avengers movies.The story in this movie is suspenseful. The battles are fun and since you probably already picked a side, you really want some hero to win. The acting is, as usual in a Marvel movie, good and they found a nice actor for the new Spider-Man.The downside of this movie is the hero-overload. In certain scenes, there are so much heroes you don't even know who can do what anymore. Also, the cheap lines the screenwriters put in the movie as explanation why the Hulk or Thor weren't there were a bit cringy.Overall, it was likable, but don't expect too much.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is as good as any real action sci fi movie ,though i won't say it has epicness of Super Hero movie fight like Batman vs superman .Civil war is better constructed than Batman vs Superman maybe cz it has really simple plot of going right into action from the start.Civil war don't spend separate time in character or enemy development but its more like characters &amp; enemies are developed through fight from the start.One problem with that is Main Characters become less important &amp; fight/mission overshadow the depths of CharactersThe Movie lack better dialogues as usual as any Avenger/Marvel movie .Acting wasn't that great .Facial expression of Iron man &amp; Captain America &amp; few other character almost remained same .Maybe they are told to look bad ass, so thats why not much expression with Face i guess .Some long ,Boring meaningless conversations with no emotional depth .Lack of any background music &amp; sometime complete silence in the background when conversation made it sound really annoying .Airport Scene !!! I really don't get it what so epicness about it like what Some Fan boy talked about instead i feel the First fight scenes &amp; the last one was better .Airport fight scene lack seriousness &amp; that take away the thrill that it should be involving its audience into . With good background music,good emotional dialogue ,some good flash back to show bonds between characters could have made the emotional attachment to the film stronger .I felt something after Batman vs Superman &amp; it stayed but can't say same for Civil war .Its like every emotional attachment gone after the movie ended,Bad Acting &amp; failed Main Character build up to blame for that though memory of real good fight scene still there .Civil war failed to become" The Dark knight "instead its more like "The Bourne Identity meet Terminator" with less depth &amp; less attachment to the Main characters</fullReview>

One thumb up and one thumb down on character development. But really good movie make sure you go watch it. Like I said the action scenes were so good and so enjoyable. definitely family friendly so bring the whole family. There are many laughs while you watch this movie but not so much that it's like a comedy(which is a good thing). This is a long movie but in a good way, it doesn't really drag out any thing.

		<fullReview>**SPOILER ALERT** IN ORDER TO GIVE AN HONEST REVIEW I HAVE INCLUDED PLOT POINTS.I will start by commenting on the action. It is the best that the MCU has ever produced. I saw a review complaining that it looked fake but let's be honest...... are any avengers films realistic? It is a matter of perception whether the action is not realistic for you however it is clear to see that, as in Winter Soldier, as much practical effects have been used as possible. The action alone is worth 6 stars.Okay so now for the story. Spiderman and Ant-Man have wonderful parts in this film. Really look forward to seeing how they both play out in their standalone movies, I really liked the Ant-Man movie so it's gonna be good! But they didn't really need to be in this movie. Why would Tony Stark, self proclaimed playboy billionaire philanthropist, need to visit a teenager in Queens? Also when Ant-Man rolls up in the back of a van and gets ripped by the falcon and Hawkeye as if they have known each other for years. Next big point. In Age of Ultron, Scarlet Witch helped the Avengers destroy Sokovia, and I mean that quite literally! But in this film, all of a sudden she has morals? Next up a big big spoiler but I have to mention it. At the end the big reveal that it was Zemo behind all of this chaos (played brilliantly by Daniel Bruhl by the way) &#x1f62e;&#x1f62e; big shocks all round. The end scene suggests that he must of known pre-emptively that Captain America, Bucky and Iron- man would have all turned up at the same place, at the same time so he could play the video for Tony and watch them all kick the living s××t out of each other as payback for the death of his family in Sokovia. The whole plot of Zemo causing conflict between the avengers was a nice idea but not played out as particularly well as I would have liked to have seen.All in all the movie is great fun and you will not leave the cinema unentertained. For Captain America - Civil War, I give 8/10, 6 for the action but sadly 2 for the plot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If Batman and Superman can fight seems only fair this group of Super Heroes would duke it out in civil war. Pick a side or vacillate like most of the characters. The movie is big and loud. It is an assault on the viewers senses.Great cast seems like they are having fun. Along with nearly nonstop action even the comedy moments work. The Tony Stark meeting with Spider Man steals the show.Most of the recent gang of heroes are there. Maybe they needed a Hulk. He might have been off with Pepper Potts.So the audience is asked to choose sides. These heroes have done away with so many bad guys they are left with nothing to do but fight among themselves. Hard to be more then an impartial observer when you don't want to root for or against Iron Man or Captain America.The movie is too long and after the opening standard action sequence it seems to take some time to get going. There are plenty of redundant fights. And one awe kiss.It's a big movie that should be seen on the big screen. The 3D was often subtle and isn't worth the up charge or sitting in glasses for three hours including trailers. If you are a fan of this genre you won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Captain America: Civil War is a fun, action-packed movie, but it doesn't charter new territory or transcend its superhero genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Captain America: Civil War is the third directorial venture by the Russo brothers who helmed the fantastic Captain America: The Winter Soldier ? not only a good superhero movie but an exemplary spy thriller in its own right. Needless to say, I was pretty excited to watch this movie when it came out last month. I was particularly interested to see how the Russo brothers would balance the intimate personal connections, which they excelled at in their last movie, and how they would handle a bigger, meaner blockbuster movie with multiple superheroes and plot-lines coming together. So what is the verdict? Did Captain America: Civil War excel at juggling multiple characters, create enough tension, and still manage to be entertaining while keeping superhero fatigue at bay?Yes, for the most part Captain America: Civil War does meet most of the expectations, but it doesn't transcend the genre. In that way, its more like the Avengers: Age of Ultron which was a fun blockbuster summer movie, but easily forgettable for non-comic book fans.The Russo brothers manage to create intimate moments of real bonding between characters. One of my favorite scenes is when Vision cooks for the first time to alleviate Scarlet Witch's homesickness. Though not human, Vision does something very human-like for Scarlet. I also liked the dynamic between Capt. America and Black Widow. While I'm personally disappointed that Marvel chose not to pursue a romance between the two, it is endearing to see that even as they fight on opposite sides, Black Widow came to support Capt. America at a moment when he was emotionally compromised. It just shows how well these two understand each other.Although this film deals with weighty topics, I was surprised to see how the directors incorporated humor into the film, and created lighter moments to punctuate the moral, ethical dilemmas its characters face. You know what was fun? All the scenes with Spider Man, it felt right to not have a long origin story for Spider Man (yeah, how many Spider Man movies do we have already?), and just let the scene surprise you when you realize it's just a normal, scrawny kid who is concerned with school and getting good grades. In a fictional world where the adults are pondering on weighty matters, the way Peter Parker cuts through the thick air and brings some lightness and humor into the proceedings is a breath of fresh air. Spider man is there for a short time, but he and Ant-Man brings some much-needed humor to Civil War.Ultimately, Civil War is bogged down with multiple characters that constantly fight for screen time. There are too many big action sequences that look good, but just don't carry a lot of emotional heft (an exception would be the fight between Capt. America, Bucky, and Iron Man near the end). I felt, as if I was running from one action sequence to another, before getting a breather to figure out: what the hell is going on? The movie could have easily cut 1 or 2 sequences, and still tell the same story. It also doesn't help that there are a dizzying number of different locations the film takes us to. What is with the strange choice of enlarged font sizes to show locations? At some points, I felt that I was watching a Mission Impossible, Bourne, or a Bond movie where the hero is constantly changing locations.In Civil War, I rooted for Capt. America as he stood for his principles and protected his dear friend Bucky Barns, alternatively, I also felt bad for Iron Man at some parts, when it seemed like he had lost half his adopted family in this moral debate on security vs. civil liberty. But the conflict, what is really at stake never feels fully realized. I kept waiting to find out if the international coalition of countries wanting to curb the powers of the Avengers at the beginning was part of an evil, self-interested group, but that storyline never appeared. Instead we get a weak, preposterous antagonist. The villain's motivations as explained at the end of the movie did not seem very convincing. All this stealth and mayhem caused by the antagonist, played by an understated Daniel Bruhl seems pointless; the length to which he goes, in order to acquire the red book and animate the Winter Soldier, and for what? Is this a parable of misguided suicide bombers who cause mass destruction as a way to cope with loss?See full review at: http://www.artspeaksy.com/captain-America-civil- war-movie-review/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Marvel's Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is just the beginning of my full review. To read the entire piece, please visit my blog at http://GuyWithAMovieBlog.blogspot.comBy now, the Cinematic Universe (MCU, for short) is either for you or not - there's little middle ground. If you're a fan, you're going to be pleased a couple times each year. If you're one of the many who bemoan a new addition to this ever expanding series, you've got something fresh to complain about on a regular basis.For me, the MCU contains films I love (Captain America: The First Avenger, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Iron Man, Guardians of the Galaxy), films I like (The Avengers, The Incredible Hulk), films I have no interest in ever seeing again (Iron Man 2, Iron Man 3, Thor, Avengers: Age of Ultron), and even a couple I haven't seen yet (Thor: The Dark World and Ant-Man). I'm by no means a fanboy, but even the worst of these films (Iron Man 2) isn't terrible by any stretch of the imagination. For a series stretching 13 films (and counting), it's shown a fair amount of consistency.The newest addition to the MCU is Captain America: Civil War, the third installment of the Captain America series. Before watching it, I was a bit worried it would be more in line with The Avengers films rather than the Captain America films, which is why it took me nearly a month to get around to seeing it.I needn't have worried.Civil War is a tad more bloated than The First Avenger and The Winter Soldier, primarily due to the influx of The Avengers (minus Thor and Hulk, who were apparently off gallivanting across the universe and couldn't be bothered to make an appearance) and several other new characters, but it still felt like a Captain America movie to me, which is definitely a good thing.The film starts with a very well done action scene. It's not only exciting and intense, but sets up the plot perfectly. After an incident occurs in a foreign country where innocent people are hurt and killed, the United Nations wants The Avengers subjected to a strict and binding set of guidelines and government oversight. Captain America (AKA Steve Rogers, played by Chris Evans) doesn't like the sound of that, knowing first hand how government agencies and people in general can develop their own agendas. He clashes with Iron Man (AKA Tony Stark, played by Robert Downey, Jr.), who feels guilty about the destruction, even though he knows it was done for the greater good.In addition to this strife, the two also clash over how to handle The Winter Soldier (AKA Bucky Barnes, Rogers childhood friend, played by Sebastian Stan), who was brainwashed by the evil Hydra organization and has resurfaced again, leaving a slew of bodies in his wake. Captain America wants to get to his friend and save him while Iron Man wants to find and arrest him. Since you've seen the previews and commercials, you know that eventually the two come to a head and end up splintering The Avengers. Some side with Cap, some with Iron Man.continued on my blog...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Give Huge Props to the Russo Bros</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow, this movie was amazing for the simple fact that it won me over. As I have become cynical and burnt out by these big budget superhero movies. So it has to take a great cinematic experience for me to care about any of these demigods and endless fan servicing.Although most of these marvel movies don't carry the weight as stuff like The Dark Knight, or the Daredevil show, for example, I generally cared about the characters and the result of the action and story. When most movies in this marvel world feel more and more flat, despite any escalation in melodrama or big action, this movie had great depth of character. The superhero parts of this seemed secondary to the interpersonal nature of the movie. The few weak points were minor, such as a few too many close up and edited hand to hand fighting scenes that were difficult to follow. Or that a few characters felt thrown in there at the ending battle. But these did not distract from the movie. I especially appreciated that the battle at the end led up to a conflict more personal at the end, which felt more epic than all the lot duking it out. Although I don't really look forwards to many superhero movies these days, despite any hype, I'm looking forwards to what the Russo brothers may do next.</fullReview>

The action scenes were even better than expected, which is saying a lot. The only part I didn't care for was who they had cast for Spiderman and how they introduced Spiderman. Would have been incredible to have Tobey Macguire show up without introduction, but that's just me, so you lost two stars for that. And Marissa Tomei as Aunt May? Otherwise incredible fight scenes and good easy to follow plot. The fight scene at the end was one of the best fight scenes I can remember.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My second favorite Marvel movie so far.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite this film not being bigger with more connections and wider variety of superheroes fighting a war. A war that is driven by more tension and inner turmoil in a more devastating circumstances. However I can sort of understand why it went in a direction where the superheroes pulled their punches. Because they wanted to go in a more lighthearted approach with more fun and some humor thrown in. For a title like "Civil War" it didn't really have lot at stake although it deals with a important decision the team has to make from the inside. It seemed more like a battle than a actual war. I did like the messages behind the plot of this movie and it does have few emotional scenes, especially near the end. So when it comes to touching base with elements that make a superheroes movie fun, it did the job close to perfection. With so many superhero movies out there I wanted something new and for the most part, this was a refreshing experience with well cinematography and choreography when it comes down to the hand to hand fighting parts. I thought I was going to prefer "BvS" over "Civil War". But I ended up liking both equally. I think "Civil War" has a more integral set up when it comes to two different ideologies, perspectives that deals with politics and inner emotions colliding. And "Civil War" has more action and hand to hand combat sequences which I enjoyed watching on screen. Plus it has my favorite interpretation of Spider-Man in it. Tobey Maguire was alright playing the role as the web slinger, but came off way too emotional and whinny at times. And came off more girly than the female leads during few scenes, despite him being a likable nerd. Don't get me started on "Spider-Man 3". I think Andrew Garfield did a okay job as Peter Parker, but wasn't all that likable. Peter Parker in this reminded me of a 16 year old verson of Pavel Chekov from the rebooted Star Trek movies. Except he makes witty comments and movie references to taunt his opponents like what Spidey does in the comics and animated shows. Anyways I also liked the way it portrayed the two team leaders, showing the heart and will power of Captain America despite his traumatic past and the loss of his loved ones. Also his experience with Hydra and Shield. Than there is the charismatic but broken Tony Stark who is driven by guilt and regrets. While one is a populist the other is a elitist, so it was engaging when things went down. Overall I thoroughly enjoyed "Civil War" and I highly recommend it.9.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Crouching Spider Hidden Panther</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In short, this is an American Wuxia movie. Superheroes are similar to those martial art warriors in Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon genre, who can leap over building, have superhuman strength, bend physical law etc. Each has his/her unique fighting style and weapons. And just like a wuxia movie, the plot is about love, friendship, revenge and betrayal.Even you can relate some action scenes to Asia's martial arts movie, like when Cap is gunned down and fall from building to the ground, Jacky Chan's stunt has done that 'fall' before. The way Black Widow/Romanoff doing 'parkour' in the market, just like Donnie Yen did in "Bodyguards and Assassins" and so on. The Russo's brothers seem to be a martial art fans and it's good, they made the action scenes awesome by combining the grace of Asia/Hongkong's martial art and the explosive/spectacular of Hollywood's CGI and special effects.However, I always see Captain America as the one who obeys the laws while Iron Man always breaks them, so throughout the movie I couldn't get rid the feeling that their roles in the story are mismatched. Another thing, while it's a superb action movie, it somehow lacks of emotional depth. Their motives are just rational. Therefore, Spiderman and Black Panther are able to steal the show, hence I put them on my title review. Really looking forward for their own films.Perhaps for the next installment, the Russo's should also add spices of Korean drama to the mix :).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very solid fun if not quite the spectacular extravaganza expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first Captain America film was a lot of fun, and 'Winter Soldier', taking a bigger, bolder and darker approach while not forgetting the entertainment value, was even better.'Civil War' is not quite as good as 'Winter Soldier' but it's a little better than the first film, in my opinion. It may not be quite the spectacular extravaganza that this reviewer was expecting from reading the critics' reviews, but it is very solid fun still, great entertainment and in the top end of Marvel's output even with its faults.Granted, 'Civil War' is not perfect, so the detractors can think again before accusing me of being someone paid to write a positive review. This is actually somebody who saw the film, enjoyed it thoroughly but realises that it has flaws. Is anybody going to point out to Marvel detractors that people can enjoy Marvel's films without feeling like it's a criminal offence to and have been giving good reasons for doing so, so parroting out ridiculous and easily disproven conspiracy theories that have often come close to violating terms and conditions is only making them look like the idiots and the ignoramuses? Sorry to point out that irrelevant note, but this attitude keeps cropping up in the increasing user and critical condescension wave that IMDb is facing, and IMDb who seem shockingly oblivious to it should come down harder on it.As with what was not quite right with 'Civil War', there is an over-stuffed and occasionally under-cooked feel at times. 'Civil War' has many subplots and characters, and while actually it deals with a vast majority of the subplots and characters are dealt with incredibly well there are a few subplots that appear (a couple of them abruptly introduced as well) and not enough is done with them, as far as being completely forgotten about after ten minutes or being rushed through to get to the next one. Zemo's story is lost within everything else and would have fared better within a film all on its own, because the potential was there. A vast majority of the characters are all interesting with engaging, in-depth personalities, but War Machine is somewhat side-lined, while one appreciates the complexity given to Zemo there was the sense that he wasn't as completely crucial to the main story as he could have been and while Spiderman really grows on you his entrance is a bit clumsily done and makes one think does he really belong? However, 'Civil War' also does a huge amount right. It looks amazing for a start, the gritty but audacious look of 'Winter Soldier' makes a welcome return while the cinematography is stylish, the editing crisp (if slightly and occasionally confused in the airport action sequence) and the special effects as extravagant as they should, helped by thunderously authentic sound. Despite really not being a fan of shaky cam usually, it is not abused here, doesn't cause visual discomfort and gave certain scenes even more raw tension than they already had. The music again has much rousing excitement and haunting intensity while being no less memorable than the music in the previous two outings.The action sequences in 'Civil War' are strong too. The opening sequence starts the film with a bang, with its tragic consequences being genuinely affecting, while the airport scene is tense, enormous fun and thrilling (though because with so much going on, the camera/editing does at times struggle to keep up). Best of all is the climax, which had much more intensity and was surprisingly rich in conflict and emotion. The direction is astute and deftly balances all the different conflicts and tone shifts, while the script is very smartly written with the light-hearted moments like with Spiderman and Ant-Man being witty and hilarious while not once being at odds with the more thought-provoking and serious elements (which never get bogged down in too much talk). The story, while a bit over-stuffed and under-cooked in places, is never dull, never feels too stretched or thin, always makes sense (even with parts that needed more development) and is endlessly riveting right up to the end, which is an achievement for a two and a half hour film with this much going on. Likewise, while some characters are more interesting than others (which is standard for any film with a cast as large as this), the characters are very intriguingly and engagingly written with distinct personalities and realism.There are great performances across the board, with the one oddity being Marisa Tomei as Aunt May, not a big role but not small enough to give the impression that Tomei in age and manner did not fit the character. Much of the film however is dominated by Robert Downey Jnr and Chris Evans, both of whom are note-perfect as Iron Man and Captain America. Elizabeth Olsen is flawed but sympathetic, Scarlett Johansson is wonderfully fearless, Paul Rudd is a breath of fresh air with his introduction actually feeling like a character who belongs, Tom Holland brings endearing enthusiasm to Spiderman, Paul Bettany and Sebastian Stan are authoritative presences, Daniel Bruhl has the right degree of arrogance and is able to convey menace while only doing as little as a whisper and Chadwick Boseman characterises Black Panther's wounded pride with dignity and gravitas.Overall, very solid fun if just missing out on being the spectacular extravaganza expected. 8/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Civil war was a good movie but missed out opportunities to make it a great movie. All acting was good, action was good, story was.. OK?Seriously though, 6v6 is a civil war? This movie had a real villain? This movie was dark? Since when did 12 people fighting become a civil war, marvel should have waited until more characters were introduced so it could actually be a civil war. Crossbones was definitely not the villain, and Baron Zemo was just annoying. Civil war was dark.. some of the episodes on Arrow are darker than Civil War. OK Civil War was pretty dark but they didn't do it right, like they immediately made the tone dark just because a lot of people lost their family.CA: Civil War was the movie where all the people's family dies so there could actually be a plot. Everything was so rushed it felt like iron man just wanted to have a fight with other avengers for fun. Still an enjoyable movie though, better than BvS.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Should retitle, "Captain America Z Tenkaichi Budokai"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been going through a U.S. Civil War history book these days. Whether the human lives destroyed and the socioeconomic consequences of a devastated South were worth their after-effects is still hotly debatable today. Civil war is the worst thing that could happen to a country. Brother against brother, both fighting to the bitter end to protect their homes. A tragedy to be desperately avoided, but when it comes, one that tests to the very limit the human will to discern right from wrong and to hold resolutely to convictions no matter the cost.In comparison, Captain America: Civil War is a parody of a civil war. It amounts to a spat between former co-workers... over governance policy. Iron Man wants the Avengers to be under the UN, Capt. America declines the health care and pension benefits and wants to stay an independent contractor. Yes, it's as banal as that. The fighting starts after some convoluted events involving the Winter Soldier, but eventually boils down to "Are you my BFF?" Like Mean Girls. Seriously. The explosions and wreckage are there merely to show off the characters' super powers, while betraying the lack of emotional intensity in the conflict. Despite all the CGI, it felt so heartless. Unlike battle between mortal enemies, sibling spats don't end in death, they end in submission. So, every punch and kick felt pulled, despite the movie's best efforts to make the damage look real, including a character admonishing another for doing exactly that. The only real damage was to the main characters' egos and my wallet (I saw it on IMAX 3D). See the X-Men series for a better superhero civil war. Xavier and Magneto make a MUCH better case for the need for war despite their personal friendship because it plays into current-day xenophobia over immigrants. This, in comparison, felt like a glorified DBZ martial arts tournament where everyone goes back to their lives at the end of the day. Except, even Goku and Cell had the sense to take their fighting far from populated areas.The technical aspects of the movie and the acting are quite good. But, the story is too contrived. The villain, too obscure. The climax, uncathartic. Afterwards, my wife and I looked at each other asking, "What was THAT all about?" For the young teen audience, there is a strong moral to the story at the very end. But, so simple is the moral, that it only reminds you of how stupid the whole affair was. Didn't these guys learn anything in kindergarten?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Flawed but Entertaining Time at the Movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The inaugural summer blockbuster of 2016 is Marvel's Captain America: Civil War, the third film in the Captain America franchise and the umpteenth in the Marvel cinematic universe. Being as I'm not particularly well-versed in the universe and have only seen a handful of the films that comprise it, I'm going to be writing this review from the perspective of a guy with slight knowledge of the characters and action taking place. Despite the plethora of heroes that are found in Civil War, I'd consider it a fairly friendly place for a beginner to watch. The references to past events are easily discerned without extra explanation and even a person who isn't into comic book movies will know the archetypes and arcs of some of the heroes.In this film, the Avengers are being made to sign an agreement to be under the supervision of the UN after their actions result in the death of innocents. While some agree with the bill, others don't. Furthering the divisions is the resurgence of Bucky, who has been connected to a bombing of the UN. While Captain America works to clear Bucky's name and find the real villain, Tony Stark believes Cap to be a criminal and wants to stop him to prevent heroes from falling further from grace.While the film works on a thematic level (more on that later) it doesn't feel organic in how it assembles its heroes. Of course, if you've seen the trailer, then you know that there's a big epic showdown among the heroes. It's why you came to the movie. But some of the assembling was not very natural. Antman is there?just because. Spiderman makes an appearance, though he feels shoehorned in. Some of the allegiances make sense but the scope of the action may be larger than it should have been.But who the hell cares? Boom! Pow! Damn this is fun! The action of Civil War is stellar. An early chase sequence and the airport melee come to mind especially. It's a celebration of superhero excess that works because it throws aside the deeper themes and gives us what we want: fun. It's like playing with action figures, only with more explosions and better quips.The theme of the movie may be the most commendable part about it. It seems to play off the complaints that have come with the superhero genre; perhaps the biggest flaw of all these films. The final giant action sequences have buildings exploding, heroes crashing into everything?civilians are dying. Civil War addresses this in a way that isn't too heavy but still feels thoughtful. At least for the first hour, then the heroes destroy a suspiciously abandoned airport and I'm left wondering if these guys are really proving themselves.A final commendation: the introduction of Black Panther is perfectly executed and his motivations are much easier to follow than those of the other heroes. I really look forward to seeing more of him in the future.And now let's get my biggest complaint out of the way. This film is way too freaking long. Despite being peppered with enough action sequences to keep you glued, it's a film that stretches itself almost to an unwelcome degree. The airport fight sequence felt like it should have been the finale, but no, it continues for a good thirty minutes more. And in that final thirty minutes we get some of the biggest problems of the movie.The revelation and battle at the end are emotional and heavy, as they should be. It's a smaller scale fight with a lot more heft. But the bad guys motivations, while nailing the theme home, are pretty lame and impossibly mundane for a guy who has caused as much of a ruckus as he has. It made the whole movie feel kind of ridiculous and stupid. "You guys are fighting because of THIS GUY?" Then again, it may also be showing how weak heroes actually are, even compared to a normal human. Nonetheless, a meh reveal.Captain America: Civil War's enjoyability will boil down to how familiar you are with the universe, how much you like the Avengers, and the action scenes. I wouldn't go so far as to say this is the crowning achievement of Marvel's cinematic endeavors (I still prefer Guardians) but it's an entertaining romp with enough humor, heart, and action to make a general movie going audience satisfied. It's not a film I, personally, would watch again. As a one-and-done popcorn flick it works. But I don't think it has enough of what I look for in a film to warrant watching a second time. Thus, I award it:</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worth Watching! Best MCU film to date..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>POSSIBLE SPOILERS BELOW! (If you do not want to be spoiled, I recommend you don't read any further)Having been a fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe films like the Avengers, Iron Man and Guardians of the Galaxy. I have to admit that Civil War absolutely exceeded my expectations. The trailer's get you hyped up for the film but I was concerned as to whether or not Civil War would be over-hyped, especially after last year where Age of Ultron had a lot of hype to it, yet it didn't quite meet my expectations. The good news is once again, The Russo Brothers have found the key to making successful comic book movies and I can assure you that if you are a huge superhero/marvel fan, this film WILL NOT DISAPPOINT YOU and it's absolutely worth watching. Spider-Man, Black Panther and Ant-man stole the spotlight and it's one of those films where you actually feel for the characters, nobody's right or wrong and every single one of them had a good reason to fight. Baron Zemo for once, was a good villain and his motivations were convincing and human unlike previous MCU villains *Cough*Malekith*Cough* Tom Holland was amazing as Peter/Spidey and for those who say he's too young or he's not good as Tobey/Andrew clearly don't understand the character. He's supposed to be a teenager in high school and this film finally gets his age right unlike previous Spider-man films. If anyone wonders why Deadpool is not in it or even Fantastic Four or X-men, it's because Marvel Studios don't have the rights to those characters so they can't use them. Sony owns Spider-man but they gave marvel permission to use him. That's why we were lucky to even include Spidey in this film. However, there are inevitably some flaws as with any other film though only minor flaws in this case and they can be rather subjective.I would advise you to watch the following before you watch Civil War:Iron Man 1, 2, 3 Captain America First Avenger Captain America Winter Soldier Avengers Assemble Avengers Age of Ultron Ant-ManReason I am saying this is that if you don't watch these films prior, the story-line may not make sense and that can make it difficult to fully enjoy Civil War and really take away from the experience. However, when you do watch these other films, you fully appreciate how awesome everything works out.Secondly, I felt like the stakes weren't high enough as I wanted during the airport battle. A problem with the MCU films generally is that none of the heroes get killed with the exception of one from Age of Ultron. I personally felt that if there were casualties, it probably would have made this film more emotional on another level and Marvel shouldn't be afraid to take risks with some characters. After all, there's always going to be casualties during a war. But having said that, this is a minor flaw and the film was still great nevertheless. Nothing that takes away greatly from the main film. All in all, the movie is a MUST WATCH and even after watching it, you won't even know whose side to really be on plus it leaves a lot of questions on future MCU films. Is it perfect? No but it's pretty close</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Its Captain America 3, Not Civil War</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So I finally saw Captain America: Civil War. I liked it. And thanks everyone for not spoiling anything. I'll only say this. From here on out, it's Captain America 3. Not Civil War. Great movie, just not the right subtitle. ***SPOILER*** So basically, I'm not even going to talk about what was in the film that WAS NEVER in the 7-Part Civil War series and you'll see why. I'm going to talk about what was in the film that was in the comic. A mother of a boy who died in a superhuman event gives Tony Stark a guilt trip. And...done. There it is. And they even got that wrong. I like the movie, it just should have just been titled something else. Oh, and the frame at the end of the Cap/Iron Man battle where he deflects the repulsor beams with his shield. That was taken from the 7th and final comic of the series. It was the cover. Literally every single other angle, plot, villain, character reveal, and scene was created original for the film. Its Captain America 3. Its not Civil War. Its like making a movie about Exodus from the Bible and calling it Revelations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What's so civil about war anyway?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know a lot of people won't like this opening statement: It had the same major problem as Batman vs. Superman.We all knew from trailers, posters, and references to the Civil War story from the comics that the Avengers would break apart and fight it out. So, as with BvsS, the writers/directors were tasked with the considerable challenge of generating a creditable story to explain this conflict. They didn't do that. Sure there is good effort on their part, but they didn't succeed. When the punches, rockets, and arrows start flying we haven't reached a believable cause for all this.The inclusion of Spiderman and Ant-Man are forced. They bring quality scenes and good humor but it just feels forced and unnecessary. That said, the action scenes are great and highly entertaining. Black Panther was good but could have been better. His character deserved a stand alone introduction rather than this. Overall, it is a good movie but I wish the focus had been on a believable story and a Black Panther stand alone movie beforehand.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Captain America: Civil War is very good --- But it's not perfect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Captain America: Civil War is undoubtedly one of the better superhero movies we've seen made, and is certainly one of Marvel's best movies they have made.Disclaimer: I grade superhero movies very differently than I do normal movies. It's hard for a superhero to earn a super high grade because of the nature of the movie and the goal of what they set out for their audiences.That being said, this is still a movies that has issues and still has its "Marvel stereotypes" that all of us can recognize.Let's talk about the positives.There are three major action scenes in this movie: the chase between Cap, Black Panther, and Bucky; The airport fight; and the final fight between Cap, Bucky, and Iron Man. These parts are, without question, some of the best action sequences I've EVER seen in a superhero movie. The finale fight between Captain America and Bucky vs. Iron Man is without a doubt my favorite part of this movie.Black Panther absolutely STEALS the show in this movie. While Tom Holland was a very good and entertaining Spiderman, Chadwick Boseman fits the character of Black Panther PERFECTLY. I was very impressed by his performance. He was a character who had clear motivation for what he was trying to do.I thought they did an excellent job of showing Tony Stark's emotional state while dealing with the issue at hand. Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man was excellent as always. I think for the most part the performances of the characters were consistently decent to good. Best performances to me were definitely Black Panther, Iron Man, and Spiderman.Here are my issues with the movie.I found the first act to be a little boring. I understand there must be set-up in a movie of this caliber, but at times I thought it was a little too slow.I thought that as the movie went on, the issue at hand-- should The Avengers be controlled -- became almost non-existent. We have a lot of buildup to the airport scene battle regarding the issue, but as soon as the battle is over, it pretty much never comes up again. It is almost as if the entire reason they battle is just thrown in the trash. I became much more invested into the story line that Bucky killed Tony Stark's parents, and the fight that ensues.One of my biggest issues with Marvel is that they refuse to let any superhero die. You would think that a movie with such high stakes, with such emotion, that someone would die. Marvel is catering too much to younger viewers, and to me, the fact that not one hero dies in this movie makes it feel as if the stakes aren't really that high, and that these heroes don't feel that strongly about their stances.My problem with Zemo is that he was just inserted at awkward moments. It was weird to have him in, then have the monumental airport scene, and just throw him back in like nothing happened. It just made for a little bit of weird pacing.One of the weirdest things to me that this movie didn't capitalize on was the whole "There are five other Winter Soldiers." Multiple times they were brought up, and then one Zemo gets to that underground laboratory nothing with them happens. I was just very confused as to why they were even brought up.Final Thoughts: Overall, this is a good movie. I think the action is amazing and the introduction of Black Panther and Spiderman are both great. But, I found the story to be kind of inconsistent and swept under the rug. I never felt as if the story had pulled me all the way into the movie. I don't completely feel that it was an ALL out WAR. I think the story produced a very good battle, but it was never WAR status to me. But nonetheless, the fight scenes and performances by Black Panther, Iron Man, and Spiderman earn this movie a 7. I really grade this movie more as a 6.5, but I felt like being generous today. Grading this as purely a superhero movie, it's a 9. But as a movie itself, 6.5-7 is more apropos.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lots of smaller, thoughtful moments and a focused plot make "Civil War" the hero-heavy blockbuster "Avengers 2" should've been</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Welcome to Phase III of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, where the solo superhero films get an "Avengers"-sized cast and even Spider-Man can swing out of the clutches of Sony Pictures and into a Marvel Studios movie. In other words, you'd need a lot of action figures to recreate "Captain America: Civil War," but you'd also need to do more than just smack them into each other; Marvel's latest is ambitious, but it makes sense and succeeds in ways beyond pure spectacle.The same couldn't be said of "Avengers: Age of Ultron," a film that "Civil War" kind of pardons by virtue of coming out just a year later and being better. Although both films demonstrate what made 2012's "The Avengers" a success ? an understanding of the importance of humor and character-driven moments in between giant action sequences ? "Civil War" has a more intriguing premise and more cohesive plot, even if you need to have seen both "Avengers" films and "Captain America: The Winter Soldier" to truly get behind it."Civil War" has the potential to be a beautiful disaster. Captain America (Chris Evans) and Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) are at the core of this disagreement over whether the Avengers should be held accountable to the United Nations after all the destruction their "avenging" has caused, but Falcon (Anthony Mackie), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen), The Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan), War Machine (Don Cheadle), Vision (Paul Bettany), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) and even newcomers Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and Spider-Man (Tom Holland) all take sides for various reasons. That's a dozen superheroes to manage in one film ? but who's counting?Directors Joe and Anthony Russo do a pretty incredible job considering all the super- stallions in their stable. They devote the time needed to make it clear where each character is coming from, albeit some better than others. Credit also to writing duo Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, who have been with the "Captain America" films since the beginning, each of them completely different than the other but all very good.The key is that "Civil War" never loses sight of what drives these characters, even when that motivation is spotty. If we're going to believe these heroes will fight each other, the reason better be very good, and the reason it's good is actually kind of surprising. After years of superhero films in which the aftermath of the destruction caused by these big building-demolishing grand finales has been overlooked, "Civil War" gets personal and looks at the loss of innocent life caused by this devastation. It adds a powerful human touch to this massive-scale story. Yes, the heroes duke it out at a German airport way longer than they should, quipping back and forth way longer than they should, but there's a lot of one-on-one scenes that don't involve throwing punches that balance it all out.And that's not to take away from the action. Although some of the sequences toward the beginning feel a bit blurry (and that's in standard definition, not 3D), the Russos make every moment of action count and really think about the characters involved in each action shot. The creativity, staging and thrill factor are extremely strong as they were in "Winter Soldier," plus the violence is grittier and more palpable for a PG-13. It's clear that the future "Avenger" films, which they will direct, are in capable hands.While the novelty of seeing several superheroes in one film has worn off a bit, even this time with them fighting each other, characters like Black Panther and Spider-Man make a difference in giving some of that novelty back. Marvel has done well introducing characters in smaller films before bringing them together, but here we see the value in doing the opposite. The fresh dynamic between Downey Jr. and Holland, for example, turns out to be a highlight of the film and will get even the most exhausted Spider-Man fans excited to see what Sony and Marvel Studios do with this younger Peter Parker next. And Black Panther gets a surprisingly effective story arch in this movie that bodes well for his upcoming solo adventure.Reining in the chaos is the crowning achievement of "Civil War," and the secret proves to be finding the small moments to put in check the gigantic stature of the film. It also helps that these smaller moments all connect to the core moral conflict of the film; we aren't following disparate story lines. Everything serves or can be tied back to the core concept of how autonomous superheroes should be allowed to be, which really ties into why these heroes do what they do, a hugely important question that gives so much credence to this movie and, in a way, the entire Marvel Studios mission. Dozens of films and almost a decade in, it's incredible to watch Marvel continually deliver. If they use the blueprint of "Civil War" as a model for building this third phase of movies, there's no reason they won't continue to make film after satisfying film.~Steven CThanks for reading!

		<shortDescription>Great Movie! Lived up to the hype!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Captain America civil war was a hyped movie. I'm happy to say it lived up to the hype. I loved the movie. The fight between #teamironman and #teamcap was great, the special effects were great and the main thing i loved about that seen is the quirky and humorous comments in between by spider man and iron man. tbh i thought tom Holland would suck as spider man but he was great. One bad thing though was how they portrayed aunt may. I hated that. The one twist i loved that Bucky killed tony stark's parents. The way they turned iron man and cap against each other was good. The recruitment of heroes like ant man and spider man were done well. They didn't have a lot of time to explain black panther's back story..wish they would have explained it...but they're saving that for his stand alone movie 2018. His acting was great too..in fact all the actors were great(though i didn't like Daniel bruhl as baron zemo.) Couldn't find a fault in any one of them. One thing i didn't like was the brief love story between agent 13 and cap. Thats pretty messed up if you think about it. She's the niece of his deceased girlfriend. I mean cmon you must have better options your captain America for god's sake. :)(also I'm hoping pepper and tony come back together again.)Up next is scarlet witch. They explained a bit more about her powers in this movie. And I'm pretty sure scarlet witch couldn't just control vision like that. The stan lee cameo was great as always. #tonystank. The secret endings were great too. But i hoped they'd give a sneak peek in the end about the remaining 2 infinity stones.Overall the movie was good. Thanks russo brothers(the directors of the movie) for a great 2 and a half hours.SCORES:- ACTING: 8/10 SPECIAL EFFECTS: more than the other side of the slash/......

		<fullReview>Kind of interesting, we're just off Batman vs. Superman so we've seen two takes recently on the superhero vs superhero deal. As with most else, the DC movie was the less sophisticated of the two, I would have trouble telling you why Batman and Superman were fighting each other, there wasn't much that made sense in that one. I have two (no, three) problems with this one: 1) the fight CGI (UNLIKE The Avengers) was way too fast to follow, it just looks too hokey; 2) the movie was about 20 minutes too long, there's a fair amount of chaff to get through before the civil war; and 3) the plot was just a little too complicated. Oh, and 4) Vision is too powerful to be in this mix. On the plus side Spidey was done very well, the circumstances that lead to superhero vs. superhero were believable (if a tad complicated), and as usual Marvel is spot on in their casting of the new roles. So while I wasn't wildly cheering at the end as some in the audience were it was a pleasant if a little too lengthy watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Captain America: Civil War is an absolute masterpiece. My only con with this film is that the 1st act is pretty weak, and it left me pretty bored. But it IMMEDIATELY got better! First, Spider-Man was just an absolute JOY to watch. He was funny, he was cool, and he was just a great character. Black Panther was also a phenomenal character. He was an absolute kick-butt guy who made for some great action scenes; Which I LOVE! Seriously, EVERY SINGLE battle scene in the film, (Yes, even those in the first act), had me feeling great about this film. In conclusion, Civil War might just be the BEST film in the MCU so far; And I am proud to give it an 8.9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Captain America Civil War is a great movie. There was a lot of things to love about this Film. The action was awesome, Story was well done and the new characters introduced were great...but it seemed like this film was a big advertisement for the newly introduced characters and their next films. Spiderman was awesome, but when you think about why he is even involved, you kind of draw a blank. And yes this film does suffer from having to many characters in it. Although it's a Cap sequel, it does feel like an avengers film. Once again the Villain in the film was weak, this film would've been fine without the villain being in it to be honest. The stakes were high through out the film, but i felt like one of the big named avengers had to die in order for those stakes to pay off, and i feel like that is what holds Marvel films back at the moment, is that they are not willing to make those sort of big calls. All in all a qood film to take the family along.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best MCU Movie to Date</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just when you thought they couldn't make a better movie than The Avengers, the Russo brothers go and make something like this. The idea of Civil War is tricky, pitting friends against one another all the while they try to remain 'the good guys'. You might be questioning why the would turn on one another, but the script actually provides some sound reasoning per character. Guilt (and a bit of revenge) consumes those who wish to sign the accords and limit their impunity, while those opposing feel the politics behind it won't solve a thing. Captain America: Civil War (aka The Avengers 2.5) might just be the best MCU movie to date (I'm sure the general public will label it as such). While that may be up in the air, it without a doubt features the best action sequence of the entire franchise, the airport scene. Not only does it feature some new unseen heroes fighting for the first time, but it also features ample amount of humor (mostly thanks to Spiderman). It is the highlight of the movie and actually the highlight of the franchise so far. But again, the main fault in my eyes (as usual) is that we are still treading water on a cosmic level. Thanos and his minions are still plotting their schemes and have yet to make their presence known to the Avengers. I'm still hopeful to get more screen time away from Earth and get the feeling the entire universe is in peril. One can only hope.As a whole though, Civil War is a fantastic blockbuster. It features more avengers than any movie to date and gives us plenty of action pieces to make the two hour and 30 minutes run-time fly by.</fullReview>

I absolutely love the tech upgrades they've done on many of the characters.And yes, you will love Spidey. He's the Spidey we've been waiting for. (No offense to Andrew Garfield, who was perfection.)I think the biggest challenge to this movie is that it doesn't bring much that's new to the table. The villain wasn't that novel. And as I know from having to sit through the movie with my parents next to me, not everyone is going to latch onto the idea that they're fighting each other. Seems rather petty, no?But meh, I loved it. There were some aspects of the Civil War comics I'd wished they'd added in, but it was still good. Lots of laughs. Lots of action. And Vision brought up some interesting plot bunnies for future films.Highly recommended, but with hesitation. It is more of the same stuff that we've already seen. For now, that's fine, but I hope they kick up the story a bit in the next movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think this turned out to be a good movie. Though there is one big gripe that I have with it that I will return too. There is a lot of talking in the movie but the set pieces and battle scenes make up for it. The introduction of Black Panther and Spider-Man is really nice and the recurring characters are fun to watch as always. The end part upped the stakes and I think the ending was nice.My big gripe with the movie is the accord/registration act. In the movie it's only applied to the Avengers vs the comics where EVERY super powered person in the Marvel universe on Earth, has to register and give their real name to the state. I understand due to budget reasons that this isn't possible to show, but the stakes get so much toned down compared to the comics.Overall, good movie and I'm looking forward to see Dr Strange.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Civil War is another marvel movie with awesome action sequences that makes it a treat to watch especially the fighting scene at the airport. The movie is very well edited. The most astonishing characters were the newcomers Spider Man and Black Panther. The chase sequence of Bucky and Black Panther was great. Opening fighting scene of Crossbones was awesome.The weak point of the movie is its average story line with a forgetful villain. The villain was not well established. The movie also lacked on emotions which it failed to create even till the end. Now the comparison with the other superhero movie Batman v Superman which also had two heroes against each other. Considering the plot, Civil War is a clear winner with better story line. Considering the atmosphere of the movie, Dawn of Justice is the winner.Batman v Superman fight was better than Iron Man v Captain America fight. Team Cap v Team Iron fight was better than doomsday fight. While both the movies are only a one time watch, Civil War was a little better than Dawn of Justice.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Is this the best comic book movie ever? It was close. But I don't think MCU will ever surpass a movie like Dark knight. But this is the best Marvel movie ever. To be honest this is how BvS should have been. I like DC universe more than marvel. But I like Marvel movies because it entertains and MCU took the comic book adapted movies to another level. It hit the right notes and the right mix of the emotions really work for the movie. BvS didn't quite get it right. Civil war is supposed to be a serious dark movie and one of the best Marvel comics have to offer (Seems like marvel is concentrating on movies and left comics for dead. The quality of marvel comics dipped recently, DC too but the Injustice is really good). But it fulfills the latter part only. It does have some negatives like some poor CGI shots, Average villain and sometimes the comedy ruins serious scenes. But it got too many elements that work, like the climax, spider-man, black panther, the rivalry and ending credits (oh yeah). Will it entertain you- HELL yes. Is this the best MCU movie ever- HELL yeah. Is this the best comic book movie ever?- Nope. Overall: Worth a watch in theaters and buy the blue-ray when it releases and keep it in your favorite movie collections. 8.5/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had really low expectations for this movie. Mainly because so many people hyped up Batman VS Superman and it ended up being one of the biggest flops in the Super hero movies I've ever seen. So ever since then i had high low hopes for movies like this. However, this time I was extremely satisfied! The plot includes the authorities or the "high power" getting involved with The Avengers due to them being very irresponsible and lacking respect when it comes to the citizens of the country. Iron Man and Captain America are now in a head to head battle with each other due to their different ways of thinking. Captain America wants to bring down the bad guy normally, where as Iron Man wants The Avenger not to get involved and do anymore harm. This is where the rest of the team pick sides and if it means they will battle it out, so be it! The moment the film starts it's nonstop action! Just when the action cools down and the slow pace starts to happen...just when you think it's going to be Batman VS Superman all over again, it ends up being a dark, roller coaster ride more than you could possibly imagine! You get to see a whole darker side of Tony Stark this time too. i wont reveal why or how, but you'll see when you watch it. The fight scenes between the Avengers was at least 12 mins long. That's double the Batman VS Superman fight! I really enjoyed it. The ending left me really wanting more and left me with an upset feeling, but not a bad thing! All in all, surpasses Batman VS Superman by a long shot! And I have to say add this in: Tom Holland as Spider-Man was hilarious and downright awesome! I think we have just seen the best person to play Spider-Man! 4/5 stars 8/10, Autistic Jay.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most human Marvel movie to date</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The marketing hype asked us to choose "Team Cap" or "Team Iron Man", presumably to set the stage up for a confrontation between these 2 friends. The cynic in all of us would be justified to think that no studio would be brave enough to make a movie that pits their 2 main tent-pole protagonists in a no-holds barred confrontation (unless they were tricked into doing so like another superhero film recently featuring a flying alien and a billionaire with a Halloween costume fetish).But I was wrong.With Civil War, Marvel did a very mature take on the whole superhero genre with genuine explorations on the themes of friendship, loyalty and duty. With this, it is one of the best film that they had produced so far and also the one with the furthest implication on MCU Phase 3.Whether you are rooting for Captain America or Iron Man, the film fleshes out the motivation for the divergent paths that each character chooses to take. For me, the action of this film (and there are tons of it) are not as interesting as the human drama that the directors have cleverly and patiently unfold for its audiences. And the ensemble cast delivered the drama perfectly and effortlessly.Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film tells the story of The Avengers who have to be regulated in view of the mass devastation they cause during their missions. However, they are divided on this issue, and neither side is unwilling to back down.It is interesting to see a "Captain America" film becoming an ensemble film, moving from a film about a character to a film like "The Avengers". I am slightly disappointed by this, because I like Captain Rogers. However, the resultant story is full of adventure and marvel, exactly because there are many characters involved. The film brings in Ant Man, and even Spiderman, making the film rich with personalities and magical powers (meaning great special effects).Marvel certainly knows how to make an entertaining superhero action film, with a good balance of adrenaline and comedy. And there are two bonus scenes, remember to stay until the end of the credits.</fullReview>

Making the ending of the movie a bit mysterious and leaving us to wonder what might happen next.

Marvel has made money and raise expecting every time with their shared Marvel Cinematic Universe while pleasing critics too over last few years now. But will they continue? Won't audience get bored of the same superhero story lines after a point of saturation? The answer is not clear, but there always would be something new to keep the audience glued. Captain America is one of the most important character in the shared universe, with deep down grift and pain which keeps him going. Chris Evans has come a long way as Captain America/Steve Rogers in this third installment and I can't imagine anyone else other than him as Cap. He has the right flexibility in his body and on his face to deal with all the actions and emotions in the most apt way. If Ironman is the heart of MCU, Cap is the soul. Civil War starts with a mission which ends up with civilian casualties and world wants all the superheroes to work under their supervision. Bucky (Sebastian Stan) gets involved in an attack on the summit and things starts rolling when Cap comes in to save his good old friends. Cap knows that his friend is not the same one which they were in their good old days and Bucky has committed very bad things, but he still helps his friends going against all the odds because he is a good man and this is what keeps audience invested with Civil War. Iron Man/Tony Stark tries to convince Cap to give in which after a point feels to be very repetitive. When Cap goes rogue, Tony comes in with his gang and a new recruit to stop Cap and Bucky with their set of friends with super powers. And we also have Spider-man.Civil War keeps you glued for the first 2 acts with some good dialogues, battle of ideologies, solid motives and impressive action. I loved the airport scene were Russo brothers have gone all out to squeeze all that they can get from their super heroes. Russo brothers know what can be done with Cap and they have done it best with an experience of The Winter Solider. Third act starts losing its grip as the intentions of the main villain Zemo (Daniel Brühl) blur down, out focusing his agenda. Martin Freeman had a very small part, but as we comes near the end, I hope he might be a new nemesis in the future.Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) has a spark as always but sometimes looks less involved. But he has his own tricks and tools, with witty lines to keep you engaged. Black Widow has done some serious action and has grown with every MCU film. Falcon fly's and give Cap a good support. War Machine &amp; Hawk Eye are good in their part. Vision is trying to evolve as a human and Wanda is still guilt ridden trying to control her powers. Chadwick Boseman is Black Panther and has some cool actions with his solid motive to avenge his father. He is a bad ass with an awesome costume and would love to see more of him. Scott Lang/Ant Man does some amazing size shifting which you can't miss.And then we have Spider-Man. The friendly neighborhood Spider-Man. Tom Holland has all his charm in place to play the third Spider-Man after Tobey Maguire &amp; Andrew Garfield. And everyone would agrees that Spider-Man is the best thing in this film. He is so much into the story and then he can be separated and nothing much would happen. Tom Holland is the perfect choice after Tobey Maguire. And how much Spider-Man comics I have read, I believe Tom Holland is the closes to the comics. He literally steals the show. Thanks God, Marvel cracked the deal with Sony and we got Spider-Man in this film. Let's hope the same with Fox and who knows we might get Wolverine in the next Avenger film, against Iron Man or Hulk. Fingers crossed.Airport battle sequence is the best part of the film with Spidey in full costume as a cherry on the top. The fight is worth the wait and exceeds the expectations. People will remember the action and intensity behind it. And due to this high-octane action sequence, the emotional ending looks energy less. But wait, you have a mid- credit scene with a surprising post credit scene. Keep on guessing. Finally, I will admit that Civil War is a flawed film which shifts interests from one point to another in swift of a moment. But Marvel is known to present the same old, world at stake kind of a story with new punches and actions. Civil War is no way near The Winter Solider, but the action lifts the film. And one of the best depiction of Spider-Man. Go watch it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was a triumph. It had everything that a great action movie needs to be great and it was great. The acting was on point the 3D was on point the whole movie was on point. Chris Evens truly nailed his role he was funny in every way. This movie was not as great as Deadpool but it was very close. I was on team Iron Man because Iron Man is great.Parents this movie has a lot of brutal action sequences in it so if you don't want your kids to be exposed to that yet don't take them to see this even though it is plain out amazing film. The movie was non stop herotastic in every shape and form if you want a great action flick then this is the perfect movie to go see.Now go get your popcorn and enjoy</fullReview>

It was the best it could have been and that is why I feel this movie deserves a 10/10, It's a MasterPiece of action movie filmmaking on the same level as Raiders of The Lost Ark, Aliens, T2:Judgement Day, Die Hard, and again The Dark Knight.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Superlative Marvel Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To put into simple terms right from the start, Captain America: Civil War is the most intense, emotional, developed and well rounded Marvel film to date. It is overwhelmingly packed with fan service to one of Marvel's greatest comic stories, from Captain America's famous "river of truth" quote, to the iconic cover of Civil War with Iron Man's beams clashing with Cap's shield. Civil War is not only the best film in the expansive Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), but arguably in the top 2 or 3 of superhero films in history.Civil War perfectly shows how conflict between fan favorite heroes should be done, with emotions running sky high throughout the film, intertwining sub plots between numerous characters and giving them all meaning. The fact that most of the characters battling it out have multiple films of development behind them makes it all the more enticing, none more than the final act between Cap, Bucky and Iron Man, which was so intense, it actually made my stomach twist. Watching our beloved heroes fighting each other is as heart-wrenching as it is enthralling, an incredible feat to make your viewer care that deeply for the events unfolding on screen.With so many characters to fit in just under 2.5 hours, things could have gotten sloppy. But to no surprise, the outstanding writing of Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, along with the equally outstanding vision of directors Joe and Anthony Russo, help Civil War be fantastically well balanced, and well paced, with the perfect blend of seriousness and humor. Even though the Civil War story with Cap and Iron Man takes center stage, this is still very much a Captain America movie, and a true sequel to 2014's phenomenal "The Winter Soldier", continuing the story arc built between Cap and his longtime comrade Bucky Barnes. The films excellent writing is able to use that story line to further progress the Civil War plot, and to help introduce new characters and arcs like the undeniably awesome Black Panther. There is not a moment wasted with nonsensical dialogue, and every character gets their moment in the spotlight, even if it's brief. The many subplots and character arcs are explored at some capacity with each and every scene having major implications towards either the story at hand, or for the future of the MCU, and with that, Civil War has truly incredible storytelling through and through.Marvel Studios keeps setting the bar higher and higher with each ensemble cast they put together, and Civil War is no exception. We have the largest array of characters in a MCU film yet. New additions like Black Panther, many familiar faces, and finally, our friendly neighborhood Spider-Man, who makes is MCU debut. Chris Evans takes the lead role again as Captain America, and he delivers his best performance yet. This is a different take on The First Avenger, he's views are clouded by his pursuit of his closest friend in Bucky Barnes, and the terms of The Sokovia Accords, and Evans displays that inner conflict perfectly on screen. Opposite Evans is everyone's favorite Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man, who also takes on a considerably different writing of the character, with a much more serious tone, something that was needed for the Civil War story. Tony is put under more pressure and hardship than any other character in the film, and RDJ is able to perfectly display every emotion needed, from watching Rhodey being shot down out of the sky, to the revelation that The Winter Solider killed his parents. A truly spectacular performance from RDJ.There are numerous other characters that are portrayed and written magnificently, with special mentions to Sebastian Stan (The Winter Solider), Chadwick Boseman (Blck Panther), Scarlet Johnasson (Black Widow) and newcomer Tom Holland as Spider-Man. Spidey and Black Panther are extraordinary additions to the film and the MCU at large, their powers are expertly done and the actors playing them both give an excellent showcasing. Marvel's "villain problem" hasn't necessarily been solved in Civil War, but with the focus on Cap and Iron Man, Zemo (Daniel Bruhl) was as good a villain as the film needed, he was cunning and twisted, and his involvement in the main plot becomes greater than expected, giving him some solid development.No superhero movie is complete without action, and oh does Civil War boast some of the best ever. From the very start of the film, we have expertly choreographed action sequences, and get to see The New Avengers in action, with a special shout out to some stellar moments from Cap's right hand man, Falcon, and even his trusty drone- sidekick Redwing. The number of practical effects and live-stunts done in the film is incredible, and the practicality adds a level of realism few superhero films can match. Every action scene dazzles on screen, and they all progress the plot at a near perfect pace. One scene in particular that I must discuss, is the now famous "airport scene", which is one of, if not the best, most precisely written action sequences in all of superhero films, and action films alike. We get to see every single hero in the film duke it out, with multiple skirmishes breaking out between different sets of characters, and every hero's powers and abilities are used to the fullest potential. The cinematography in the film is terrific, but it is absolutely breathtaking in this scene specifically. That scene was a dream come true for die hard Marvel comic fans, with loads of thrills, humor and fan service everywhere.I could go on for pages longer, and not have anything negative to say about this film. I didn't even touch on the likes of Vision, Scarlet Witch, Hawkeye, War Machine, and more. Captain America: Civil War is the superlative Marvel movie, and with its glory, takes a heavy run at The Dark Knight trilogy as the best superhero film of all-time. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great start for Phase-3!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love Captain America films, I really do. I loved The First Avenger, even though many people don't. Plus, Winter Soldier was a masterpiece, it was a movie which combined the excitement of a superhero movie with the thrill of movies like those of the James Bond franchise, encompassing themes of government espionage, parasitism. Civil War acting as a sequel, is a follow up to more than one MCU film and seems like a discount Avengers films along its entire run-time rather than being one of Cap's. Besides this, the movie is great. It is packed with all the action one casual-moviegoer would expect from a summer blockbuster such as this, and references and easter-eggs enough to please one hardcore Marvel fanboy (I am not one). The thing which separates Civil War from Batman v Superman is the different tone of narration and story-telling they undertake. BvS remains dark throughout, and that what makes it a DC film, it shouldn't be criticized for being too dark, STOP IT. On the other hand, Civil War plays balance between gritty, melancholic and laugh-arousing tones, consisting of cheesy one-liners from RDJ and Tom Holland ("Hey Cap, Big Fan, I am Spider-Man) plus heart-melting duels between the heroes we love and cherish. The movie, aside from playing follow-up, sets up a platform for future standalone films, introducing Black Panther, which I think is cool, and Spiderman, who I really want to see give a run to Tobey Maguire for his money. Overall Verdict? You should see it, it is a great flick and please don't compare it to BvS, DCEU is just starting, I could do this all day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Captain America Civil War (2016):</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Captain America Civil War (2016) : Well almost all superhero movies deal with some super villain trying to conquer world and our heroes stop them.Those movies only depend on VFX but no plot.But some superhero movies break these stereotypes by making different attempt. For example Batman series by Nolan and Captain America Winter Soldier.Winter soldier is kind of a political thriller than superhuman. So I eagerly waited for Civil War as its Cap Vs Iron Man war. Plot: With many people fearing the actions of super heroes, the government decides to push for the Hero Registration Act, a law that limits a hero's actions. This results in a division in The Avengers. Iron Man stands with this Act, claiming that their actions must be kept in check otherwise cities will continue to be destroyed, but Captain America feels that saving the world is daring enough and that they cannot rely on the government to protect the world. This escalates into an all- out war between Team Iron Man (Iron Man, Black Panther, Vision, Black Widow, War Machine, and Spiderman) and Team Captain America (Captain America, Bucky Barnes, Falcon, Sharon Carter, Scarlett Witch, Hawkeye, and Ant Man) while a new villain emerges. Plus Points: 1)Story: Well this movie do not have any super powered Villain but it deals with ego conflicts between our own Avengers.When Iron man accepts the new Act and Captain disapproves it,there starts a war.We cant chose a particular side among them because they all sound right.Both the teams intentions are good. 2)Screenplay: As I said it has good screenplay which can keep us glued to screen with new twists and hero entries.The way they introduced Spidey and Ant Man are awesome.If you are just an action lover you may enjoy only those but if you are a true movie buff you will love it. 3)Action scenes and VFX: They are just spectacular with brilliant VFX .The chase between Captain America,Winter Soldier and Black Panther in first half and the fight scene between both teams in second half are marvelous.Even the blend of humor is a huge asset for this movie. Spidey and Ant Man gave us great laughs. 4)Performances: Well as we are watching them in their roles in lot of movies we cannot describe their ability again.But Spiderman got a new actor Holland but his look should be maintained well. Minus Points: 1)Duration: Movie's duration is 2hr 30min long so some may feel bored and to those who hate more conversation and less action movies they may not like this movie much. So Civil War is another perfect superhero movie just like its predecessor Winter Soldier. My rating 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Now This Is What A Superhero Film Should Be Like, Excellent!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2016 is a good potential for superhero films first with the awesome Deadpool second with the disappointing Batman V Superman. But Captain America is truly one of the best this should have been a new Iron Man movie because Captain America really didn't need this movie. Civil War was boring the first 20 minutes but later catches it's grip and becomes into perhaps one of the best Captain America film ever made!Now I will move on with the ratings first with acting Chris Evans never disappoints neither does Robert Downey Jr., Scarlett Johansson did great as Black Widow. Paul Rudd was good as Ant Man and the other special appearances were okay so for acting I would give it a 4/5.The plot of the film was nicely handled and it was very interesting comparing all the Avengers film to this they don't stand a chance! So for plot I will give it a 4.5/5.The stunts were handled very great and all the fighting scenes and dialogue and story and direction is simply amazing best film yet of 2016 after Deadpool, The Jungle Book, Ghayal Once Again, Airlift and Fan.8.5/10 or 89% or A+. Marvel has really succeeded over the years.</fullReview>

Also: I was not really a fan of the Winter Soldier character before, but NOW he reminds me strongly of the protagonist of my Punch series (both the Winter Soldier, who is referred to as Manchurian Candidate at one point in this movie, and the protagonist of my Punch series are based on Cold War era fears about North Korean mind control experiments on American POWs. This is a topic dear to my heart because of my father's service in that war.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Superhero Movie to Date!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is by far my favorite superhero movie of all time. This movie has it all, and there are very, VERY, few flaws. This movie is based on the 2006 comic book event called "Civil War", and even though it's barely like the comics, it honestly didn't matter at all because the story was something we've never seen before. The movie isn't all black and white like normal superhero movies, because there's no clear villain in the movie (except for Zemo, but we'll get to him later.) The cast in this movie is fantastic. Chris Evans, Robert Downey Jr., Scarlet Johansson, Sebastian Stan, Anthony Mackie, Jeremy Renner, Paul Bettany, Elizabeth Olsen, and Paul Rudd (who steals the show by the way), are all back and each and everyone of them Gove absolutely AMAZING performances. Newcomers such as Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman), and Spider-Man (Tom Holland) are also awesome and I can't wait for both of their solo movies. In the movie, Steve and Tony's relationship is developed greatly and is emotional until the very end of the movie. But first off, let me say something about Spider-Man. Tom Holland is the BEST Spider-Man on screen to date. The BEST. He jokes, and fights awesomely like Spider-Man should, and as a lifelong Spider-Man fan, I couldn't be happier. The action in this movie is also amazing. The airport battle I gotta say is probably the very best action sequence in any superhero movie or just any action movie in general (Giant-Man though!!!!). And the final battle between Captain America and Bucky vs. Iron Man is also amazing. It's brutal and emotional, and the very last line Iron Man says "That shield doesn't belong to you... You don't deserve it... It was my dad's..." gave me chills. The only complaint with this movie is Zemo is yet another bland Marvel villain. His motivations make sense but he still comes out short and not as menacing as he is in comics. But overall, Captain America: Civil War in my opinion is the best MCU movie and the best superhero movie of all time. 10/10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good action, but overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>People were hyping the crap out of tho movie, so I figured I'd go see it today. Long story short, this was the first time I actually got bored at the theater. The 3D was good, the action sequences were pretty cool, and the camera-work includes some neat shots. Where Civil War falls short is an extremely boring first half. The payoff is good towards the second half with spiderman and more action, but the story gets derailed and all over the place. Not only is the story confusing and all over the place, the many slow parts of the movie just made things boring. I mean REALLY slow parts. The villain is a Russian guy apparently and not at all important to the movie, only appearing for about 10 minutes and not showing any real significance. Speaking of which, no characters showed any significance besides iron man, despite being called captain America. Had this just been Avengers 3, it might have made more sense. Captain America was there, but most of the focus was on iron man and every other character felt like cameos besides bucky and captain America. I had to give this a 6 though, because even though there are some seriously slow parts and plot holes abundant, plus an odd choice of casting (why is aunt may like 35 years old?), the film has good action and I really liked spiderman and black panthers appearances, as they really added some weight to the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Captain America: Civil War is Slightly Better Than a Real Civil War</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a movie that got such outstanding reviews from most critics, it was quite the disappointment. This is not to say that it was a terrible film. I did enjoy the movie, but I enjoy plenty of movies. Going into this, I expected to watch a Marvel movie with epic action sequences, lots of humor, and a big finale. The action sequences were OK, the humor was misplaced, and there was no finale whatsoever. The airport scene that was raved about was certainly the most enjoyable part of the film, but the tone was unidentifiable. There were jokes, missiles, webs, and threats all being launched at the same time. I will say that there were some fantastically choreographed action scenes, but there were not enough to keep this movie engaging over a 2 hr and 27 min running time. The most disappointing part about this movie was the ending. SPOILERS FOLLOW. In the last act of the film, Cap, Tony, and Bucky team up to stop a mastermind villain. Though, in the end the villain did practically nothing. He literally just pressed play on a video to pit Tony against Bucky. Then he went up on a mountain to shoot himself while the dynamic threesome had a little grudge match. So, that pretty much sums up the film. It was disjointed, bloated, and anti-climactic. Not a great combo. At least there was decent acting, a few funny jokes, and some good fights, but that in no way constitutes a ten start film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A victim of its own hype?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Entertaining movie that doesn't quite live up to the billing of "Best comic book movie ever made" that so many were claiming it to be.Zemo's plan seemed to come together a bit too perfectly. In terms of diabolical plans I'll reference Nolan's Dark Knight film in which everything goes a bit too according to plan for The Joker. But what works about that is that you're dealing with an agent of chaos that doesn't really care what the end result is. He's just playing sick twisted games and having a hell of a time doing it.Zemo however has one clear motive and end game which relies a bit too much on a hunch that things will turn out the way he wants and the other players will do exactly as he expects.Spider Man/PP feels shoe horned into the film. While introducing The Black Panther into the movie works because he plays a central role in the film, Spider Man feels forced in as a way for Marvel to get him into the MCU because of his importance as a character to the franchise. I felt like he was there because Kevin Feige wanted him there.Robert Downey Jr as Tony Stark was starting to get a bit stale, but man does he deliver in this film. His best performance in the MCU By far since the 1st Iron Man and Chadwick Boseman was fantastic as Black Panther. I also liked the dynamic between Vision and Scarlet Witch . Vision in particular had a cool role as both the logical center of the strife between the sides and felt his questioning the role the mind gem plays as his power source was a subtle way of touching on the war for the Infinity stones yet to come.And while I stand by my criticisms of Zemo's plan, I thought Daniel Bruhl was excellent and liked that in the end, regardless of his capture he won the day. The Avengers as we knew them at the end of Age of Ultron were no more. Evans and Downey have a great chemistry and in the end that is what carried the film more than anything. People have raved about the airport scene but the final battle between Cap and Tony was the most exciting part of the film. And the reason they stop fighting is because Cap loves Tony. A sentiment that has been built up organically over time as opposed to having mothers with the same name ( Sorry, couldn't resist!)In the end, these are movies based on comic books. You've got to let some things fly and be ready to have fun. I had fun watching this film so I'd tell you to go see it. It was good. But based on preliminary reviews I was expecting a perfect balance of the fun factor of Avengers with the smart writing of Winter Soldier. It wasn't. Good but not great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As someone who isn't crazy about superhero movies, I can't help but be impressed by Marvel, and just how far their stories and characters have progressed in such a short time. Arguably the best of those characters is Captain America, simply because he's the one character people are most likely to relate to. The Captain isn't a billionaire or a king, and he doesn't have super abilities from another planet, he's just this wholesome, level headed guy, who you can't help but like. In his third feature film, Captain America (Chris Evans) comes into conflict with other members of the Avengers, as following a tragedy, the world governments decide the Avengers shouldn't be free to do whatever they want anymore. Some of them agree, some of them don't, and that's where the split occurs, leading to one of the best fight scenes I have ever seen. When I saw the previews for this film, I couldn't understand why the story wasn't used for an Avengers film. Even while watching it, I noticed that much of the focus isn't solely on Captain America, and I became even more convinced. This film was not a true stand alone like we've seen in the past, and that's because I think it was more of a transitional project than anything else. Clearly it seems as though Marvel is putting Captain America on the shelf for a while and trying to draw our attention to the new Spider-man series, starring Tom Holland. I must admit, I have never really liked Spider-man. I always saw him as bland and weak compared to the rest of the Marvel universe, but Tom Holland changed my mind in this film. He was all personality, in a way that Toby McGuire and Andrew Garfield couldn't even imagine. The charisma this good looking young actor puts out there should be enough to get anyone excited for the new series. As far as this film goes, the story was a bit complicated, and in my opinion there are far too many characters involved for this to be titled Captain America. In that sense I was disappointed, because I love the character, and was looking forward to another feature film about him. On the other hand, amazing new characters were added, a major story line was introduced into the Avengers genre, and I got to see the best action sequence I've ever seen, so while it wasn't what I expected, I still highly recommend seeing this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is probably my favorite superhero movie since the dark knight. Wow, I didn't expect this movie to be very good at all, and for once I fell like the fanboys are right and my expectations were wrong. I mean it's got well shot action, it's got Spider-Man, it's got decent character development, it's got Spider-Man, and did I mention it's got Spider-Man? I mean first off this movie does the little things correctly (for the most part), it has action scenes that you can tell what's going on (except for when they have to hide Scar-Joe's body double with shaky cam when doing some of her fight scenes), Chris Hemsworth seems to do most of his own stunts, and overall the fight scenes are very creative and action-packed. The superhero scene with every hero coming together for their big showdown is freaking amazing. Like besides the fact vision doesn't seem to do much of anything and doesn't even chase down Captain America once he starts to escape, every hero seems to be constantly doing something off-screen as well as using their powers in new and interesting ways on screen. The score for this movie is very well done, maybe not original but it's there when it needs to be, accentuates moments that it needs to, and shuts up when it shouldn't be there. The humor is toned down but still there, and besides some missed jokes from ant-man (and some from Spidey sadly) this movie still manages to be hilarious and the comedy is actually well timed for once. Overall the story and the writing for this movie are well above average. I loved black panther and spider man and their respective introductions. I thought the villains motivations were actually really unique, which made for one of the best superhero movie twists since watchmen. Yeah Iron Man is an asshole, and Captain America is pretty obviously right after you get into about an hour through the movie, but so what. The characters seem to stay true to themselves and I appreciate that. Overall this is the second Marvel movie I can say I love, and the only real movie I love so far this year (unless you count the Witch as a 2016 movie). I think anybody, even none comic book superhero fans like myself, to check this out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was so excited for the movie. Its maybe i expected a lot but whatever it was a good marvel movie but not the best.I did like the spider man stuff and zemo was one messed up guy really. After an awesome movie like Avengers Age of Ultron we expected even a lot more. I also like the RAFT and how they try to keep the Avengers locked inside of it. The movie did had many funny moments like cap sharing a kiss with agent 13 (Sharon Carter - yeah the niece to the Agent Carter cap's now officially deceased ex).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just when you thought the Marvel films couldn't get any bigger and better, you'd be wrong. This film tops every other Marvel film in every way.The story is great, interesting, and keeps grabbing your attention. Everyone plays their characters very well. Black Panthers is a great new welcome. And the fight scene? Some of the best I have seen in quite a while. Especially the airport!I won't give anything away here. But, do yourself a favor and see this incredible new installment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I can guarantee it you will not be let down.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Captain America: Civil War - review: Elaboration</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is good, but it's not great. Civil War is engaging enough to keep you entertained, but The Winter Soldier is intense enough to keep you on the edge of your seat, and so I prefer the latter. The Russo Brothers did a fine job with Civil War. The action and fight scenes in this movie are extremely well choreographed. When the action/fight scenes happen, some are spectacular, some go overboard, but they flow perfectly well within the story, and the mixture of the two have context. It's just that for me, I felt like the action really overbalanced the story in Civil War. When the two different teams have a discussion/disagreement about the "Sokovia Accords", I'm invested, I'm interested in their different ideologies, and so I understand why their at odds. All of the scenes were everyone's just sitting down and talking are engaging, compelling, and are by far the best scenes in the movie. When everything goes bang and boom, yes I'm having fun, some scenes are better than others, but I feel they just go on far to long. The airport sequence is the best action/fight sequence in the movie, it breaths catastrophe, Vision warned these idiots, but they didn't listen, and look what happened. I just believe that some of the action/fight scenes could've been toned down a notch, except the airport sequence. I wanted more intensity in these action/fights, and I just didn't feel it most of the time. For example, the opening action sequence is the weakest of the batch, it's a cool sequence with a lot of flash, as an audience member, I get to see the team and how they operate, but as it goes along, I feel like it goes overboard, the scriptwriters could've created something more elaborate, but I feel like they copped out, and they created something more exaggerating than compelling; However, the ending of the opening sequence is the best part; However, I believe that it could've been done better. The scriptwriters could've created something with more of a tragedy element, after a short elaborate action sequence (not the long one we got), show the Team trying to save potential victims from the building, it would've been cool to see someone die while Cap was trying to save them, and I believe that would've been more compelling than the sequence we got.Black Panther is awesome in this movie, I believe that he has the best scenes. Every scene with Panther is intense and engaging, I don't think he smiles at all, I believe that's because he's always so serious, and I don't think you would smile either if your dad died right in front of you. I loved Panther during the airport fight, he was the most interesting person in it because he was fighting for vengeance, and every other combatant was fighting to cease or elude. I enjoyed what Panther said to Hawkeye during the airport fight, while the two teams where sort of playing around, Panther was being serious, so when Hawkeye tried to state his name to Panther, Panther's reply was "I don't care", and that response gave me an extreme experience of amusement.The cameos from Ant-Man and Spider-Man are awesome dude! Ant-Man is only in the airport sequence, but he did get his GIANT moment to shine, and when he did I was all smiles. I've never really cared to much for Spider-Man before this movie, but after seeing him in Civil War, I can say that I'm looking forward to Homecoming.The ending fight is pretty compelling because Tony wants vengeance on the person who killed his parents, but as I said earlier, some of these action scenes go on far to long, and this one is no exception. I felt for Tony and I understood his reasoning, but I didn't feel any intensity during the fight because all I saw was pizazz, however, the last few moments of the fight were good, but I didn't believe that there were any real consequences in the ending result.Overall, this movie is good, but it's not great. I like the Winter Soldier better. The airport fight in Civil War is amazing. Black Panther, Ant-Man, and Spider-Man stand out the most to me in this movie. There's way to much flashy action, I wanted things to be more elaborate. I wanted this movie to be more intellectual, hazardous, and gritty.Final Grade - B</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie blows all expectations out of the water. The emotion, and over all just feel of this movie is fantastic. I can't praise this movie enough. From the first since to the last I was involved the entire time. Its all thanks to the way this movie is written, its done so well and I love it. I will definitely see it again in theaters. The airport fight scene is definitely the single most amazing fight scene we've ever been given on screen ever. Spider-Man was freaking amazing! Best Spider-Man and Peter Parker we have ever been given. From the quips to the way he just acts nervous around the big time heroes, I couldn't have asked for more from Tom Holland. Ant-Man was hilarious and I just am so glad Paul Rudd is him. He made me laugh, he made me just so happy he was in the movie. Plus he even made Spider-Man say "Holy Sh**." I am so glad to be around while we get these movies its fantastic. Will definitely see again soon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Avengers 3.0</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We are in an era when MCU (Marvel Comic Universe) productions become a tentpole staple one finds rather too big to ignore on the radar, once or twice a year, there is impending danger of being ad nauseam. Re-reading my extolling review of CAPTAIN American: THE WINTER SOLIDER (2014), I am trying to figure out why the thrill has faded quite a lot this time.There is no shame to admit that the action-packed superheroes scuffle set pieces are the highlight, as in two THE AVENGERS, in fact the movie should be renamed as THE AVENGERS 3, which could take a more impartial stand in the internecine war. Maybe one shouldn't call it war, there is disagreement, but not so serious, which makes the two teams' group fighting look more than a grandstanding drill, every and each one is too valuable to kill off (since they have an entire future universe to plan), even the sidekicks, War Machine is the closest one to be dispatched, right, Don Cheadle still needs the big cheque to finance his personal projects like MILES AHEAD (2015), his director debut biography about Miles Davis. This "play house" frivolity becomes the hot-bed for bathos (Vision is unfortunately underused for his puissance, in order not to cause casualties, he even has to accidentally undermine his own teammate), that's why by comparison DC's BATMAN v SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE (2016), self-serious as it is, still eclipses this one in its narrative coherence and dialectics. If the script could reveal the key twist earlier, which would give a perfect personal excuse for a more substantial battle pathos (Bucky Barnes could be a ruthless killing machine, right?), which only fleetingly takes place in the small-scale finale, so, this is Marvel's tenor, (notably antagonises DC Comic's darkness and solemnity) - why so serious?Paul Rudd's Ant-Man and Tom Holland's young Spidey are competent comic relief, the former's low self-esteem can be perpetually milked to induce laughters and the latter's garrulousness as a rookie superhero can only be matched by the rogue iconoclast DEALPOOL (2016). Chadwick Boseman's Black Panther is introduced to ensure a more politically correct leaning (the first one born in Africa), so what's next? Asian or Latin American? Or an LGBT addition couldn't be more exigent.Action scenes are sleek, often in close-range which causes some hand-held ricketiness, the indelible ones are Bucky's motorcycle hijacking stunt and Captain America's bulging biceps when holding a helicopter single-handedly. The ordinary human background of Zemo (Brühl) gives his motivation a more visceral arc, but as most villains in the franchise, the chance to consummate their scheme is largely stacked with random happenings other than meticulous plotting (why on earth the script would allow an imposer of an interrogator infiltrates the faculty so easily, as if no one there has ever met the original interrogator?).A lethargy has been officially reached after this chapter, for me, at least, one needs more time to overcome it, sadly there is no stopping of it, next instalment is THOR: RAGNAROK (2017), which might explain to us the reason of Thor and Hulk's jarring absence in the fracas on earth, where is apparently too small and crowded for super-humans, deities and monsters, preparing for the next round!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie so full of characters and story it can't keep up with itself.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Civil War has a good start. The audience is bombarded with well shot action and a new improved Team. It comes straight to the point, introducing the first conflict: collateral damage. Furthermore, the appearance of the Sokovia Accords filter out already build up tensions in the team.The movie struggled to deliver a clear story line. Introducing big characters, but understandably refusing to give them the deserved attention. Sadly multiple important aspect were thrown into the story line only to be dissolved half. Moreover, Civil War managed to put Fanservice into a new perspective. Above all a pointless kiss between two characters without any chemistry or tension distracts of the real problems. The fast changing of location for example the jump from Bucharest to Germany and Berlin to Leipzig wasn't comprehensible. If they decide to put city names on the screen, they should do it every time a new location is introduced.You can go on about which side is right. Freedom vs. protection and the actual meaning behind it. The Avengers are not honest with each other. Tony has his mind fanatically set without accepting new input. Steve seems to worry more about Bucky than on freedom. I have a hard time sympathizing with Tony. Though his "side" is based on a logical conclusion, well portrayed by visions equation, Tonys focus seems to be on a tragic incidence and personal difficulties. He has a hero duties. Tonys priorities are off the chart so he starts to force his opinion on other enhanced humans. This is shown in his wish to pull Spider-Man into the boat. The teenager is clearly directed by Stark, persuading him to fight in a dangerous war. He buys him with cool gadget and bosses him around. Spidey even said that he is just there to impress Mr. Stark. Steve is not really better though. The way the men fight about Wanda, labeling her like an object without a right to choose her own side, is wrong. This is no criticism. I actually enjoyed the overall dispute between the character and in them self.One thing I missed was Bucks split state. A Bucky that needs 3 years to get a grip of himself and to embrace his past persona, without being able to cooperate with Steve, sure doesn't manage to fully work and joke with his teammates after suffering a relapse. Later on he again is not trusting himself to the point where he is ready to froze himself just to prevent damage. Funny scenes like joking around and smiles may enhance a fans liking in the character but they contradict how a former abused assassin should act after getting his life back.Marvel went darker with Civil War and sadly the jokes that made it through the cut really didn't hit it off like in the last movies. Some funny things didn't cooperate with the story line. Once again proving my point with a strangely relaxed Winter Soldier. Furthermore, why is Tony able to chop of a vibranium arm but not to put a scratch on a vibranium shield?Now to come to a point that bothers me a lot. A Winter-Soldier-army is introduced. Deciding to make this big new story line coexist with the already established Civil War-story is a tough decision. It pulls the focus away and overwhelms. It may give Buck and Steve the right to act the way they do, but it seems to be pulled out of nowhere simply to make actions more plausible. This is brought to a breaking point where a big excitement over said army was thrown away by killing all of them. This is weak and easy story telling. It is easy to invent big enemies for big heroes and weak to remember along the way that the actual point was that they were their own big Nemesis. The audience can expect more of a billion dollar entertainment company.Let's see the biggest problem with Civil War. Zemos motives are more of a deal breaker to me. He seams to pull the strings behind the scenes. But in the end all this epic fighting comes down to one more collateral damage. (Really proving the point of the restriction law.) But seriously! 2 Hours of pure heartbreaking action, all just because a man lost his family. A small personal tragedy after Marvel gave us an alien army, evil gods, an artificial intelligence and a Nazi underground gang in the US. government.This just proved that Civil War made some obscure dramaturgical mistakes. It throws around with charismatic characters and more problems to count. It felt to easy to have Tonys strong opinion changed in a second. And how where they even able to capture half a dozen Super Heroes without explanation? Finally, making a huge deal about the Winter-Soldier-army to later simply dismiss them for the sake of the parallel moving story line. In the end it comes down to a simple thing: Loosing and Family. Zemos Family, the Avengers, T'challa and his dad, Tony and his parents, Steve and his Bucky!!! This is the actual focus of the story. The last two Avengers-movies were about coming together as a team, now it is staying together as a family. The movie ENDS with that exact fact. Even though they broke each others heads, they offer help to one another. (Steves letter to Tony), After everything went downhill they realized something Black Widow knew from the start: Family is what's most important. United we stand, divided we fall.The movie failed to really put emphasis on this message. To portray our beloved heroes as a broken family is an awesome move. But with everything happening around it, a sad widower, a revenging son, a Winter-Soldier-army, a power craving government, it just stays in the shadows of a Civil War that is wrongly belief to be caused by collateral damage.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A League to Disown</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(RATING: &#x2606;&#x2606;&#x2606;&#x2606; out of 5) THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED. IN BRIEF: More of the same, but there is some skill and care by the filmmakers to develop characters between all the standard action stuff.GRADE: BSYNOPSIS: The superheroes are called to task about the repercussions of their questionable actions which leads to a splintering of the league.JIM'S REVIEW: Today, many moviegoers above the age of forty, like myself, can easily develop a condition known as PTSHD (Post Traumatic Super Hero Disorder), a malady that weakens many seriously-minded cinephiles who are continually force-fed the barrage of comic book blockbusters playing at our local movie theaters. Side effects include: vertigo (caused by multiple hyper-kinetic CGI battles), nausea (due to shaky hand-held camera-work), a lack of stamina and general listless yearning for sophisticated dialog (instead of snide puns and comic one-liners) and a feeling of isolation and abandonment (as one feels adrift from today's younger generation of moviegoers).If I am at all honest in my review, after seeing so many superhero blockbusters of late, in this era of pop entertainment instant gratification, I must admit that I have indeed reached my saturation point. The formula for success is repeated with successful variations on a theme: A rowdy band of misfits is assembled to become their own weapon of mass destruction, destroying cities in one fell swoop. Endless repartee is bantered between our crusaders. Actors fit into their tight-fitted spandex to fight the forces of evil with the straightest of faces and sexual identities to match. Granted, I am not the target audience that the filmmakers have in mind. But here I am, ready to plunk down my well-earned dollars to see another epic sampling of comic book justice. This time around, the group resembles one big unhappy family dealing with sibling rivalry issues and minor dysfunction. Captain America: Civil War is entertaining, if somewhat over-indulgent in its messy strained relationship between Captain America (Chris Evans) and Tony Stark a.k.a. Ironman (Robert Downey, Jr.). Their animosity causes a ripple effect with the other superheroes taking sides...and gee-whiz, is there an over abundance of muscle, power, and ego! Fanboys, behold the testosterone level on display: Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan), Ant-Man (Paul Rudd), and Vision (Paul Bettany). Women and diversity are well represented in this Marvel universe: Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olson), Falcon (Anthony Mackie), and War Machine (Don Cheadle), Newcomers to this action figure franchise include: Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and Spider-Man (Tom Holland) for the millennial set. Batteries not included.The plot borrows a similar scenario from the DC comic book universe's recent movie entry, Batman v Superman, the premise being the high collateral damage inflicted upon the town-folks by their so-called protectors. Many lives have been destroyed as they battle evil forces. So there is now a public outcry and revenge against the Avengers. It's governmental and political control over our vigilante crime fighters, some of which accept the terms of a UN mandate while others want to secede from that union. Their decision to either conform with this global request or go rogue causes the friction and tension that finally dissolves their alliance. &#xfffc;Credit screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely for spending considerable time to build the interrelationships and inner angst, even if there are far too many Avengers to do full justice to their individual back-stories. Most characters seem to be fighting for equal screen time than actually fighting a cause. At times, the film feels a bit desperate and overstuffed. It is always on maximum overload, which has both positive and negative results. One just wishes less superheroes were called to duty so the film could be more focused. &#xfffc; The fight sequences themselves are uneven. The opening battle is poorly edited and filmed in harsh close-ups that obliterates the action. But the film improves greatly from there. In fact, the main combat between the divided team of superheroes, which takes place at a deserted airport, is a brilliantly staged and extensively well choreographed scene that is worth the wait (even if it takes over an hour to get there). There is also a strong climactic smack-down between a few of the Avengers that delivers, even if the build and final twist misses some fine opportunities to unite the splintered crew for one final memorable free-for-all.Both Evans and Downey as the opposing leaders bring their A-game to the A-Team. They have a nice chemistry that makes their rift involving. The rest of the cast play their parts well. However, Daniel Bruhl is miscast as the villain, Helmut Zemo, who never establishes any real presence or menace. He remains an enigma right to the end. &#xfffc;Directed by Joe and Anthony Russo, with enough whiz-bang expertise to make the film diverting and satisfying, Captain America: Civil War proves to be a film that would rather debate the deeper issue of friendship and family than settle for being just another simple slam-bang blockbuster. That factor helps elevate this action fantasy and takes it a rise above the standard genre. The playing field may be overcrowded as everyone dukes it out, but it is still enough of a crowd-pleaser, even for this older and slightly worn-out reviewer.Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com</fullReview>

His vendetta had nothing to do with a power grab or world destruction, it was all personal. For the most part, he did exactly what he intended and used the perfect scapegoat. This movie has much of the action and comedy we've come to expect of Marvel, but this goes a bit deeper. We've seen all the glory of being a super hero and now we get to examine the consequences of being a hero. I love love love this movie from start to finish.

		<shortDescription>Best from MCU!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the rousing success of 2014's "Captain America: The Winter Soldier," which strived to redefine a problematic superhero in a post-"Avengers" landscape, Marvel Studios sustains the introspective atmosphere for "Captain America: Civil War," expanding on ideas of heroism and responsibility as the Marvel Cinematic Universe expands and costumed crime-fighting becomes ubiquitous in fictional realms and at the local multiplex. Returning directors Anthony and Joe Russo know exactly how to play these characters, building on the "Winter Soldier" success through community inspection while still making time for bulldozing action sequences. Captain America remains the focal point of the movie, but his place as a symbol for freedom feeds into a larger appreciation of heightened abilities and tech, and all the confusion it creates in a paranoid world. "Civil War" teases the Big Ideas while still wholly triumphant as superhero cinema. Trying to maintain his position as a protector of the innocent, Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans) leads the Avengers into battle against terrorism, partnering with Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Sam Wilson/Falcon (Anthony Mackie), Vision (Paul Bettany), James Rhodes/War Machine (Don Cheadle), and Wanda Maximoff/Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen). Realizing that old friend Bucky Barnes/Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan) is a HYDRA puppet behind recent unrest around the globe, overseen by Helmut Zemo (Daniel Bruhl), Rogers hopes to rescue his war buddy, salvaging the humanity that remains within. However, U.S. Secretary of State Thunderbolt Ross (William Hurt) wants to contain the superhero infestation, introducing a policing agreement known as the Sokovia Accords. While Rogers isn't convinced of the law's purpose, Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr.) is, splitting Avenger interests as the heroes figure out their next move, remaining in a holding pattern as Zemo works to divide and conquer. There's a formula to Marvel movies, and when it works, it's wonderful. "The Winter Soldier" found life in the familiar, delivering a newly empowered Captain America to audiences ready for Rogers to tear off on his own adventure, developing the hero into a battering ram with a conscience, growing aware that the country he represents has been poisoned by corruption. With eyes wide open, Rogers returns to duty in "Civil War," only now he's in a leadership position, tasked with preserving the nobility and power of the Avengers 2.0, guiding a motley crew into battle against evil. The Russo Brothers understand the visual power of Captain America, and they handle action sequences remarkably, this time transforming the titular combat vet into a wrecking ball, ordering up encounters where the character smashes through walls and bowls over baddies, often propelled by Scarlet Witch's magic. The introductory clash between the Avengers and armed goons is a great example of the Russo Brothers and their imagination for Marvel-branded mayhem, adding a variety of superpowers to the mix, amplifying the fury of the team and their uniquely flexible gifts, while Falcon is aided by a loyal drone. "Civil War" is incredibly exciting and swiftly paced, sustaining the MCU flow despite a roster change, with Thor and Hulk taking a break for their own adventure (due in 2017). Granted, much of the picture plays like an "Avengers" sequel, but the screenplay is careful to maintain concentration on Rogers, who's faced with a challenge to American liberties with the Sokovia Accords and remains troubled by his missing years as a frozen man, experiencing the loss of a loved one that reminds him of his splintered identity. "Civil War" also takes its time with Stark and his concerns, catching up with Iron Man as he's trying to move on with his life, pushing Pepper Potts away and concerning himself with the development of science and tech, funding young geniuses, while taking a special interest in the afterschool activities of Peter Parker (Tom Holland), a particularly clever teen from Queens. Stark is dealing with unresolved grief stemming from the 1991 death of his parents (one of the key mysteries of the film) and his concern that superheroism is out of control, with new combatant Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) joining the battle, finding the vibranium-clad African prince also interested in taking down the Winter Soldier. "Civil War" welcomes an entire justice league, which also includes a few old faces from the MCU, a burgeoning relationship between Vision and Wanda, and maintains a human touch with the return of Sharon (Emily VanCamp), who joins Rogers in his moral quandary, while also adding some warmth in Captain America's newly empty life. There's a lot for the Russo Brothers to juggle, but "Civil War" never feels heavy or strained, always maintaining momentum, keeping introductions snappy and chases destructive, exploring individual powers and agendas. The story marches all over the globe to provide expanse, but it remains intimate as well, carefully noting the superhero debate and its lasting impact on the future, building tensions to a second act payoff that offers a battle royal between the costumed vigilantes at an airport, feeding into comic book extravagance through competition, watching these ornate characters unload on one another. Surprises are plentiful, humor is maintained, and such amplified combat successfully complicates allegiances, setting up a third act where Rogers and Stark are forced to confront their fierce differences and establish their newfound direction as world leaders seek to control them. "Civil War" doesn't bring anything significantly different to the MCU, but it doesn't have to. Instead of radically altering narrative directions, it maintains the ongoing evolution of these characters, adding to the engaging soap opera atmosphere with new challenges, darker reflections, stranger characters, and enough dramatic lubrication to feed additional sequels and spin-offs, adding more width to this already gloriously widescreen world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best film in the MCU</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film may very well be the peak of all the marvel films. It's the empire strikes back of the Mcu (Empire is even referenced in this film). I'm not sure how they are going to top this film and am worried that it may only be downhill for marvel from here. Doctor strange does not have a reliable creative team behind it and neither does the upcoming Spider-Man movie. I have high hopes for the black panther though, and the foundations of the MCU have now been solidified with nigh indestructible material. This film is fantastic. Easily the second best superhero film ever after The Dark Knight. I have very few gripes with this film, which is surprising. They could have trimmed a bit of the fat on the running time and removed a pointless romantic subplot. But other than that the movie exceeded my expectations in every way. The characters in this film are three dimensional and feel like they could be real people. Everyones motivations were well established and I couldn't really choose a side in this movie as both sides had interesting points. Even the villain had understandable motivations in this film and I could sympathize with him, if only a little (I do feel that he could have been in the movie more). The story was excellent once again and even topped winter soldier's politically turbulent undertones. The writing was once again brilliant in this film.The dialogue felt natural and realistic for a movie about superheroes. Tip of the hat to the Russo Bros for gifting us this encore of excellence. An easy 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>captain America civil war is the best superhero movie ever made, period. that means better than both avengers and better than Nolan's batman movies. its even better then the last cap movie. there was so much going on in this movie that it could have used 5 or 10 more mins of footage to slow it down in the first act, but then it would have been over 2.5 hours long and we know how decision makers frown on that. the first 15 seconds of tony meeting peter felt a little stiff but thats small.there is one big problem i had but its not a cap problem is more of a spider man problem, aunt may is to darn young.the movie had really good organic humor that made you laugh. no cheesy one liners like in Age of Ultron. the airport battle is the best ever put on any live action superhero movie, ever. less destruction but better than man of steel, even better then winter soldier. to have better action then both of those is really saying something.the motivations of both cap and iron man was well thought out. iron man sees and feels all the damage thats done trying to save people. at some point he even feels betrayed by cap. on the other side of the coin cap knows there are casualties even when you do your best to stop it, its unavoidable ( he probably learned that from WW2), cap believes in Bucky, especially after cross bones said he remembers you, and there is no way cap is going to let the only real childhood friend he ever had die. not to mention a fellow soldier from the war. loved this movie from start to finish.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll make this short and sweet....What a rancid piece of baboon sh*t!...just kidding! Actually, I consider this one of, if not the best film in the "Marvel universe" series! It also has, IMHO, the best super battle ever put on film, digital, whatever! Everything is here and it is a fan boy's wet dream and it is done so well. The filmmakers get it! My biggest issue is that there is way, WAY too much shaky cam during some of the fight scenes (Especially the action scene that opens the film). To get everything else so right and just not lock the f*cking camera down, so we can see and savor the action is frustrating. Thank Odin, they kept it to a minimum during THE epic super battle! Shaky cam just needs to be banned altogether. Period!!!!!! Anyway, it's great, it kick's ass and there is even a very poignant Agent Carter scene. Stay for all of the credits, cause there are 2 Easter egg scenes. Can't wait for more! PS - Tom Holland IS Spiderman and he rocks in this movie...Although I do have an ingrained vision in my head of what "Aunt May" should look like...And it doesn't look</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Winter Soldier/Avengers 1 &gt; Civil War &gt; Age of Ultron</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Civil War" is Marvel's second attempt to bring the ever expanding roster of the Avengers lineup to the big screen--and by second attempt I mean this film in addition to "Age of Ultron". Sure, most Marvel Cinematic Universe films are featuring an Avenger or two in some capacity these days, and yes, "The Avengers" obviously started the whole affair in earnest. But Avengers 1 was a more limited roster consisting of just the few heroes who had already had their own stand alone movies (plus Hawkeye and Black Widow). "Age of Ultron" and "Civil War", on the other hand, have featured heroes galore, and so I see this movie as the second installment of this new phase of the MCU.That said, the good news is that "Civil War" pulls off its task of including just about every Marvel property introduced so far in a much better way than last year's "Age of Ultron". Whereas with "Ultron", the film's pacing and lack of setup made for bad storytelling, "Civil War" avoids these problems by offering more in the way of plot development and better introductions of new characters (Black Panther and Spider-Man, the latter of which obviously needed no introduction but got one anyway).As far as the movie's other task--the task at hand of simply being a good movie with a compelling story to tell in addition to juggling so many characters on screen at once--"Civil War" does well in that department. At no time did I feel like I was watching a bad movie, even if there are a couple of scenes that feel a bit forced (Vision &amp; Scarlet Witch, for example; Spider-Man's introduction being another).All in all I'm going to give this movie 8/10 stars. It's definitely a step up from "Age of Ultron", but doesn't quite hit the standard set by "Winter Soldier" or "The Avengers".Two quick afterthoughts:1) Marvel misstepped by branding this a Captain America movie instead of an Avengers movie. The source material may revolve mostly around Cap, but it's really an Avengers movie, and certainly felt like a sequel to "Age of Ultron".2) This is geeky of me, but with everyone happy to see Marvel's "Civil War" comic hitting the big screen, I'd just encourage the comic fans out there to check out the late 80's Captain America collected volume, "The Captain". That story is a proto-Civil War story, written twenty years before the more prominent "Civil War" comics event. "The Captain" was my favorite Captain America story arc when I was a kid, and I'm glad to see it having the influence it's had in the Civil War comics and now in the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A must watch movie for sure.Best marvel movie by FAR!! All the fight scenes are damn awesome , and that airport scene of about 17 min, oh boy its a treat to watch. Its almost a perfect movie, although the villains were bit dull.Another good thing about this movie was how much it gave time to each of the characters and i gotta say Spiderman and Ant man were the best part of the movie.Its far better than BatvsSuper and it did very well were BatvsSuper lacked. For all the comic fans, marvel fans, action freaks, or any other guys you are definitely gonna love this! 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Comic Book Film Since The Dark Knight</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was my most anticipated film for 2016, and it didn't disappoint by any stretch. It actually exceeded my expectations. What this film does so well is how it blends humour with tremendous action sequences. It's actually probably one of the best action films I've ever seen.Tom Holland as Spider-Man is fantastic. I would say this is the best Spider-Man we have ever seen on the big screen. Civil War also introduced Black Panther so well that he was one of my favorite parts of the film. Every single hero in this film has a clear motive for what they do, which is an astonishing achievement considering how many super heroes there are. There are so many, but the Russo brothers were able to balance them all and make sure they all had a significant part for the story.I honestly don't know what else to say, other than it is my favorite comic book film ever made, and the closest thing Marvel has made that can rival The Dark Knight. Go see this film! If you haven't seen it yet, then what are you doing?. Go see it. You will not regret it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Winter Soldier was the best Marvel movie....until now</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is how you do a comicbook fight movie. Every character's motivations is well-defined and completely believable. Why are Cap and Tony on different sides? Why is Cap so protective of the Winter Soldier? Why is Black Panther after the Winter Soldier? Why is Tony? All of this stuff is explained well, and some of the explanations will surprise you. Friends side against friends. People that don't particularly like each other join forces, and it is all so well done.The intro of Spider-man is exciting, and Ant-man has about the most incredible moment in the movie (and that is saying something.)The Marvel Franchise still has A LOT of juice left in it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As Robert Downey Jr's ribald characterization of Tony Stark would say, this film is "the shiznit". I think. We've had a couple of twists and turns over this journey, but now this one is finally here. I am not sure if it's some kind of landmark, or maybe the start of a different kind of Avengers film (more Avengers per film?), but this one is definitely the one that it is, and it's the new one. There's more Avengers in this film than have ever been in a film before. More than the 98 Avengers or 2012, or even more than has ever been featured in any of the MCU movies owned by Disney. There's Spider-Man... he's the new kid on the block, always flashing his eye at the old Iron Man and the big boys. In this one he becomes one of them. Also flashing his points is Paul Rudd as Ant-Man, the ant man. He becomes one of the big leagues in this film. If you've never seen an Avenger film before, don't start here. You'll be confused. This film is mainly easter egg throwbacks to the other films, but done in big fashion. Remember the joke in "Iron Man 2" about Iron Man Tony Stark putting on his underoos? Well, there's a big payoff for that joke here.The plot of the film focuses on Captain America, but really this is the story of Tony Stark coming to terms with the past, present, and future of the entire GALAXY! So there is no nationalism here... not just the entire world is included, but the whole of space as well as the Guardians of the Galaxy. There is so much meat here it's like all you can eat fried shrimp at Red Lobster. Bucky the Winter Soldier is in this film and he is better than ever in the third installment of the Captain America franchise. Go see this film! The film culminates in what is one of the most exciting sequences of television I've ever seen: "the airport battle". This is a good battle and the best action ever put to film on film. Robert Downjey R does his own stunts.So... let's see. Is there any reason not to see this film? Only if you don't like it. But for the rest of us, and I do mean ALL of us (this is one of the most inclusive films ever made), this is the newest Avenger film so let's go see it and also it's the best. As a sequel to Winter Soldier it's thrilling, as a sequel to Age of Ultron it "expands" on the story, just like Spider-Man's new "expandex" costume. Go see him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie to redefine grading scales</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really hate movies that are as good as Captain America: Civil War because they make me have to redefine what I consider an "excellent" movie. This movie takes the word "excellent" and makes me wish there was a better word to use. Excellent is actually not good enough to describe the awesomeness of this movie. Is Awesomexcellent a word? It should be. And even that is weak to describe this movie.Grade: 10/10 (probably actually 100/10 but I can't go that high)100/100 (probably actually 1000/100 but I can't go that high)A+ (+++++++++)Plot: 10/10 From the start of this movie until the end, it is a Captain America-centric movie, but most of the MCU we've met takes part in it--along with a few new members who are welcome additions to the MCU: Spider-Man and Black Panther. Everything about the plot was so well-written that it was like watching DaVinci paint. You can't really believe you're watching something this epic. It is the dream of every Marvel fan where Batman v Superman was every true DC fan's worst nightmare. Everything Batman v Superman did wrong, Captain America: Civil War got more than right. Where Wonder Woman was a throw-away character with hardly any screen time, Black Panther was there almost from the start until the end, and his presence was FELT and appreciated. The story was captivating, and you never once feel bored or left wondering what is going on. Character Development: 10/10 There are technically 19 actors in this movie that need screen time, and all 19 of them are given the perfect amount to make their presence in this movie worthy of being there. Not one of them felt like they didn't need to be there. Even one that did not have as much screen time as others made such a mark on the movie that his forthcoming movie is now much-anticipated. Direction: 10/10 The Russo Brothers got everything right. The Russo Brothers know how to juggle, and they didn't drop the ball once where a single character was concerned. They also made the movie more excellent by getting help from the directors of John Wick to help with the fight scenes. Everything was set up and executed beautifully by them where Zack Snyder tried juggling elephants with one hand in Batman v Superman and failed miserably.Casting 10/10 The MCU knows how to pick good actors who fit their roles perfectly. We've seen each of the actors before, so you know how good they are. But adding Chadwick Boseman and Tom Holland into the mix just proved, once and for all, that Marvel knows their stuff when it comes to casting, unlike another company that I won't mention (Gal Gadot looks nothing like Wonder Woman-- nothing!)Acting: 10/10 All right, they aren't doing Shakespeare, but for what they're given, the actors really know how to tell a good story. Everyone played their roles perfectly because they had a really excellent script to work with. No one acted like they didn't want to be there, and you could tell they were all having a really good time.Cinematography: 10/10 Beautifully shot and great locations. It was such a joy to watch.Music: 10/10 Again, not the opera, but for what it needed to be, the music was great. It was subtle and did not take away from the action on the screen but added to it.Pacing: 10/10 There really was not a slow spot in the whole movie. Scenes flowed together well, there was slow parts when there needed to be and action when there needed to be. Unlike another movie I could mention, there wasn't 90 minutes of nothing leading up to an hours of headache. The Russos let you breath when you needed to and then got your heart pumping when it needed to. Great work, guys!Sets and Costumes: 10/10 All the costumes in the movie were great, as usual, but the star costume in the movie had to be Black Panther. It was everything I wanted Black Panther's costume to be. Spider-Man's was good but not as good as Panthers. Everyone else pretty much wore what they're been wearing for eight years now.Re-Watchability: 10/10 I cannot wait to see this movie again. I'm going to see it in IMAX and at least once more this weekend, then I'll probably see it a few more times as well. This was a really great movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Review from a realistic, neutral point of view.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Captain America: Civil War is a movie that serves as opening to Phase 3 of MCU, and is 2nd MCU movie by Russo Brothers. That means we are bound to have it different. Considering Dawn of Justice came out month and half ago, and with all DC vs Marvel nonsense, and duels between heroes, it is hard not to compare those two movies. Which is a reason I decided to write this review, as both DC and Marvel fan - because I read a lot of both Civil War and Dawn of Justice reviews, and I can't help but notice some... irregularities. Civil War is NOT best superhero movie ever (title still belongs to The Dark Knight from DC, and Guardians of Galaxy from Marvel), and it's NOT how Versus movie should be done either. But that doesn't mean this is bad movie. Movie starts way too slowly, and it takes almost whole hour to pick up. when it does, everything happens too fast. Main battle between characters feels chaotic, and not in War-like, good kind of way. It feels rushed. not to mention that it's quite overcrowded movie (which I happen to find funny, because no pro critic mentions that), some characters don't even get justice, and their point of view remains... untold? This IS Avengers 2.5, not Captain America 3, as whole Cap's goal, and Cap's story doesn't get necessary depth. Movie lacks good continuity. It is fun at moments, then at some you are wondering how long until movie ends. Movie shouldn't last 2.5 hours, filled with cheesy lines, unnecessary parts. Movie would maybe be best superhero movie ever if it lasted hour and 40. Plus from me is that there are no usual Marvel jokes, and whole movie feels SLIGHTLY darker than usual, which is plus from me.of all characters, development was left for few. Spiderman (Tom Holland is BEST Peter Parker we ever had. As for spider-man himself, I need to see more. there is great potential, but for now I think Garfield's one is better for just a hair), Black Panther, Scarlet Witch, Hawkeye, Falcon - all got developed greatly. On other hand, Vision was quite disappointing, along with Iron Man, Black Widow, Warmachine. Tony is annoying as ever, but this time it feels that writers juggled way too much with his development. Ant man, along with Spidey, is something that made movie MUCH better, but still - Ant man felt way too rushed. still, amazing addition. You'll enjoy every second when Ant Man and Spiderman are on screen. I could watch whole movie with just two of them. If those two weren't in movie, movie itself would be mediocre. Which is silly, because movie shouldn't be pulled that much forward by two side characters.Main Villain - Zemo, is forgettable. Even Crossbones was much more impressive. Zemo was so bad villain that you will forget about him after few days. It's nothing we haven't seen in past iron man movies. There is really stupid analogy to Dawn of Justice, which no one cares about, because it's Marvel. It's not same, it goes opposite direction, but boy, it's so... Dunno. Disappointing. All in all - Civil War IS better than Dawn of Justice, for sure, but this is not best superhero movie ever (people said same for Age of Ultron, yet... that was far from truth) . One fight does not make whole movie, and whole versus thing is incomparable to Dawn Of Justice - it's two different kind of versus, both aren't what we deserve. We are now getting too much Superhero movies that we have to set bars higher each time. Civil war did not follow that through, although it appealed to general fans in certain ways. Still, Civil War kept marvel spirit, looking forward to infinity war (only). Sadly, predictability was also kept, so as most of marvel movies - story is bit predictable. I rate it 7/10, same as I rate Dawn of Justice. Is it amazing movie? it's good. Does it have predictable moments? Sure. And unneeded ones? Of course. Should you watch it? Sure, man, it's nice flick, especially with friends. Decent opening to Phase 3, but I expected better. Guardians of Galaxy and Winter Soldier remain as better movies, in my opinion, while this story is as good as Iron Man 1, or Ant man.</fullReview>

It's good, but a bit disappointed in certain aspects, though I really went to the cinema with a fan mind and frankly I'll always keep this 2016 in my memory as the year of polemical movies but I was left more than satisfied :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>1st Avengers + Captain America 2 = EASILY The Best Marvel Movie Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was shocked when I was watching this movie on how great it is. It was not only pop-corn kind of great like The Avengers, what shocked me was how fantastic and neatly the characters were developed and how smart the movie is. The movie is the combination of the best things of The Avengers+CA: Winter Soldier, resulting the perfect combination smart grown up thriller (yup there I said it), fantastic action (action, not only CG destruction), and actually incredible dialogues and jokes that actually works.The characters of Stark, Rogers, Black Widow, Scarlett Witch, Falcon, etc had developed, and it actually didn't feel weird how characters' point of view changes just because how organic the script is. It's well known that the whole point of the movie is Team Cap vs Team Iron Man, and both character actually have good reasons on why they choose what they chose. Like Seriously, some of my friends debated intensely on whose point of view was more on the side of good, that's how good the character development was. Aand all I can say about the new lovely Spider- Man is this Peter Parker is EASILY the best one yet by a mile. All of my Spider-Man fatigue that has been developing is completely gone, and he's the character I'm most curious to see even more in upcoming movies.Captain America: Civil War is unpredictable and unexpectedly thought provoking, yet you would not be confused watching it because the director knows how to construct multiple story arcs. In spite of that, this film is still a perfect action-popcorn movie. The action was certainly one of the best things about the movie, yet people would not say much about it because it got overshadowed by its great directing, acting, characters, editing, just all around a great film, not just a great superhero film. I rate this movie a 9, and I usually only give a 9 rating for near perfect masterpieces that will remembered for decades to come. Captain America: Civil War is literally a perfect blockbuster, it succeed in every way possible, and Marvel proved that they are only getting better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Are we not happy that first of all - Avenger Characters are not being replaced every 5 seconds with new actors. .... (spidey excluded.. lol)You actually feel closer to an actor and them playing a super hero, when its the same actor. You start feeling part of the character. I mean when new actors replace a hero, it takes away the plot as you probably sit half of the movie trying to compare this new guy playing the previous guy's part. I cant see another guy playing Iron Man better than Robert. I cant see anyone playing Captain better than Chris. Wow and these guys really bring new improved action skilled scenes and moves every time. In advance thanking the martial arts guy &#x1f606;. ' Wow what a move.. ' that was me already getting the action in beginning of the movie. Thanks for that.Yes it sounds like I am a total Marvel fan. Its only because they truly make the effort to making a bit of effort in fitting the avenger movies into a storyline which the average person can understand. Its puzzle but it fits one by one. A well oiled machinw. Might not always be spot on to the comic books. But it makes sense and it never ever has been boring. Looking forward to Avengers next year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When action and story become one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of I've got to say that this is a masterpiece in combining a story with action. Yeah explosions, fighting and stuff - but you actually care about it all.Secondly, here is my good/bad summary:+ A damn good story! The conflict is built up believably and there is a reason for every choice a character make. It's a dramatic good vs good fight and you are conflicted in who to root for. There are several parallel stories, like the introduction of the new character Black Panther. Such parallel stories risk to mix badly with the main story but here that isn't the case. 10/10+ Action (duh). Not only it's fantastic visuals, but it also help telling the story. If you love explosions and fist fighting: you'll love it. If you love fleshed out fights where you really feel something: you'll love it. 10/10+ Cinemaography. What to say? The visuals perfectly set the tone of every moment 10/10+ Acting. Very good. Every character feel true and relatable, you can feel their inner conflicts. 8/10+ Spiderman, Black Panther and Ant-man. Do I have to say more? They are all seamlessly introduced and even Black Panther who has a pretty strong story arc are perfectly built-up without taking any focus from the main story. And by the way: this Peter Parker is my favourite up to date! :D+ The blending of each element stated above is done so good. Great action scenes and a lot of storytelling tend to be difficult to blend, resulting in pointless action sequences and a lot of "character development" that feels out of place. This clearly isn't the case here. 10/10Now my biggest (and only BTW) complaint about the movie is - ironically - about the story: it could have been even stronger. You do have a big conflict between good and good, but I think it's to much to call it a "civil war". So there were multiple things that split the Avengers up which I feel could have been built up even more, and possibly intertwined to make a greater impact, making the split more final than it were now.So all in all: very well-made, very enjoyable with great action and story. Highly recommended! :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why Civil War is the Greatest Comic Book Movie Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Super Hero movie is a genre (note: CBM is not) which all of us have come to cherish and criticize for our own reasons and through our own lens. We talk ad nauseam about which one is the best, which ones are superior/inferior to others, and all the other nuanced opinion- based, fact-backed, rationales for why A is good/best/worst/better. I posit that Civil War IS the greatest of the genre. To explain why, first we have to look at what we want out of these movies. A TRUE HERO. Captain America, without a doubt the fastest rising fictional icon today. I can't be the only one seeing Cap T-shirts everywhere I go? How did we get here? Prior to CW, 2 starring roles in excellent films (Winter Soldier is TOPS) and supporting roles in the flashy and wondrous Avengers flicks. We KNOW Steve Rogers now. We do. He's not a prototype, or an archetype, or a symbol, he's a guy from Brooklyn named Steve who has suffered heartbreak and loss and through his backbone of unwavering morality has persevered. We believe in his moral code, and Civil War brings that trust to the forefront of this film by forcing us to view it through not just our lens but other characters we've come to appreciate like Iron Man, as well as through the eyes of our fictional counterparts, the typical citizen of MCU's Earth. A SPECTACULAR FIGHT. AIRPORT AIRPORT AIRPORT. Holy Sh!t! I was riveted for 20 minutes straight by that set piece. It combined scores of characters we love with different and nuanced power-sets clashing together with kinetic and jarring results. Never has there been a better fight in CINEMA than this one here. Civil War is an embarrassment of riches in this department as the climactic battle between Bucky, Cap and Steve is core-cutting, pulpy, madness. The Romania escape scene, with the stairwell battle -&gt; rooftop Buck v Panther was f'ing SICK. Never has a CBM had this much glorious, character-motivated, plot-driving action before. A SURPRISE. Spider-Man. Yes, we saw his costume design in a trailer. Personally, I knew nothing more than that eye squinting image and the actor playing him's filmography. Of Spider-Man I know much more, and on the big screen have seen him 4.5 times (turned of ASM2). The surprise that was the delightful, fulfilling Spider-Man on screen, wise-cracking, web-shooting, wall-crawling and heartfelt as we've never seen before. A CONTINUING STORY. Super-Hero genre is derived from the Comic Book, and the comic book is a serial. To pay true homage to its roots, you can do a number of things, like rip the cover page off the book you're adapting and throw it up on screen for an extra beat (which they did in this) or name check creators, etc. But the truest way to homage the medium is to create an evolving story that lays story seeds that are nurtured into central conflicts in later films. That's what we got here with the revelation that Bucky killed Tony's parents. Bucky himself as a character is also a perfect realization of the continuing story as the Cap Trilogy (GOAT!) creates this saga of Bucky throughout. The ending of this movie is satisfying, and yet... we NEED to see more! A WORTHY FOE. Iron Man and Zemo and Black Panther and Self-Doubt and all the other antagonistic forces that challenge our heroes in this film are perfectly pitched and create a harmony of conflict throughout that the audience can do nothing but root root root for the home team. Crazy thing is, with Iron Man, our allegiances are tested and at times we sympathize with our antagonists. This is a mark of a great film. In conclusion, in Captain America: Civil War we have the truest, the most rewarding, the most riveting, emotional, suspenseful Super Hero movie that has ever been created. Wonderful movies in the genre have come before. Some with excellent villains like Ledger's Joker, some realizing moments on screen that most never dreamed we'd see (The Avengers) and others that offered us a taught thrill-ride (Spider- Man 2, Days of Future Past). NEVER, and I mean never, have we gotten a movie that delivered EVERYTHING we could hope for in a single offering like we got with CIVIL WAR. It has NO weak spots, indeed this movie is all STRENGTH and that is why it's the Greatest of All Time.</fullReview>

So if you are a movie fan it's a must see, SPOILER WARNING - If you have not seen this film stop reading right now - o.k., Spider-man was so much fun, I loved watching him in action, He was just as I expected to see him on any film before, they just upgraded him and it was something else, I recommend the Spidey fans to go and check it out, Ant-man was funny and Black Panther was as good as Batman on any film, we was just awesome.</fullReview>

However, this one has done two things: 1) it has done everything that previous MCU films have done, only it's done them better 2) it has blown away predecessors such as the cringe- worthy 'Dawn of Justice' and given me the best time at the movies I've ever had with a superhero film. That doesn't necessarily make it the best in quality, but it is my favorite. Because it's so easy to compare this movie with 'Batman v. Superman', that's what I'll be doing. First off: this movie is not a versus movie per se. It explores the question that many viewers such as myself might contemplate about the superhero genre, which is: how does the general population really feel about these heroes? Aside from a few news clips, we don't get much from input from this fictional public. Now we get to explore from a satisfyingly not-too political and yet still political standpoint how the government and the citizens react to the aftermaths of the films we've seen. The movie focuses very well on the setup of the final duel and the final duel itself. Baron Zemo is behind it all, but I won't get too in-depth on here. Whereas BvS set up everything clumsily and unbelievably, 'Civil War' was very easy to get into and accept as part of the Marvel realm. The cast is overloaded, but the characters are panned out surprisingly well. Each is given a satisfying amount of screen time, including the smaller roles of Paul Rudd, William Hurt, Martin Freeman and Marisa Tomei, and not to mention newcomers Black Panther and Spider-Man. Speaking of which: this alone makes this movie re-watchable. Most superhero films get less and less re-watchable as the years go by, so I tend to treasure first viewings. But I'm confident I can continue watching this film for some time. The plot gets me going, and Black Panther and Spider-Man are both extraordinary on screen. Spider-Man is young, which may bother a few, and he does have a PG-13 wit (ala the R wit of Deadpool), but this is the Spider- Man that the comics originally gave us. I'm not afraid to say all previous incarnations have sucked compared to Tom Holland's new version of the character. And what can I say?Black Panther, Winter Soldier?every action scene in this movie (minus the opening Crossbones scene- the decided weak point in the film) is awesome. Maybe not flawless, but awesome. And so that pretty much wraps it up, all things considered. Things get serious in the third act, but it's still a good time. Everything up to that point made me want to grin and cheer, especially the already- praised airport battle. The film certainly leaves a lot to be concluded. It almost worries me, as maybe this means 'Avengers: Infinity War Part 1' will have to be more of a setup than a real Infinity War movie. But we'll have to see. I now have much more confidence in the Russo brothers than ever before. Congratulations on giving us Marvel's best installment yet.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It is brilliant incredible a masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a comic book reader my expectations were really really high but again Marvel didn't disappoint and gave its fans the best adaptation this comic can get.Not even for a moment I was bored,I didn't even blink so I won't miss a second of it.The movie was so action-packed and the fight choreography was mind-blowing.Also it was so intense and showed us each hero has a dark side but at the same time extremely funny.I was having heart attack watching but also laugh my self into tears.This is what you really expect from a movie,to give you a little bit of both.The Russo brothers did an excellent job.Not just bringing all these heroes together but also introducing new ones.It is not easy.They come up with a story that it is not just a political incident but also an emotional showdown.We finally got to see how the world really feels about heroes.We see the damage they have done.Yes they saved thousands but what about the ones we have lost.It was the best answer to the people who think that Marvel isn't realistic.I ask you can they get more realistic?!Another thing that got my attention was we finally got a movie that does not end with saving the world cliché. We also see that heroes does not always win.Another point that needs appreciation was the visual effects.As someone studying software engineering I'm very strict about basic points and they did a great job.Everything looked so real and they gave us a fight scene that will leave its mark in history.To the ones saying there is too much CGI.Try shooting without the CGI and just good luck.I really believe that the visual effects is the thing that gets our favorite heroes out of the comics into the real world.Finally all I ask is just forget about your prejudgments and stop comparing this to BVS.Just enjoy one of the best comic book movies of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Which side are you on? Are there sides at all? Do you support the ideology of freedom and individual responsibility or the one of security and obedience to a collective? Is either of those two polar opposites attainable in the first place or are they just illusions?This film couldn't have been more topical if it wanted to. Wait a minute - it's the Election year in the US... it DID want to be topical. Nothing occupies minds of citizens of the Western hemisphere more than these issues nowadays and "Captain America: Civil War" addresses them with zest. Of course, it does so in Marvel style: punch up first, ask questions later, but it does address them with some unexpected insight and self-awareness.Personally I found the premise a little ludicrous. If I was someone with superpowers and a proved record of integrity and reliability I'd be hard pressed to allow sneaky bureaucrats who elbowed their way to UN to "supervise" me; or to wait for months on end for them to reach an agreement on what to tell me to do. If I was an unreliable and/or immoral superhero, they'd see even less of me. So it's a no-brainer as to what side should any of the characters really take. I also found ironic that the thing "the Avengers" were accused of by their political opponents - routinely ignoring sovereignty of national states and acting as the World police - is what the US military does on a regular basis. But hey, the setup needed to happen and the screenwriters have put in enough effort to make it look as plausible and as realistic as possible.The result is a very tense and well paced film that balances serious and fun bits pretty easily. All the characters of old as well as some new additions have found their place in it. Perhaps the most anticipated addition, the one of Spiderman, is the one most effective (and hilarious). Given how colorful that superhero bunch is, the fight scenes are naturally spectacular and very imaginative. I found the ending kind of anti-climactic and unfairly vague in resolution. Obviously a major Disney investment isn't allowed to really take sides and risk repelling some of the audience, and that warrants taking the rating down a notch or two. Still, overall it's a very satisfactory film.Of course, comparison with another major conflict in a competing comic-book franchise is inevitable and kind of obligatory. So, as far as that's concerned, I'd say I find both films on equal footing. Both are overall impeccably produced and directed, both are marred with similar implausibilities in terms of main premises, and both can be forgiven for that because they're so damn well made. The only difference is "Captain America: Civil War" is more fun and "Batman v. Superman" has a more poignant ending.But comparisons don't really matter to me - I like both franchises and I like to see them both alive and well because I've grown tired of TV-series. You see, ever since the early days of television the cinematographers are fighting to bring the audience back to theaters. A relatively easy task at first, it became harder and harder over the decades, as both TV-series and TV-sets kept getting more and more cinema-like. The 3D technology was the latest gimmick but it also ended up in living rooms. And now the film industry started copying television. Just as TV has series, cinema has "franchises". A couple of ongoing and very expensive sagas are set to entertain majority of the film-goers during the next decade or so. The companies can ill- afford any flukes and I root for all of them to succeed as far as possible. If they retain the quality of this year's entrances, it could be a long fun ride.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fighting scenes are good and exciting, as always. Mark 46 is sooooooo good- looking.The title is Captain America 3, so Cap is always right???? Excuse me??????? Bucky wasn't himself when he killed Tony's parents, it was Hydra's fault, I get it. But they were killed by Bucky, at least his body. If Tony decides to forgive Bucky, it means Tony is a noble man, if not, it means he's a human being, with feelings. It's just not your call, Cap. Even Bucky knows he did a lot of terrible things under control, Cap seems to have lowered the IQ of Avengers, if he still deserves to be one of them. The letter totally sounds weird. When I heard it, it didn't sound like "whenever you need my help, I'll be there". It sounds like the opposite. Of course, I may be biased, because I feel soooooooooo bad for Tony. Cap is being very personal. Besides, I don't get Wanda either. Tony and Vision kept her in the house because they don't want the public to see her when they are still afraid of her, or cause some worse consequences. What's wrong with that????Spiderman and Antman are cute, but are they really necessary? It's called Captain America: Civil War, but it involves 12 superheroes altogether. Black Panther seems to be a smart and reasonable man. Looking forward to his solo movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Marvel Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The character conflict in this movie is built up so well. It takes it time and lights a fuse, making not so great Marvel Movies relevant and demonstrating that there were consequences in those films while also having thrilling action and a story that you can really get invested in because of how well-realised the characters are in this film. Forget Avengers. This is the pay-off to those stand-alone movies that ranged in quality that we sat through. We have twists, broken people and relationships, enthralling action and an amazing well-done emotional undercurrent. The action choreography is so well-done and instead of having standard fight choreography like in Winter Soldier the settings combined with the great idea to make a legitimate action sequence instead of some bloated CG fest prevent any action sequence from being repetitive and dull and all of them are quite phenomenal and the character conflict make it more meaningful. And the motivation behind characters is so understandable because of their past experiences and that clash of belief ends in a dark, emotionally intense finale. Though it is still entertaining. There is humour and this movie has most fun character ensemble in a Marvel film ever and just gives out so much fan service while still feeling tangible and Civil War is throughout always entertaining. There are some flaws, most noticeably a scene at the start of the film that gave me deja vu of the most terrible parts of AOU though luckily that was one scene. There was also a bit of a lull and slow-pacing during one point in the film that affected the building intensity this film had ever so slightly and took me out of the film a little bit and there is one funeral scene that was a bit executed ever so cheesily but that is just a nit-pick. All up this film has tiny flaws and is definitely the best Marvel Movie. I love this movie and I'm pretty sure it is an 8/10 but I will have to view one more time to solidify that rating so for now I am giving it a 7.5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not groundbreaking but a lot of fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nothing lasts forever, a sentiment that extends to the now overstuffed and far to frequent superhero films of the modern day and where adventures like Spider-Man or the team up of The Avengers once felt like a true event, superhero films whether they be of Marvel or DC variety in today's climate feel increasingly uninspired and forgettable, which makes the enjoyment levels found in Captain America's third outing Civil War that much more surprising.While it neither reinvents or rejigs the comic book staple that has become so stale over recent years and while it sometimes takes itself far too seriously for its own good, Winter Solider helmers Anthony and Joe Russo successfully balance a large roster of beloved characters and a couple of new ones in the form of a fresh faced Spider-Man and Black Panther to make Civil War's slightly overlong run time an enjoyable and likable event.Delving into the idea of an inwardly warring Avengers group with larger than life personalities like Tony Stark clashing with the well-meaning and old school like Steve Rodgers, Civil War presents us with a collection of superheroes and super soldiers that aren't all lovey-dovey, rather at the point of blows within a world that no longer wants to give these creations free reign around the globe, themes that were prevalent in the recent Batman v Superman but explored far more enjoyably here in this more fun focused ride.With its fair share of dialogue heavy situations and scenarios, the Russo's infuse Civil War with a collection of highly entertaining action set pieces filled with great moments (many that involve a teenage Spider-Man and Paul Rudd's endearing interpretation of Ant Man) and humorous quips by its now seasoned cast members that make its weaknesses like a largely forgettable baddie in the form of Daniel Bruhl's Zemo and terrible payoff of bad guy motivation and plans far more tolerable and new cast members Tom Holland as Peter Parker and 42s Chadwick Boseman as T'Challa/Black Panther seem like positive additions to an ever expanding roster of players.Hard to hate and easy to enjoy, Civil War doesn't exactly make one feel as though the superhero blockbuster is 100% assured heading into the distant and not too distant future but it certainly enough to makes a now cynic like me feel far more willingly to be a part of the crowd pleasers for the next little while as long as they are as well played and constructed as this energetic adventure.3 1/2 Vision cooked dinners out of 5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marvel's Best Film (so far) Some Spoilers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Joss Whedon directed The Avengers he proved he could handle all the voices, but wasn't adept with delivering out-of-this-world action (partly his fault as co-writer). Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love the film as it was fan service for Marvel's elite but compare it to Winter Soldier and Civil War, two things separate the men from the boy (those darn Russo brothers). Pacing in Civil War is on-point, character beats are pitch-perfect and everyone gets to do something! If you felt letdown by Olsen's Wanda in Ultron (Whedon claims to champion strong women but they were sorely lacking) she makes up for it here, as does the heavenly VanCamp reprising Agent 13/Sharon Carter. I've said in the past how I thought Emily Blunt was the better choice for Black Widow (and has since gone onto award-winning fare with Huntsman 2) but Johansson has nailed that part of Romanoff. She's hot, funny and more importantly, a deadly assassin who could betray you in a heartbeat.A lot has been said regarding Brühl's casting as Zemo and it's okay to express that opinion. However, the Russo brothers want to remind the audience they're not just watching a superhero film, but also a thriller and Brühl is another strand in a movie with so many elements. You're not going to have him appear for a few minutes and bugger off; he's a tremendous talent and hoping we might see Baron Zemo in a future Cap movie. &#x200b;A huge smile came across my face when we turn to a different part of town (New York to be precise) and our first look at Tom Holland as Peter Parker/Spidey. I gotta tell you, he is a lot of fun! He looks and dresses like a typical teenager (still the best time of anyone's life; adulthood just stinks). Don't even get me started on Aunt May (one of my all-time favourite actresses) who happens to be incredibly hot (great casting choice Sony! Let's forget dowdy Sally Field who by rights, hated being in the Garfield-emo vehicles). This is one of the movie's most endearing and iconic highlights and perfectly illustrates that Marvel knows how to deliver drama. Holland is already a star in the making and loved him in The Impossible. I hope Sony hits a homerun with Homecoming in 2017 and thank God the Russos knew who they wanted because CW wouldn't be the same without his presence. And boy, Spider-man is used to amazing effect (pun very much intended). It's whetted my appetite and if Holland is given a decent script/story and incorporates Easter eggs from the 70s/80s, I'll be one happy Jazzy! Still, Tony Stark will pop in and I for one cannot wait.Two towering performances from acting stalwarts, Downey Jr. and Evans - I could watch these guys all day. Their dialogue in previous films has been solid and here it's notched-up to a ten. Not since Redford and Newman have I seen such flawless chemistry which rarely gets mentioned. Yes, wearing a superhero costume and spouting meaningful text may seem redundant to those who despise these movies, but let's hark back to Shakespeare (still pausing for thought, dear? Okay). Evans IS Captain America and has made that role his own (sorry Jensen Ackles). Not only is Evans a fine physical specimen to behold but he's also a damn great actor who brings command and presence for a character whose popularity was in doubt. But watching The First Avenger again and its superior sequel, it's hard not to love the big guy and rooting for him all the way. But thank the Russos and writers for elevating Steve Rogers status and blending him with politics/corruption, the perfect vehicle. Tony Stark does have his moments to be funny in Civil War, but also gets to be an entirely different beast (had this been a Hack Snyder project Iron Man would be on a killer rampage by the third act). DC can sort out their hasty business decisions and critical fallout, but Marvel know their (bleep) and why casting has been paramount in the success of the MCU. I guarantee by the end of it all, you'll be sucker-punched through the heart. RDJ isn't just a great actor, he's a force and I love him for that and never phones in a performance; if anything he owes his second chance in life to Iron Man and Marvel and that is evident (hell, he even owns the Avengers logo which sits in his office!) I'm not ashamed to admit it but I man-cried in Act 3. Kudos to the writers who deserve an Oscar each.The airport or as rival fanhards called it "car park scene" is the template on how such a grand action set-piece is executed with beauty and precision. Hack Snyder should take notes and watch his mess with BvS's final showdown which makes Michael Bay look (almost) like Martin Scorsese. The action scenes are easily 10/10 and makes you forget you're watching a PG-13 movie. Unlike DC, Marvel assumes you've watched all of their films before arriving at this juncture and doesn't hold your hand in doing so.Love Deadpool which I need to rate jointly with Civil War as my favourite movies of 2016.</fullReview>

It's really the best scene (airport scene) in history.But, there's a big but. Before and after that scene there's nothing. Is more of an okay.

		<fullReview>Captain America: Civil War. We all went there with high expectation, and it delivered!The positives: Civil War is FULL of action. Each action sequence and fight sequence had me at the edge of my seat, lowering my hand into my snack as my eyes were glued to the screen. It was pure magic to watch!I also think that the characters were well adapted, from Iron Man Tony Stark's ego being challenged, to Winter Soldier's return - this movie will give you enough on every character to enjoy!The negatives however lie with the timing of the movie - it's a little awkward. A small spoiler here, but it's tagged either way - there is no consequence! There's nothing here that's lost in this war and this makes little to no impact on that actual Marvel Cinematic Universe.To summarise - this movie has all the action you want and came for, but feel a little unsatisfied as you realize that is actually ended without anyone dying.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Captain America: Civil War is directed by the Russo Brothers and stars Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Sebastian Stan and Robert Downey Jr., and the tells the story of two camps that get formed after another incident involving the Avengers. One camp is led by Steve Rogers and the other is led by Tony Stark.Marvel's new highly anticipated film has finally arrived, and I'm of course talking about Captain America: Civil War. My expectations were very high for this film, since I heard nothing but great things from Critics and fans alike. So, is Civil War a comic book masterpiece? Well, to me it isn't. Look, I'm not disappointed by any means. But I just expected more. The movie is widely entertaining and the action scenes look amazing, but it never felt like there was anything at stake. This film also features another weak villain, which I think shouldn't have even been in the film in the first place. My other grip with the film are the few misused and thrown away characters. Characters like Crossbones and even Spider-Man didn't even had to be in this film. But none the less, I have to admit that it was fun seeing them on the screen. Now. Let's stop complaining and let's get into the juicy stuff. The battles between all the different superheroes throughout the film are extremely fun. Especially the fight sequence on the airport. Some unexpected and amazing stuff happens on that airport. Especially something that Ant-Man does is mind blowingly great. Something that Comic Book readers will truly appreciate. As I mentioned earlier, the action is executed very well and filmed stunningly by the Russo Brothers. Although the comedy wasn't as great as it was in Ant-Man or Guardians of the Galaxy for that matter, I still had to chuckle a few times. Overall, Captain America: Civil War is a fun summer blockbuster that will keep interested and entertained the entire way through.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am kind of new to superheroes and comics, and has many times though that they are reusing the epic moments from Avengers when the Hulk smashes the big whale-snake-floating ship, and I thought that the Thor movie was pretty B and 3D- infested mess. But this movie is pretty awesome! Using all characters and making them feel like you know them, when watching their single movies to the big civil war fighting is awesome! But I got to say awesomeTHAT SPIDERMAN!! I never really thought much about the actors they used in the portraying of Spiderman through the other Single-movies. You can never really relate to them, and they feel a bit like, they put a 30 year old man to play a high schooler. A high schooler who is really good- looking, not awkward at all and feel, in Garfields case like a douchebag, more then that weird "science-geek" he is suppose to portray. "I am a high-schooler". But really they are not! They don't have that awkward set up like you do when you are that age. In the way that they break in their voice or in the way they act. But this Spiderman does!! First when I saw Peter Parker i Civil War, I was confused thinking he was someone else. But when he started to act his part!! PERFECTON! This is the BEST Spiderman I have ever seen, with or without the costume! Well now I am just blabbing about the spiderman-moment... But just giving me a sneak-peak of these characters awesome setup and the big fight! Gave me all the Epic-Movie moments I could ask for this summer! Thank you Marvel for bringing Spiderman back to his Teenage self!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Captain America: Civil War will be known as the Godfather II or Empire Strikes Back of the comic book movie genre. The Russo Brothers emphatically show their mastery of how to blend fantastical, comic gold with honest, complex struggles and emotions any moviegoer can feel or recognize in our reality. The writing that went into the grand action pieces, each character's role and development, and the overall conflict was nothing short of pure genius and heart. This film does all the clever comic book interactions and quips we've come to expect with Marvel, but it takes itself into another threshold of brilliance by providing audiences with a gripping yet balanced plot filled with highly understandable logic behind each characters' motivations. Marvel has given us its pinnacle masterpiece to date, leaving audiences with even more reason to feel happily invested in the MCU. The films listed above were what our parents were passionate to share with us, and I'm glad to say I have found my own.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as I thought it'd be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To start off: I am a big fan of Marvel comics, and enjoy most of their movies too. I also loved the Civil War comic event, which, to me, was probably the best crossover in comics.I was excited about a movie based on it, but walked out of the theater rather... disappointed. Why?- Of course it wasn't possible to translate the whole story-line into a movie. There are hundreds and thousands of heroes involved in the comic version, and it's such a huge amount of comics in the event. However, the main-thing, the actual Superhero Registration Act, the law that divides the heroes plays almost no role at all in the movies. It comes up, gets explained, some sign, some don't, and then it's all about battles and that story-line with Zemo. That Act has potential... it does make sense, but at the same time, it is understandable why some heroes refuse to sign it. This isn't covered here.- Pacing and story. This feels like zapping between two different movies.Even though it's long, they tried to cram too much in here.- The battles were OK, but nothing as epic or fun as the final battle in Avengers. The airport fight... well, it was like a playground. No one was hurt here? - Too much focus on Winter Soldier, whom I don't find a terribly interesting hero. Are they setting up a death for Cap for WS to take over, like he did in the comics?- Plot-holes- Music is entirely forgettable- An uninteresting and cliché opponent- Yeah right, that German police mission in Bucharest was SO realistic. As if /sarcasm- The color palette of the movie felt cold, gray, dull and depressing. Was this on purpose? Why not let the story cause emotions, instead of paining everything in a dull gray? Why telegraph what we are supposed to feel?- The new Spide-Man was fun, but what are those stripes on the costume? Also, at the same time, I was bored quickly of him. Thanks to Marvel for the THIRD Spider-Man in 15 years. It gets dull and repetitive and its hard to care when it's ANOTHER. NEW.Spider-Man. Also, Spidey has a big role in CW, but here, it just feels odd that he is asked to help.- Now, one revolutionary thing Marvel did back in the day was to have these crossovers, heroes appearing in other comics, to make the world feel cohesive. However, does EVERY SINGLE EVENT, EVERY ITEM have to be connected to another movie or character? The whole thing about the death of Iron Mans parents was just..unnecessary. I mean, what's next? Was every parent of a hero killed by some other hero or villain now?- The helicopter scene. Evans himself called it biceps porn. It's silly, and had me laughing as it was so obvious. And how does he first hold the helicopter when not holding anything? Magnet shoes? Glue? It doesn't matter how strong Cap is! If he is not fixed to the roof somehow, just stands on it, only his weight matters and the helicopter could have taken off. He couldn't have applied force by dragging his feet! I have no problem suspending disbelief in a superhero-movie, but this was just sillyThe good parts:- Ant-Man. Much needed comic relief delivered by him. Loved his movie, love him here.- Black Panther is pretty neat. The change with the Vibranium armor adds more credibility, because it's always the question how well such a character can stand against some totally overpowered heroes. BP looks cool, and has some nice scenes.- Scarlet Witch is doing OK. She mainly has 3 facial expressions, but she does the best she can with the script she was given.- Some fun battle scenes for all chars- Martin Short was nice.Verdict: Too many cuts and changes of scenery, not enough focus on the actual Registration Act, too dull-looking, too many coincidences. This could have been amazing, but ends up merely OK,sadly</fullReview>

In my opinion i liked civil war more than ultron &amp; winter solider, this one has delved in to story more than other two movies.

		<shortDescription>Marvel's Captain America: Civil War, through the eyes of a DC fan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After last year's stupid Ant-man and disappointing Age of Ultron I wasn't going to waste my money on another star studded, cgi action flick that will just build up for Thanos or something. Fortunately my friend had a free ticket. And honestly, this is the best Marvel movie to this date.Of course it still is another star studded, cgi action flick building up the stage for Thanos. But Civil War has a lot more going for it. It tells a story. Story of friendship, ideology and origin. Villain is irrelevant here. Although we are eager to see where this is going, we still can't take our mind off this story. And even though I didn't care much for all the jokes and quirkiness, I couldn't stop laughing at them.I wanted something "deep" from BVS. People need to learn that "deep" and "dark" are not the same thing. If you are looking for something deep, dramatic, entertaining and you are angry at Zack Snyder for not delivering what was promised to you, then go and watch Marvel's Captain America: Civil War.</fullReview>

The russo bros managed to give you ample time with each character and each of them bring something unique, ant-man had a BIG role in parts of this and it was just perfect, black panther is probably the show stealer, his demeanor and everything is just nasty! I would say it up past avengers AoU but its not of the same scale of that movie, but the story is must see! I need to see it again just to catch all the small details that i know are stuffed in the 2 and a half hours, but for the most part you can grasp and stay along for the ride fairly easily, not a lot of slow parts, and if there is...you are definitely engaged.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>CA : CW is a fun film with good ensemble of super heroes! Unlike Batman Vs Superman, this one got a good story and well narrated, often tongue-in-cheek manner! Loved the cast. Never thought Elizabeth Olsen(Scarlet Witch) would be so hot! :PBy now, you know Spiderman is a part of the team and he gives a few chuckles. So does Antman! The only problem with the movie is, you need to know the back stories of all the superheroes involved. Otherwise, it will be difficult to follow what's happening on the screen because there are lot of references to their previous superhero movies especially from Avengers 1 &amp; 2 , Captain America 1 &amp; 2!This film is a must watch... especially so if you are Marvel fan... like me! :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Russo Brothers Do It Again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whenever Anthony Russo and Joe Russo are behind the camera for these Marvel films; I get extra excited to go to the theater and check it out. There should be no surprise that they were given the reins to direct Infinity Wars. Civil War doesn't disappoint at all as it brings the same level of tension and comedy as The Winter Soldier. Both movies tell powerful stories compared to the rest of the Marvel Universe that leave you on the edge of your seat.What made Age of Ultron just an okay movie was the lack of a strong villain and the constant running gags that can take the viewer out of the moment. The jokes really felt forced in Ultron and had me cringing all the way through. Civil War was more subtle with the comedy which I enjoy way more. Civil War goes away from the typical bad guy and makes the viewer think who is in the right. Do heroes need to be controlled by the government or should the heroes be able to be heroes? So I believe the story was top notch for a Marvel film and they were able to blend in all the characters without it being forced. It seemed like all the "minor characters" got equal amount of screen time which was a surprise too me. The airport scene was a little long and silly at times but it was fine. I am a little disappointed by how much the trailers gave away in the airport scene. There are still a couple of cool moments but a lot of the fighting moments were in the trailers.A Break Down of the pluses/minuses +++ StoryVillainsHow they incorporated the new charactersFighting Scenes--- Couldn't think of any glaring issues with the film just small issues that I will not spoilIf I were to rank it with the other films I would rank it fourth, behind Iron Man, Winter Soldier, and Guardians of the Galaxy. The movie gets an 8 or just a little higher.</fullReview>

Aside from that while it may not follow the comic and some characters are missing it is still an amazing movie.

		<fullReview>Overall I enjoyed this film and personally I'm happy with the directing from the Russo brothers and believe that the next Avengers film shouldn't disappoint. My only quibble with these films now is Marvels refusal to kill off characters, I know for the future of the franchise you can't go killing all your cast but these movies become very repetitive. However that being said, I am happy with the quality of this film against other superhero genre films, I think this is by far the best Captain America film, although honestly it is just an Avengers film without Thor and Hulk, however the introduction of Black Panther and Spider-Man was perfect. Excited for more Marvel Phase 3 films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>BEST Marvel movie ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, this is my first review on this website as I've just joined yesterday. This review won't contain spoilers.Watched it yesterday, and wow. I'm amazed what I've seen. This was what all I ever wanted in a team-up or/and a fighting-each-other in a superhero movie that both previous Avengers were failed to impress me. The trailer of this movie gave us so many features, including the new characters such as Black Panther &amp; Spider-Man. But little did we know, it just gave you so little details about the whole story. The plot is not too simple nor too complex, it's just a perfect fit. It gives so little at first, but reveals so much more later in the 2.5/4 of the movie. They also constructed the storytelling carefully but in a decent pace. Not too much information nor too less. I am pleasant by the head counts in each team, too many superheroes fighting each other would be like swallowing all the good food but not tasting or biting any of it, IMO. (8/10)If you're just here for the action scenes, you won't regret seeing this, not even after watching it twice. The much anticipated fight scene at the airport is amazing &amp; one of the best fighting scene in a superhero movie to date. You will literally love it! (100/10)Other than that, the acting is spot-on. The returning casts of course are perfect as they were in the previous MCU films. But let's talk about the new heroes here, Black Panther &amp; Spider-ManBlack Panther/T'Challa plays an important character, and Chadwick Boseman successfully delivers that underdog role. He performs really well despite he has to develop a new accent. And his suit looks badass! Oh and don't worry, this Spider-Man may be the best Spider- Man we've ever seen, finally. Tom Holland did an amazing job at it &amp; made Peter Parker looked so fresh than the previous ones. If you didn't like him, please give him more time, he's still young and learning and just got into the MCU universe. (9/10)The visual graphics were beautiful which I didn't expect at first! From Ant-Man's ant-size, to Spider-Man's suit. And the last fight, too. ;) (7/10)Lastly, the soundtrack during the action sequences were low-key EPIC. Especially during the last fight. You'll know what I'm talking about. Kudos to Henry Jackman for producing, yet another stellar soundtracks. (9/10)==TL;DR==Plot, storytelling etc. = Better than any other Marvel moviesAction/Cinematography= GOD BLESS THE RUSSO BROSSpider-Man &amp; Black Panther = Rainbow pukesSoundtracks = Music to my earsCGIs = Good but aren't perfect.In any case, PLEASE SEE IT, EVEN IF YOU'RE NOT A MARVEL FAN, OR DON'T WATCH SUPERHEROES MOVIE. YOU WON'T REGRET SPENDING YOUR MONEY ON THIS!Oh, and #TeamIronMan as always.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is not a Captain America film...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>... it's an Avengers film, which kind of sucks. The Winter Soldier was a great film, and I had hoped for a good wrap-up to Cap's trilogy. There's always been a reasonable amount of cross-over (such as Iron Man 3 drawing on events from the first Avengers film), but the Captain got short-changed on this one.The second issue is one of the plot. The idea of registering super heroes is a good one, and has been explored in other works (such as Watchmen). Here however it's a bit half-baked. The motivations are all mixed up and wrong. The split between the Avengers seemed forced and unnecessary.Iron Man's motivations for signing were okay. Captain's refusal is a bit shaky. It would have helped to show a situation where the Accord prevented them from doing something.It's not a bad film, but disappointing that it co-opted for the Avengers, especially when they have two more films coming up (Infinity Wars).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This...is...AWESOME! Best MCU film by far!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this last night, in a mostly packed theatre, knowing almost nothing about this movie. Literally, I only know what was in the trailers, so everything was fresh and cool to me.The action scenes were intense as hell; whether it be the actual Civil War, or the opening scenes involving the taking out of Crossbones and his gang of mercenaries, the stuntwork and kinetic feel of the fight scenes were great. The final fight of Captain America and Bucky vs Iron Man was brutal, low down and hugely varied. The Russo brothers certainly did a good job of keeping the Marvel film humour - and this movie does have a lot of humour about it - whilst still giving it a darker tone compared to the other films, and this kept it watchable; THIS is what I wish Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice was like.Speaking of that film, this movie gets one thing better than any MCU before it: it's villain. OH. MY. GOD. Daniel Bruhl is here playing Helmut Zemo, a big villain in the Captain America comics but with a re-designed backstory. This version of the character has a more sympathetic motive than the comic Zemo, but he's still threatening as hell. Bruhl moves with a measured, quiet intensity, but he talks like he's full of rage and threat. The first scene we see is one when he interrogates an officer involved in the Winter Soldier program and brutally drowns him when he's done. He plans everything down to the wire, but not like it's absurd. This is a great character, and I'm glad we'll get to see more of Zemo in later films.Other new characters introduced include Black Panther and the new Spider Man, and these were characters that I could easily get behind, especially Tom Holland as the brand new Peter Parker. He's funny, awkward, wise-cracking when it's appropriate AND he looks the part. Chadwick Boseman is also cool as Black Panther, who looks ultra intimidating when he's first on screen.The nature of the conflict here is cool; I was on Team Iron Man, but regardless of who's side you're on, you'll find yourself questioning which side is actually right. It's a movie that does have themes about terrorism in the modern times, but STILL is enjoyable.Guys, SEE THIS. Really? You're still reading this? GO AND SEE IT!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Iron Man vs Captain America</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One thing that baffled me about this film was that it seemed as if it was another Avengers movie as opposed to a stand-alone Captain America movie. Sure, The Winter Soldier had a number of characters from the previous Avengers movie (namely Black Widow, Hawkeye, Falcon, and Nick Fury) however Civil War had Iron Man as well, who sort of has a nasty habit of stealing the limelight from the title character. Okay, they were going at each other tooth and nail, but despite it being a pretty decent movie, having Iron Man as one of the lead characters (as well as bringing pretty much all of the other Avengers, with the exception of The Hulk and Thor) sort of takes the thunder away from poor old Captain America.The plot is similar to the plot that we had seen in a number of the X-men movies, namely that we have a bunch of enhanced people running around causing mayhem and destruction wherever they go, despite the fact that they are actually beating up bad guys. As such the UN decides to step in and establish an organisation that will review each of the actions that the Avengers propose to take. Mind you, they did have an organisation previously ? SHIELD, but SHIELD was pretty much destroyed back in Winter Soldier.However there is a major catch ? Captain America isn't all that thrilled with the idea, especially since it means that there will be a human organisation, with human agendas, decided when and where the Avengers will be deployed. As such they suddenly split along the lines of those supporting the registration (led by Iron Man) and those opposed to it. All the while, in the background, we have the Cap's buddy, the Winter Soldier, being set up for blowing up the UN, and the Captain has effectively become a fugitive namely because he is harbouring a known, and wanted, criminal.I must admit that I quite like the Captain America films: there seems to be something about them that the other films were lacking. Okay, a bulk of the film seems to focus on this huge battle between the opposing factions of the Avengers (all the while the protagonist is looking on an laughing). Mind you, a part of me wondered why the action suddenly shifted from Berlin to Leipzig, but maybe it had something to do with the plane that the Captain wanted being there. It does also raise a question as to whether they had to shut the airport down because there was a huge battle between superheroes going on here.Okay, it was still basically a load of biff, pow, kapow (which is what most of these superhero movies seem to degenerate into) but it was still quite fun to watch, especially when Iron Man and Captain America are having their big showdown. Oh, and you probably already know this but they've now managed to bring Spiderman into the franchise, which is pretty cool, especially since he still has his big mouth. However when the next Spiderman movie comes out I suspect that the whole how Spiderman became Spiderman will probably be dropped (they've already done two, though depending on the success of upcoming Marvel movies, bringing Spiderman into the franchise will probably end up working a lot better than simply having him in another suite of movies).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Captain America: Civil War is marvelous, indeed.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Earth's Mightiest Heroes has return to duke it out with Captain America/Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) or Iron Man/Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) in a battle for vigilance &amp; superiority under the increasing political issue of government oversight. Directed by the Russo Brothers, Civil War marks the 13th overall film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and the first film of the MCU's Phase 3. It is based on the Civil War limited series, albeit on a much smaller scale. Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say, the Civil War conflict in the comic book was a lot more intense, than it was, in the film. After all, it dealt with unmasking, secret identities, and high death tolls. However, since secret identities don't really existed in the film series, the conflict was change, significant with Rogers trying to protect his buddy, Winter Soldier/Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan) from standing trial in a federal court. While, this marks a major point of divergence from the original comics, the film still somewhat deals with the conflict between freedom and security; and the fact that these super-powered individuals have to act under official regulation, somewhat akin to law enforcement with this plot device. In my opinion, I felt like the issues with the Sokovia Accords could have easily be solve, if simple-minded, Rogers, would just agree to it, and then, ask for a fair trial for his buddy. Yes, I get that Rogers might be, against government oversight, because of the events of 2014's 'Captain America: Winter Soldier" and Stark is for more security after the killing spree in 2015's 'Avengers: Age of Ultron'; but there was no reason, for these two, to really hate and disagree with each other. After all, both of those events from the previous films, effect both of the character in similar equally ways. If any, they should agree with each other. The rift formed between the Avengers due to their differing opinions on the Sokovia Accords stays civil only until Helmut Zemo (Daniel Brühl) made it personal for both sides' leaders: By implicating Bucky in two international incidents, he tested Cap's loyalty to the team while forcing Tony to act on the Accords. He's by far, the best Marvel villain, these films had in a long time. Zemo actually manages to drive the Avengers apart, which is something his comic counterpart never achieved. He wasn't cartoony. He was a very compelling character. Brühl is wonderful in the role, despite his character actual scheme relies on a few too many coincidences, destroying the Winter Soldiers plot and also the fact that a video existed, when there is no way, it should or Tony not knowing about it. He did better, than the other villain, Crossbones/Brock Rumlow (Frank Grillo). Crossbones was a little disappointing with his short appearance, since he had a major part in the comic. Another big change, from the comic book to the film, was Captain America's fate. While, many people might disagree with me, but I found the fact that he doesn't die; somewhat of a blessing in disguise, because I never like that comic book arch. Although, he lives in this version, at least, the movie does give depth, with other emotional deaths, and one shocking big twist ending, toward the film. It gave this movie, some real-world value, without going too grim or violent, like 2015's 'Batman Vs Superman: Dawn of Justice'. Though this movie is significantly less dark than that DC Comic's mess of a movie, it does warrant caution for children, especially under the age of 13. Despite that, this movie is still pure escapism. Everybody in the film did their job, and it was well-acted. While, the humor is bit unbalance. There's still some laughs. The action scenes were amazing. However, it was a bit jarring to some of the reasons, why the other supporting characters were there. A good example is why Ant-Man/Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) was even in the film? Why would he risk, going back to prison and being away from his daughter? At least, Hawkeye/Clint Barton (Jeremy Renner)'s reason for returning is pretty clear, because the fact that Scarlet Witch/Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen)'s brother save him, in the previous film. Another is Spiderman/Peter Parker (Tom Holland). Since, he wasn't unmasking, there was really no reason for him to be there, besides fan-service &amp; cross-company partnership. As much as I love the character, I kinda sick of him, being rebooted, time and time ago. While, it's cool that characters who had only minor roles in the original comic book event like Black Panther/T'Calla (Chadwick Boseman), Black Widow/Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson), Falcon/Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie), War Machine/James Rhodes (Don Cheadle) &amp; Vision (Paul Bettany) have bigger roles and some time spent on them in this film, but nevertheless, it takes away scenes for characters like Sharon Carter (Emily VanCamp) to rise. While, she did receives a slightly larger role since the last movie, Sharon is still very underdeveloped as a character, considering her level of prominence in Cap's supporting cast in the comics. Anyways, with so many characters jam packed into one movie, it hard to keep track of all of them. The overall story of this film often relay on continuities from the previous films. It's doesn't stand on its own. After all, it's seem for any general or new viewer to these films, you would have to see, a good deal of the previous films, before even attempting to see this film. Not only that, but you might have to read the original Civil War comic book by writer Mark Millar to further get insight on what is happening, as well, as other graphic novels. It's a lot of homework. Also, this movie has pacing problems. Clocking in at 146 minutes. It's a long sit. However, once you aboard or caught up; you better, buckle in, because it will be, one hell of a ride! Worth the watch!</fullReview>

There were a couple of "Sweet Baby Cheeses!" moments, more than a few "Jeebus, Cap!" moments and many, many "That'll leave a mark" moments. (I wasn't talking throughout the film, all comments were internal.) Unfortunately, there WAS talking throughout the film as there was a fellow in the theatre with 2 under-10's (in my eyes)and he had no control over them. Quite distracting but at least he got to see the film.I wasn't completely sure who's side I would be on before the film but was leaning towards Team IronMan. Whilst I can see it from Cap's point of view, I am now firmly on Team IM.All I'm going to say is, if this was Game of Thrones, somebody would have died! You'll know it when you see it ;)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I gotta admit, I wasn't hyped for this movie as much as I was for past MCU movies like The Avengers and so on, and since I hate spoilers, I haven't watched or read anything about the movie after the very first trailer. But, boy, was I pleasantly surprised!!How great you're asking this movie was? I was literally shivering at one point in the movie. The actual "civil war" fight, that was shown partially in the trailer. I've been to a lot of movies, but none of them has made me shiver with excitement like this one, and that's saying something.There wasn't a weak point in this movies. Now, I'm not very pretentious about movies and have liked films that are hated by the majority of moviegoers, but even I admit the flaws of movies that bother others. Well, this movies has none! NONE! You literally have to nitpick to find it bad. The action scenes were good, the storytelling was good and characters felt fleshed out.Speaking of characters, I cannot not point out the villain in this one. So, yeah- Marvel makes great comic book movies, but the villains have always been a weak link. Well, I'm glad to tell you that this is not the case in Captain America: Civil War! Finally another good villain has joined Loki in the rogues' gallery :) Zemo is not your clichéd villain that seeks world domination, he's motives are good, he has a certain charisma to his character. You'll like 'im, trust me ;) And of course, much thanks to Daniel Brühl for his performance.To sum up, if you're into comics- go watch it! It's a must! A really well made CBM. And since the same directors are going to make Infinity War 1 &amp; 2, we're in good hands :) And if you're just a casual movie enthusiast- go watch it. It has a lot to offer to you as well, even though you won't get most of the references.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There has been an alarming amount of Super hero films in recent times, as much as one would like to take a break from them, it does seem unlikely because the moment one franchise ends, another starts, and don't you just crave for something different. When the best film you have seen so far this year is 'Eddie The Eagle' (which is very engaging and entertaining), you know you've got problems.The last super hero film I saw was Batman v Superman. I went with some friends and when we left we were scratching our heads unable to decide whether we liked or disliked it. Sure there was a lot wrong with it. The colander script, the irrelevant characters, Superman still not having a personality..... the list goes on. But Ben Affleck's portrayal of Batman and the action scenes at least rescued it from being a complete turkey.But yesterday my friends and I saw the latest Captain America film. Having not being a fan of the first instalment, I didn't bother to see The Winter Soldier. But when I clocked the favourable reviews of Civil War, I thought maybe I should see The Winter Soldier before watching Civil War.I already had preconceived ideas of it being more like the Avengers than a film about Captain America. As long as it wasn't like Age Of Ultron, I didn't care. The reviews seem to be very favourable, and I was very impressed with The Winter Soldier, so what could go wrong?Well everything. Something I discussed with my friends after this movie is how easy it is to say what the best film you have ever seen is, as opposed to the worst. If I ever disliked a film, I don't think I have been able to watch it til the end or give it my full attention, so how could you truly say a certain film is the worst film you have ever seen if you have not been fully conscious to appreciate the ordeal?While Civil War is far from being the worst film I or anyone else has ever seen, this film does fall into the category of indifference or making you feel ambivalent. The three of us saw this film in the Everyman Cinema in Reigate, England. This is a very twee cinema. Very small and cosy, where the priority seats have sofas and small tables for you to rest your chocolate chip cookies and drinks on. Yes, so far I have already given a review of this beautiful cosy cinema, where as the film is about to start, an employee introduces the film and themselves and tells us that they hope we enjoy the film.Oh we enjoyed the cinema. It felt like the three of us had hired the room just to watch the film. Yes, just the three of us, no one else. Despite this we still whispered to each other until I realised that we could have shouted and we would only have annoyed ourselves. I did start a Mexican wave, but it didn't catch on.Then when we stopped whispering, we started talking amongst ourselves. We were bored and endlessly reminding each other how long this film was as yet another new super hero was being introduced. There were too many of them. When Hawkeye appeared I thought maybe Cup Holder Man was about to make an appearance. Why not? Everyone else has.With all the characters on screen, we found it somewhat confusing, and whatever criticisms that Batman vs Superman had, was magnified here. Sure the script is nowhere near as bad, but the sheer volume of characters doesn't make this film feel like it's about Captain America but actually about The Avengers. Even though Iron Man doesn't have much screen time in the first half of the film, if you walked in half way through, you would be forgiven in thinking the film was about him.Other reviewers will give this film far better scrutiny than I ever could, but when a film stops you caring about the characters the way this did, it's hard. Only time I cared was when Captain America gave Iron Man a kicking, but that is a small portion of an overly long film.Think I'll go and watch 12 Years A Slave again to chill out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sometimes a roller-coaster, sometimes a really boring boat ride</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you, like me, didn't watch Agents of Shield, read the recent comics or watch and read all the other extended content Marvel throws at you, the first hour of this movie is going to be boring and confusing. It doesn't really pull you into the story (if any) either. We get a movie with a boring political premise, after that, characters and heroes we've come to love over a couple of movies suddenly go haywire. Characters we've seen bonding over several movies, been through almost 326 apocalypses and were ready to die for each other 47 times suddenly hate each other. Why? Because politicians divide them. Or something, I'm still not quite sure. Then popcorn time starts. Special effects splatter the screen in a fantastic manner, the colors in this movie are simply awesome. We gaze at superheroes clashing it out and it simply looks extremely good. Black Panther does some awesome stuff, some talking, more fighting. Fighting. Fighting. And eventually it ends. The movie is 3,5 hours, but feels a solid 5. If you forget the story (which is easily done) this is a visually stunning movie. Too bad that's all it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blows Batman VS. Superman out of the water.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It comes as no surprise that Marvel and DC would release two of their biggest movies in the same year. It also comes as no surprise that their plots are very similar. And it DEFINITELY comes as no surprise that the Marvel film is so much better than the DC film.Captain America: Civil War isn't perfect. British actor Tom Holland as Spider-Man has a few slips of the accent, the shaking camera during the action can be tiresome, and the death of a character isn't treated with nearly the amount of weight it should have been.But considering everything good I have to say about this film, all of those are nitpicks.Civil War manages to be heartbreaking and funny, action-packed yet grounded in emotion, and fast-paced despite the amount of happenings within the film. The premise alone is fantastic. Captain America, the Boy Scout, is unwilling to compromise with the government and Tony Stark, always the maverick, is sure that this group of superheroes needs to be kept in check. No matter who you agree with before the film, you will be in a completely gray area after it's over.Every character in this movie makes a big choice; their choices have consequences, and those consequences are rarely good. It takes you back to Bruce Banner's words in the first Avengers movie, that the Avengers are a time bomb. Boy, was he ever right. And that bomb finally goes off in this story.It's truly heartbreaking to see these characters we know and love come apart as a team, but brilliant writing, direction and performances at least give us a solid reason why they do. In the end, you don't hate any of the characters for what they've done because you see their point of view, and considering the amount of characters in this film it's incredible that they managed to do that.Speaking of the characters, I want to specifically mention two newcomers to the pack: Tom Holland, despite his few slips of the accent, is everything you could want Spider-Man to be. He's youthful but obviously intelligent beyond his years and he's funny without ever being annoying. What surprised me, though, was how sweet and likable the character was. Even when he's fighting other superheroes, he makes it clear that he admires them and wants nothing bad to happen to them. Holland is by far the best Spidey that we've had, and Homecoming can't be released soon enough.The real breakout of this film, however, is Chadwick Boseman as Black Panther. Making his first appearance in a film filled with characters we've known for nearly ten years, the Panther still manages to steal the show. Boseman brings so much dignity and charisma to the role that you never once doubt that he's royalty and the perfect person to become a superhero. In a movie filled with great lines and performances, Boseman's lines and performance managed to stick with me the most. He is everything fans of the character could want and even more, and like Spider-Man, I can't wait to see his solo film.It's also worth mentioning that for the first time since Loki, we have a villain worth remembering. Marvel has gotten a reputation for giving us likable and interesting heroes but rarely delivering on the villains, but this one is an exception. In the film, Baron Zemo's motivation is so understandable that it's only his disregard for human life that takes him to villain status. In some respects, I'd even argue he's superior to Loki. While I enjoy Tom Hiddleston as Loki and Loki probably gets the better lines, Zemo's motivation for tearing the Avengers apart is much deeper than Loki's megalomania, and I do hope to see more of him in the future. I know this is a long review, but I'm not even scratching the surface. I wish I could go into so much more detail about the acting and writing and directing and such, but there are many other reviews where you can read about that. As far as I'm concerned, Civil War is one of Marvel's absolute best, and I can't wait to see it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Batman V Superman's inverse opposite</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ever since IRON MAN came out, I always ponder on whether or not the MCU's "shared universe" experiment would pay off. Amongst the Phase 1 movies barely reaching above average and the obnoxious references to other movies within movies (to which AGE OF ULTRON became the worst example of), a small part of me wonders if any of it matters to the big picture, or if I actually stick around for said big picture. However, after seeing other superhero franchises executing this concept SO. FRICKEN. HORRIBLY, my doubts simmered while Marvels biggest secret became clear. They take their time in developing their wacky, comic-book universe while virtually blending it with the modern real universe, They care about these characters and their struggles so much as to have us care about them as well. They explore concepts and opportunities within these heroes and expands their meaning and what they represent to those that wrote them in the first place. And now with CAPTAIN America: CIVIL WAR, when the film might tread on the "dark and moody" vibe instead of the campy escapist fare that they represent, they smartly delve into the morals of these already-established characters and their reasons for going off against each other, all while never being shy of occasional fun. The result, even considering a few missteps, blooms into the most grounded yet thrilling superhero movie since THE DARK KNIGHT; a shining example of Marvels status as engaging character- driven action romps with poignant philosophies about what we believe is the right course of action.The most glaring thing to consider about this film is that it doesn't really feel much like a Captain America movie as it is just another Avengers movie. Rather than the actual character taking front and center of his movies, his ideals, the way he solves issues, and how said ideals are being conflicted instead reflects on the other characters, with some of them opposing the Act because they feel they can do things right again. The biggest variation, though, is that none of their sides ultimately become the WRONG choice nor the RIGHT one. With Iron Man switching towards responsibility to contrast the irresponsible behavior prior and Steve Rodgers justified do-gooder turned independent vigilante, neither side trumps the other; sometimes it's good that the world is saved with a few casualties, but sometimes said casualties wind up too unbearable to cope with. All of this is due to the films willingness to implement "breathing room". All of this is due to the Russo Brothers character-driven television backgrounds, which allows them to set the story back a few times to properly flesh out these characters. I mean, c'mon! The idea of shoving in Spider Man and the Black Panther while simultaneously developing Scarlet Witch and Visions friendship, AND shifting focus on Captain America saving Bucky would sound like another AGE OF ULTRON disaster, but it pulls together this time! While some hiccups are inevitable in this gamble, the willingness to take its time, plus some actual stakes by the actual team and not just another army invasion, gives this story its lasting weight. And yes before you mention it, boy do I feel lucky to be alive seeing the best Spider Man and the best Black Panther! Tom Holland as Peter Parker and Chadwick Boseman as Black Panther both succeed in adapting these characters in a script that impressively establishes them without treading on their back story for too long. Even keeping the abundance of solid action scenes in mind, the introduction of Black Panther and Starks small talk with Parker might be two of the best scenes in this movie. But make no mistake, this film would never be worthwhile had it not been for the Russo Brothers surprisingly solid action. Seriously, this might be the best Marvel ensemble fight scenes ever! Explaining these would ruin the fun, but let's just say that the airport scene? HOLY CRAP!Judging solely on the action scenes pairing with the conflicting ethics of regulation would instantly make a masterful film, but sadly it is not. Once that big fight gets out of the way, the film feels like it should conclude from there, only to shift into another fight scene due to one's own vendetta. No matter how bold of a move that is, to have this whole fight derive from a smaller but more personal struggle, but it took me out of the film to have yet another fight scene just a few minutes after another. You also might gloss over the "villain" in this movie that brings up a worthwhile twist in the end, but I pay no mind to itNow I am sure there is quite a lot of discussion that my praise for this film strictly lies on my "bias towards Marvel" after recently bashing DCs shameless aping of this shared universe. Trust me guys, I strained to stick with my doubts on this one. I desperately find anything wrong with this movie despite the ratio of reception of film and BATMAN V SUPERMAN telling me otherwise. Sadly, I stand with my statement. This is not only miles better than DAWN OF JUSTICE, but I am right on board on the ever-so redundant but inevitable discussion that this is an opposite inverse of that in quality terms. Smart and funny writing instead of stupid and self-important trailer fuel; struggles based on character-based ideals instead of dumb manipulation; dark tone for meaning and weight instead of mindless aesthetic mimicking. Even that notwithstanding, this makes a confident, everlasting, and fun superhero movie properly made better by the eight years of world-building that has finally payed off. I would say watch it and judge for yourselves, but I believe my stand is as follows: SEE THIS ONE INSTEAD!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing Marvel Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK so to start with this movie is slow at the beginning for somewhat 30 minutes but after that what a pick up by the movie. Its a great Marvel movie! Loved each bit of this movie (other than first 30 minutes). First let me come with Robert Downey Jr. (Iron Man) and Chris Evans (Captain America). They both have played an amazing and pivotal role. Scarlett Johansson (Black Widow) and Elizabeth Olsen (Scarlet Witch) well didn't like that much but Scarlet Witch's character was very powerful! Anthony Mackie (Falcon) and Tom Holland (Spider-Man) were amazing and loved the face-off between them. Chadwick Boseman (Black Panther) was the 2nd most favorite character in this movie for me. Fighting Sequence between Captain America and Black Panther was amazing. And the star for me was Paul Rudd (Ant- Man) my God he is as epic as he was in his own movie! Face off between Team Iron Man and Team Captain America was amazing specially Ant-Man which gets huge! Overall an unbelievable movie! Great Movie. My ratings 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great movie about taking sides</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had the pleasure of seeing this movie this weekend, and let me tell you, it is great! The first thing that I loved about it is the action. This is top notch action. There is a ton of fighting and while there is also downtime, the action is exciting and towards the middle and end it keeps going.The next thing is, the characters were great! I loved Black Panther and Spiderman was neat! Ant-Man being hauled in was also great, too.The humor was funny! This movie probably wasn't as serious as it was supposed to be, there were times where I was just having a great time smiling because of the humor.Lastly, this is most definitely a Captain America movie! I know there was talk saying that it should have been called Avengers: Civil War, but I disagree. The main focus of the movie was on Captain America and Bucky and that is why there is so much disagreement.Overall, this movie was a 9/10 worthy movie. I have never given a marvel movie this high of a rating. However, there are still flaws. A few problems that bothered me were: --Spiderman felt shoe-horned in. The scenes introducing him just felt forced and strange. I can't explain it. It didn't bother me in the long run, but it was obvious that he was added in and reshoots were taken.--The trailers for the movie are very misleading! They make it seem like the fight is to the death and very intense. It isn't. No one wants to hurt anyone, but Iron Man is just trying to subdue Cap and Bucky and take them in. I can see why some were disappointing because they were expecting a literal "War." It's not. It's more a "friendly confrontation." Think of it more as Captain America: Iron Man wants to bring in Bucky so he confronts Cap's group lol.Anyways, 9/10 for me. B V S was also a great movie, but I ended up giving that movie an 8 because of more flaws. Both great movies, but in the CW wins and is more entertaining even though BVS is more serious and dark.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Values of Freedom vs Values of Security</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The "Civil War", of course, can't avoid comparisons with the recent "Batman v Superman" film. In both films their authors decided to create confrontation between "good" heroes, thus adding philosophical depth and psychological authenticity to the heroes. Also both films have raised up a problem of the so-called "collateral damage" and responsibility for consequences of superheroes actions.While not referring to the question "which movie is better", I'll try to ask myself a question "why the theme of confrontation between the "forces of good" appeared in the film adaptations now?" I think the answer lies in the domestic US problems. Criticism of Bush's foreign policy and national security measure, I think, were essential in raising "collateral damage" problem and control of power in original comic book series. Coming to power of the "leftist dove of peace" Obama that has transformed now into a crisis of the US political establishment, manifested in the appearance of presidential candidates like socialist Sanders and populist Trump, tells about upcoming serious reformatting of traditional American values. What twenty five years ago has seemed unshakeable foundation of the US - individual freedom, liberalism, individualism, Christianity, reliance on the middle class, the belief in the "American mission", the constitutional rights, the right to freely carry weapons, the belief in the intransigence of good and evil (so- called "freedom values") - is increasingly shifting now to the so- called "safety values" - strengthening of state control and regulation, taxation, reliance on large corporations on the one hand, and people with low incomes, on the other, with the simultaneous impoverishment of the middle class, atheism, restriction of the right to carry weapons, moral relativism, non-interference in the affairs of third countries. This US' "offset of values", with the polarization of the supporters of "freedom values" and supporters of "safety values", I think, is reflected by the both blockbusters.In the previous Russo's work with Captain's story we already saw clash of these values when heroes revealed that evil has grown up inside of SHIELD and its operatives and head were converted to the HYDRA's side arguing that security and control will finish the world's chaos. In this Captain's story the same message was hidden by Ross brothers more subtly, when right and wrong sides are not so clear. As in life, it is difficult to see the evil in someone everyone accustomed to consider to be a hero and who considers himself to be good (as well as all villains).On the one hand there is Captain - the embodiment of the "freedom values" - who believes that you can not shift the responsibility for your actions on others including the state (like, for example, the Nazis did) or a coalition of states, knows that there "at the top" just ordinary people with their ambitions and desires, and that he won't become a puppet in the hands of cynical politicians only in order to get rid of guilt and absolve himself of responsibility. He is the embodiment of belief in uncompromising, absolute good and evil, inviolability of principles, justice, even if they are not supported by the majority, which out of fear is ready to give up freedom in exchange for security, to exchange risk-taking birthright for a guaranteed onion soup. On the other hand there is the Iron Man, oddly enough, the epitome of the "security values" - he comes from large corporations, he wishes to subdue the group's activities to external control, to absolve himself of responsibility, and thus in some way (how?) to protect others from "collateral damage".If motivation of Captain America is transparent - responsibility, adherence to the principles and concepts of good and evil, even if they are contrary to written laws, as well as loyalty to friendship, the Stark's motivation is questionable. Does he made his decision due to the conscious or unconscious desire to split the group and take the leadership from Captain America, isn't there monstrous selfishness hidden behind the rantings about the need to "control" (again, it is not clear how such controls could prevent "collateral damage"), maybe it is thirst for power and, at the same time, desire to absolve himself of any responsibility for the "collateral damage"? Look at the motivation of the real villains (Commies, Nazis) - they wanted to create a perfect system with total control for the "security" of common fellows, who they sought, were unable to bear the burden of freedom. Ultron was alike, but he grabbed his delusion ideas from Stark. For me, Stark is the main villain of the film. He begins to pursue those who disagree with him - put a pressure on them, put them (Wanda) under arrest. It is similar to most of the tyrants, a typical villain who wants to trample his opinion as one and only and to eliminate all who disagree.Behaviour of Black widow seems illogical - she is a clear candidate for Captain's team (unless she has stayed with Stark for sabotage like in the hangar scene). But suffering from guilt Wanda would rather choose Stark's side that allows her to shift responsibility to someone else. But she has chosen the right path of "growing up" - accepting responsibility. In the "Age of Ultron" she had read Stark's mind and warned Cap that Stark is "capable of anything".Distracting from the current political and philosophical background of the film, it may be noted that in terms of action this Marvel's cinema-comics keeps the style and the brand - despite the seriousness of the plot, Marvel's ease and jokes are still there even during fierce battles. The flick is dynamic and quite fun, though perhaps not as deep as the "Batman v Superman", but more fully revealing of the motivation of the main characters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Avengers never seem to find a peaceful way out of trouble</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie helps one realize how much better the real world is compared to the courier guy's fictional world of superheroes. How much better the world is without heroes and their struggle towards proving themselves. It also makes one think about the kind of friends that a person keeps and his commitment towards his relationship with them. How vulnerability to hypnosis renders a person totally helpless and doing things that he doesn't want to do. Ideas like the dark force of vengeance, the power of forgiveness, the internal conflict between these two emotions that a hero has to face makes it interesting to watch. This might also help us realize how lucky it is to be ordinary and alone, rather than having super powers and being with a group of super people.Ultimate freedom comes from not having to choose between two sides. Let the avenger's avenge. Let the lovers love. We just sit there and enjoy the show. It was a great show. Loved it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hi, This is my first Movie Review. I had a lot of hopes of this movie cause after all its a Marvel movie and moreover starring Robert Downey Jr. in it. And I am glad to say all my expectations are met. I am truly satisfied. The movie's highlight was supposed to be Chris Evans but Robert Downey Jr. steals the show.The suspense is heartbreaking yet its worth it. The story takes a surprising turn towards the end. Sebastian Stan was a total game changer.This is the movie where all your prediction goes wrong. Tom Holland Makes a type of Guest appearance. Chadwick Boseman is a surprising package. Martin Freeman has a short yet dominating role.Paul Rudd has a big surprise of everyone. The end is so thrilling and suspenseful that waiting for the next movie is like waiting for the next season of Game Of Thrones. The teaser at the end blows away everything you thought. At Last the movie is worth your money and is better than any previous Captain America movie. Thanks Folks, I hope this review was helpful, ADIOS!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Captain America: Civil war, the most hyped marvel movie of 2016, is better than any other movie we've got from marvel studios, till now. It has a great storyline, almost every character gets to play their part in the movie. Unlike Batman vs Superman, this movie is a movie with a plot, and also a very good one. The Russo Brothers have thought and made the movie in such a good way that every one will be leaving the theater thinking about Iron Man and Captain America. There are no Flaws in the movie, no plot holes, pure awesomeness, i didn't.The Things i didn't Like: 1) The movie is nothing like in the comics, except for some references 2) Spiderman's cameo was too short( more like 15 minutes) 3) T'Chaka's death was too early, but its inevitable, the Russo Brothers probably wanted to find a way to involve black panther in it, and this is the only way.But these errors wont make you hate the movie, more over there's no silly scene like the "Martha" scene from BvS.The movie has 2 post credit scenes, which u shouldn't miss. Looking forward to review X-Men apocalypse and Suicide squad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Beginning for Phase 3!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hey everyone Connor here once again with the review of one of the biggest films of 2016, Captain America: Civil WarAfter the scenarios of New York, Washington, Sokovia, and newly Logos, the U.N. wants to put all super powered beings into check. Cap doesn't exactly like that and so many of our favorite heroes choose which side they represent, and so comes the arguing, then the fists go flying. So there you have the central plot.One of the things that I loved about this film was how perfect the fight was, not in just physical form, but mentally as well. I found myself neutral throughout the entire movie. That is how tough it is to pick a side, both have even pros and cons against the others beliefs. Therefore job well done to marvel again for that part.As for the characters, they are the same misfits we all have come to know and love over the years. Except for a few new faces. Ladies and Gentlemen we finally have in the marvel film universe Black Panther and welcoming home in amazing fashion, Spider-Man. Chadwick Boseman plays T'Challa aka Black Panther who we see a lot in Civil War and I must say I now am sold and cannot wait to see his stand alone film when it releases next year. As for everyones favorite web swinging hero Spider-Man is home with marvel and debuts in Civil War. Tom Holland in my opinion is already in my opinion a scene stealer and easily my favorite part of Civil War, mark my words by next year when his solo film Spider-Man: Homecoming is released i truly believe everyone will say he is the best Spidey ever! The way he looks and cracks jokes constantly is perfect and I cannot wait to see him return soon.The film from the trailers point don't show much humor but I promise you Civil War will at many points have fans laughing away as it brings a whole lot of humor to a film with hurtful truths as well.Overall I loved Captain America: Civil War and would see it again. I Connor approve this film and love where Marvel starts us out in Phase 3! Hope you enjoyed the review and as always have fun and enjoy the show!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went in with an open mind considering how many avengers/captain Americas i have watched and they have all been similar. This one finally got me sitting up for the whole length of the movie.Its exactly as titled. Civil War has everything from the good, the bad and you can bet the most ugly. No punches were held back and did everyone get punched more than once.Just like in war innocent people were killed and running with this and vengeance is the baseline of the movie. RDJ again playing iron man so perfectly no one else could fill this guys position. Along with the huge cast of super heroes all coming into one.I wont spoil it and tell you who exactly, although it wouldn't be hard to find out. But do your self a favor don't ruin the movie, watch it before you read spoilers.Overall i do give another 8 out of 10 but its totally deserved. Finally an Avenger movie that feels like a decent thought out movie rather than the standard superhero time line.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Straight off the bat Captain America Civil War is worth the hype,it's dark,grounded,action packed,emotional and very fun.First off the Russo brothers,these guys have to be praised because of they way how they handled each and every character in this film no matter how much of a big or small role they had everyone fit perfectly,because not only was this a Captain America sequel but this felt like an Avengers sequel as well,and the film is just handled perfectly.So this movie starts off there winter soldier and Age of ultron picks off with the Avengers team still being intact and doing their missions then as the movie goes by you start to see that the Avengers aren't so perfect as events from the first Avengers movie,Age of Ultron,Winter Soldier and Civil War it's self,reveal that people have died during these Avenger encounters and it was really never touched upon in past movies as they made it seem the Avengers saved everything and everyone with no added consequences and this is one of the things the movie does well in exploring what has happened in the past to determine everyones motivation in the film and thus the world starts to question the Avengers' methods and the civil war between the Avengers begins.What really impressed me was how solid everyones reason for being on either team Captain America(against the government) or team Iron Man(with the government) was,and what I found amazing was how no team was villainized as both sides remained neutral and the decision was really left to the audience as both sides were correct and again the points and reasoning for each side is spot on(well done again Russo Brothers).Now there are some new characters in the movie namely Black Panther and Spiderman.Chadwick Boseman nails it as T'Challa/Black Panther as he has his own agenda in the film and he is just epic as you follow him and his story throughout the movie as he is one of the best things in the movie because he was so different from any other superhero we've met before.Spiderman,man Tom Holland's performance as Peter Parker/Spiderman is just amazing and you enjoy seeing him for every minute in the movie from start to finish and I definitely can't wait to see more of Spiderman in the future.Baron Zemo is the villain in Civil War,before I saw this movie I questioned whether this film needed a villain,but Baron proved to be a good villain with good motivations.What I also found surprising is how grounded the villain was as he wasn't overblown or overcomplicated,he was just a regular guy who was against the Avengers for a justifiable reason.The Action in this movie is wonderful as Captain America:Winter Soldier had some of the best Action sequences in the MCU and I proudly say that Civil War has better,more epic and bigger action than any other comic book movie.The Airport fight scene is just incredible it's fun and heavily entertaining and it's not that one fight scene alone that's done so well as Civil War has great balance with action sequences and character interactions and with all the Avengers including Antman,Black Panther and Spiderman,Civil War is a great visual feast.The Balance of tone is near perfection as the movie is dark and grounded in some scenes,then just shifts to a light and fun tone with some humor as you laugh multiple times in the film and when the movie needed to be emotional and dramatic the Russo brothers made it that way.Since this is a Captain America film,the focus always goes back to Steve and his journey after Winter Soldier and his relationship with Bucky/Winter Soldier.Their relationship is also one of the strong points in this movie as Captain America never gives up of his friend Bucky and their relationship is tested in many ways in the movie.Sharon from Winter Soldier is back and plays as Steve Rogers' love interest which was a welcome surprise too and Sharon also has something to do other than being a love interest too.Now the movie isn't perfect(but it's really close),the Ironman introduction into Civil War at the beginning of the movie was a bit sluggish and although Baron Zemo was a good villain,but his end game at the near end of the film is a bit lacking and somewhat plot-device- ish as he makes the Avengers come into quarrel and you just find Zemo's methods questionable in order to move the movie along.So at it Captain America Civil War is a film about friendship and family which comes with the struggles of it,one thing I have to point out without giving too much away is that the friendship message is wonderful crafted in the third act and in my opinion that's were the "Civil War" begins as the tag lines suggested in the posters and trailers "United We Stand,Divided We Fall", and this message is conveyed beautiful in the movie along with some epic action,fun moments combined with some emotional moments too.A great movie and definitely one of the best Comic book movies ever made.Can't wait for Avengers Infinity War.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marvel steps up their game with Captain America: Civil War.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Captain America: Civil War is the 13th feature film from Marvel studios and their universe. It is a sequel to Captain America: The Winter Soldier, directed by the Russo Brothers, and is once again back to helm this one. It basically stars all of the Avengers, so this is a stack cast for a Captain America movie. It is written by Christopher Markus &amp; Stephen McFeely, whom of which wrote the first Captain America movie &amp; The Winter Soldier as well. So let me start by saying that I LOVED this film. I've seen it twice and it honestly got better the second time around. Is it a masterpiece? No. But it was near. The Russo Brothers NAILED IT once again. I consider Captain America: The Winter Soldier the best MCU film, and they managed to top it. The way they handled the characters, the story &amp; the action was so well-done. Each scene of this film has a sense of effort and execution, and all that credit goes to the Russo Brothers. They've done a MARVELOUS job.The story is very complex and has a lot of elements into it. These elements of which are interconnected in order for the movie to move along. The story also touches into many different themes/subject matters and I really liked that. For a film like this, that has a lot plot points and themes, an individual could easily be confused. I wasn't. Though to be honest, the first time I watched it, I was lost a few times, but all that are resolved when I watched again. The film does get busy because of it's story, but it doesn't get out of control. It's not messy. It's not tight and cohesive as THE WINTER SOLDIER, but the film still is structured well. What I loved about the story is that it's very personal. It's a character study between Steve Rogers and Tony Stark. They're the centerpiece of this movie. This has been building up from the start, and to see it pay off here was an absolute blast. All of the performances are GREAT. The original cast are better than ever, which is not a surprise. So let's talk about the new ones. BLACK PANTHER is MAGNIFICENT. Chadwick Boseman did a good job as this newly introduced character. Looking forward for his standalone film. SPIDER-MAN is AWESOME. He was so handled well. I didn't feel he was just shoehorned in. Pretty damn excited for his new movie. Tom Holland IS Spider-Man. Paul Rudd as ANT-MAN is just so perfect. From his standalone film, I was really excited to see him interact with the other Avengers and it didn't disappoint. Robert Downey Jr. as IRON MAN gave such a powerful performance here, so powerful. Basically everyone was in their A-game. I was BLOWN AWAY by the action, it has the best action pieces in an MCU movie yet. The action was gripping, powerful, &amp; emotional. Speaking of those things, the film was poignant but at the same time funny as well. The film was very well BALANCED. Whether it's balancing the tone, balancing the story, all of it which are balanced.I didn't mind the villain. I understood his character. He had motives into why he was doing all his actions. Although his not a very fleshed out character. He was just there for the sake of the story. He was basically a functional villain that was used to move the story. He's not the worst, but he's certainly not one of the great things about the movie. The character was clever and low-key, and I liked that, I just needed to know more about him. Daniel Bruhl's performance was fine. I dug the soundtrack of The Winter Soldier, but this one just disappointed me. It's not TERRIBLE, but I was just expecting MORE from Henry Jackman. Final say: With breathtaking action, complex and balanced story, CAPTAIN America: CIVIL WAR is a superhero film that's ABSOLUTELY entertaining, and at the same time has the gravitas and depth to the story and it's characters. You understand certain motives, you understand the conflicts, you understand both sides. This is not only a GREAT TIME of a movie, it has qualities that is pretty rare in these kind of movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Better Marvel movies, yet still didn't break the " it's awesome" line.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alright, I see many reviews are biased from Marvel fan boys and say BvS was sht compared to this one. So I will try to give an honest review and try to avoid all this DC vs Marvel fight.First off THE PLOT. At least from my perspective, the first half was a bit rushed, new characters didn't get proper introduction. The movie seemed during this first part like it was trying to be serious but wasn't sure, then switched back to the old marvel style of jokes and hollow dialogs. I hoped that Captain America will truly fight for justice, which I turned out to be wrong. Don't want to spoil anything about his development throughout the movie. Then after hour and half of boredom, sparked with few jokes and mediocre/good fighting scenes (yes even the one with black panther, for reasons I will write later) came the reason why people call this movie awesome. Fighting scene on the airport. As far as the "choreography" and fights go, it was a well made part of the movie. Superheroes coordinated well with each other. The final battle was in my opinion the best part of the movie, (seen in trailers) especially when Bucky and Cap go both at Iron Man.I personally didn't like in the story, new characters were introduced very fast and some of them even immediately revealed their identity (I guess new rule for Marvel superheroes).THE CHARACTERS: we all know the good old marvel superheroes from previous movies, so I'm not going to talk about them. I will focus on two new guys Spidey and Black Panther. While Black Panther's development and introduction was good, new mysterious guy appears and is very angry, it was ruined a little bit with immediate reveal of his secret identity. Although I must say this was made up with excellent fighting with very few flaws. And Spidey? It feels like Marvel got rights back for Spiderman from Sony in the middle of the movie shooting, and they didn't fully think it through how to properly implement and introduce him into the movie. It went more or less (spoiler? wanna join? yeah why not). Other than that he was the funniest character and was in the lead of bringing the fun back from the first boring half. Sadly as far as his character goes, that's it. It felt like the only lines he had were jokes.THE CINEMATOGRAPHY. Here is where I have to give Marvel a big minus. First off the fights. Often you could see characters 4-5 meters away from their enemies, and in next shot right next to them beating their asses and yes I am mainly looking at you Black Widow. Some of the scenes mainly from first half felt inconsistent. Second one and which bugged me during the entire movie. CGI. I expected much more, and to be honest it looked like work of 2nd grade college students or visibly fake internet videos. Some scene's CGI was so cringe worthy, they looked like they weren't made in Hollywood but Bollywood. And it seems like Spidey got what Deadpool was afraid of. "Don't make my costume green, or animated." And last but not least the physics. You know you have terrible physics in your movie, when even the movie itself has to make fun of it. The objects and people were flying around like in "goat simulator". There isn't excuse like they are super heroes. It was sloppy. Nothing had it's weight, and it was very visible during the fights (for example the panther fight as mentioned above). And one note to the producer. If someone is mortal and will fall from height bigger than 15 m, they will die or at least end up in coma with almost every broken bone. Again some scenes felt because of it almost Bollywood like.OVERALL This movie did break the mediocre line of Marvel movies, yet still wasn't awesome. Marvel has yet to surprise me with a very good movie. Other than 2 good fighting scenes and few jokes I didn't take anything else from this movie. Maybe bad memories horrible cgi.LAST WORDS: As you can (maybe) see from my review I like a little deeper movies. Marvel movies from my perspective are mediocre, and keep their standard of an easy "popcorn movie". Good to watch once, but not many times after. I tried to stay objective and point out the very good or very bad things about the movie. I myself was and still am a big fan of Marvel comics, but don't like Robert Downey Jr's portrayal of Iron Man, yet in this movie, he improved my opinion of his role as he wasn't a complete douche. And people should really stop comparing Marvel and DC movies. They are clearly made for different demographic and are taken in two different ways. The only thing they have in common are people/aliens with super powers.This movie deserves max 7.5/10, definitely not more than 8 if you compare it with other similarly rated great movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie but marvel marketing over hyped movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wont lie Civil War has some individual greatness but as a whole it fails to deliver the promise of civil war. The movie is carried by great actors in Chadwick Boseman, Robert Downey jnr and Chris Evans to name a few.I remember a time the Russos said the final act is a psychological horror piece that was utter nonsense. I also recall them saying by the times credits role the will be people in body bags. Another disservice Im afraid. Heres where I start to nitpick it. Marvel has shown time and again that they are saving their heroes for infinity war and that most will die then. However how interesting is that the Marketing suggested that this movie will be different and intense and as a lover of the Russos work Im afraid I am disappointed in this movie. Marvel doesn't want to take risks the story is not as important as individual characters. I am ashamed to say that they treat us their fans as kids because they don't think we can handle their deaths. The introduction of new characters introduces a new dynamic and thats what they always master they are great at manipulating the plot to introduce better characters and thats just it. How interesting will it have been if someone died in the so called splash panel sequence?? In the end fight?? Then it would have felt like a civil war instead of feeling lackluster and adding forceful comedy movie. Spider man was a great addition but not necessary, Ant man too, his giant form was wasted. I will however say this that the so called marvel style comedy movie failed this time around. Most of the comedy was not necessary and felt awkward in tone of the movie. The Comedy and a darker tone in Civil war didn't stick together. The directors said when you were going into the movie you would leave with a whole different picture another lie on my part the movie both parties were correct none convinced me more than the other the movie felt like a downgrade in most parts the CGI effects were a little off but I dealt with it. However Civil War was a great movie Black Panther being the star of the movie :) I cant wait for his solo movie Chadwick Boseman and his black panther portrayal were the best part of the movie for me:))</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Accountability of superheroes and precarious conflicts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ultron was Tony Stark's innovation that was meant to withstand future onslaughts from the threats of the Universe. However, due to the maligned nature of Loki's sceptre, the Age of Ultron wreaked havoc on Sokovia, while the Avengers scrambled to prevent collateral damage as the city was raised to the skies and yet, not everyone could be saved. Nations become suspicious of the unchecked powers of Earth's mightiest heroes and those who lost their families due to their actions, seek to avenge them. Thus, 'Civil War' is partly an aftermath of 'Age of Ultron' and partly a follow-up to 'Captain America: Winter Soldier' mainly due to Bucky's presence. The Russo brothers enter the 3rd phase of MCU and stick to the formula that has worked wonders for Disney/Marvel in keeping with a brighter, entertaining tone.We start in 1991, with Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan) being sent on a mission to retrieve a serum from a car. The driver of the car isn't revealed quite yet but that proves to be quite a twist at the very end. Current day in Nigeria, a group of Avengers disrupt Brock Rumlow's (Frank Grillo) attempt to steal a bio weapon. Their encounter leads to Rumlow detonating an explosive under his vest and Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen) directing its effects away from the busy marketplace. Unfortunately, it leads to the death of several humanitarian workers from Wakanda who were in the building nearby. Meanwhile, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) reveals his impressive sample of future technologies to M.I.T. students and generously offers to fund all of their research projects. There, he meets a grieving mother who lost her son in Sokovia, reminding Stark of the failures and uncontrolled powers of the superheroes.Too much damage has been done even with their best intentions and efforts. Accountability was thus proposed by a United Nations panel through the Sokovia Accords that would control their actions. US Secretary of State, Ross convinces them of no other way but to sign in its favor. Tony agrees due to his bad decisions and experiences, Captain (Chris Evans) disagrees because of his suspicion of those who rule with agendas. One prefers accountability by external authority while the other prefers the freedom to act as he assumes that the safest hands are still their own. The Accords themselves weren't much to quarrel over since the scenario was inevitable but it's the explosion at the UN Conference in Vienna that really tears them apart. The Wakandan King, who was a strong proponent of the Accords, perishes in the attack and his son T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman) is determined to bring the suspect to justice. The suspect being the Winter Soldier. Automatically, Cap saves his bro-friend Bucky on every attack from the government, Ironman and T'Challa's mysterious form of Black Panther. This exciting introduction of a powerful warrior expands the might of the Avengers in general with his formidable abilities and skills. Thereafter, it was upon Stark and Cap Rogers to recruit new members and convince existing ones to take a moral stance in their favor. To make things even, we have Spiderman on team Ironman and Ant- Man on team Cap. Their action sequences are immense fun and Tom Holland's teenage Spider-boy is nimble, agile although quite talkative like his character in the comics. Paul Rudd's Ant-Man takes up some surprising form and plays a big role in the airport fight. This seemingly half hour-ish sequence at a German airport is certainly the film's highlight and showdown of the two teams that is regarded as Civil War. The plot drags on further as Stark investigates the actual events that transpired before Cap's escape with the Winter Soldier and his findings reveal a deeper ploy by Zemo (Daniel Bruhl) to divide them even further. His revelation of the 1991 incident involving the Winter Soldier opens up traumatic wounds for Stark and it leads them into a more serious combat that breaks the trust between Cap and Ironman. The heaviness of a divided team of superheroes only bears down on us thereafter and it took the Russo brothers over 2 hours 20 minutes to convince us. The motivations for many of the characters remain a bit casual for them to really take sides and stand against their fellow Avengers. Scarlett deserves a Black Widow movie but she's losing the grip on her audience as Natasha doesn't have much influence over others. Black Panther's only reason for joining Ironman is to take down Bucky and Boseman is a brilliant T'Challa. Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) is just inconvenienced with all this while Falcon (Anthony Mackie) gets adventurous in his second outing with the Cap. War Machine (Cheadle) represents the Government's interests and is close enough to Stark to influence his decisions. Vision (Paul Bettany) spends the entire airport sequence trying to keep Wanda away from harming anyone and without his superhero suit, looks quite weird adorning a sweater. Spider-Man is just stoked to be called upon by Mr. Stark and Tom Holland portrays the excitement to showcase his powers and the fear of Aunt May discovering them, quite naturally. Ant-Man is just happy to be among his heroes and Paul Rudd brings the credibility of a common guy honored to be working with his heroes. But again, this theme has worked well for Marvel and shall continue to do so because the general audience prefers the levity with the action. 'Civil War' does less to lead up to the upcoming Infinity Wars and more to introduce new characters and reboots. In the absence of Thor, who is busy with far greater threats, the stakes aren't high enough for the Avengers right now but they do need to keep themselves in check, even if through an international panel and they must resolve their unsettled differences if they want to be the Earth's mightiest heroes.8.588 on a scale of 1-10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very powerful superhero film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Captain America: Civil America is such a strong powerful marvel superhero movie! The acting is great from the entire cast, including Scarlett Johansson, Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, and Sebastian Stan. I loved this film also for the extended superbly done action sequences. The action/violence is done just right for a marvel movie. The writing is very well done too, it's got it's comedic moments that are truly funny and delivered well by the actors. The stunts are great and the special effects/visuals are very well put together. I liked the younger new teenage Spider-Man here, i thought he did well with his role. You will not be bored for one second all throughout this film, never a dull moment. That is the duty of a hero movie after all, is to entertain with action, and to create good characters with depth. Civil War did all of those things very well, it wasn't perfection, but it came pretty damn close. The different characters come together so well, and their chemistry is spot on. I was genuinely happy with this entry in the marvel hero franchise, the director made all the right decisions. I give Captain America a 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Fights, Boring Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a big fan of traditional storytelling. What I mean is, the plot should start off with an inciting incident which introduces the conflict that sets the story in action. The plot should build on this conflict until it is resolved in the climax.But I felt like this movie was all over the place.The climax is a confrontation between Steve and Tony (not a spoiler, it was shown in the trailers), which could have been great if the rest of the movie built up to that. But the inciting incident started a plot about collateral damage, political will, government oversight, and the responsibility of super heroes.Even these themes were not developed very well, imo, as we jumped from random location to random location, the script writers seemingly caring more about groping for reasons to make these heroes fight than putting together any compelling narrative. Then, in the end, the conflict isn't even addressed or resolved. The climax is basically an unrelated (to the plot) fight scene introduced by a random video.I found it to be a messy movie and I was thoroughly disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perhaps THE best addition to the MCU, thus far,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2016 has been a wonderful year so far for superhero movie adaptations, and the ongoing superhero-fuelled train isn't coming to a halt anytime soon. So Captain America: Civil War finally reaches our cinema screens, and oh boy, I might need an underwear change. To be entirely honest, I went into this movie with very little knowledge on what I should expect, or even the slightest of clues about how this monumental superhero moment could possibly be executed perfectly for fans. But it's safe to say the Russo brothers pulled off possibly one of the best superhero movies of all time, well, at least up there with The Dark Knight. However, the reason for this is not just because there's so many memorable scenes from the comics being incorporated, but because it's done so well. The mammoth of a fight scene was unforgettable, with so many superhero giants facing off and beating the holy hell out of each other. It truly was a cinematic moment to remember and cherish for our lifetimes, one which stand the test of time for being perhaps the best superhero scene that we will ever see. I mean, how often do you see Spider-Man and Captain America going ham on each other?As for Spidey, Tom Holland KILLS it. We all know what to expect with our friendly- neighbourhood Spider-Man since Maguire and Garfield's portrayals, but Holland provides something different, and something extra. We aren't bored with the origin story of a hero we have become so accustomed too, instead, we meet a young, charismatic, yet quirky Peter Parker who is only now getting to grips with his new powers. The chemistry between the young Parker and the experienced Tony Stark was delightful to see, with Stark almost playing the father-I-never-had role. And with Robert Downey Jr. looking to reprise his role as our beloved Iron Man in the upcoming Spider-Man remake, Spider- Man: Homecoming, fans can look forward to seeing the pair in action once more.What makes Captain America: Civil War the gripping film that it is, is due to audiences being able to clearly see and understand the motivations for both Team Cap and Team Iron Man. Steve Rogers eagerly detests against the Sokovia Accords, a government- drafted motion to attempt to keep the heroes in check, and also to save his childhood friend Bucky Barnes, AKA The Winter Soldier, from false murder accusations. Stark and Co., however, decide that these guidelines are completely necessary, and audiences are encouraged to empathise with the mass amount of civilian casualties caused by The Avengers' attempts to save mankind. In short, there isn't a moment when watching the film in which we don't see both sides of the story, and as a result, disables us from only focusing on one party being the good guys. This is how Civil War reaches out to audiences, pulls on our heart-strings, and keeps us on the edge of our seats ? something that the MCU has done so excellently over recent years.The MCU have also gained a reputation for its light-sided humour being repeatedly cemented into its roots, and Civil War isn't any different. More importantly though, this time around the humour is used in relevant moments and avoids the urge to shoehorn any jokes when it's not needed. The introduction of both Spider-Man and Ant-Man into the Avengers really helps with the comedic side of the movie, with both characters cracking audiences up whenever they're on screen. But, again, it's relevantly used, so the humour is refreshing and immune to fatigue. Civil War also introduces Black Panther, a rather underrated hero at times with a strong moral standpoint. It's about damn time, too.However, the ending of the movie was a little anticlimactic for my liking. Picture this: you're speeding down an empty road, no speed limits, no boundaries, nothing but eye- watering fun. And then BAM, a deer runs out onto the road and you have to slam on the brakes. What a dick, right? Well, this is what Civil War falls into the trap for doing. For 3/4 of the movie there's so much going on: so much fun, so much badassery, so much intensity. And then suddenly, it slams on the brakes and next thing we know, the credits are rolling. Whilst I understand the difficulties with timing, and especially when the movie is already 2 and a half hours long, I would have preferred an extra 15 minutes to gradually reach the finale. Beggars can't be choosers, though, right?I had no interest in the antagonist in the movie, either. The introduction of Zemo was, at times, boring and completely uninteresting, something fans of the MCU would be disappointed about since the likes of Loki and Ultron were the complete opposite. The main fault for this, I think, is because fans are lining up to watch a movie showing a catalogue of superheroes battling against each other, and whilst that still is the case, Zemo only helps to reassure viewers that the heroes don't actually dislike one another, and to be brutally honest; he was the only character that I really didn't care about. Although War Machine was a close second. Also, the CGI at times was painfully bad. Yes, Iron Man's suit, I'm looking at you. For a budget that could have covered around 20 different films, you would have thought Marvel had it covered, surely?In the end, Captain America: Civil War was a fantastic superhero movie. It had everything fans wanted to see and more, but more importantly, it's done so in a well-structured manner. I, for one, will never forget seeing so many superhero greats coming together to battle it out, and seeing Spidey in the mix makes it so much sweeter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could have been the best Iron Man movie ever (but is still great!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't get me wrong: Civil War is a great movie and Captain America is by far my favourite Avenger. But actually in the story the real drama and conflict comes from Tony Stark - not Steve Rogers. Captain America goes rogue in order to save his friend Bucky - that's understandable. But it is up to Iron Man to bring his friend in. Adding to this drama Stark has a few ghosts from the past he has to fight as well. So although Civil War is one of the best Marvel movies ever, it could have been even more interesting if the main focus was on Iron Man.But let us not be unthankful. Civil War is a great fun and an exciting ride. First of all Spider- Man gets a great introduction. I liked the fact that he's in highschool instead of being a student like the previous movies. His scene with Tony Stark is brilliant and during the fight at the airport he steals the show - still being in awe of seeing his Avenger heroes for the first time. I also loved Black Panther. His role in the story is pretty vital. Because there are a lot of Avengers seen in Civil War it could easily have been an Avengers film. The Russo brothers did a great job by giving all the heroes enough screen time. So were there any down points? Personally I didn't like Ant-Man becoming the giant that he can be at the airport fightscene. With the Avengers not really wanting to hurt each other, the fight scenes almost became slapstick. Ant-Man becoming the giant was just a little bit too much, I think.But enough complaining. Captain America Civil War is a great action movie about loyalty and friendship. At the end the relationship between Tony Stark and Steve Rogers is changed forever and I can't wait when they will face each other again in The Avengers III. Oh yeah: one spoiler: finally Captain America gets his first kiss. It was about time!Can't wait to see it again.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Captain America: Civil War Review (Minor spoilers) So finally got a chance to see this movie, I have to admit when this movie was announced I actually wasn't excited because many of the characters that were involved in the Civil War comic book wise such as Wolverine, F4, Spider-Man etc. were not owned by marvel studios(of course they just got the rights back to Spidey but the former two still aren't) and there needed to be more heroes I figured but nevertheless the movie was still good and ultimately the story worked(though on a personal level I still think it was too soon and should've waited) the movie does a good job balancing the stories focusing on the principal characters and giving each side character just the right amount of screen time without overcrowding the film that we loose interest.The film picks up where the Age of Ultron story left and where Ant-Man left off. The Avengers are essentially being briefed about the repercussions/fallout of their battles(tell me how an alien invasion wasn't going to have some casualties) and how the general public worldwide believes they need to be kept in check especially following their latest mission; Secretary Ross(formerly General Ross in the Hulk) tells them of a registration that will take place at the U.N. basically it will keep the avengers in check and they will answer to the U.N. who will tell them when to attack and if the mission is sanctioned etc. This sounds good but ultimately not everything is black and white, Captain America is not for it fearing that them being in anyone elses hands other than their own is too risky (they cant trust anyone else other than themselves and after what happened with S.H.I.E.L.D. whom they had answered to who can blame him) and if another world wide catastrophe happens they'll have to wait for the U.N. to give the OK and how long will that take since it would more than likely be voted on and by the time they got their would it be too late? Iron Man on the other hand believes they need to be in check that way whatever they do will be sanctioned and no heroes would go on rogue missions plus they keep an account of all super powered beings and or heroes in general. This is the back story that leads to infighting between them with each hero taking sides but also trying to go after a bigger threat which is responsible that being the issue with Caps friend Bucky. How this will all end well you'll have to see.The movie I think maybe the best Versus type film by far, the story is right(as I had said) it really does a good job tackling the conflict of friends fighting friends, team torn apart, fighting my own brother, don't make me do this. The acting is good and direction very well thought out. Graphics are excellent and homages to the original comic is very well done and I have to admit I liked the ending in the movie better than the comic ending(that really made me made). In the case of the theatrical cut of BvS it was too fast paced and the story didn't plot out very well(though ill reserve my official opinion on this when the extended cut comes out) Cap Civil War didn't have this problem with the story moving at the right pace and with as many characters as this movie had that's quite impressive, it takes its time and segways through the plot showcasing what's needed and not veering off to something that takes away from the story. Cap and Iron Mans conflict in some ways can be taken as an allegory to real life with the issue of politics tearing everyone apart from friends to families, businesses etc. in some ways I thought it kind of hits home on that front how something as complicated political ideology ultimately can do harm and indeed the public comments on this film is that Captain America represents the libertarian/classical liberal/I believe in the freedom of the individual/limited government/anti-socialist basically everything that America was ideally supposed to represent where as Iron Mans basically the Keep everyone in check/bigger government/watch their every move/you don't have my permission/for the greater good/people cant be trusted/pro-socialism kind of deal. This film could be taken as a kind of satire deal utilizing the comic book to paint a picture of society just as actual comics do every now and then(but it has fun with it to so its not like its really trying to shove any opinion down anyones throat, I think ultimately it did its job and making not everything black and white and honors each persons opinion in the end). I WAS REALLY EXCITED TO SEE SPIDER-MAN ULTIMATELY, This wasn't the first time Spider-Man was on screen (hes had a total of 5 films under Sony) but this was the first time he was finally on screen with the rest of the Marvel band, shame on you Sony for trying to keep him away from the rest of his brethren. But the actress that played his Aunt May I'm sorry she has no business in that role at all she is NOT AN AUNT MAY I mean wow she's good looking and Tonys all hitting on her really??!! Whose behind this decision? As far as comic to movie adaption goes its not the worse but it was a lot more complicated comic book wise I mean Spider-Man revealed his identity, Iron man went as far as using villains on his side(his greater good) Wolverine, Daredevil, The Punisher, Fantastic 4, they were all involved(Susan and Reed separated even) All in all I give this film a 2 and a half thumbs up and recommend it to anyone who loves comic films and versus films at that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Loved this move so much. Only reason why it's not a 10 is because it could of had more characters. Other then that it was very amazing. I loved the use of each characters powers (especially scarlet witch). I thought wolverine, cyclops or jean grey would have been a great addition to the movie although it is captain America. The ending was good and I hope it gets a sequel and hopefully a Marvel Ultimate Alliance 3. The quality of the film was good and all characters costumes were very detailed and done well. The story of the movie was planned well and executed amazingly. It is a family movie as most people like the marvel universe. I hope everyone enjoys it and the writers did an amazing job.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great start for the Phase Three Marvel Cinematic Universe movies, what else oh yeah this movie is Awesome! And better than Batman V Superman Dawn Of Justice.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ever since the trailers and promos were released, I was excited to see what direction Marvel will go through now that Phase One and Two are finished. Me being a comic book fan and a die hard Marvel fan I was excited for what Marvel will bring to the table next, because ever since The Avengers and its sequel Avengers Age Of Ultron I enjoy each Marvel film because Marvel brings all the good things to the table for what comic book fans want. I was able to watch an advance screening of this movie at IMAX with my sister and it seriously blew me away even when I watched it for the second time with my sister at the Director's Club it still kept me on the edge of my seat and the third time I watched it with my parents yesterday it still satisfied me, I can truly say that Marvel is on the right direction of their movies compared to DC. I was very surprised with Captain America Civil War because this film did a very superb and outstanding job in terms of storytelling and introducing new characters who we will see in their future solo movies and this also acts as an incredible end to the story of the great Captain America. The story is very engaging and well paced, it seriously puts the movie in a whole new level and the action is just awesome plus the humor and jokes are even funnier when compared to its predecessor. But the film's true highlight (SPOILER ALERT FOR THOSE WHO HAVEN'T SEEN THE FILM YET!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!) is the introduction of Spider Man because we all know that when the second trailer was released we get to see our favorite web swinger in the Marvel Cinematic Universe kick some butts and he is seriously well done and better than in my opinion Tobey Maguire. The same can be said to Black Panther, who I can't wait for his own solo film and is well portrayed in this movie. This film shows proof that Marvel is always on the right spot and track when it comes to their films and it is better than Batman V Superman, because this movie has all the good elements that was not in Batman V Superman that is joy and humor. This movie is very entertaining overall and it is the best film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe since Avengers Age Of Ultron and Captain America The Winter Soldier.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yes! Civil War is the one you got to see!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's rare that the sequels can out do the original, but the first Avenger does not hold a candle to the Winter Soldier and The Winter Soldier is nothing compared to Civil War.A superhero movie with some real depth to it, Civil War is not so loosely based on the Marvel comics event. All the Events since the first Avengers movie are being called in check, when the UN forces a political policy on the Avengers that would allow them to regulate how superheroes battle the forces of evil. Captain America is not for it, while Iron Man is, putting them on different sides.Just like Winter Soldier, what makes this movie so good is that it is basically an Avengers movie, having pretty much all of them in the same film at once, with some extra added surprises, like The Black Panther making his debut on the screen, Spider-Man joining the marvel cinematic universe and Ant-Man showing off his full capability.I was a little nervous that Cap would get lost in the shuffle of his own picture. He does, kinda, but thankfully the movie is about him being the leader of the Avengers so he does get some screen time. I love Cap, he has the flair of a a comic book, but the moves of the greatest action hero, and even though Chris Evans gives his best performance as the Star Spangled Avenger, we all did not come to see him. Civil War has the same appeal of X2, Just so many superheroes in the film, and it was done right. It's hard to say which is cooler, watching the spark happening between the Scarlet which and the vision. Seeing the origin of the Black Panther, or watching Tony Stark having a heart to heart with Peter Parker. Definitely the latter, because I though that Spider-Man's appearance in the film would be overkill, but you could not help but to clap when he comes on the screen. Tom Holland is going to do for Spider-Man what Christian Bale did for The Dark Knight.For those of you who hate how these movie superheroes don't seem to go up against a proper villain, I have to say that Helmut Zemo does not have the flamboyance you expect from a villain, like if you compare him to Loki (he does have the hate of Magneto, however), he was the perfect Villain for Civil War and adds well to everything the movie is.It's big and Epic,and action packed, and within all that is some serious drama that gets to you. Darker than you'd expect these Marvel movies to be, but still a ton of laughs and entertaining fun.It's what Avengers: Age of Ultron could have been and what Batman Vs. Superman really (really) should have been. Sorry Deadpool, but you've been replace as my favorite superhero movie of the year!No matter what side you pick, you win if you go see Captain America: Civil War.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>4 May 2016 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Captain America - Civil War. Imagine a really really bad Marvel Film and you're on the planet that it's farthest from. Another great instalment and yet again, possibly one of the best. This film had so much going on it kept your attention one hundred percent of the time. It's another story where superheroes are being pitted against each other and when I saw this in the trailers my heart sank, but I must say go with it, see where the story takes you, it's a Marvel!!!!! All our old favourites get airtime, and even a mention for those not joining us on this outing, and a couple of new ones join the mix, A great performance from Tom Holland.....Billy Elliott turns on his spidey senses. This was quite a serious film but there were still moments of frivolity, and people.....don't get up and walk out before the credits.......it is a Marvel production after all....just saying!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Most Impressive Entry in MCU</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the first introductory to the second dark political thriller, the Russo brothers has surprised the audiences by transforming the entire tone of the series into a psychology based superhero film. It's a mini Avengers reunion but more centralise on the conflicts between Captain America, Winter Soldier as well as Iron Man and with more grounds to cover, both Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely who have written the first two installments managed to ensure the well-pacing of the story without losing its sense of intentions. Continuing the epic traditional fighting sequences from previous episode, the 13th outing of this MCU adventure offers a wide variety range of action scenes and it is evenly distributed among all the superheroes through efficient cinematography of switching without focusing much on gunshots, smashing and explosions. All characters are engaging thanks to the compelling character developments; Chris Evans, Robert Downey Jr. and Sebastian Stan deliver well as their roles respectively in term of resolving the challenge of their friendship test, the other Avengers perform outstanding too especially the brought in of Spider-Man, Back Panther and Ant-Man have added more fun and joy which is entirely absent in DC's Dawn of Justice. It is emotional, inspiring and perfectly crafted, implying that the actions chosen between the two main characters are not anything about right or wrong, but more on perceptions and the outcomes. While the Captain America trilogy is not up to The Dark Knight trilogy masterpiece, the decision to explore thought- provoking themes have made it one of the most impressive series in MCU.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Captain America: Civil War is probably Marvel Studios' finest movie to date. The superhero registration act resembles that of the comics great, but halfway through the movie you can realize that the plot device is moved out of the focus, which you can either love or hate, depending on what you want to see. There's a lot of characters, and I really mean characters because of their distinct personalities and traits (Unless you haven't seen the other Marvel movies, in that case they are kinda good at best.) The characters developed a LOT in this movie (which is something to say since the other Marvel movies basically followed a formula.) So you will definitely see them changed to a certain degree in the next movies. One thought that crossed my mind in the cinema was: Was there too much going on? I'll admit, there was slightly too much going on in the movie, but what was in the film, they got the best out of. Another thing I personally thought was great about the movie is the change of tone. You get to see The Avengers in a different situation than before, and I think it's refreshing to see a very serious film. I'm also impressed that they pulled it off, since all of the other movies have always been light-hearted. Over-all this movie is incredible for any fan, and I can't recommend it enough. If you haven't seen the other MCU films then you won't like as much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Everything I wanted and more! The BEST Marvel movie to date!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Captain America: Civil War is a good balance of action, drama and comedy. Marvel was often criticized for being too bland or being too light for its past movies. With Civil War, you get the chance to see the dark and gritty side of the superheroes we all love. Still staying true to the well-loved humor, Civil War managed to tell a beautiful story of friendship, family and loss.It was a concern, after the announcement of the film, how they will be able to still focus on Captain America in spite of having "too many" superheros involved. This film just shut down all those doubt by giving the perfect amount of focus to each of its character, Captain America still being the main center of the story.If you read the comics and hoping that they stuck to the reference, then don't bother watching the film. This film is an epic on its own. It stands on its own motives and reasons. If you keep an open mind and not think of what happened in the comics then you will surely find this movie fantastic.Others say that the movie villain, Baron Zemo was weak and irrelevant but I saw him in a different way. He wants chaos and he brought it to the Avengers. He was a small villain compared tow hat we have seen before but his intentions were chaotic and evil, powered by his desire of vengeance. He was the catalyst of the movie, he made everything unfold in its right phase.Steve's love for Bucky clouded his perception. The always "right and moral" Captain America was in the middle of his own dilemma. His relationship with Tony was heavily damaged because of this. Tony on the other hand was fueled by his ego, conscience and revenge.The fight scenes in the film was terrific. Each hero stood out. Black Panther was greatly hyped for this movie and so as Spider-Man and Ant-Man. These are all "new" superheros which already gave us more than what we're expecting.I loved the phasing of the film and its timing was perfect. It was not fast, it was just right for you to follow what's happening. Twists and turns happen along the way that you might not expect but will surely love. They were able to develop each character especially Scarlet Witch and Vision, even Falcon. These characters were all essential to the development of the film.This film is a great epic and at the same time a great set up for the upcoming films. This movie CHANGES EVERYTHING on MCU. It's never gonna be the same as some heroes became fugitives and fugitives became heroes.Best Marvel movie to date! No doubt!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will try not to add any spoilers but if any do get added I do apologise. Firstly the Russo brothers have done it again and this time in my opinion and a first for me the movie deserves a 10 out of 10 rating. Even though this is a Captain America movie the other characters do get ample screen time including the new additions of spider-man and Blank Panther. The movie had the right flow of Drama / darkness but still in certain moments kept light with humour added in. Marvel / Russo brothers seemed to have nailed this, something DC comics seem to not be able to get a grasp of.The battle scene at the airport where team cap vs team iron man is executed brilliantly. Walking out the cinema there were praises for Spider-Man coming not only from myself but a large number of the audience. Just hope that Sony let Marvel do what is right with the character.Any one sceptical of this movie don't be. Just go and enjoy it and you shall not be disappointed. And I am with Team Cap.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A smart script delivers all a Marvel movie fan could ask for.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WAR! WHAT IS IT GOOD FOR? TWO HOURS AND 27 MINUTES OF SUPERHERO FISTICUFFS THAT'S WHAT! It is a certainty that most of the audience will know Captain America: Civil War's cast of characters from the movies which is a bit sad because, for me as a Marvel comic reader since my distant teens, one of the main pleasures of watching the movie is its loving evocation of the Sixties Marveluniverse in which characters gleefully crossed over onto each others'titles to trade insults and punches in equal measure.However, The touchstone for this superhero slug fest is Mark Miller's 2006-7 Civil War storyline that formed the spine of a Summer comic book cross-over event brawling across multiple titles and winning new or winning back old readers for the Marvel line in the process. The cinematic version goes its own way and is mostly successful precisely because its execution is cinematic rather than comic bookish (Comics are often spoken of as if they were films but the differences between the media are important).On-screen, Civil War is carried as much by its actors as its effects. Chris (Captain America) Evans, Robert (Iron Man) Downey Jr and Sebastian (Winter Soldier) Stan form the emotional triangle at the heart of the movie. When The Winter Soldier is implicated in acts of terrorism Cap wants to bring him in. But the move places him outside the law and Iron Man must bring the World War Two hero to book.The film's complex but far from incomprehensible plot weaves together the collective fates of the rest of the Marvel cinema superheroes and introduces a few new characters for good measure. The tension between vigilantism and the Rule of Law is the same theme that should have provided the weight to Batman Vs Superman but didn't and, truth be told, is hardly better explored here as Civil War is carried by personal motives of vengeance and loss. The 'villain' Zemo is driven by the loss of his family in Sokovia and T'Challa becomes The Black Panther after the death of his father.The script gives key secondary relationships between, for example, The Vision and The Scarlet Witch, and between The Black Widow and Hawkeye enough screen time to make you care about who ends up zapping, clobbering and generally battling whom. It's all a far cry from the DC movie which still felt the need to rework origin stories as if afraid the audience had forgotten what makes Batman Batman.The direction draws on contemporary war/action movies to realize the fight scenes. This lends them a violent reality although I found the strobing bodies flinging themselves across the screen hard on the eyes. But, again, a confident script gives the audience a much needed break by inter-cutting the action with more intimate scenes. We see the Vision struggling to cook for mutant Wanda and tony Stark cajole a young Pete Parker (Tom Holland) into donning a smartened up Spider-Man costume and fight on the side of International Law. Civil War effortlessly handles shifts in tone and pace. The latter left me more than happy to see a new Spiderman movie, although I preferred James Acheson's costume design for the character ? the new suit looks like foam rubber. Incidentally, Aunt May (Marisa Tomei) has undergone a radical reworking (is there such a category as an AILF?) As the trailer suggests, a key fight occurs on an airfield as Captain America seeks to steel a Quinjet from under the nose of the government. It is Captain America, Scarlet Witch, Ant Man, Hawkeye, Winter Soldier and The Falcon vs Iron Man, War Machine, The Vision, Black Widow and Black Panther on the other. You'll not really know who to cheer but, while the introduction of The Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) is a crowd pleaser, Ant Man's (Paul Rudd) transformation into Giant Man steals the scene. But it would be a mistake to believe the film simply descends into violence. Its final act delivers plenty of plot twists and, if anything, the dialogue becomes sharper, funnier and more poignant. And yes, Stan Lee makes his customary appearance, albeit late in the day and with a weak joke that the audience greeted with rapturous laughter suggesting that this moment of light relief was also well timed.The cleverness of Captain America : Civil War's script, performances and direction cruelly exposes the weaknesses of Batman Vs Superman: Dawn of Justice. In the battle of the Easter superhero blockbusters Civil War wins by a critical knockout.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overall Captain America: Civil War is an amazing superhero film and arguably one of the best ever (For me it's no challenge) the best MCU movie yet with amazing characters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hey guys it's STARK here with my early screening review of Captain America: Civil War!Expectations: Going into the early CA: CW screening I was pretty hyped. My expectations were high and maybe the highest I've ever had for a marvel movie. The film did not disappoint.Review: The Russo brothers directing was next to perfect for this film. I can honestly say there were no real or huge flaws from their directing. The fight scenes sometimes got a bit unrealistic from some characters but we're still so good. The fight scenes did not involve very much CGI at all and had a beautiful pace that was quick. The fighting was clear and did not make you confused or dizzy either. At the same time though they did a great job of getting in touch with the emotional side of the film and were able to put the film on the same scale as both Avenger films. The directing was amazing and Infinity War is in great hands.The screenplay for the film was also amazing. The majority of the script was suited the plot really well and did a great job with all the MCU characters especially with the first besides a few corny lines. There were lot's of great lines in the film involving comedy and drama. The way the plot was together was great and one of my favourite MCU ones. Once again Infinity War is in amazing hands.The films soundtrack was engaging and very good. Even though I couldn't distinctly remember it bar from bar It was still interesting and gave the story more life.Finally the characters. Chris Evans brings his best Captain America performance yet and really dives into the characters ambition this time and does a great job of showing both the characters good and bad side. The character of Cap in this film really makes you question the nature of him and if he's really the good guy we all know and love. Robert Downey. Jr brings another good performance of Iron but I thought even thought it wasn't bad it wasn't his usual best. The Iron Man character was great in this film and stayed the same at his core throughout the film so it was still the Iron Man we still knew and loved. Mostly. But I'll leave it at that. Elizabeth Olsen does a much better job as Scarlet Witch in this film with a more familiar style of acting for herself that wasn't as forced and much more natural. (More less thick accent). The character of Wanda I thought was much better and had developed a lot more. She was less of an annoying character and brought a lot more interest to the table. Sebastian Stan's acting as Bucky was great because he was able to play the character with humanity and the monster/drone very well. Bucky's character had change a lot since Captain America: Winter Soldier but there really isn't much I can say without revealing anything. Frank Grillo did not get much screen time in the film but the time he did the character was better than the acting even though his acting was not very bad. The character was portrayed as a terrorist and was one of the films darkest characters and also brought a dark sense to the film. Daniel Bruhl did a great job as Baron Zemo. His acting was great and very interesting to watch. The character himself even though he was a bit of a cliché was perfect for the film and rest assure, did not take away attention from the actual Civil War part of the story. His character was controversial and maybe one of my favourite Marvel villains yet. Chadwick Boseman. Black Panther. Boseman becomes the perfect casting for Black Panther portraying absolutely comic accurate but also being appealing to the audience. His acting never seemed off for a moment and never seemed corny. He made you believe and trust the characters motivations. The character of Black Panther was also very comic accurate and cool. His fighting style was entertaining and awesome. He was Marvels Batman and brought a new refreshing character to the MCU. They aced Black Panther in all ways. Now finally... SPIDER-MAN! Tom Hollands performance was not always great as Spider-Man but as an early actor it's okay and still wasn't bad and was very fun to watch. As he grows older I think his acting will continue to get better. The character of Spider-Man himself was better than all other Spider-Men and was next to perfect. He looked awesome, provided great comic relief that actually gave me a good laugh, great action and awesome character interactions/development. He was the most comic accurate spider yet and one of the most comic accurate comic characters seen on screen yet. Besides one or two cheesy lines (That went with the character in a way) Spider-Man could not have been better. Returning characters like War Machine, Ant- Man, Falcon, War Machine, Black Widow, Vision etc did not change too much. Though Ant-Man in a film with Avengers was a delight to see and he fit pretty well with it.Overall Captain America: Civil War is an amazing superhero film and arguably one of the best ever (For me it's no challenge) the best MCU movie yet with amazing characters and an amazing story with no real flaws. Infinity War will be amazing. In case you were wondering.. #TeamIron is who I side with.ScaleDirecting: 18.5/20 Story: 19/20 Writing: 18/20 Sound: 16/20 Acting: 17.5/20 = 89/100 = 8.9/10 = 89%Rating = 8.8/10 = 88%</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The first Superhero movie with no villain</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No doubt about it, this film is something new that has never been done before. And it is done with elegance, sophistication and intelligence. For this CA:CW is the first superhero film ever created that effectively has no "baddie" in it.Now that's a milestone in the genre because as we all know, it's generally the quality of the villain (not the hero) which defines how successful a hero flick will be in the marketplace.CA:CW sets out more like a bond film than a hero flick. Espionage and politics reign supreme and for a while there, it can be difficult to follow for many of us film goers used to letting hero flicks "just wash over us" without having to use our brains.But have patience punters during the first hour because it DOES all come together wonderfully in the end and there are very few strings left untied by credit roll time.CA:CW takes the new "post modern, human hero" thing to a new level. Finally, we see that these heroes can and do have their limits. They CAN be beaten, they DO get hurt. I guess when you're in the Marvel universe and have so many of them, you can afford to lose some along the way.The biggest surprise (SPOILER ALERT!) is how the whole film builds to make us think there is about to be a typical showdown between the Avengers and a group of mysterious "baddies" - only to find that these so called "baddies" have all now been taken out with a single shot each as they lay in their beds! As with most Marvel Universe stuff, this film builds a framework for future films yet to come.CA:CW is the film that you and I always dreamed of having been made when we watched these things as kids. We would all just sit there and wonder how these heroes would survive in real life, and wish that someone would just "take out" the baddie for us quick smart so the rest of the movie could then give us an insight into the hero's loves, lives and the way they manage being heroes in a complex world.Despite the slow and complex start, CA:CW will not disappoint. However the more Marvel make this kind of stuff, the more they put these characters in straight jackets for future films. I guess they don't care because when it comes to Stan Lee, there's plenty of heroes out there still "in the can" yet to open up.Oh and one more thing : Designed by Owen Paterson! ANOTHER Aussie LEGEND (most well known for designing the Matrix films) and from the same mold as Colin Gibson (most recently winning big time for Mad Max / Fury Road). Good on ya mate.. no less than total world domination will do now eh. Maybe we should include Captain Invincible?...ZM</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Captain America: Civil War is directed by Anthony &amp; Joe Russo and stars Chris Evans, Robert Downy Jr., Scarlett Johansson, Sebastian Stan, Anthony Mackie, Don Cheadle, Jeremy Renner, Chadwick Boseman, Paul Bettany, Elizabeth Olsen, Paul Rudd, Daniel Brül and last but definitely not least, Tom Holland. After another incident involving destruction, chaos and death, the Avengers are required to sign a contract with a governing body to ensure they are only called upon when absolutely vital. Tony Stark and Steve Rogers become enemies due to a disagreement and the other Avengers are caught in the crossfire. Firstly I'd like to state that I'm not overly keen on how 70% of movies these days are centred around superheroes or their respective universes. I've always enjoyed the instalments Marvel have been releasing in the MCU canon and this is no different... But yet it is.Anthony and Joe Russo so skilfully directed 'The Winter Soldier' that I had no doubts for 'Civil War' and I had a deep feeling it would be perfect. I was right. This is how you direct a superhero movie. Take note Zach Snyder and DC Comics, because this is entertainment.The action sequences are so brilliantly directed and shot that it's impossible to keep your eyes off the screen. It's fast-paced, rapid, clean and smart. If you've seen their work before then you know how beautiful their direction is. And not just in the action sequences; the real conflict and deceit between these heroes is written extremely well and shows you both sides to the story. It's really hard to decide who you side with as a viewer, and that's what is truly wonderful and unique about this movie. It has you rooting for both sides of the argument, regardless of who your favourite characters are.Along with the usual team of Avengers we have some newcomers; Black Panther and Spider-Man. Chadwick Boseman did a terrific job as Panther and settles conveniently into the story. I look forward to seeing more of this character in future instalments. Tom Holland as Spidey. Perfect. He has an incredible balance between the web-slinger and teenager Peter Parker. He was introduced into the MCU nicely and was actually involved a lot more than I had expected, which was a great surprise. He handles the comedy with absolute ease and had the entire theatre laughing in all of his scenes. I am stunned and cannot wait to see more of him!Music by Henry Jackman is just as tense and gritty as it was in 'The Winter Soldier' and as the screenplay evolves, the new 'Civil War' theme gravitates to the foreground. Instead of a mash of motifs, Jackman decided that it would be easier to have one overall theme. I appreciate this decision.My verdict; Captain America: Civil War had major potential to be a disappointment. But luckily the Russo brothers came through just as they did before with a complete masterpiece. This is now my favourite MCU instalment by far. Go and see this movie.Captain America: Civil War, 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Marvel Masterpiece In Full Action</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed this spectacular and flawless movie 100%. The storyline is absolutely 1st class which flowed perfectly like a powerful and majestic waterfall. I loved how all the superheroes played an important role in this 4 star film especially Iron Man and Captain America. The directors, producers and of course the actors, all deserve full credit in making this legendary masterpiece. Seriously, one does not view original classics like these anymore. I am looking forward into digesting and savoring this magnificent movie once again and I hope to see another one like this. Excellent Job. My compliments to the chefs and Stan Lee.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most cinematic Marvel film yet!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Captain America isn't just one of the best superhero films, it is an outstanding film outside of the genre. There is so much going on in Civil War that you'd think the film would never be able to keep with all of it. New characters, huge set pieces and multiple plot lines coming to a head. However the direction and writing handles everything with a resounding respect and pace that makes this film spectacular.Old characters like Iron Man, Captain America and Black Widow are given new nuances and interactions that keep there characters from becoming stale with Robert Downey Jr. delivering his best performance as Iron Man yet. Newer characters like Winter Solider, Ant-Man and Vision are also given great moments that don't distract from what's important and Spider-Man and Black Panther are excellent new additions to the formula.What is most effective about Civil War is that it combines the political intrigue and believability with the fun and large scale of The Avengers together seamlessly making this the most realistic and enjoyable looks into the MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe) yet. If I had one criticism of the film, it would be about the villain who seems very pointless and confusing until his motivations are revealed at the end of the film. Once this happens your perspective on the character changes into something quite unexpected that fits perfectly into the films tone and messaging.Good - Fantastic Action Sequences - Multi-layered characters and storytelling - Well paced comedy and realism - A film with suspense and consequencesBad - Villains motivations are unclear and jarring to begin with.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad......but....not Fun.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All I can say is......it is about what you would expect from a movie when hero's fight other hero's.It never really ends well. Yes.....this movie is based on the comic ARC, which I ignored intentionally. But, the trailers for this movie made me think that it might be fun to watch.It was a long movie. It was at times quiet, and boring. I also missed seeing the Hulk and Thor in the action, so I truly hope that there is something exciting planned for those two in Ragnarok.I got a chance to see this in Japan, which for some reason premiered a week earlier than in the USA. I kind of wished that I waited for the DVD.The acting was good. The action was good. I enjoyed seeing Black Panther in action. But...I left this movie feeling like......ehhhhhhh it was OK.I do hope that Marvel and Disney will read these reviews and consider what the fans want. Because right now, it seems this is not made for the fans.Over all....solid movie, but leaves you wanting something more. Not more minutes, but more depth.One more thing, there are two end credits. I left before the 2nd one. Stick around.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Comic Book Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So far we had many comic book movies, but we never had so far, THE comic book movie. Not until Civil War! The Russo brothers did something I did not expect, exceed The Winter Soldier and make not only the best Marvel movie so far but the best movie in its genre so far. The movie is not only an epic proportioned spectacle but also a very well thought conclusion to what previous movies have been leading up to. From a technical standpoint the movie is, just like The Winter Soldier a delight. Practical effects, very good implementation of CGI, beautiful camera work and choreography, sound and a solid script. The Russo brothers take action to another step with amazingly cut action scenes that keep you on the edge of your seat. I need to mention that Captain America Civil War has one of the best action scenes I have seen, ever. The movie not only offers great action but also very good character development, strong performances from each member of the cast and more than enough screen time for everyone. The newcomers, Black Panther and Spiderman are as expected among the highlights of this spectacular flick. The movie has its issues, while it is up for debate the villain played by Daniel Bruhl is most definitely the biggest low in this movie along with some specific scenes where the editing can get a little confusing and tiresome making it hard to keep track on what is happening on screen. With all these said the movie is absolutely excellent and a whole new level for comic book movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marvel continues what they've done and have done well, but for how long?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Captain America: Civil War was hotly anticipated. I was looking forward to it as well and the film definitely met those expectations. However, I'm feeling the age in the Marvel Universe franchises. The films all seem alike and we already know the cast is great but how many times can you watch any group of actors do the same thing again and again. The shtick for Civil War of course is the heroes fighting each other and the story is solid and the addition of Spiderman is...well forced in there but still fun mostly. The best thing to come of Civil War is that some of the lesser known heroes get their time in the sun. Scarlet Witch becomes a much bigger part of the story, Black Panther (which everyone is raving about) and even Black Widow (give her her own movie already!) The story is good, the pacing is a little slow but the action scenes are as good as they have ever been. Marvel films don't get worse but they set the bar so high that eventually you're going to feel like this is very familiar ground and it is that. It certainly sets up the Universe for the next phase and moving into Avengers. I'm just afraid that this entire genre of films has worn out the superhero world.How much more can you say about this cast? Marvel/Disney casting is and always has been very much dead on. Robert Downey Jr is the master of the Universe as Iron Man and actually has given the role a lot of depth and emotion especially since Iron Man 3. Chris Evans completely embodies Captain America and this film especially gives him a little more edge than usual and seeing him and Iron Man at odds is a nice turn. Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Anthony Mackie, Don Cheadle...these actors absolutely ace their roles but they always have. Not has changed there. Chadwick Boseman who completely enamoured me back in the film 42 (one of the most powerful films I've ever seen) now takes on the role that will likely skyrocket him to Hollywood heavyweight. Black Panther is a fantastic character that will probably be a great stand alone movie and the introduction for him was perfectly fit into this film. Elizabeth Olsen really gets to stand out in this film with a much bigger story arc than previous and she really does well with it. Paul Rudd shows up randomly too as Ant-Man, my least favourite Marvel hero and he completely ruins the scenes he's in. He changes the entire feel of the film and doesn't fit. Tom Holland makes his appearance as Spiderman and I think he'll do a great job however the way they introduced him and threw him into the mix felt very forced. Still he did a good job in the role. Everyone on the cast is at least decent! Captain America: Civil War probably would have made more sense as an Avengers film. It isn't quite focused entirely on Captain America though I see how its his story-line that drives it. The film felt like it was purposely missing Hulk and Thor even though they briefly explain in their absence in a ridiculous forced way. The fact remains if you like the Marvel Universe and you like the films, this is one of the good ones. They've all been good...even the less than great ones and I have high hopes that Civil War will bring this genre into it's golden years. Eventually it has to wind down. It will be interesting to see the Russo brothers who have a long history in Television take on the Avengers films but they also did very well with directing this film as well. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why are people giving so many negative reviews? Its a goddamn amazing movie. Captain America: Civil War fulfills the war part that has been in play since 2008's Iron Man. Seeing Spider-Man in the MCU was worth it. Its the best portrayal of the character. Robert Downey Jr. gives one of his best performances as the Iron Man. Black Panther, Ant-man, Captain America to name a few gave an amazing performance too. The movie is about politics, friendship, retribution and teamwork. It is fun, fierce, thrilling and simply breath-taking. More importantly it teaches us one good lesson: "United we stand, Divide we fall." Words aren't enough to describe how great this movie is. It must be seen to be believed. Another great aspect of the film was the villain -- Baron Zemo. Wow. He stands as one of the best villains in MCU history besides Loki. Despite being a lengthy film clocking at about 2hr26mins, it doesn't give a chance to feel bored. Without giving away too much, the 'Airport scene' in the movie is one of the greatest-epic-amazing-mind-blowing fight scene in the history of superhero movie. But I still miss Quicksilver. Watching some scene at slow-motion Quicksilver kicking some butt would've been awesome. Nevertheless, Captain America: Civil War is truly an epic film. You must see it. 10/10 (Amazing!)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Russo Brothers Did it Again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After Captain America Winter Soldier, I didn't think they could top that with another Captain America movie. Maybe an Avengers movie, but not a Cap movie. I was wrong. Civil War is one of my favourite Superhero movies to date, it had a bit of everything. It had a good cast, developed characters, new character introductions, great fight scenes, a good villain, a good story for the most part. I left the cinema screening feeling like I needed to go back and enjoy it a second time, which I did, and a third. It hasn't replaced Avengers as my favourite Marvel movie, but it's definitely close. With the disappointment of Age of Ultron, I was so happy to see this movie succeed, I had high hopes for Ultron and was crushed by how it turned out, and this really made up for that. It even made Falcon and Scarlet Witch so much cooler than they were in Ag of Ultron. Although it's not an Avengers movie, it did have aspects of being one, but with the core focus on Captain America at all times. His relationship with Bucky, his struggle with his moralistic views and the signing of the Sokovia Accords. You really feel as though it is still a Cap movie, but with a really big cast. The Russo Brothers did a great job in bringing Black Panther to life on the big screen for the first time, you could really feel like they put effort in ensuring this Black Panther feels like the one we grew up with in the comics and cartoons. Whenever he was on screen, I had a big grin on my face, the way he moved, even Chadwick Boseman's acting and accent were fantastic.It makes me really look forward to Ryan Coogler's Black Panther solo movie. Spider-Man's first time on screen in the MCU was brilliant, even though I've enjoyed previous versions of Spider-Man, the 30 minutes of screen time that Tom Holland performed as Spider-Man made all of those other movies look like child's play in comparison. It was very much on point with what we've grown up and I am so excited to see Spider-Man Homecoming, especially now we have Michael Keaton confirmed as a villain, and the most likely inclusion of Downey Jr's Iron-Man. The fight scenes were pretty much on point, with the airport scene being one of the best on screen superhero scenes ever made, full of excitement, fun, humour and action. Ant-Man was fantastic too, we don't see much of him, but from what we do see, it's great, especially in the airport. Baron Zemo as a villain is, for someone with no Superpowers, a really intimidating, cold and calculating villain. I really liked what he did, his manipulation of the characters. It was refreshing to see a villain that wasn't bent on destroying the world, as with most villains in superhero comics. If i had any gripes about the movie, it would be that dots seemed to connect quite conveniently to Zemo's advantage and for the friction between the Avengers. But apart from that, an awesome experience of a movie leaving me very excited for what the Russo's have in store for us with Infinity Wars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Captain America: Civil War, is a great movie because it isn't just the one big topic of Captain America vs Iron Man that we are dealing with. For those of us who haven't seen Captain America: The Winter Solider, we get a look at the Winter Solider for the first time. The movie also shows us conflicts between supporting characters, and gets us hooked with the drama of the story. The trailer doesn't show you only the important scenes of the movie. There is much more in the movie than that. It introduces new characters to us, such as the Black Panther, and designs story-line for characters we saw in The Avengers: Age of Ultron, such as Vision and Scarlet Witch.Some of the most exciting things about the movie is that we get to see characters from other Marvel movies, such as Spider Man and Ant Man, team up with the Avengers. Over all, this movie will have you choose your side, and root for whoever's team you're on in the battle. With action scenes not failing to excite us, this movie is something too see.</fullReview>

Funny, explosive with quite a good message about friendship, revenge and believing in teamwork.First time to like captain America as a superhero and liked the spin at the end of the movie which hold a strong link from the beginning till the end. a lot of comic characters appeared in the movie where there appearance made the movie stronger and funnier. definitely tony stark or Robert is such a great actor and i wish to see him in a villain character in his upcoming movies and it doesn't matter if its a comic or not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Approaching Perfection</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is Captain America: Civil War perfect? Approaching perfection, but not perfection is how I will describe Captain America: Civil War upon second viewing. It is a film that is humorous, exhilarating, fun but still full of emotional weight. It is a film that has impeccable action sequences and beautiful CGI, a film that outruns The Avengers: Age of Ultron by far and is just as awesome as the second installment of the Captain America trilogy - The Winter Soldier. Hey, but what about the plot conveniences? True, there are indeed plot conveniences and traces of the film makers 'making things happen', instead of dragging out plot points logically. This was indeed a flaw, because truly good movies are often based on real-life 'sense'. However, the difference between a movie and real life is that, in a movie, the unreasonable components of the plot can be tucked away in a well paced, well cut film. This is exactly what happened in Captain America, Civil War. The Russo brothers knew how to cut the film so that tension is maintained throughout and the story never breaks. All the pieces of the plot are strung together and played out step by step, joining together like a jigsaw puzzle to form a big picture. By making the big picture well constructed and well paced, the existence of plot conveniences didn't bring the whole film down. Though more logical links and less plot convenience will certainly make this a better movie. You've got to admit the villain is bad though, right? Certainly, just like the majority of other MCU villains, Zemo was a mediocre villain at best, and a huge plot convenience at worst. His plans to turn the heroes against each other was a clever one, but his methods of succeeding in such a convoluted plan was never explained. Maybe the film did not need the villain, and the Civil War could happen because of Iron Man and Captain America's difference in opinions. That worked int he comics, that should also work here. However, I do think having the villain in the movie added to certain aspects of the 'Civil War', putting the heavy fact of Tony's parents' death into the last fight, giving it emotional weight and higher stakes. And the 'no stakes' Civil War? Many people believe that Disney owned projects are trying too hard to appeal to the family and put no real stakes into their movies in case it upsets the eight year old boys who is a die-hard Captain America fan. People accuse Marvel for not having enough 'guts' to kill off, or even disable characters permanently. However, I would argue that Marvel films so far has struck a good balance between 'family friendly' and 'high stakes'. Comic book fans will know that no hero stays dead, whole runs are often dedicated to superheroes coming back to life. Nobody ever says there are no stakes in all comic books every, right? Why? Because comic books don't need reversible deaths to have stakes, the stakes lies in the emotional connection between friends, lovers and family. As 'Disney' movies need to be family friendly and superheroes shouldn't die, Marvel films worked on making the emotional stakes high. In Civil War, the emotional stakes are very high as the ideological differences build to a peak, only to encounter a personal matter that completely derails Tony Stark. The pain constant in Tony's eyes was portrayed perfectly by Robert Downey Jr., other characters such as Black Panther were given great personal arcs too. These character moments are what gives Marvel movie emotional weight, as well as fun. For a person who is invested in the MCU, this movie's stakes is incredibly high due to my value in the friendship between the Avengers. Isn't it just poor film making, like every other Superhero film? A defiant no. Superhero movies are not Godfather or Citizen Kane, they won't push all the frontiers of great film making or open new doors to creative processes. However, this does not prevent them from being a good movie. What does a good movie need? Interesting plot, strong characters, good visuals. By these elements I don't mean they have to be outstanding and noticeable. It means that the plot is interesting enough to hold the audience's attention throughout the movie, the characters are strong enough to warrant an emotional connection, and the visuals are great enough to allow audiences to suspend disbelief. Having these elements do not guarantee an Oscar, but having them means that the movie will be an enjoyable one. Civil War was an enjoyable movie with all three elements above, with added emotional finesse that can be fully understood by those who have watched previous films. It was also a humorous film, with most jokes landing perfectly and inspiring laughs all over the place. Furthermore, it was a film that was really satisfying to watch, as it is full of awesome, kick-ass action scenes that didn't feel unnecessary. Yes, the airport scene may lack some 'reality', but no one can deny it was 18 minutes of none stop fun and eye candy. Yes, the score may be forgettable, but it served its purpose as a atmosphere building block that made moments better. All in all, Civil War is a film that holds up to a second viewing in the cinemas. It has a very engaging story to tell with some very engaging characters and talented actors. It managed to bring Black Panther and Spiderman into the MCU perfectly, with two great actors who fit the role perfectly. And though it is an imperfect movie, it is still one that's worth your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best Marvel movie I've seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not a big fan of the MCU films, but on this weekend, I chose to watch it instead of The Angry Birds Movie (which is getting ugly reviews). But anyways, I thought it was great, much better than any other MCU film I've seen. Here's why.I found the story in this movie solid. It was entertaining, it mostly made sense, and it was funny. In it, the world considers Super Heroes dangerous, so Iron Man wants limit to their actions, and Captain America doesn't, which causes conflict between the two. But in the process, a threat rises. I find it also deep, and well craft. Age of Ultron's story on the other hand, was simple compared to this, and not solid. But one flaw I find is there are a couple of plot holes. But I won't tell them, because it might be a spoiler.The characters in the movie are more dynamic than they are in other MCU films. There is clearly some struggle in them, and with good reason. Also, the special effects in this movie are amazing, and very realistic and believable, despite the CGI.So overall, I recommend this movie to anyone over 10, even non-Marvel fans. It is amazing, and I consider it better than Star Wars: The Force Awakens.</fullReview>

Although, of course, impossible to convey faithfully so enormous story on the big screen and the end is totally different, but that's what I expected. This film is showed how important director. Russo brothers have done a great job at the Captain America: Winter Soldier but they also repeated the same now with the Civil War. They get great material in hand (almost all the most important characters in the Marvel) and are managed to make a very, very good film. Way to go (stupid Snyder). Motivation at the figures is clearly displayed so that everyone can understand it.A only action? Not only is it the best in the Marvel world, but also in general. The effects are in place, the perfect combination of CGI and stunt, I just enjoyed it. I do not have any major objections, eventually someone will say that there are too many characters to follow, but that's why I used the previous films as well as those who have already announced. Marvel continues with excellent films, in my opinion, do not have any really bad movie, they're good or excellent. It's a shame that the DC can not do such a good job, especially when you have a better material.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>May contain spoilers from movies and/or civil war event from the comic books. Definitely contains spoilers.Not only in movies among MCU or even movies based on comic books, Captain America Civil War is a great movie in general. I didn't expect it to be a comic book civil war. How could it be? They have no X-men or Fantastic Four or the New Warriors (Stamford incident which gave a huge boost to superhero registration act) even Spiderman came in late.. I was more leaning towards a political thriller. But it wasn't as much a political thriller even. It was a very close and personal movie with such emotional core. The emotional drive of characters like Tony Stark(due to death of his "mother", Bucky killed his parents yeah,though it is the third act when things were just starting to looking to settle down. Surprise!! Bucky killed Howard and Martha was it? No it was uh... Tony's mother,yeah. and captain America already knew.) and Steve Rogers(who never gives up on his friend Bucky) as well as the antagonist Dr. Helmut Zemo is what gets the story going, later with a different story than that of comics. He is emotionally driven to tear avengers apart and rather than using brute forces ,he plays a manipulator. He is a sympathetic character, you can say that...he is not that much in the screen maybe Marvel is setting him for a bigger arc in another Project. Even though it has a larger ensemble it is still a Captain America movie at it's core. There were some plot holes, yes! but I can look past that. It was a very hard job to accomplish but the new characters felt like they just fit in the MCU; Bravo Russos!! Spiderman , Black Panther and Ant-man were the newer characters introduced to the bigger universe , granted Ant-man already had his solo film. This has got me so excited for upcoming Marvel projects. Wish movies would address just a bit of what's going on with TV universe. Even vague remarks would do. One line is just what i am asking for.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful Escapist Fare and a GREAT Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Way back when I first heard that Captain America was being brought to the screen I kind of cringed. How could they translate the complexity of character and his true coolness but stay away from any cheese? Dress a guy in the flag and remain true to the seriousness of the Depression and World War Two era? Well, they managed to pull it off quite well in the first film. The director knew that you had to establish and truly care about the character. Making it a period piece really helps give it a flavor unlike any other comic adaptation. The Raiders of the Lost Ark flavor was there. In the second film, they met the new challenge of depicting Cap in the modern era. Now, everything established in both Captain America films and both Avengers pays BIG dividends in this Civil War movie. The universe has been established wonderfully and this film does the best job to date playing in that universe. Everything and every scene packs some sort of punch and resonates with true style and heart. They really let the action flow but also allow for key development of the overall story and over concept. This also allows them to probe deeper into the character's personalities. And I'm talking ALL the characters even the ones with smaller roles. This heightens the tension, so often missing from lesser comic-book movies, and adds real weight to the action sequences which are thrilling and often mesmerizing. Add more than a dash of thriller aspects and a few new characters that steal every scene that they appear in. I honestly can't think of one way to improve this film. The result is a sequel that's just flat out exceptional and a trilogy that's the best any genre has ever seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not really into superhero flicks I still do watch them because everybody does and I want to talk about them. The X-men franchise can't satisfy me really and the Avengers franchise is better but do has it flows. But have seen the trailer of this one I thought I would give it a try.What a great flick this is, and by now I do know why the Avengers causes me problems. It's the annoying Iron Man. I mean, when he's Tony Stark he really annoys me with his way of talking but here he isn't the main subject. It's all about Captain America of course. Why I did like it is the fact that it's all about the action throughout this flick. Not that many talking, it's fighting and fighting and it's the Avengers against each other using their superpowers so on part of the effects it's ultra brilliant. I must warn that if you haven't seen another superhero flick that you can have a problem because there's Ant-man and Spiderman popping up, and we do see flashbacks from most of the other superhero flicks.The performances are all excellent, yes, after Deadpool (2016) and Ant-Man (2015) this is the next in a row I do like. Be sure to watch the end credits because the movie goes on, and also wait until the end credits are over, there's more to catch.Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 5/5 Story 4/5 Comedy 0/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Inconsequential Blockbuster with Great Action</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the 13th installment of what has become the majorly successful and popular Marvel Cinematic Universe, Captain America invites conflict within the Avengers by going against the wishes of the world's nations in pursuit of his own ideals. The terms of agreement within the NATO sanctioned accords proves to be polarizing, leading to the formation of two separate teams bound to battle each other ideologically and physically. Spearheading these contrasting viewpoints is Steve Rogers and Tony Stark, and what begins as a calculated political dispute descends into violence and climaxes as an emotionally driven brawl between the two uncompromising men.I left the empty theater following the second after credits scene, satisfied and with a smile on my face. I had a good time. This is mostly due to the extraordinary spectacle the Russo Brothers brought to life remarkably well; the action sequences were superb. Few other films felt so genuinely "comicbooky" with such dynamic fight choreography and a sprawling battle sequence that seemed to perfectly encapsulate the two page spreads found in the comics that bombard the reader with so many super-powered heroics on display. Black Panther and Spiderman were standouts as new entries to the MCU, but every character was well utilized in combat. The blockbuster provided overwhelming spectacle with so many of our protagonists converging on each other simultaneously while also having a more intense and personal one-on- one fight that pleasantly surprised me with its relentless brutality.Humor played its role throughout the film's script as usual, and the comedic levity was well executed for the most part. Certain scenes here or there felt a tad bit too forced, but Paul Rudd's Ant-man and newcomer Tom Holland's Spiderman consistently delivered in this department and always left me laughing.However, a MARVEL film being comedic or action packed isn't news to anyone. The question of going beyond the summer blockbuster appeal into becoming something impactful, emotionally provoking, or resonating remains to be answered. And in my humble opinion, Captain America: Civil War attempts to respond to this better than any of the previous films comprising the MCU. Captain America's motivations follow the themes of comradeship and loyalty, while Iron Man wrestles with accountability and safety. The film presents a fascinating issue of responsibility but unfortunately declines to answer it in any conclusive way, which is where the film's shortcomings come in for me.The conflict's catalyst and core surrounds the topic of consequences yet the film is mostly inconsequential as a whole. Steve is still active and is shown freeing those that stood by him, Tony is up and about at the Avengers headquarters, Rhodey isn't completely immobolized and will probably suit up just in time for Infinity War, Bucky is taking a nice cryogenic nap rather than being prosecuted as a criminal, and the Sokovia Accords which gave birth to this conflict is entirely abandoned by the film's narrative in the third act. Of course not everyone got off scott-free, there's all the casualties mentioned in the first act and T'challa's father is dead, but in hindsight they all seemingly exist just to further the plot and are forgotten as signaled by that "uplifting" ending. Zemo is imprisoned. The bad-guy was defeated. Business as usual for the Avengers.As previously mentioned the action was visually great, but thematically speaking the Civil "War" aspect was astonishingly shallow and short-lived. The only characters with legitimate motivations are that of Iron Man, Captain America, and Black Panther all the others just seemed to tag along and the constant lighthearted back-and-forth undermined the stakes involved. The airport skirmish played out like a display of abilities rather than an uncompromising stand for their beliefs. Which is why I've come to appreciate the final fight between Tony, Steve, and Bucky so much more in the context of the story. There was weight in those blows, passion in their pain, and raw emotion and rage in Tony's eyes, and I wanted to see more of that tone.Contrary to the popular consensus, I actually did end up enjoying Daniel Brühl's Zemo as the film's antagonist quite a bit. His motivation and plan's execution were all well realized despite being a dramatic departure from the Zemo found in the source material. Hearing his wife's final and tragic voicemail multiple times humanized what could have been a very clichéd "you killed my family prepare to die" villain, and seeing him delete it in preparation for suicide was a nice touch. Having him actually follow through with the suicide, however, would have contributed to Zemo's resolve and the Black Panther's unforgiving nature but that's more personal preference and ultimately Baron Zemo is a solid addition to the MCU's villains roster in my opinion.Some gripes I had with the film included: &gt;there being a conveniently placed camera on the countryside road to record Bucky's assassination of the Starks&gt;how often is an airport terminal completely abandoned?&gt;Tony feeling guilty about the death of an aspiring young man, only to enlist an aspiring 15-year-old into his war moments later&gt;inconsistent power levels&gt;realizing that in Captain America's third film, I wholeheartedly side with Iron man and believe him to have more logically sound and compelling motivationsUltimately, Captain America: Civil War, despite many drawbacks that prevent it from reaching its full cinematic potential, is a solid superhero film. As a crowd pleasing and fun blockbuster, it passes with flying colors, but is not a "genre defining masterpiece". It has however taken the place as my favorite MCU film of all time and should be considered a great indication for good things being in store for this universe and this genre of film.Pros + great action sequences +humor is on point +Zemo is a solid antagonist +Spiderman is shoehorned beautifully into the movie +great premise and themesCons - inconsistent tone - inconsequential nature - completely forgettable score8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There was one scene that didn't make sense to me. (contains spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This review contains spoilers and yes I checked the "Contains spoiler" box for anyone that is accidentally reading this right now.Moving on...In the beginning of the movie, Scarlett Johansson is fighting this one guy and she gets knocked into a van. That guy throws a grenade in there where his other men are fighting her and the other men decide to keep fighting her even when they're about to die themselves. This scene made literally no sense to me. Why would the guards or soldiers sacrifice themselves to kill her and why'd the leader throw a grenade at his other men in order to attempt to end Black Widow's life?Okay, aside from that the movie was pretty cool and had a lot of good action scenes. I really feel that Scarlett Johansson's and Robert Downey Jr.'s characters really drove this movie. Black Widow and Iron Man whenever they are on screen really dominate the picture at the time. Chris Evans the guy that plays Captain America did the role well but he didn't seem to have as much depth as the other 2 characters I mentioned. I understand his character's dilemma, I just feel like Tony Stark and Natasha Romanoff were given much more development in this specific movie.I ended up going to this movie with my brother and his girl friend out of the blue. I had no prior plans to go, but it ended up being worth it to me for mainly the action scenes and seeing many Marvel heroes battling each other in a specific fight scene near the end. I feel that Spider Man doesn't really enter into the film until pretty late, but when he does make it into it the film gets a lot more humor added to it.I'm assuming whoever is reading this right now already seen the movie but if you haven't and you're still on the fence, I'd recommend going to see it. It's fun and even though some things don't make perfect sense, it's cool to see a lot of popular marvel characters duke it out between themselves.I give it a 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So, its finally here although not anticipated as BvS but it was anticipated to be better.The best part of the movie is direction by Russo Brothers, they have done a great job just like they did in Winter Soldier.It becomes really difficult in a multi starer movie to give every person there screen time and memorable moments, but Russo brothers have managed to do it for every character. The story is good, plot line is good , you understand why every character take there decision.And special thanks for Spiderman,finally he is close to his comic portrayal, talkative and funny. He is the Spiderman we need and deserve.Finally its time that Black Widow has its own stand alone movie.Go for the movie you will not be disappointed, its so entertaining and good you can go for second time.

		<fullReview>Once again I have a very good movie, which I loved, and I find myself being annoyed by the little bits that went wrong. OK, maybe not so very little, but still, most of the movie is superbly done. The acting, the pacing, all the technical aspects - every thing is first class. Even what I think is the core of all good comics adaptation - the moral debate around which the entire story revolves. What do you do when you can do almost everything, or in other words what do you do when almost none can stop you. To this very important discussion that many fail to notice because they pay too much attention to the magnificent action scenes and all the fireworks and the CGI. Another layer of moral debate is added, about the nature of all consuming revenge. And again it's done with full respect to matters discussed, not just superficially as an excuse for all the twists and turns of the plot. But then we arrive at the but, the unfortunate annoying but.Here goes: with all the scheming and superb planning, the ending works only if we get these very specific three characters locked together, like they obviously end up. But there's no way anyone could forecast that they will be the three arriving there, that they will be the only three arriving. I can't elaborate without adding spoilers and I won't but this means the stitches holding the plot together are all too evident - this film deserved better. When everything else is so perfect, the plot should be up to par and not the weakest link, and the plot is going all through the film, not in bits. Every time I think about it, I get angry again, and I did like the movie a lot. That's just plain shame.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Captain America Civil War is not a bad film it's just not the main event i was hoping for the first 30 with 40 minutes are so slow and it made me get bored, the whole film is mostly about Captain America being a jerk to every Avenger and him trying to save Bucky from everyone. Also Civil War and Dawn of Justice have a lot in common don't you think? Superheroes that love their moms, superheroes fighting, evil villain that does nothing in the movie and controls one of the main characters in order to fight someone else and of course it also has some differences Batman V Superman was Dark and Brutal this one? well it isn't but i have to give them credit for something Spider-Man was freaking amazing and i can't wait for his movie next year, Robert Downey Jr steals the show as the so called 'villain' and Black Panther was badass. I hated this whole thing with Natasha playing in both sides and The Winter Soldier kept boring me to death i expected the final fight to be as the comic for Cap to die or at least Bucky but nobody dies in this movie and it's definitely not tear jerking as some people said at least DC had the balls to kill Superman but Marvel and Disney didn't i like both DC and Marvel but Dawn of Justice was by miles better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Appropriately Action-Heavy and Vibrant; Overstuffed and Unfocused at Times</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An impassioned disagreement breaks Earth's greatest superteam in half and ultimately drives them to fight with more than just words. It's basically The Avengers 2.5, but you already knew that. And like the preceding two star-studded chapters, most of what makes it work is the thrill of seeing all the big names geared up together, slinging zingers and blowing dollars through the VFX budget like t-shirts from a cannon. It's a more serious take for the series, sober and steely outside of a few great jabs from the new guys (Ant-Man and Spider-Man steal the show on this front). Which is fine, it adds a necessary level of gravitas to the subject and it wouldn't seem proper for Iron Man to be going all tongue-in-cheek while he's trying to punch his buddy's eyebrows off. That heavy-duty weight can make the film feel long and overstuffed, though, and all told I was feeling a bit weary by the time it got around to wrapping itself up. There's a whole lot of action, as you'd have to expect, but this time it feels less grounded than in the past. It's as comic book as the MCU has ever been, really, with loads of Kool Aid-colored lights shining around the room, bodies flying through walls and one ridiculous chase scene in which our heroes sprint through traffic at highway speeds. And that's the focus, no doubt about it: action with a side of Bucky, whose quest for answers and redemption seems far more important than the moral dilemmas and personality clashes that split the Avengers. Personally, I was more interested in that lesser-explored gray area, but at the end of the day it's Cap on the marquee so I can understand the emphasis on his pet plot threads. It's a strong, solid entry and a fine continuation of this cornerstone franchise, but at times it tries to pull off too much. Could've easily been broken into two films, and I'm almost never one to recommend trying something like that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Captain America: Civil War" (2016)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Captain America: Civil War" is the second superhero film of 2016 to feature heroic super-powered characters fighting each other - the other film is DC Comics' "Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," which I have not yet seen. (On a side note: over the weekend, I watched "Deadpool" finally, which I thought was a refreshing change from the usual pool of superhero movies of late.)Joe and Anthony Russo return to direct "Civil War," which follows "Captain America: The Winter Soldier" (2014) and "Avengers: Age of Ultron" (2015). In a story that bears some fairly obvious parallels to the contentious debate over the current U.S. foreign policy of interventionism (and the role of the U.S. in world geo-politics as a whole), the super-powered superhero team the Avengers are divided, after their recent battles with evil have left much destruction and lost lives in their wake.So the Sokovia Accords are drawn up, which seeks to limit the highly costly activities of the Avengers in the event that they need to be deployed into action; Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr.) is for it, while his best friend and fellow Avenger Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans) is against it. Half the heroes side with Iron Man, the other half with Captain America; I never thought I'd side with Captain America ever on anything, but I thought he was in the right here (as well as in the original "Civil War" comic book story-line)."Captain America: Civil War" also marks the debut of T'Challa/Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman), the king of the fictional African nation of Wakanda, and who in comic book history is the first black superhero of any significance, and who later became a prominent figure in the Avengers himself. I'm glad to see that such a historically significant character got the proper treatment in Chadwick Boseman that he deserved. "Captain America: Civil War" also marks the debut of Peter Parker/Spider-Man (Tom Holland) in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, as well as introducing Scott Lang/Ant-Man (Paul Rudd, the film's most welcomed comic relief) into the fold, too.The movie, as a whole, works, even though the issues that it brings up regarding the role of superheroes in the 2016, post-9/11 world of today take a back seat to overly choreographed fighting sequences, explosions, and special effects. I guess that's the sign of what Marvel Studios/Disney expects that audiences want nowadays - less not more.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First thing first Civil War can be dubbed as Avengers: 2.5 ! Though I would rate Civil War several notches above the Avengers due to its sheer brilliance.The casting is spot on, the movie seems slow at the start, but that is because Marvel let the audience to build characters in their mind and that is the best part unlike DC wherein things are hanging mid somewhere ! You can actually relate to the difference of opinions on part of Captain &amp; Iron Man and they are ably justified. RDJ is shown a dialed down version of himself &amp; rightly so as its a Captain America flick after all ! Chris Evans is rock solid as Captain America and the bulging biceps as shown in iconic chopper scene is sure to give some new biceps workout vows ;)Elizabeth Olsen is almost there with Scarlet Johnson upping the hotness quotient &amp; soothes the eyes. Ant Nan, Black Panther &amp; Spider Man make interesting debut to the team but it is the Spider Man who steals the show irrespective of his hardly 15 Min screen time, in fact he should be a permanent member of the Avengers team in Infinity Wars 1 &amp; 2 !The showdown sequence at the Airport is just mind boggling and they have done that without vaporizing out whole cities &amp; crashing down buildings unlike Avengers:2, that is when you realise that this movie does make a lot of sense.P.S: Watch out for Stan Lee's "stank" cameo &amp; sit through end credits for a concluding scene ;)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining and silly at the same time while the writers manage to not make a mess out of this huge ensemble cast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Wow!! A Super-Hero movie" days are gone with one releasing every month and the interest levels getting saturated with the audience. In these times, the studios, artists and technicians are always trying to find ways to out-do each other, come up with something fresh and innovative each revision which sometimes work. Marvel seems to be a clear winner in the genre war against DC which seems to be imploding with its heavy-handedness continuing the strategy successfully used by Christopher Nolan in the Dark Knight trilogy. On the other hand, Marvel seems to have understood the pulse of its mass audience better and kept churning out blockbusters with relative ease - but not sure how long the same strategy works.The storyline is very close to "Dawn of Justice" and many other recent superhero ventures dealing with people's tolerance towards vigilante justice and accountability for collateral damage. After an operation to thwart a mercenary from stealing a bio-hazardous virus goes bad in Lagos, Nigeria leading to deaths of innocent civilians, the Avengers are held accountable and an accord is passed to give control of their missions to a UN committee. Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) and Natasha a.k.a Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) sees reason in this request and plays ball but not Captain America (Chris Evans). When a bomb explodes in the accords convention at Berlin, and Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan) comes out as a prime suspect, battles lines are drawn and each member of Avengers are forced to take sides.What Marvel is getting right in the Avengers series is the treatment - after all these characters and story lines are straight out of comic books. While they try to build mature character arcs and brings in a serious plot involving death of some characters, the treatment is still on the lighter note focused solely on quick and cheap entertainment. If a viewer takes especially this storyline seriously, there couldn't be a sillier premise with the two groups of Avengers fighting each other but not seriously enough to hurt each other. Another attribute that Marvel has been doing so good is how to write a script that gives enough screen time and importance to this plethora of characters.Starting with the technical departments, the special effects are slick and on par with other recent movies. A special credit goes to the writers for coming up with a smooth screenplay with so many characters each having their space. While it features some of the best actors that Hollywood could offer, there isn't enough in the script which requires them to play out of their skin. Most of the actors are veterans in this series who has established characters and mannerisms, so rather than indulging in their performance analysis - I would rather go over some new characters in the Avengers series. Chadwick Boseman as Black Panther doesn't come off as menacing as he wants to be without the costume, but the effeminate mannerisms with the costume makes it highly inconsistent. Paul Rudd (Ant-Man) has built his entire career on his comic timing and the writers have ensured they leveraged the most out of it. However the revelation has been how good Peter Parker a.k.a. Spider-Man (Tom Holland) has been integrated into the Avengers universe with lots of wit, charm and heart - which the web wielding audience favorite is know for. Overall the pace is brisk, the battle scenes of the actual premise is entertaining and silly at the same time while other action scenes are worth a watch, the actors seem to be having a good time and it shows in their performances. The makers have overstayed their welcome for sure with the repetitive gags and banter between their lead characters across multiple Marvel movies, I am not sure if I am ready for more of this.Entertaining and silly at the same time while the writers manage to not make a mess out of this huge ensemble cast.</fullReview>

This is not a kid's movie. It has very serious themes, detailed scenes of assassins, death squads, a whole air of bloodiness around everything related to the Winter Soldier.The second most annoying thing is actually the plot; the nonsensical and unbelievably one-sided tunnel vision view of Tony Stark of the pro-registration thing...But the worst thing (spoiler alert)(spoiler alert)(spoiler alert) (spoiler alert)(spoiler alert)(spoiler alert)(spoiler alert) You've been warned... The worst thing in this movie, was something very disrespectful, tasteless. Steve Rogers and Peggy Carter have been in love from the early days of him becoming Captain America. In this film, the director/script writer would have you believe, Steve and Peggy's daughter have a romantic thing going... Incredibly poor taste. Total disrespect for Peggy. Bad example for impressionable viewers.Anyway. Aside from that most irritating bit, the rest of the movie gets a thumbs up. Go watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is my first review so please be kind. Solid filmI just recently saw CA:CW and i will say that it was a pretty solid film as far as Superhero movies go. While i think that this movie was good cinematicly it did not bring anything really new for me. The first half of the film was the usually superhero formula of kicking but. I do like how the make everything tie all together making the avengers look like they were a danger to society, better than BvS with Superman. (Sorry i do not mean to compare the two, i know i sensitive people are with both fan bases. Though i will say there were a lot of similarities) The acting was great, I thought the inclusion of Ant- man and Spider man was a little weak, but it was great to see them. I did think spider man was a little bit annoying though. What was missing for me is the stakes were not high, there needed to be something that was lost but, i will buy what they did with the film anyway. The film really got my attention when the third act took place. No Spoilers. Acting was great as usual, the shaky cam sucked when they were fighting. Spider mans aunt was weird, cause she was attractive, but hey its something new. It was also weird that Cap got with Peggy's niece. I guess i he likes to keep it in the family. And i wish the inclusion of the bad guy was a little stronger, i was confused and who was who cause they all kind of had similar characteristics. I know that marvel and superhero fans will love this movie and consider it great as they will, whatever film marvel releases, but it was not the best marvel movie. It also didn't really feel like a Cap movie, it felt like a miniature avengers movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a first for me, a credited actor in the movie is not here on IMDb, so let me give them credit here in a small supporting role, but one that gets your attention - Stan Lee. By the time anyone reads this, he might be there, but as I write this, he is not credited.As for the film, there is so much script setting up this nearly 3 hour film, the first half has only small spots of action. In this case, I think the writers thought a lot of set up was needed because there are so many Avengers in the movie. I really feel it bogs this one down a bit. John Slattery, formerly of Mad Men, has a small role in this one, less noticeable than Stan Lee. The humor in this one in sporadic, and while there are some good laughs in the latter stages, it is strange that most of them are in the action sequences. The first half or more of the film is almost too dramatic for a Marvel film. The film actually brings in the United Nations after an action opener that makes the viewer think the whole film is going to be action. Spoiler- no it is not. Appropriately, some of the best jokes in the movie come late in the film including a great one delivered by Stan Lee. I will not spoil that here except to say Lee's role itself is a great inside joke.Even though the film is long, I did enjoy a lot of the small stuff in it. Ant Man and Spiderman are fun, and I like Tony Stark's comment about a young Spiderman's Aunt May, played by Marissa Tomei. This Aunt May is the best looking one I have ever seen.The plot uses the UN and the Avengers to divide themselves up against the bad guys and themselves. While the plot holds together, there are times all the infighting seems pointless. The blowing up of a UN building really seems pointless as there is not a real clear reason for it to be done, though it is explained it is to get the Avengers to fight each other. There is a question about a 1991 mission report that is referred to throughout most of the film, which serves in the plot as well as a couple of flashback sequences. It does a promo for an upcoming MARVEL film at the end, and George Costanza does not show up to date Aunt May in the movie. Would have been a nice touch though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good script saves a flatly filmed punch-a-thon (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a film that is basically a kid shaking a box of toys and going "pew pew pew", Captain America: Civil War (CA: CW) is really boring to look at. Marvel has a trademark "flat" visual style and it really takes away a lot of the punch from this film. There is only one really epic "comic" style moment that stuck in my memory: Captain America and Iron Man tussling at the end was taken directly out of the Civil War comic ... and it looked great. There are zero stakes in this film regarding the fight scenes. You know nobody will die. Everyone character has to be capable of at least holding there own. So there really didn't need to be that many of them outside of the huge battle royale and the final three-way fight between Cap, Bucky and Tony. Honestly, Batman vs Superman (BvS) is a better-looking film with way more style and visual flair. It's literally the single area it beats CA:CW. The music is also totally non-memorable. I remember going "whoa" in Captain America: The Winter Soldier when Bucky attacks Cap on the freeway, and his creepy Winter Soldier theme song kicks in. There is none of that here. IMO, they should have trimmed down the Crossbones terrorist attack, removed the Captain America / Bucky vs the police SWAT team fight entirely, and also trimmed down Bucky's Zemo-assisted escape scene. Honestly, the only thing which really stood out for me in this film was the script. I hated Age of Ultron (AoU) and BvS ... too many setups for future films and jumpy editing ... but Captain America: Civil War juggles a lot of plot-line and characters really well. The Black Panther and Spider-Man are introduced in a way that feels organic to the storyline ... they don't feel shoe-horned in like Wanda and Pietro in AoU. The most neglected characters (Black Widow, War Machine, Falcon, Hawkeye, Agent 13) get their moments. The movie is a little short on Captain America and heavy on Tony Stark, but not in a way that harms the film ... it just means Captain America gets less character development and is more of a stock "ultimate hero" guy. The bad guys are so subtle as to be almost non-existent. Conventional baddie Crossbones is killed after a single tussle with Captain America and Zemo is more of a James Bond bad guy than a Marvel super-villain. It's pretty ballsy and reminds me of the subversive way Shane Black used his villains in Iron Man 3. Also, the Howard and Maria Stark murder scene ... wow. They could have left it at Winter Soldier merely forcing them into a fatal car crash, but showing him beating Howard to death and then strangling Maria was an effective way to ratchet up the tension and evoke sympathy for Iron Man. The only downside is that you NEED to watch Captain America: The First Avenger, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, and The Avengers: Age of Ultron (bummer) to understand MOST of CA: CW. Watching Iron Man 3, Ant-Man and Incredible Hulk would also help.That is a LOT of referencing just to understand a single comic book film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thematically this film has similarities to rival DC Comics/Warner Brothers Batman v Superman. Who watches the Watchmen, sorry superheroes.This is the question asked in Civil War after a disastrous incident in Lagos involving Captain America and his team but the powers that be led by General Ross now the US Secretary of State that various incidents involving The Avengers either as a team or individuals has led to collateral damage. In short, innocent people have died.The film sets up a confrontation between Captain America and Iron Man and the various superheroes choose sides with new additions including Ant Man, Black Panther and Spiderman. Iron Man feels that there should be scrutiny or oversight by an external body like the UN. Captain America has concerns, rightly so after all he revealed Shield as being corrupted in the previous film and so nervous about history repeating itself.History does play an important part in the film. The Winter Soldier has history both with Steve Rogers and Tony Stark. Something just ripe to be manipulated by the film's villain Zemo who is planning the moves to pit the various heroes against each other.What the directors, the Russos get right here is a layered story with action pieces that are well paced. Some of the action sequences in the early part of the film are maybe too fast and frenetic with almost cartoon like action.The new version of Spiderman is introduced here and along with Ant Man they are there to add zippy humour and expand the Avengers universe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is how to do it, DC!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you see someone with a sad face coming out of Captain America: Civil War (2016; 147 mins), sidle over and whisper, "Are you a Warner Bros/DC executive?" If they answer 'yes' just be kind. I'd rather bathe in stinging nettles and marmots than have that feeling. Marvel, Joe &amp; Anthony Russo, and to some extent Robert Downey Jnr and Chris Evans, have pitted against each other two lesser characters (objectively speaking) than Zach Snyder's wasted gold dust and there isn't even a competition about which is the better film. Because yes, Civil War is as good as you may have heard. No, actually, it's even better than that. Where the recent DC films have struggled with consequences of actions, this is a film all about them. Some examples: if you open with a virtuoso action sequence that thrills and entertains without flaw then you're going to have to escalate throughout the film. Check. If you have too many heroes on your hands then you're going to have to write a brilliant script that introduces/involves/evolves them all in a significant way, so that the audience doesn't wonder why they're there. Done. And if you've done all this successfully before then you're going to have to do better. Mission accomplished. What Marvel have been especially good at is finding the right balance between humour and action, between levity and high stakes. In Civil War they have reached the apotheosis of this alchemy. The moments of tragedy and pathos that come from conflict between friends, not to mention other developments, mingle effortlessly with those of genuine hilarity, from all comers. It makes for a ridiculously entertaining mix. Similarly, the balance between action and dialogue scenes is pretty much perfect. When they come, the energy and sheer inventiveness of the former makes for a spectacle that never, ever gets boring. Each set piece utilises a completely different style and the ideas just never stop, with one particular motorcycle trick inducing gasps and cheers from the audience. The latter, the story, the personal conflicts, are superbly scripted and played out, and they ground the movie in something real. Civil War is fun, pretty much non-stop, but it is a long way from silly. There are serious matters afoot and the 'bits in between' are as gripping as the action because so much attention has been paid to each word, each glance. The cast, as usual, are exemplary, and we get bigger and better turns from Paul Bettany (The Vision) and Elizabeth Olsen (Scarlet Witch), while the introduction of Chadwick Boseman's Black Panther and a certain web-crawler brings even more to the party, and without diluting the mix. Special mentions, though, to Chris Evans (Cap) and Ben Barnes (Winter Soldier) who do a lot of heavy dramatic lifting; another one to Scarlett Johansson (Black Widow) because, well, I don't need a reason (she's excellent, though); but the big bucks do go to Downey Jnr, who is the best he has ever been as ol' Shellhead. In short, I loved this film. Even the two credit stings are ace, so do stick around</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Captain America: Civil War" Pits Two of MCU's Biggest Heroes in One Epic Confrontation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Marvel universe gets tenser with the most-awaited "Civil War". For what fans clamor to be a storyline that the MCU is building towards, here comes a showdown of Marvel's biggest properties."Captain America 3" starts off where "Avengers: Age of Ultron" ended, when the New Avengers, led by Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans), are cornered by international concern in response to continuous collateral damage. As a result, a governing act is proposed to the Avengers, fracturing the team to two sides, one led by Rogers and another led by Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.). But when a new threat is on the horizon, the team has to face the repercussions of their brawls.It is a huge help that the Russo Brothers returned to hold the weights of Marvel's Phase Three, after their spontaneous effort in "The Winter Soldier". Though "Civil War" may not be as solid as its predecessor, it is still a worthy addition to the Avengers storyline and Captain America's saga. Yet, it excels for taking a mature route that brings a compelling character study, a token from the first Avengers movie. Out of such character study is the major theme of vengeance. I am not going to give any more details about it. It is best to be seen and be enamored by how such themes are delivered with an affecting yet entertaining vibe.Kudos to the cast ensemble that all brought their A-game, even though some characters are not that fleshed out, or feeling shoehorned. Evans is at his most moving as the fading patriot who wishes the best for his team and loved ones. Downey Jr. is still what we expected from RDJ. Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow has a neutral but affectionate presence, despite her rather little involvement. The rest of the cast is great to see, with notable breakout performances from Paul Rudd as Scott Lang/Ant-Man/Giant-Man, Chadwick Boseman as T'Challa/Black Panther and Tom Holland as Spider-Man/Peter Parker. And Daniel Bruhl as Helmut Zemo is a better addition to Marvel's lacking lineup of antagonists. But despite the cast's collective efforts, there is an obvious battle for screen time with all characters. Thankfully, it was all salvaged as the two parties brawl in a cleared airport, in an exhilarating action sequence that will surely make every audience member cheer.For all the makings of a summer blockbuster, "Captain America: Civil War" gets it all started right. Besides being a loyal companion to the comic book storyline, it is a worthy setup to Marvel's other properties and one that truly can hold on its own, courtesy of its consistent superhero action scenes, the Russo brothers' tense direction, the excellent cast, its thought-provoking themes and its exciting story with its signature Marvel snappy dialogue. Let us hope for the best for MCU's future, including Tom Holland's "Spider-Man".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than the recent crop of superhero films, Captain America; Civil War looks at dilemmas many heroes face.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Captain America: Civil WarI saw this because it was 100+ degrees out,there was nothing else to see in town, and it got good review. So, a short review is in order.Pros: No Pepper Pots, No Hulk, No space aliens, (Head) Human villain played by Daniel Bruhl. No Thor. Spider man's acrobatics. Antman was cool, shockingly, Plot had some surprises, Trailer for Dr. Strange played by Benedict Cumberbatch, Black Panther kicks ass! Captain America is actually not a rule following, annoying, frat boy, kiss ass in this one. Cons: Rhodes in an Ironman suit. What a self-righteous prick. Spiderman's dialogue and childishness, Hawkeye is a waste of time, Wanda the Witch is misused, Vision was NOT a sight to behold, No one died in all the fighting, The plot has big holes, if you care to look, a dearth of decent female superheroes, a weak origin story for Black Panther, Set up had flaws like the fact that no one admitted that without the Avengers, things would be worse. Push: Wanda still a cool character even if out of place, Black Widow also seemed out of place here, Special affects sometimes special, other times, not so much. Rogers is still Captain America. Rating: Matinée There was enough entertainment and an actual plot to bring out the characters. The final battle was not overblown, and while the middle battle was, it was still fun. An actual moral dilemma present in a superhero action film is refreshing even if it is too simply presented.Now, can we have Spiderman and Black Panther join up for a movie without all those other clowns? Call it, 'Good Friends Defeat Umbrella Corp', or some such thing. Peace, Tex Shelters</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wanted to love this movie so much, when it ended I liked it, thats about it. I personally prefer story over action, and this movie is mostly just action scenes. Don't get me wrong! The action scenes were amazing! But that is about it... The story was so simple. "I'm mad at you." "Well, I'm mad at you too, lets fight." Whenever the characters were talking instead of fighting, it was just the same argument every time. The film had weak dialogue but made up for it in action. Black Widow seems to be more of badass in every movie. I found myself wishing Scarlett Witch would go away every time I saw her on screenI loved the new Spidey, but Black Panther stole the whole movie for me. I was clapping and cheering every time he showed up on screen. Baron Zemo was yet again another waste of a potentially great villain. Overall, I enjoyed the action but it did not live up to my hype and it is very far from a favorite in the Marvel series.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best movies of 2016</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is one of a kind, this is probably the best superhero film i have ever seen. Many Superhero fans have been waiting a very long time for this movie, and it delivered what it promised, just from the name it will get you interested, the style of the movie is intriguing itself. This movie is about Captain America (Chris Evans) wanting to help his friend Bucky (Sebastian Stan), even if it means crossing the law. The way they introduced Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and Crossbones(Frank Grillo) was amazing and fights between superheroes are not seen very often and i would always recommend watching this movie, but what makes this movie so great? let me tell you, this is my opinion why this movie is awesome. So the movie starts off with with a great introduction. The introduction is followed by an awesome fight with Crossbones, i wasn't expecting much from him, but overall they started it the best they could. Soon after that Tony Stark (Robert Downy Jr) is introduced and wants to stop the Avengers from doing what ever they want and wants them to abide to the law, because the destruction and deaths of innocent lives. Captain America, Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie), Clint Barton (Jeremy Renner) and Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen) don't agree and think what Iron Man is doing is wrong. They go against each other, with Vision (Paul Bettany), War Machine (Don Cheadle), Black Panther, Spider Man (Tom Holland) with Iron Man's statement that being able to do anything as a superhero is wrong and dangerous.I found myself at the edge of my seat by the time this movie ended, like most other movies. This movie is worth watching! easily one of the best movies of 2016, I hope you found my review helpful. Remember this is just my opinion.</fullReview>

CapAm should get a room with his bro right away and don't be sad Ironman, it take turns. I have no idea what Dr.Watson is doing there. Nice jail by the way.

		<fullReview>This is the best Avengers movie as of yet.Yes, yes, I know it's not officially an Avengers movie, but it feels like one. It's chocked full of Avengers, amazing action sequences, hero on hero conflict, a lot of quips, and some good character development sprinkled here and there.However, it also feels like a sequel to Captain America: The Winter Soldier. It works off a lot of those same themes, and it was directed by the same guys: the extremely talented Russo Brothers.I'm kinda glad Whedon is done directing these movies. He's a talented man, don't get me wrong, but his talents are much better suited for Buffy and its ilk. It's pretty clear that he's a TV guy through and through. There's a lot of overwriting going on in Avengers 1 and 2, causing the scenes to take too long and the plot to not advance as fast as a movie plot should advance. It's all right for a good director to be self-indulgent, but while the Russo are self-indulgent in an upward direction, Whedon is self-indulgent to the side, which is good in TV but not so much in film. Yes, I know the Russos have done a lot of TV work too, but they don't feel like 'TV directors' to the extent that Whedon does.There are less quips here, and a lot of the ones they do include feel like they benefit the story more than the quips of Avengers 1 and especially Avengers 2. A good chunk of them are delivered by or about Spiderman, who I am glad to see in this film. He's the best movie Spiderman by a good margin. What a lot of people forget is that Spiderman is supposed to be a dorky teenager. His invention was a way of saying, "Yeah, all you awkward comic-book reading teens, you can be superheroes too." I don't know how I feel about watching a whole movie based around this kid, but I love watching him and Iron Man play off each other. There's a 30 year age difference between Tom Holland and Downey and it shows. I also love his interactions with Captain America. I can see Cap being like an older brother to him if all this fighting stops.And it is an if. The story, of course, is that the Avengers are divided by an act that would requite superheroes to basically put themselves under the control of the UN. Over a hundred nations are in favor of it, as are Stark and most of the Avengers. Captain America is the outlier, but he refuses to move, and we're in for a Civil War. The UN wants to neutralize Bucky, especially after he supposedly attacks the conference in Vienna where the Act was signed, killing the king of Watanga in the process. Cap wants to help out is friend and free him from his mind control. By the end of the story, a lot of the mess has been resolved, but the deep ideological differences that started up the whole conflict in the first place are still there. I have all the respect in the world for the Russos for doing this. It makes it feel like what happens in this film really matters, a problem that Avengers 2 had a hard time trying to solve.Of course, when Thanos comes to town, the heroes are gonna have to band together, but I hope what that time comes, it's done well. The Russos are still directing, so I don't really worry about that, but it is a legitimate concern. The war this film most resembles is not the American Civil War, but World War I. And how did that end? In the Treaty of Versailles, which directly led to World War II. While I hope the Avengers don't end up in a World War II, I also hope not everything gets nearly resolved.The best parts of these movies are the Avengers themselves, and this film seems to get that, as it has its villain stay out of the spotlight and put the focus on the Avengers, and said villain's scheme has a lot to do with watching the Avengers fight. It's more than enough, particularly when the conflict between Avengers is made interesting and complex. The addition of Black Panther adds another wrinkle to the fray, as he really isn't on Cap's or Stark's side. It's complex, interesting, and completely entertaining.</fullReview>

Insect guys were great..I mean ant man and Spiderman..Spiderman is just a teenage boy..but Tony Stark can convince any one..not a big deal. Antman becomes faint man and his grown up powers u can watch further in Jack and the bean stalk. Scarlet witch powers are all purple purple...don''t ask how she got her powers. Even powerless fighters like black widow picks up fight. She is least occupied bcoz she doesn''t have to sing and seduce with the hulk. Besides, it has one of the best action sequence seen in any superhero movie so far. On the tech front, the movie scores full marks for its outstanding CGI and visual effects. In short, a film not to be missed!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Captain America movie franchise has come a long way. Ever since Winter Soldier, when you first notice a change in the delivery pattern. It was now Cap 2.0. The actions were how you would imagine a superhuman would fight. With Civil War, it maintained that same tone and vigor. It was a fun ride to get hyped together with the internet with those memes speculating on how the war would broke out between Cap and Iron Man and when you finally get to hear the real reason on screen, I was like "Ohh, okay... I am feeling this". You understand what those characters were defending, it was not just out of greed, pride or for their personal gain but from what they, as their own experience and sense of honour and justice feel and they hold on to that and thus the dispute. Black Panther was so good. While watching the movie with my brother, I keep telling him "Oh man, can you believe this, that's Black Panther, that's him, they nailed it". He was my absolutely favourite. Chadwick Boseman was phenomenally perfect in that role, marvelous casting there. And coming to Spiderman, I know a lot of people out there said this before and I will say it as well, 'BEST SPIDERMAN EVER!'. He was great. The humour was there, the spider-man persona was well captured and executed. Well yeah, in the end. It's a Russo brother movie, it's great. It's amazing!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Captain America: Civil War is a fine entry in the MCU. I use the word 'fine', because this definitely is not a game-changer. First the good stuff: The character motivations are well drawn (it is actually hard to pick a side), the overall story is tight, the performances are generally good and there are some truly emotional moments. Spider-Man and Ant-Man are awesome. However, when you look at the number of superheroes involved in this film, you expect to find something extraordinary. Unfortunately, this isn't the case, except for a couple of bright spots.This film turned out to be exactly the kind of film I didn't want it to be. It's inconsequential, however much it may try making you believe otherwise. Also, this movie follows the same formula both Avengers movies have followed till now: Bad guys fight good guys, good guys fight among themselves, good guys fight bad guys again. The villain is again weak. The action too, which felt fresh in The Avengers and The Winter Soldier, feels a lot been-there-done-that (except the airport scene). Black Panther felt somewhat shoehorned in the film. It's fun, but not as much as The Avengers. It's engaging, but not as much as The Winter Soldier. You know, in a movie with almost a dozen superheroes, when you come out remembering only the scenes which featured two of them in cameos, there is certainly something wrong with the movie.People hate on BvS a lot and are comparing it unfavourably to this film. While BvS surely had its own flaws, the good moments in it were absolutely breathtaking. And it dared to be different. This one, not so much, inspite of a more serious tone than other Marvel movies.PS: Spider-Man: Homecoming is the most I'm excited for a Marvel movie now, besides Doctor Strange.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was fun. Now, I know that doesn't sound amazing. And it's not. It's not amazing. There are flaws. Plenty of flaws. But you know what else there is? Fighting. A lot of fighting. Way too much maybe, I mean damn. You got... you got Spiderman, right? Spiderman's hanging off War Machine and... and then Ant-Man goes giant or whatever and... like... um... Black Panther, y'know? He stabs people and jumps from car to car... and the Winter Soldier, like, gets on a motorcycle while it's going... and Captain America holds a helicopter... and... and... yeah. God, this film was fun. Of course, the fun factor can only get you thus far. I mean, sure, it was well written (dialogue wise), well choreographed and it had Spiderman flying around Giant Man like-- sorry, sorry, got a bit excited there. Alright, so... what does this film do wrong? Well, it has a lot to juggle. You got way too many characters, way too many plot points and it gets weird. It does the best it can with the 56+ characters it has, introduces a new villain, and has a big manly testosterone man fight. And the intro sequence is very fun, too. But some of the characters feel off, considering the dark tone of the film, which, by the way, was WAAAAY better than Batman V. Superman (Aaaaand there's the obligatory jab at Batman V. Superman), characters like Ant-Man. Why in the hell does Ant-Man join Cap's team? Why does Iron-Man need Spidey for? He's got Vision in his team. Goddamn Vision, dude, the guy can fly, shoot lasers and go through walls. And maybe read minds, I'm not sure. And there's the villain, which comic readers will immediately recognize, but they seem underdeveloped to any casual moviegoer. Because they are. There really wasn't much time devoted to them with all the stuff going on. Hell, there wasn't even a big bad fight scene. Besides Loki (who wasn't that great in the first place) the Marvel movie villains haven't been that great. Most of them were guys in a business suit (Iron Man 1, 2, 3, Winter Soldier, Ant Man) and Ultron, who was pretty stupid as well. The big point of this film, the reason behind the "Civil War" (odd way of saying it, they kick each other in the face for fifteen minutes. Kinda like how the Age Of Ultron lasted like, what, a week? A couple of days?) is this discussion. Or at least, that's what they lead you to believe in the trailers. No, the reason why they fight is much different, the Hero Registration Act or whatever it's called kinda stays in the background. And there is a lot to discuss there. Stark says the Avengers need to be put in check. And they do. They can't just run around like they own the world. However, had the Avengers not been there the last three times, way more people would've died. It's an annoying discussion. The characters fighting feels rushed, too. Maybe if they sat down and talked it out they'd fix it in 20 minutes. Without broken bones. Especially in the final fight. Also, is the Winter Soldier really compelling enough to make two movies focusing on him? Overall, the good outweighed the bad. There was still bad in there, don't get me wrong, but I'm not grouchy enough to let that get in the way of Black Widow kicking people in the balls. Black Panther for life, by the way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great, but overburdened</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I definitely liked Captain America: Civil War: the story touches on some important issues, the action is top-notch, and it has a couple of really great character moments. It still doesn't qualify as the best Captain America movie, let alone MCU movie (that's still Winter Soldier), simply because I think it really would have done better with a couple of trims.One of its biggest problems was in my opinion the whole plot line regarding Zemo, which for the most part felt like an unnecessary red herring. I do concur that, in the end, it added a nice twist to the movie's main topic of the rift between the Avengers, and it did lead to the final (and worthy to be called "epic") showdown between the Cap and Iron Man, but for the most time, it simply distracted from the eponymous "Civil War". A stronger focus on the Avenger's internal conflict, its reasons, and its repercussions would have done the movie good.The second biggest problem is the over-full cast of heroes. Even if we ignore that someone who hasn't seen every other MCU movie before Civil War (I luckily have) will have a difficult time to comprehend who all these people are and what the heck they are doing in a Captain America movie, a bunch of the characters simply don't add anything meaningful to the movie, except maybe filling up the roster of "Team Iron Man" and "Team Captain America". Especially Ant-Man (despite his huge role in the team brawl at the airport ? pun intended) and Spider-Man seemed pretty much unnecessary. I do understand the importance of Spidey's cameo in this movie to bring the character "back home" into the MCU, but his drawn-out introduction felt completely out of place and made the story grind to a halt for almost ten minutes. That said, I was impressed that they managed to give almost every character well developed and insightful moments and their time to shine. Black Panther was an interesting addition, and I'm looking forward to see what they will be doing with this character in the future.And maybe to point this out again: for the general audience, which didn't follow the MCU slavishly, large parts of this movie must be incomprehensible, due to the sheer number of different characters and allusions to events in the past MCU movies.Anyway, for MCU fans, Civil War is definitely a treat, and - due to its importance for the future of the MCU - an unmissable addition to the series.</fullReview>

It's true that Marvel has been doing great so far, but I think they are kind of losing their touch. 1. what was good: the fighting scenes, the actions scenes, Spiderman and Antman jokes, Captain's overall presence, young Robert Downey Jr special effects. 2. what was mediocre: I haven't read the comic and I cannot know if they respected it, but the whole plot didn't seem powerful enough to justify a massive collision. Which was more of a Step-up dance-fight than a civil war. I was expecting a global war between them and I was only served with a 10min airport fight (in 2h30 movie), with mostly insignificant scratches. 3. what was bad: was there any music? they could have revived these 5 super winter soldiers and make a mess, instead they were simply put to sleep. I'm fed up of Spidermen reboots. Spidey was T.Maguire, the rest I don't bother watch. The way they brought in Spiderman and Antman was even more forced than Wonder Woman in BvS.Movie was entertaining because each character is likable, but other than that feels a lot like filming before writing it. Marvel once again fails to deliver a worth remembered sequel</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Video Review for Civil War! Excellent but flawed.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Captain America Civil War was a flawed Masterpiece! It has everything I could ask for with Spider-Man and Black Panther being great new characters. Iron man and Captain America having amazing motivations to be fighting. Every character feels so down to earth and real in this Marvel movie. There are a few things I do have problems with though. This mostly points to the fact that the movie does feel a bit too crowded in the beginning. The villain is pretty lame, feels like that type of villain that just sits around, doing stuff from his laptop, and not really feeling that intimidating. He also just feels unnecessary. I also don't like how Marvel is not willing to take risks with their characters. I am not the best typer so if you'd prefer to check out my movie review on youtube instead here is the link.

		<fullReview>Civil War has awesome Avenger action. Strong character interactions. Spidey and Black Panther were definitely the highlights of the film. Crossbones looked great but was underutilized. Zemo.. another underdeveloped villain.The airport scene will probably be the most stand out scene of the film. Even though this is a Captain America movie it sometimes feels like Avengers 2.5. I still really enjoyed Captain America Civil War. Even though Zemo wasn't that great, it didn't ruin my overall enjoyment of the film. Some of the story elements were meh. Civil War is by far my favorite Marvel movie to date!I would give Civil War an 8.8/10 or a B+.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed Batman versus Superman so much more than this movie.This movie just felt terribly unoriginal, boring, and the same old stuff I've seen over and over again.Nothing interesting about the plot. More of a showcase of all the characters, leaving the dialogue absent of anything intriguing.Great special effects, it's also fun to see all the new characters interacting. Had a good take on Spider-Man.Out of all the Marvel movies, this was one of the weaker ones. Better than Ant-Man.But no where near as interesting as Batman versus Superman.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bloated effort falls short of its predecessors</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like the vast majority of the movie going public this weekend, I suited up for another go 'round with the mighty MCU. Outside of the first 'Avengers', the 'Captain America' films have been, for me at least, the best of the MCU to this point. First Joe Johnson delivers a fun period piece that, like its title character, builds its muscular action around an enormous heart. Then the Russo brothers craft a sleek, smart homage to the political thrillers of old in the exceptionally well made Winter Soldier. Now comes Civil War, also by the Russo's. If it's not quite on the level of the first two Cap films, it's miles better than the most recent solo efforts of 'Thor' and 'Iron Man'.For all intents and purposes, this is really just another 'Avengers' film. Only a few players sit this one out (Thor, Hulk) and while Cap is a central player, he's not the main character. That's because there really is no main character. Like 'Avengers', it's an ensemble. Cap may be 1A, and the friendship between he and Bucky the main dramatic thrust, but "Captain America" is a bit misleading.This is a movie packed to bursting; with ideas, with story, and most certainly with characters. It's a bit bloated at times, lacking the laser-sharp focus of its predecessor. It never gets as unwieldy as 'Age of Ultron', but that's a backhanded compliment to be sure.New characters were the big buzz going in, and they deliver. Chadwick Boseman has the charisma and physical goods to breath life into a character I knew nothing about and I look forward to his solo effort. Tom Holland (the seventeenth Spider-Man in the last decade, or so it seems), makes a big impact in his relatively brief screen time. In fact, his Spidey was like a B-12 shot here, waking the second act from its lethargy. The fact that he's an actual teenager really adds an important intangible to the character and it should be fun to watch him grow into the role.There's a lot of really good stuff in here, unfortunately it just never flows as smoothly as I'd have liked</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Is captain America civil war a perfect film? No, but it is so close I can nearly taste it. This movie had me smiling from start to end.I never seen a group of directors balance such a large cast so effortlessly, it still amazes me as of right now. Let me tell you that if you were a little bit worried about spider-man or black panther, then I can safely tell you that Tom Holland maybe the best Spider-Man yet. The action was really great, the story was pretty well written, and all of the characters came together and a Perfect Blend that will make even non comic book readers be filled with joy. The only thing that I could see which wasn't so great in this movie was the main villain, but overall everything worked in this movie and I am really glad I went to go see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flawed, but still a great superhero film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(SPOILERS)Captain America: Civil War is one of the best Marvel movies and superhero movies to date. It's not particularly groundbreaking story-wise and, at times, falls prey to formulaic nature of the previous films in the MCU. If you're not a fan of the Marvel universe, this film won't change you're mind. However, if you are a fan, I don't see any flaw strong enough to incite dislike of the film as a whole. It boasts every element that fans love about these movies: the action, the humor, the interesting and entertaining character interactions, etc. Despite the title marketing Civil War as another Captain America movie, it's much more reminiscent of the Avengers films. The focus is spread evenly among both Cap and Iron Man. Both sides of the ideological warfare are shown, with no clear- cut "these are the 'good-guys' and these are the 'bad guys'" element. Both sides are attempting to do what they believe is right. Even the character of Zemo, who is more or less the villain, has a clear and understandable motivation for tearing the Avengers apart. Each character is given just enough time to shine and, more importantly, each character is feels relevant to the main story. The action is entertaining and filled to the brim with wit and creativity. The airport scene is easily the best superhero brawl ever on-screen. I loved the dramatic tonal shift during the third act. The battle at the airport was largely a big comedic skit, with each character seeming to have a fun time fighting each other for the most part. However, a series of events including Rody being injured and Iron Man finding out that Bucky was responsible for his parent's death lead to the final fight between Cap, Bucky, and Tony to be an epic, intense, and almost dead-serious climactic clash. Despite all these great aspects of Civil War, the movie has it's downsides too. I have two major gripes:1. The lack of character death takes away from any palpable tension and feeling of possible consequences. This isn't so much a problem specifically with Civil War, but for entire superhero genre. Major characters don't die and, if they do, they won't stay "dead". I ranted about this in detail in my Batman V. Superman review, so I'll keep it brief here. For a movie that is supposed to be a game changer for the franchise, I would think that at least ONE major character would die. Just ONE. Is that really too much to ask? On the bright side, they didn't pull a "Batman V. Superman", by pretending to kill off a character, only to bring them back in the cheapest way possible. Characters simply don't die. War Machine, who I think we can all agree isn't super important in the franchise, is wounded, but, of course, doesn't die. Don't worry; he will be back in the next movie. Even though I am strictly against judging movies based on loyalty to source material, I can't help wondering why they decided not to kill of Captain America like in the comic books. As awesome as the final fight scene was, there was very little palpable tension for me as I know that neither Iron Man nor Cap would bite the dust in the end. Even if Rody/War Machine had actually died, that would have at least created some sense that there are actually stakes. Nope. Everybody survives and everybody is friends again in the end. Yay. 2. The cinematography is, for the most part, bland and unmemorable. Both Avengers movies had "the one" long shot amidst the action that stood out, showing all of the Avengers kicking ass together. Civil War doesn't have this. They missed a golden opportunity to have a long shot of all the heroes fighting at once. As the fight is about to begin, we get a nice, long shot of all everybody running at each other, but just as they are about to clash, the camera cuts away and begins showing brief tidbits of two individuals fighting, followed by another shot of another two fighting, and so on. There is never "that one shot" that stands out. Don't get me wrong; that entire sequence was great; I just wish there was more to cinematography. Obviously, there are plenty more Marvel films to come. Heck, "Phase 3" is only just beginning. However, thus far, Civil War is the best of the bunch. In my opinion, it's the best Marvel film we've had yet, and the best superhero film since The Dark Knight.</fullReview>

I loved this movie and when you finish it, you'll be begging for more. The suits were also enhanced to give it a futuristic type of look to give more style points to the epic action of the fight scenes. Overall, the battles are amazing, the suits are awesome, the characters are great, and the movie is amazing. This is what the movies are all about. This is why we have movie theaters. This is why the MCU is the best. You can't ask for a better, more emotional movie than this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When Captain America: The Winter Soldier came out I fell in love with it immediately, so when I heard the Russo brothers had signed on For Civil War I knew it was going to be a great movie, but not this great! I don't even know where to begin, alright I guess the beginning is fine! So Captain America and the New avengers are trying to locate Crossbones and his men. When they do S**t goes down! First of all the fighting it choreographed Very well and Second of all the heroes find some new and creative ways to use there powers and It's awesome! But Scarlett Witch "Accidentally kills" Crossbones and the government doesn't like that. So the whole Accords act happens and friends are divided! So Tony recruits Spiderman and Cap recruits Ant-man, and do we get a surprise from him! GIANT MAN!!!! It was unexpected, funny and downright awesome! After they all fight Cap and Bucky get away and Tony finds them. They form a truce until Tony finds out Bucky killed his parents! And the fight was amazing!!! I guarantee you if you go see this movie you will not be disappointed! Best movie of 2016 so far, maybe even the best superhero movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More of an Avengers film but still worth watching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I heard the title Captain America: Civil War, I reluctantly thought it was going to be the Marvel version of Batman v Superman: Dawn Of Justice and I am glad to say that it didn't compare (in a good way).Whilst BvS struggled to portray the building animosity between the two title characters, Civil War did a fantastic job at splitting up the beloved Avengers and ending in an epic final battle. Which brings me to my next point ? it didn't necessarily feel like a stand-alone Captain America film and it become more akin to another Avengers installment instead (sans Thor and The Hulk though).Another qualm I had was the fact that Elizabeth Olsen's Russian character Wanda had somehow lost the terrible accent that we heard in Age Of Ultron and had become an all-American Avenger. Whilst not having to endure the horror of it again, it still didn't sit well with me that they chose the easy way out.The film also introduces a few new faces: Tom Holland as (yet another) Spider-Man and Chadwick Boseman as Black Panther ? we can expect two new stand-alone films for these guys in the near future.All in all, it was an enjoyable, action-packed saga and with all of its CGI glory, my eyes wouldn't budge from the screen.motherofpopcorn.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>CONTAINS SPOILERSCivil war wants to be taken seriously. The stakes are high. Thousands of people have died due to events in previous movies. And it's all the fault of the Avengers. Scarlet lady feels bad about killing a dozen people for about 5 minutes, Tony Stank wants to sign a document that will guarantee that they don't smash a single building next time there is a threat, not even if the alternative is the planet being destroyed.But really what this film about is kicky kicky, punchy punchy, smashy smashy, between friends. The film utterly fails to explain why someone like hawkeye would intentionally try to murder his friends with his arrows. The action is ridiculous. Some of these people seem to genuinely trying to kill each other. Over what? Failure to sign a document? A disagreement in the beyond reasonable doubt guilt of a prisoner?The film fails to explain why these guys, after going through hell together previously, even have a reason for the kicky kicky, punchy punchy, smashy smashy.Somehow the mastermind of this whole civil war plot managed to turn the avengers against each other by stealing VHS footage of Starky's dad being murdered by Bucky. He lures the best friends into a silo, shows them the VHS footage, then mic drops. The entire scheme was about his assumption that Tony Stark and Captain America would not be able to reasonably use language to settle their differences rather than try to murder each other, so of course, buildings will be smashed, roads will be torn up, innocents will be terrorised.On the plus side, the acting is pretty good. The action is fine. The special effects are excellent, spidey was fun, but without a story that makes sense, it all falls flat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining, but quite lame superhero movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Captain America: Civil War is quite entertaining, but empty superhero movie. Somehow I don't understand, why they have named it to Captain America movie? Iron Man is as least as predictable in this movie, that it could be Iron Man movie as well. It is better to call it Avengers movie. Movie is quite long (2,5 hours). It has inflate to almost too big. Somehow it feels, that it won't take too long when audience starts to get bored to these superhero movies. It has too many characters to tell well enough any of them story. It feels like presentation of all Marvel's superheros more than a decent movie. The story won't actually start and end nowhere. It is very entertaining thou and you easily spend 2,5 hours with it if you have enough candies, popcorn and soda to flush it all down. Movie has filmed in 3D format, but they won't get almost anything out of it which is quite surprisingly with this kind of digital effect movie. Primary movie leaves quite empty feeling, even it has a lot of action. Lee Falk's cameo is nice surprise at the end of the movie. At least it is his legacy to Marvel. Entertaining, but quite lame superhero movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie but not Amazing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm going to try to write this review without being bias as a comic book fan.Going into this movie I had high hopes from the trailers but I quickly realized most of what you see in the trailers is the big action sequences in the film. It hurts it as the movie becomes quite predictable. You're literally sitting there going "Oh, I know what comes next" through much of the film.I did however enjoy the comedy that is present in every Marvel movie. It was done well in this one and the inclusion of Spiderman and Ant-Man really helped. I also enjoyed the movie more once Hawkeye came in as he really did well in Age of Ultron and repeated that in Civil War. For me the comedy was a plus factor and helped keep the movie about a 5 rating.The biggest fault however was near the end of the film. After the comedic battle between Stark's Avengers and Steve's we learn that Baron Zemo(who is nothing like the Baron Zemo you expected) is going to wake up a team of genetically enhanced super soldiers much like Bucky and Steve to presumably do battle with the Avengers and bring the world to it's knees. Sounds cool right? Might see all the Avengers team up to duke it out with a team that supposedly has the power to kick their rears! No, that doesn't happen. Instead Zemo has already killed them when our heroes consisting of Bucky, Cap and Tony arrive. We're then treated to an all out battle between the three with Cap winning. What exactly was the point of even mentioning the super soldiers? That is mainly the reason this film only gets a 7 from me. I hate when movies fall flat at the end and this one did.</fullReview>

My big-boy personality was brought up by all the cool armor stuff. And since then I watched every marvel superhero movies in the cinema. 8 years after it. I'm still sitting in the cinema watching Captain America III. The whole scene is even better than the avengers, gathering new team members and enhance the old. Even Spiderman get re-made. The scene at the airport is awesome and clearly they have way more budgets than dead pool. But I'm not getting excited any more; all they do are just hunting villains saving the world and people are still stupid enough to live in the super crowded cities waiting something bad happens. Maybe the only one who changes is Tony; he used to be a typical playboy and gradually grown up into someone thinks of the society. 8 years later, Tony's boyhood is over and so do I.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Captain America not so righteous and Iron Man out for vengeance.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Do not read the review if you haven't seen the movie and planning to watch it without any spoiler. )So I went to watch one of the most anticipated movie of this year and as always I am disappointed with another Avengers movie. Yes, though the title is all about Captain America it's actually one of those good old Avengers movie with few added characters and a surprise package. Frankly when all my friends are going gaga over the realistic characterization of superheroes and their so called ego clashes and moral complexity, I sheerly judged the movie on the basis of partiality and stupidity of the characters. The secretary of states decided Avengers are too dangerous to act without a supervision so they decided to clip their wings by bringing them under the UN panel. Tony Stark who already going through a relationship crisis with Pepper Potts suddenly has got his conscious awaken by one of the mother who lost her child in Sokovia incident (Avengers: Age of Ultron).The outcome, Tony Stark and few others like Black Widow, Vision and few decided to sign and join under the UN panel. Captain and his trusted men revolted back and We have a civil war of Superheroes. The entire movie is all about Captain America trying to save his childhood buddy Bucky Barns aka Winter Soldier thus inflicting the anger of Tony Stark as he gradually getting p***** by Winter Soldier starting from trying to kill him, his best buddy Rhodes gets injured inall these mess and in end finding out that Barns actually killed his parents. I mean though his brain was fried by HYDRA and he did it under the brain dead situation, still I feel he should be the one be in the confinement cell where Stark and his boys tried to put him.So starting from saving his fugitive buddy to making out with his ex's niece Peggy, to me everything look so immoral at least to standard of Steve Rogers/Captain America. We learned more about the childhood issues of Tony Stark and also that Vision have emotion too.The only character shined in them is surprisingly Black Panther/T'Challa, he was a truly a breath of fresh air.All I want to see a good old-fashioned comic book heroes taking on the bad guys, not always fighting among themselves which slowly turning into a cliché. Oh and honorary mention of Spiderman making an official entry to Marvel and Ant-Man joining Captain America's team.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but not great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just got back from seeing this movie. As is usual when I see a hyped-up film like this, I wanted to look at what others had to say after I'd seen the movie. I usually don't write reviews for a movie unless I really liked it or really hated it. However, upon seeing all of the glowing reviews, I felt the need to say something.I feel as if many times people give a movie great reviews because of the hype associated with it. Very rarely do I find a movie that actually deserves an overwhelmingly good review. This movie doesn't fulfill my requirements.I liked this movie, but it was nothing special. It had the potential to be something else if they had stuck with the plot from the comic more. Instead, it seems as if the writers, directors, or whoever used the basic story and took the liberty of rewriting the rest. I'm generally fine with that because everything doesn't translate well across different mediums, but this was a little too much.My main issue with this movie was that I agreed with Steve a lot more than Tony while I watched it. Why is that bad? Because I didn't agree with either more than the other when I read the comic. I thought both sides had good arguments to present, but I didn't swing one way or the other. In this movie, Tony clearly was the one who was wrong. He started out fine with the reasons for signing the contract. Then, it's like he was turning a blind eye to what was going on. He was "protecting" Wanda by keeping her under house arrest. Maybe that was true, but it felt like he was trying to convince himself more than he was trying to convince others. Then, he refused to listen to Steve when he described the plot involving the other Winter Soldiers. The fight at the end was the last straw for me. I know he was beyond angry with Bucky for killing his parents, but he let his anger get in the way of taking down the bad guy. Thank goodness Steve ended the fight in a reasonable manner. Tony's behavior just bothered me in this. I didn't always agree with him in the comic, but I rarely did in this movie.Besides that, the movie was worth watching. The actors are always a delight to see. I wasn't in love with the casting choice for Spiderman. Something about his acting rubbed me the wrong way, but I guess he was alright for the minimal screen time he got. The action sequences were cool, especially the chase involving Bucky stealing a guy's motorcycle. Civil War is an overall neat flick, but it takes a lot more than that to earn a raving review from me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Civil War is a good movie. There are great heroes, a nice twist in the end (don't worry, I won't spoiler anything that's not already known from the trailers), a bad guy with believable motivation. However, it also has some flaws: At 2,5 hours it feels too long - after one hour the conflict between the main characters didn't even started. It has too many subplots and way too many characters - and especially Antman and Black Panther, this male version of Catwoman, are simply ridiculous compared to the other heroes. Overall it feels like watching Avengers 2, which had similar problems, a second time. It's a good movie, but it can't compare with Iron Man 1 or Avengers 1, the best Marvel movies so far. I think I also liked Captain America 2 slightly better - although this one has Ironman in it - because Captain America 2 has more focus on it's story and not so many characters. This one feels more like X-Men than like Captain America.</fullReview>

I had read the comic previously, and they still managed to somehow make it a similar but different story at the same time. The best thing about the movie were Spiderman and Black Panther, and let me tell you that I've never been a huge Spiderman fan, but I really liked him in the movie, and his next solo movie is definitely in good hands. As for Black Panther, I didn't really know a lot about him until this movie, but he was an amazing surprise to me and I can't wait for his next appearance. The writing was so good that as a Marvel fan, it was really hard for me to choose, and even after seeing it, I still don't know who was right. Maybe the only bad thing about the movie was the villains, specially Crossbones, because he barely got any screen time, and I feel like he deserved more as I thought he was finally fully developed. Baron Zemo wasn't the best but he still was very good, although he was necessary for the film and his first steps in the MCU. However, I liked the movie so much that I forgive them those mistakes. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Captain America, CIVIL WAR: "You Just Started A War!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rating: 8.7, Awesome Movie*The most anticipated movie in the MCU has finally landed in cinemas, and boy was it entertaining. However some comic fans may find disappointment scattered throughout the conflict, knowing that it had the potential to be the greatest comic book movie. That being said I can guarantee that Avengers, Infinity War Part 1 &amp; 2 are in safe hands thanks to our MARVEL directors the Russo Brothers. P.S All the heroes, including Hawkeye were amazing in the movie so I've only selected a few to brush over.*Characters - Captain America: Without no doubt Steve Rogers is the heart of the story and the hero of the conflict. His actions and behaviours towards the right of freedom win the audience's attention on who's side to follow. - Iron Man: As much as we all love Robert Downey Jr.'s Tony Stark, over the course of the MCU he has evolved to become an even bigger ass towards his fellow avengers. Yet this corrupted hero does serve us well as a secondary antagonist. Speaking of which... -Zemo: A simple villain with simple motives had so much potential and yet ended up wasting it. Crossbones could have easily served as the main antagonist. - Vision: Paul Bethany's Vision is the wisest avenger on the team and gives both his fellow avengers and audience a true understanding of both sides of the conflict. - Spider-Man: Peter Parker has swung his way into the MCU with a web of hope. Although we would have loved a surprise, Tom Holland's is a bright talented actor who is sure to bring our friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man to life in his upcoming movie Spider Man, Homecoming. - Black Panther: Lets end on a high note... Black Panther is no doubt the greatest thing about Civil War. This feline delivered the dark side of a hero that MARVEL was in dire need of. His motives, suit and fighting scenes are all perfect, Looking forward to his movie!*The movies plot is a great and powerful one, with humanity in fear of the Avengers capacity to control the situation they encounter and our heroes are forced to take sides between what I call 'American Freedom' and 'Iron Justice'. While in the mean time Captain's wanted friend Bucky Barnes the Winter Soldier has also been put in the crosshairs adding to the conflict at hand. Although the movie was more of a Civil Battle rather than a Civil War, that being said the team fight was a nerds dream and the final act was an emotional one. However they have missed some great opportunities.*SPOILER! In the comics Captain America gets a fatal shot with a sniper rifle by Crossbones in the end of the Civil War. Not the other way around! Even War Machine could have been killed off, proving the movies message, "that conflict can breed to catastrophe." DC Comics knows how to involve death and emotion in their movies unlike MARVEL, however I think we can all agree that Batman V Superman, Dawn Of Justice (6.5) was rather disappointing. Nether the less Civil War was an entertaining but not a perfect movie.To any followers or MARVEL fans reading this please check out my lists and ratings at riyork2! I hope this review was a valuable source for my fellow Avengers!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Talk about overrated.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed most of it, i mean i thought Cap and Bucky were great, the action scenes were well done(though sometimes the camera was too shaky) and very fun, had a few nice laughs, and Spiderman was great. Though it felt extremely formulated, and took no risks. The score was beyond generic, and it was filled with annoying conveniences that were only there so characters won't die, also it had way to much humor and humor used in many of the wrong parts.And if you were wondering which side I'm on, I'm definitely team Cap. Before I saw the movie i was team Cap, and after the movie I was SURE i was team Cap. Ironman, even though I thought he had some great scenes, didn't have many good points on his side. And what his character does in the 3rd act of the film was stupid as f*ck. And only convinced me more he was a hypocrite. And oh how shi88y was that ending? Lol, it literally felt like the ending of every other Marvel movie. Especially the previous Cap movie, Winter Soldier. Which I personally prefer to this</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun, movie but not as great as people are making it seem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not bias. I like DC and Marvel. I honestly like BVS better than this movie, and thought Winter Soldier was way better too. This movie felt so lazy honestly. I think people are just obsessed with Marvel, and their cheesy/corny one liners in every scene. The villain in this movie sucks, and it's all about making them split up or whatever his goal is, due to his loss. I watch every superhero movie, regardless if it's DC or Marvel, and like I said BvS is way better than this movie, and had me more interested in the story and plot. Winter Soldier had the same effect on me. I think the majority of obsessed Marvel fans are just liking this movie because it's Marvel and the characters, but if you take the time to look deep in the movie, you will notice at the very end, what the heck was the point of all this. Black Panther was the only character I was interested in seeing, and he barely got any screen action. The movie should have been called Team Iron Man or Team Cap. A. Some of the fight scenes also look so cartoonish, I don't know what that was about. The conflict between all of them seems very stupid to me, since there has been all sort of cities destruction, and killing in every movie, and now they want to address the same bs again in this one, by showing what someone can do when they take someone they love from them due to war.Other than that, if you're just looking for the same ol' Marvel cheesy/corny one liners, and action go see it. It's a fun movie, but not one I would go see twice, as I did with BvS, and Winter Soldier.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was quite underwhelmed by CA:CW. For starters, I found the story vacuous and that the motivations leading to the conflict did not to strike a chord with me: so much so that I could no longer remember them anymore on the following day!Yes, combat scenes are impressive and daftly edited for a brisk pace, but they are so plentiful - and the characters so many - that occasionally it gets complicated to work out who's fighting who and exactly why.This, in fact, may well be the main problem with CA:CW - there's now so many heroes with so much back-story in other movies, that the whole thing is beginning to collapse under its own weight.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Marvel film to date</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Should The Avengers be nationalised? This is the controversial idea running through the film, tearing the superheroes apart and into a "civil war". It is interesting to note that the two blockbuster comic-book movies which were released just weeks apart- Civil War and Batman vs Superman- each have a similar thread. They are both about collateral damage and a guilty conscience splitting those who would normally be on the same side. The key difference is that Captain America: Civil War is a far more engaging and enjoyable affair.After a disastrous campaign in Lagos, the majority of the world's states have had enough of the Avengers' vigilante actions. By signing the UN-drafted Vienna accords, the group will surrender their independence by coming under government oversight and control. However some of them, led by Steve Rogers, will simply not have it. In an ironic turn of events, it is the privately-funded Tony Stark who is flying the flag of nationalisation while being opposed by the government creation of Captain America.This leads to a hugely enjoyable set-piece at an airfield which pits superheroes against other, akin to an all-star game that actually matters, and answering thousands of playground arguments of "who would win in a fight between x and y?". Despite the serious political theme and the battle of ideas between The Avengers the film has a wittiness to it, helped by funny turns from Ant-Man and Tom Holland's debut as Spiderman.Civil War is not perfect- it is slightly overlong- but the clashes between the characters meant something and unlike Dawn of Justice you understand why they have turned on each other like this. In short, it's the cinematic superhero showdown you always wanted.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good but could be better.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, i'll like to say that the movie in it self is a good movie, although it may lack of a more objective point of views.I'll start with spiderman, his better than expected, and provided the movie with a little freshness, therefore plus to spiderman, but not not to the CGI-suit that is horribly done. Antman on the other hand isn't that good, he's boring just like the Antman- movie.Now to the actual problem; Ironman vs Captain America. Both sides have equally good counter argument for whether or not to sine this Sokovia peace document. But it does not really show what it means to side with the Cap, to put it more directly, The Cap's actions for doing the right things doesn't cost enough casualties and the Ironman side doesn't sacrifice as much freedom as they where afraid of. to sum it up, this movie doesn't make it clear, that the problem is about the document, and not the kindergarten-hunt for Bucky. This movie, focuses too much on Ironman, and is leaving a feeling that you have to take his side.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's many flaws that added up during the first half of the movie, but the second half really made up for it. Adding more several new main characters in a sequel can be a hard thing, and there's quite a lot of plot-armor for the main characters and a few plot holes. However the second half wasn't flawless, but it was an incredible experience to watch that part. If i could rate the first half and second half individually i would rate the first 3/10 and second 8/10, but overall it was a nice experience that could arguably be 6/10. However I'm setting the score on 7. The final score might be what it is because i am slightly biased.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mixed feelings - Could have been much more</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is worth a watch. The build and story is slow and quite boring. Fight scene were good except for the big showdown not enough was done. Spiderman and ant-man stole the fight. Scarlet Witch would appear anywhere. They threw in a mini fight between Hawkeye and black widow which was.....well out of place. Vision was mostly kept out of it which begs the question what was the most powerful ally of iron man doing? And the jokes so many jokes. A few wouldn't mind but it's constant and takes away from the epic showdown that could have been. I'd compare it to a looney toons.Captain America and Bucky escape fight and scene was awesome. And the end trio fight was bordering on epic. No stupid jokes full on psychos stark trying to kill Bucky and cap trying to stop him. Loved it.Zemo was extremely underdeveloped. The keeping him mysterious didn't pay off for me. He seemed too small of a fish for what he caused. Used in many ways with no explanation and puts a few plot holes into the movie. He was a convince for the movie.Iron Man seems mentally ill, in need of a psychologist and suddenly turns into a willing puppet for the government until the end. The CGI on his suit when he has his mask off is terrible like Spy Kids 3d terrible.(I'm being harsh here).Black panther introduction to the universe perfect. On point. Easily the best thing to come out of this movie.Overall fights and choreography great. Story apart from black panther no so great. Villain very weak.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As exciting as a senate hearing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Captain America: Milking the Franchise.There are rumors that the Hollywood movie industry manipulates the IMDb ratings (this is going to get me banned so I might as well stop typing) and the score for this movie does not in any way make these rumors less plausible, en contre, I am now convinced it is so (this is my own personal opinion based upon no facts whatsoever, even tho the facts are there to be checked, I claim no knowledge of such undeniable facts). Plausible deniability - Check.Ever since my long days of boredom in all my years of school, I have wanted to experience the ultimate experience in boredom. I'm talking about the kind of boredom that stops time. I looked long and hard, I signed up for boring jobs, got boring friends and went to boring parties. You know the usual stuff. Nothing could scratch my itch for boredom. I had to go deeper, and deeper I went. I was looking at the UN website trying to find a nice boring hearing of ca 2 hours and 27 minutes, which happens to be the length of this movie, but I couldn't find any. Earlier I was looking into US senate hearings on some boring subject such as Foreign Relations, yummy I always wanted to be bored to death on US relations to some backwater Kingdom somewhere in the middle of wherever. BUT, I found this movie instead and boy oh boy was I BORED. This hit the spot! I'm amazed at how bored I was. I wanted to walk out, but the boredom had propelled me into an out of body experience where I could not control my body, I could only watch my self bored literally out of my skull sitting there bored. This is like bored-ception.Anyway, now I no longer owe Satan 2 hours and 27 minute of my life time due to that bet we had a while a ago.What about the movie and the things that were happening in the movie? Surely the action was good at least? Well, if you've been in a coma for the last 100 years, then the person watching your comatose body for 100 years would be less bored than watching this movie. To illustrate the action: I have seen cars before, so when someone comes at me with another car, I'm not impressed. The action in this movie is an excellent mid-range car that will ultimately not turn any heads. You have seen the action done better somewhere else. But, if you are a boredom affectionado like me then you have to watch this movie in 3D. Now you can be bored in three dimensions!There was some kind of moral message, that we should always do something that is not the wrong thing even tho it might appear to be not the right thing to others at the one before second sight and friendship as well... Also civilian deaths were like maybe not bad but not really good either? In the end I wanted everyone to die to spare us the rest of the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is so boring the most exciting thing that happened during this time was when the two attractive girls stood up next to me, almost 30mins in, and never returned.The movie is a long winded emo dialogue with a few weak action scene's and bad attempts towards humor. While all other movies seem to sort of get back to a higher standard... This one must be one of the bottom movies. I honestly could've without wasting my time sitting through this garbage.There is truthfully nothing interesting going on all the time. The dialogues, the "inner struggles", the tension between the comradery and loyalty. It's a hollow shell that has been a huge missed opportunity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found this movie to be quite tedious. Fight scene after fight scene separated by slow parts of dialog. Some parts were funny and well written, but the entire movie is not well written. I have seen most of the Avenger movies, but still did not recognize all the characters or know their back story. This is the typical action movie where the government is stepping in to shut down the action figures. Just like in Bourne, Bond, and Mission Impossible. Must be written by Republicans who think all government is evil. Can't we have a different threat or bogey man? The real bogeyman here is not that interesting and has capabilities way beyond a his stature in life. And, how many superhero movies do we have to sit through where superhero fights superhero. Hey they are indestructible so why keep fighting? The scenes just take up space on the screen and add to the CGI budget. The fights don't advance the story at all. There was four adults who saw this movie in my group, and all of us could hardly wait till it was over.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Marvel ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't do anything else but rushing to the nearest theater for the earliest screening session once Captain America: Civil War is out. It's easy to understand, especially after such a huge impression Winter Soldier has made 2 years ago. No doubt about this: Russo brothers have boosted the super-heroes fighting scenes onto another level. They have it all: The timing actions, the intensity yet no lack of humor and charm. But Civil War has brought something more to this party: the complicated, spinning-round-and-round heart and mind of every single character once they have to choose a side. Anyone could relate to Iron Man or Captain America in this situation. For the first time ever (since the birth of MCU), I can really feel the deepest pain from the past of IM and CA, the devastating memories that still keep haunting their daily life, the crucial reasons as to why they keep fighting and it reveals quite a lot about what they consider top-priority in their life. This revelation makes them more human, and really adds another layer to this superhero super-franchise. And I can't say it otherwise: This is simply pleasing.So go and catch this movie. It's a masterpiece to behold. I guarantee.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will keep this short and sweet - as a good fan of the marvel films this had to be one of the worst. As other reviewers have said there was too much to pack into 1 film and hence it was disjointed, dumbed down and frankly quite boring. I re watched the winter soldier the night before to refresh my memory and that was a great film likely from a great plot and simplicity of the low number of characters etc.This 3rd instalment was a bit of an pseudo avenger 3 mess with such a weak flimsy plot and an enemy you couldn't care less about.A few jokes wouldn't have gone amiss.Shame on the scriptwriter and directors.Normally not so aggrieved but had to quite literally apologise to the non marvel fans I went to the cinema with at it was that poor.</fullReview>

I don't blame them, I mean its been years and years since the last big great blockbuster has been shown in cinemas and they forgot what a good movie should be.Action: 9/10 Drama: 0/10 Story: 2/10 Character: haha Dialog: if it wasn't for the "hilarious jokes" there wouldn't be dialog at all, so 1/10.It was fun and fast only because of the action and nothing else. It's strange how you can make tons of money just by filming action and only action these days. I don't know, I prefer movies with a story, plots, twists, subplots, character depth, meaningful dialog, good music. To connect with something, not just with my pop-corn and soda. I can do that anytime I want for the love of god.To me this movie was bland, shallow, just entertaining to kill 2 and half hours and thats about it. The actors are great, I give you that but they don't make the movie great.It's like Marvel is on a loose feeling safe and secure with their huge fan-base and not putting enough effort into the films anymore. Hell, even BvS was better than this one.Anyway 5/10 due to the action and the actors, other than that would've been complete failure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Captain America: Civil War was my most anticipated movie of the year. The MCU movies have made a great setup to this movie and Civil War was everything I wanted it to be and so much more. I had extremely high expectations and this movie even blew those away. This movie is AMAZING. Everything about the movie works and it is put together so well by the directors and writers. The story pretty much follows how the Avengers experience conflict and a rift is formed between Captain America and Iron Man. We all know that the cast would bring their A game to this movie since we've seen them as these characters so many times by now, but I feel they brought their A+ game to Civil War. About the new characters, Chadwick Boseman as Black Panther is awesome. He is a very interesting guy and he is so entertaining during the action. Tom Holland's Peter Parker/Spiderman is very likable. The thing I liked about this Peter Parker is that you do feel sympathetic for him because you really see that he is just a kid in high school fighting among grown men. This Spiderman is terrific.The story moves at a very fast pace and is both thrilling and vastly entertaining. Despite all that happens here, the movie is really at its core about the relationship and conflict between Captain America and Iron Man. The whole promotional things are about the teams but the movie focuses in depth on these two, and that is great writing. The teams don't really matter anymore because you will be able to see that both Captain and Stark have clear motivations for what they're doing and that they're both correct in certain ways. There really are clear motivations and reasons for why Captain America and Iron Man have to fight. As for everyone else, you also understand why they choose a certain side. The movie is so emotional because it feels as if the MCU has been building up to this.The action in this film is phenomenal. There is so much action and it is all done so well. That airport scene from the trailers is AWESOME. The chases and fights are so exhilarating and I was just gripping the seat handles not knowing what would happen next. All the battles between Captain America and Iron Man are gritty and bloody. These guys are really fighting to kill here. I have to say my favorite action scenes were the ones with Black Panther and Spiderman.A lot of people are complaining about the villain Zemo and saying he is "shoehorned in." I understand why they'd say that but I definitely think he was a necessary part of this plot and just like with the others, his motivations are clear. Daniel Brühl does a fairly good job in the film.Captain America: Civil War takes everything that worked best in the previous MCU movies and builds on them. I do think this one is the best MCU film so far and the Russo brothers have proved for a second time that they know how to direct these movies effectively. I can't wait to see what they do with Infinity War. In my opinion, Captain America: Civil War is the best superhero movie besides The Dark Knight.Captain America: Civil War gets an A+.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Brilliantly Refreshing Place to Take the Marvel Cinematic Universe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now that is how you make a superhero film. After 12 films, it seemed unlikely the Marvel universe could create something so refreshing and new, but Civil War does just that. It's impeccably paced, exhilarating, heartbreaking, and just outright fun. Captain America Civil War is one of the greatest superhero films to be put to the big screen.Civil War sees the return of most of the usual suspects from the Marvel films, with the exception of Thor and Hulk, and sets the universe in a new direction while also honoring what came before it. The Captain America 'trilogy' should be considered the most unique trilogy of all time. Although, for all intents and purposes, this film is essentially Avengers 3. Yes, the story is always focused on Cap and Bucky, but it is just as much a Marvel Universe film as a story about two best friends from Brooklyn.The Russo Brothers are thankfully back after Winter Soldier and they pulled off the impossible with Civil War. There are so many characters, plot-lines, and things that need to be set up, and it's handled wonderfully. But they also direct action maybe better than anyone in Hollywood right now. Much like Winter Soldier, the action in Civil War always hits at just the right time. The airport scene will go down as one of the greatest superhero fight sequences of all time.Newcomers Black Panther and Spider-Man were brought along and implanted seamlessly. Chadwick Boseman and Tom Holland play the two characters brilliantly and instantly get me excited to see their solo films within the next few years.Each character gets their time to shine. Scarlet Witch is fully realized and Ant-Man, Falcon, and Vision bring the witty Marvel one- liners that they have become known for. As much as this film is deeply rooted in psychological emotion and tough character choices, it still retains the humor that keeps the film from ever reaching grim areas. It really puts to question, how much better can superhero films get?I haven't even mention Hawkeye, Black Widow, or Bucky/Winter Soldier who all get incredible moments. Does anybody not have confidence that the Russo brothers can balance 60 something characters in Infinity War in a few years? Overall, the Marvel Universe and superhero films in general, have a new level of greatness to live up to. Perhaps more time will give me perspective, but for now, Civil War is my new favorite Marvel film.+You understand both sides of the coin+That Airport scene+Builds on what came before, and sends the universe in a refreshing direction+Still a focus on Cap and Bucky+Black Panther and Spider-Man steal the show+Maintains the fun tone amidst an immensely emotion film.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I walked into Civil War with high hopes and dreams that almost all were reached of my high standards. There were some idiots in my cinema who complained they didn't know who Crossbones or The Winter Soldier were (they had not wanted to see CAWS and only came for the avengers) so If i sound angry it is because of those idiots who demanded marvel should have explained the characters for people that didn't see the others. Okay so this isn't an adaptation of the comics AT ALL. The one thing that upset me was that Crossbones was killed in the first few minutes of the film (unlike comic civil war were he kills Cap with Agent 13). Now Tachaka is in the film but is killed off early on to motivate Black Panther witch is good. The main antagonist of the film is Baron Zemmo (or just Zemmo as instead of being a Hydra agent and all that stuff, his family died in Sakovia as he is sakovian) he tries to take down the Avengers by making them fight each other. He is mysterious and overall a good bad guy for Marvel's standards and could possibly come back one day with the purple mask as for once he is not killed off. The best parts of this film were Spiderman and the fight scene. Spiderman is young and a bit of a beginner but never the less he is interesting. And he jokes around a lot and also fan girls over Buckeys arm. The middle battle was awesome with great characters and great stories, especially Spiderman and Black Panther. Another BIG part of this was Giant man and the AT-AT reference I did not think they were going to make but they did it.I was upset Black Widow betrayed Team Iron Man. Even though the 3rd act is emotional it has lost a lot of steam from the action pact events of the 2nd act but is emotional non the less. I like Chris Evans as Cap any day but the most emotional thing I think they could have done for Starks character was for him to kill Bucky or Cap in the end. The movie ends with Cap going into hiding, featuring two end credit scenes including Cap putting Bucky into chryosleep in Wakanda and a Spiderman set up. Over all this was a good film and probably the best movie in The MCU to date with amazing Directors and writers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dear Marvel, Thanks for showing us incredible moments all these years,no one will forget all those beautiful memories "Marvel" has given us since childhood. I am sharing my personal experience.May be I am the only one who believes this, and may be there won't be a single person to back me up, but even though, you need to know there is a guy in this world who thinks this way. I was devastated when I found out "Joss Whedon" has left MCU (after Age of Ultron). And I totally understand if you have issues bringing him back.What my concern is, "Russo Brothers". I am a big fan of these guys,they directed a few episodes of TV series "Community".But this is no TV episode. This is the fate of "Infinity Wars". I know for sure that DC's "Justice League" will nail it. I just want "Marvel" to be as awesome as them, even better. I don't want to offend anyone but you need to make the right choice for this.Totally your decision.The decision of bringing in "Jon Favreau" was amazing(Marvel always does amazing stuffs like these) but another great choice right now will be (since Joss Whedon is gone), to get rid of "Russo Brothers" once and for all.Hand over the entire project to "Jon Favreau", and he might be the guy who beats "Justice League". We already have "Bryan Singer", "James Gunn" and "Tim Miller" kicking asses.No one remembers "The Winter Soldier" and "Civil War" will be forgotten soon.I care about "Infinity Wars" too much,I can't see this getting blown to hell. And, this will happen if "Russo Brothers" get involved even a tiny bit.So, please .. pretty please. Regards, Anonymous Fan</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I couldn't sit it through.And why the heck is it called Captain America, when it is not even about him?There are again too many superheroes and not enough time for everybody and the little time is wasted with boring talk.I have nothing against interesting talk, but this was not one of that.It was another Avenger crap.And they had to jump on the bandwagon and had to make it about how the Avengers kill everybody around them by "saving the world".Duh...! We know it since Batman v Superman that you are sorry. We don't need to talk about it in every superhero movie from now on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best super heroes movies of all time...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Captain America trilogy must be one of the best trilogies ever made. I am not a big fan of sequels, and usually the sequels do not outperform their predecessors, in my humble opinion. There are a few rare exceptions of course, like Captain America: Civil War for instance. After the disastrous Batman vs Superman that left a bitter aftertaste, time had come for something more refreshing and engaging, and I must say that Captain America Civil War delivers the goods. It has everything one would expect from a movie...dynamic superheroes with awesome abilities, story, momentum, and the question we ask as to what happens next, which keeps our attention on the big screen. I watched this in the theater and not a soul stirred during the 2.5 hour duration of the movie. All the characters in this movie played out their roles with precision and realism. The fight scenes are excellent (at times funny) as each superhero is matched up against someone else but the seriousness of the fight scenes builds to a crescendo which leaves us with a very satisfying climax to the movie. I have seen most of the Marvel movies in recent years but this by far is one of the best superhero movies ever. You might want to watch Captain America: The Winter Soldier again as this is somewhat of a continuation of where that movie left us off. Overall, I give this movie a deserved 10/10 as this is of the best super hero movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marvel's Next Great Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the beginning of this movie you are automatically on the edge of your seat. The first scene is super intense. As the movie progresses the audience is left pondering over which side is the side to root for because this isn't your typical good vs. evil, but rather freedom vs being caged and being government puppets. When black panther, Ant man, and spiderman all appeared the audience started to cheer. Ant man and spiderman both brought the lighthearted comedy to the movie while panther made you question all the grudges that you hold on other individuals. In the end Cap was left to choose between Bucky and Iron man and in the end chose Bucky. It was a tad bit upsetting because you realize that the Avengers might be diminished, but once Cap sends Tony that letter you know that everything is okay between all 12 of them. The most upsetting out of everything was probably when war machine fell and became paralyzed. The only downside was that Tony Stark wasn't Tony Stark. He was his usual self but rather a more adult like character.....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marvelous Triumph</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just came back from a screening... I am trying so hard to think about ways to nitpick my way out of it. but this movie is one of those rare achievements that can juggle between being so gleefully exiting, serious, tense and foreboding yet remain so cohesive and committed to it's narrative. I had high expectations, the Russo's didn't even care about my comparatively lowly expectations, because they had their own. this movie is the overachiever of the MCU, it brings you the goods, and THAN SOME. everyone has their glory moments, but at the heart it's an epic dispute between friends, idealists and pragmatists. what's amazing is that it's not only a struggle between Cap and Iron Man (and also Bucky) it's their own internal struggles, and that echoes in all the characters. it's actually the newcomer who come on top of it all, and that is Black Panther who is easily one of the most well put together heroes I've ever seen come through such a short introduction. he along with Winter Soldier get to make choices you wouldn't assume a comic book character would, choices that get into resolutions through unconventional means. Spiderman is a glorified cameo, I gotta admit he is, but good god Marvel is in so much swagger they can get away with it! Tom Holland finally nails it and you know why? because he doesn't try so hard to be a silver age impossible nerd ala Maguire or the market approved "millennial" Garfield Spider-Man. you just look at him, and he totally naturally IS that nerd, you believe he is Peter Parker from Queens and you believe he is Spider-Man. the beginning of the movie sets the precedence for everyone incredibly well and it's all just a natural progression that gets into the airport. now the airport fight was so amazingly choreographed, everyone gets to do something absolutely amazing and it had so many moments straight out of... yeah, I know it's been chewed out that line "straight out of a comic book page". I've heard that said before, and I think it's arguably true- this might just be THE best or at least the most grandiose fight ever to put on film between superheroes. Civil War even beat Batman V Superman in what BVS set it's goal to be- CW is way darker at the heart of it's conflict, it touches dark violent history behind some characters and thematically it approaches dark material with incredible maturity, a maturity BVS's infantile teenage like angst attitude couldn't approach. the climax is tense, it holds no reservation about how violent the clash between our heroes can escalate into and it makes us understand everyone, even our villain do what they do. Civil War is a triumph, it shows us just how far Comic Book movies can reach when they put their A game into it. it also shows that absurdity and nuance are not oil and water. we should all celebrate this triumph, we earned it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Have you seen that old movie, The Empire Strikes Back?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What are 'stakes' when it comes to super-heroes? How do they function when it comes to protecting people over the world and saving us from the enemies? What if there's destruction? How can people be trusted? Or, more philosophically, can the heroes trust themselves if they have to live with the deaths at their hands (or can they)? So many questions are at the heart of Captain America: Civil War, the sort of sequel-cum-culmination of a lot of plot threads and emotional stakes that have been set up since Iron Man 1 in 2008. It feels earned, and it's hard to not think of the immediate comparison of the other big super-hero beat-down of this year, Batman v Superman. Those comparisons could last all day, but I think it's also apt, even more-so, to think of this as a criticism of X-Men Last Stand, which was another film that had super-hero "registration" as far as being under control and the different factions that pop up and sides taken as far as who is right and wrong and the grey areas.But where that film felt too cluttered by characters, Civil War is not. It very easily could've been, and it's easy to see it as not only are characters from the Iron Man and Captain America series here (Pepper Potts is out and Peggy Carter passes on early in this film, but that's fine, less potential clutter). But there are also additional characters from other movies (Ant-Man) and even a new character, a friendly neighborhood kid from Queens (you know him if you saw any images in the past month for even a nano-second, it's not as if the internet does a good job of keeping things on the low-down, it's Spider-Man), and yet everyone has a purpose, every character of some significance is given time to have a conversation and to talk about things so we know where they're coming from (i.e. Scarlet Witch and the Vision even do, which is a great couple of scenes), and so on.The Russo brothers do a fantastic job of keeping things emotionally speaking with Rogers and Stark clear and yet complicated; we know that the deaths of so many in an explosion at the start of the film weighs down on Rogers (though perhaps we don't see it as much), while for Stark it's thrown in his face every other moment of every day, and the turmoil is there on his face all the time (though Downey Jr is such a gifted actor as to show it just enough and to modulate the turmoil so that it comes at striking times, all of it in the eyes, it's really one of his best performances of his career). So as this goes on the plot keeps going as well, with Daniel Bruhl playing a variation on a character in the comics (who I'm not familiar with but it doesn't matter) named Zemo.This is an interesting villain and one of the better ones in the series (not Loki or Ultron level great but close), as he is *just a guy*. He's not some ultra criminal mastermind - though he certainly knows how to set up a mass explosion - but he is also someone who is another person who has the vast well of grief and vengeance from people he's lost (family but also just, as he says, "everyone") from his home in Slovakia. It's a good performance from Bruhl too, not too over the top (close to it but more realistic), and it's a play on past conflicts from other MCU movies. Yet here it makes its mark more because, well, this time it's more about how to tear up the super-heroes by doing it from the inside, which itself is reflective of SHIELD being taken down by Hydra in Winter Soldier and the seeds of doubt already there in 'Ultron'. It's a pretty strong creation for this particular movie.This is a very operatic type of movie - The Empire Strikes Back gets name-checked and it almost feels like a bold statement, like 'really, did you just make that even in a jesting manner in this big bad-a** action sequence at this airport - but damn if it doesn't try and possibly does live up to that standard of blockbuster excellence. It's a lot of fun though, there's lightness and quips and jokes and moments visually, filmmaking wise, that makes this something that will entertain you if you're only looking for surface thrills. And at the same time I found a lot underneath, and what it all leads up to makes things devastating for the characters. It's not perfect - I have parts I can pick at as far as a particular character's fate following the battle, and a speech given at a funeral scene is so on the nose that there's barely a nose left to see - but it's about as good as mainstream action spectacle gets.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Although is good , it's really over rated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's really nothing new here besides a bunch of superheroes fighting another bunch superheroes. it has really cool fighting scene , especially the one in the airport ( probably only because all the superheroes there ) , besides that there's a lot of clichés and plot holes. I don't know if it's only a coincidence or not , but there's a lot of simmiliarity plot with Batman v Superman. Personally , i think BvS has make more sense plot than Civil War ( not that because i'm a DC fanboy ). If you're a "movie-goer" in general , not just some marvel/DC fanboy you'll probably gonna find this movie boring because other than the over-hyped fact that there will be a lot of superhero fighting each other there's really nothing good about this movie. MAJOR SPOILER AHEAD !- The plot is almost exactly like BvS , it's basically about the consequences of superhero fighting those alien which makes thousands of people dead and they should've being controlled by government. The difference is , in BvS the government immediately questions their heroes after the first alien attack and in marvel it looks alien attack , a robot that want to dominance the earth and a organization for government to realize that. - The camera footage of a look-alike Bucky bombing those building. I mean really ? and they accused him of blow up a building only based the evidence of CCTV ? If governmnent that ignorance , everybody can disguise of someone and bomb some buildings and can easily get away with it - And the footage of bucky kill stark's parent , i mean really ? He's a trained assassins , how did he made that fatal mistake ? and the fact that there's some random camera on the middle road is really annoying- I like the fact that a normal human can tear apart a superhero , but there's a minor plot holes, How did he could interview Bucky when the government got Bucky ? and there's a lot more plot holes like why did stark's hired peter parker ? he's just a kid ffs , and hawkeye joined cap ? he has a family darnn it and a lot more plot holes. Other than that it's kinda good , but highly overrated. It has a lot of humor tho</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie that risks nothing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Problems with MCU were first sighted in Avengers Age of Ultron, continued to show themselves in Ant-Man, and everyone was expecting Civil War to fix that. Unfortunately, Civil War lead MCU down a path that I fear will be hard to come back from.I find it unnecessary to review the acting because all of these actors are so connected to their roles they do not act anymore, they are those characters. They were seen in a bunch of other MCU movies and got a grip of what every one of them should actually do in certain situations. I feel that directorial guidance for the long runners such as Downey Jr., Evans and Johansson, was completely unneeded.So, where did the directors focus their efforts? It is clear that when directors do not burden themselves with the cast much more can be done with the quality of the movie itself. The result is visible in this movie. Civil War was greatly directed, feels compact and is technically superb. But, Civil War messed up in the most crucial part - the story. Civil War needed to be a dark and gritty story, difficult and layered. All of that was destroyed by over stuffing the story with irrelevant characters. The story was nicely introduced, with general outlines of how it will develop, getting hopes up. Then, somewhere at the middle of the movie, the story begins to deteriorate rapidly, and the reason is an unnecessary introduction of Spider man and Ant man. If this was done purely because Spider man needed an intro into his own movie, it is unforgivable. Killing 20 min just to pull him into the MCU is playing with fire (and nerves). On the bright side, it was a good presentation of Spider man. Ant man, on the other hand was a character that was completely irrelevant and was there to fill up the space. But, as a newcomer, Black panther was a perfect fit to the MCU. Unlike Spider man and Ant man, he actually had a story behind him in the movie, so he could develop his character and work on him (also, Boseman as Black panther really stole every scene he was in).The all-out battle on the airfield was supposed to be the highlight of the Civil War. But, it felt shoved together, overly caricatured, and not at all what it was meant to be. It had good fight coordination and nice CGI, but all in all, it just didn't feel as tense and complex as it was intended to be. Unlike the very end of the movie, when the true story of all the characters is revealed, the real Civil War begins. The battle of Iron man and Captain America is the climactic highlight that punches you in the teeth, leaves you breathless and just will not let go. So, upon considering the movie finale, and regarding what this movie could have been, Civil War starts to feel like a huge flat line.The last three MCU movies all had miraculous potential, magnificent cast and superb technical performance, but they all lacked that final kick, that comic book style highlight. It seems that MCU has a problem with doing something new and shocking, which it did so marvelously in the past. Also, a concern and doubt is lurking in most minds now. If Civil War felt this shoved and overstuffed, how exactly is Infinity war going to look like? Especially when one knows who is to direct.All in all, Civil war is a splendid movie, technically strong and acted superbly, but lacks risk, potency and darkness. For a story of this magnitude, different approaches were a necessity, more risk in storytelling and less characters. Still, the movie is fun and delivers another great chapter in the MCU. Unfortunately, it leaves a bittersweet taste with a feeling of underdevelopment. This truly could have been the greatest superhero movie ever made. Like this it's just cool.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie is well-done in visuals, plotting and build up. The action is top-notch and closes out some old scores from the last Captain America. The addition of Spiderman and Ant Man added depth and helped with the set up of the new Spiderman and the next Ant Man movie. For the most part the casting was right on. The movie could have done without Don Cheadle's War Machine. As usual, Cheadle mails it in with his cheesy (I'm the coolest cat here). This has always been one of the worst castings in the Marvel Universe. Never understood Hollywood's fascination with his pipe arm and bony persona. At any rate, hopefully this will set up future franchises like Black Widow and Black Panther. Perhaps even a Falcon movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A definite improvement over batman v superman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WARNING! Review contains spoilers! Do not read if you haven't seen the movie!If you were disappointed by batman v superman in March, you'll enjoy this. It's like the marvel version of it, but 1 trillion times better, for that matter. The acting from Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr was great, stark was funny, as per usual. The opening battle with crossbones in Nigeria was really thrilling and packed with action to pretty much tease what was going to come, more exciting fight scenes just like it! Tom Holland is great as spider- man, I just loved the way he was talking loads during his fight with falcon and Bucky, and making references to Star Wars during the battle between the two teams. Baron Zemo was a great villain, he was simply one of the most realistic villains in the MCU, who just wanted vengeance for his family, which was a simple, but pretty good reason to be the villain in the movie. Black panther was also a great character, Chadwick Boseman really fit the role of the Wakanda born warrior. His cause to fight in this was great too, he also wanted vengeance, for his father T'Chaka, the king of Wakanda, who got killed in the incident in Vienna, so he went to kill the winter soldier himself. And the actual fight between the two teams was really awesome, and it was funny when spidey saw giant ant man, it just added to the greatness of his character, and that whole scene, and the movie. Go see this movie now, you will not be disappointed by it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I rate this a 9 only behind CA:WS because WS had the shock factor of Steven finding out Bucky is alive. In CW he is trying to save him, from everyone! I see people hate IM3 and Thor:DW, why? Both of these movies move the franchise to the next level. IM3 is fantastic! It shows Tony can resolve problems without his armor. CA:WS tells how Steve has coped with being frozen for 70 years and then is caught is a web of lies from Fury, Black Widow and Shield. Thor's first movie is okay but too overwhelmed with legend, something Kenneth B is known for. Thor:DW shows the infinity stone of the Aether infecting Jane Foster, who is "yes" written as weak, but it can change just like Pepper Potts. Her, PP role in IM3 is awesome! What I'm trying to say is I've see all the movies and I have to say Marvel knows what they are doing! DC as much as I want, does not. Sure there are holes, weak spots, we all see the MCU different but don't second guess yourself, CA:CW is a slam, bang, wonderful story sure to make many people cry at different times, I did, so many times, when Bucky smashed Tony's father in the face, when Tony blew Bucky's are off, when Tony smashed Steve but Steve said, I can do this all day! And then Steve slammed his shield into Tony to rescue Bucky, minus an arm. I may be all over the place but let me say if you loved Winter Soldier, Civil War will make you cry and say, more CAP and more TONY but not until Infinity War, so sad we have to wait!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite having enjoyed all the Marvel movies I've seen,I have somehow ended missing the latest entries in the "Universe" for the last few years.Hearing praise from a family friend about the latest Captain America film,I decided that it was finally time to enter the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) again.The plot:During their battles against evil,The Avengers cause a vast amount of damage.Seeing them as dangerous,the UN reveal that they are going to pass a motion which will limit The Avengers to only going on UN- approved missions,which the UN hopes will limit the horrific level of collateral damage they have caused. Feeling divided over the UN's plans,The Avengers are left crushed,when the UN is bombed in a terrorist attack. Learning that a former childhood friend/war buddy is suspected of being behind the attack,Captain America decides that he must defy his fellow Avengers,which leads to the start of a civil war.View on the film:Web-slinging Spider-Man into the MCU,returning directors Anthony &amp; Joe Russo make the criss-crossing of huge franchises look marvellously effortless,as every web-sling,spinning disc and flying Iron Man light the screen in a dazzling blast of primary colour.Giving the CGI a metallic shine that gives the fight scenes a frantic mood,the Russo's closely work with cinematographer Trent Opaloch and editors Jeffrey Ford and Matthew Schmidt to bring the human out of the superheroes,by matching the CGI smash-ups with tough hand to hand combat,which give the action scenes a strikingly tough edge.Bringing (most of) The Avengers in with new additions,the screenplay by Stephen McFeely and Christopher Markus impressively balances moving the mythology forward,along with giving each Avenger their moment to shine,from Iron Man hitting funny one liners,to Captain America having to choose a side. Flourishing in the moments of brightness,the writers make sure to highlight the less than heroic qualities in their superheroes,thanks to the UN's questioning leading to doubts over how helpful they truly are,which leads to a thrilling twist ending,that brilliantly alters the perspective of The Avengers origins,as The Avengers discover that history does not hide the lies of a civil war.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Came very, very close to topping The Winter Soldier, but the Russo Brothers deliver another great hit in style while having to maintain a great deal of characters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>!!! Plot Spoilers are in this review!!! !!! Plot Spoilers are in this review!!! Still here? Alright, but it's at your own risk if you still haven't seen this movie! First off I won't compare this to Deadpool, as these are entirely different films in my eyes and should both be praised and appreciated for what they have accomplished. Having seen Civil War twice, I can come to a solid conclusion that Captain America's third solo outing manages to keep up the grade of new superhero films that was set by comic book films like The Dark Knight, The Avengers, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, and Guardians of the Galaxy. The Russo Brothers seem to bring out very, very good, if not great performances out of the MCU actors. Robert Downey Jr. adds yet another layer of depth to Tony Stark, bringing, in my opinion, the best Iron Man performance since the original Iron Man. Chris Evans plays Cap very well, and effortlessly makes the movie seem like a Captain America movie and not Avengers: 2.5. I was skeptical that the teams would be unbalanced due to Iron Man having the Vision and War Machine on his team, but Scarlet Witch more than makes up for her team's relative lack of firepower. She is easily the most powerful character in the movie taking down the Vision, who is powerful in his own right, almost instantly..The airport scene doesn't make the mistake of a Transformers film and has a limited amount of quick cuts, keeping the action in focus.The newcomers Black Panther and Spider-Man, brilliantly played by Chadwick Boseman and Tom Holland respectively, are phenomenal. Holland is easily the best interpretation of Spiderman and Peter Parker (no offense to Tobey Maguire or Andrew Garfield, who were both solid) and steals nearly every scene he is in, bringing a needed youthfulness and the quipping that Spiderman is known for in the comics. And even with so much to maintain, conclude, and set up, the Russo Brothers make sure that it doesn't feel crammed. The only minor setback is Zemo. Daniel Bruhl is amazing in the role, by a lot of coincidences had to happen in order for his plan to work, like Iron Man following Cap and Bucky to his lair. Overall, Civil War is a near perfect comic book movie that is almost as great as TDK or CATWS, but The MCU has a great launching pad for Phase 3 in this film, and the expectations will only grow for Disney-Marvel from here on out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If we're being honest with each other, I can't say I've enjoyed too many installments in the Avengers series since 2011's Captain America: The First Avenger. I mean, REALLY enjoyed them. I liked most of them, but not to the point of needing to rewatch them. The first Avengers film was very enjoyable. And so was last year's Ant-Man. But other than that, it's been growing a bit tiresome.And within the first ten minutes of Captain America: Civil War, I thought it wasn't boding well for this one either. There was a random action scene, which felt more like action for action's sake. We weren't sure why things were happening. It was more self-aggrandizing than anything else.But soon after, we realize it was supposed to be somewhat unimportant. Merely setting up the theme for the rest of the movie.The Avengers are trying to stop some bad guys in Nigeria, but kill some civilians in the process.Afterwards, the superhero team faces a lot of adversity across the entire world. The United Nations issues an act that will oversee and control the Avengers' missions. This divides everyone in the group. Some feel that not fighting every battle they hear of is a waste of their abilities, while others are affected more by the death toll of the innocent.I wasn't expecting the "civil war" to be much more than a verbal conflict, but it escalates pretty badly. You know something really catastrophic is going to happen as a result of this.Halfway through this movie, I've already realized that it's better than most that came before it.Here's why I like it: More than almost any Avengers film, there's no convoluted premise or overuse of impenetrable fanboy references. Everything here is clear-cut. There are no alien races trying to takeover the planet. Nothing here feels like it's beating a dead horse.This film also contains the best cast yet. Chadwick Boseman ups the ante playing Black Panther, as his acting abilities almost seem too good for this franchise. We also get some great character surprises, as well as a few minutes of Marisa Tomei.It's a refreshing mix of each character's personality and wit, without it sacrificing the film's intent or them stepping on each other's toes.Like any of Marvel's Avengers movie, this one has tons of charisma. But it's different this time, because it isn't forced. It becomes top tier in this glorified franchise, and moves into my top 3 favorite Marvel films since the series was launched in 2008--along with Iron Man and the aforementioned Captain America: The First Avenger.It isn't perfect, but it's pretty close as far as superhero movies go.It's also important to note that you should probably know some background on the whole Bucky-Captain America relationship or you might be a little lost. Also, for those of you who've never seen ANY Avengers film, this will probably all be lost on you.Twizard Rating: 98</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome Movie!! Best in the MCU till now..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the best MCU movie till now along with Captain America: The Winter Soldier. It is difficult to pull off this kind of movie as it has so many characters. But the Russo Brothers did it! The story is very good. It keeps the essence of the comic book story line but makes the necessary changes to it. In the comic book story it was easier to pick a side as Iron Man was almost shown as a villain. Here it is not the case. We see both sides of the argument in a very meaningful way. So even though I was #TeamCap I could see Iron Man's point of view and understand where he is coming from. It is true for every character. There are so many characters but every character gets their moment to shine in the movie. The movie is mostly serious in tone but there are many humorous moments as well and all of them are done brilliantly. Spider Man is finally in the MCU! And he is great. His scenes are amazing and are among the several high points of the movie. The other big character introduced is Black Panther and he is awesome in the movie. Black Panther has his own story in the film which connects brilliantly with the main story. He is definitely one of the highlights of the movie.The villain is pretty good and brilliantly portrayed by Daniel Bruhl.Coming to the acting, Chris Evans as Captain America and Robert Downey Jr as Iron Man are amazing. The scenes between them are terrific. The other highlights are Chadwick Boseman as Black Panther and Tom Holland as Spiderman. Both of them nailed their roles. Scarlett Johanson is great as Black Widow. Paul Rudd as Ant Man is amazing and steals the show in his scenes even though he had little screen time. I could keep going about the acting so I will just say everyone else is also great in their roles. The action scenes are outstanding. Everybody is talking about the Airport scene which is off course amazing and maybe the best action scene in comic book movie history. But all the other action scenes and sequences are also superb.Are there any negatives? Not much for me. The only negative I can point out is that the people who have not seen any other MCU movie before may get a little lost sometimes and may not like it as much as those who have seen the previous movies. The two movies which are particularly important are Captain America The Winter Soldier and Avengers Age of Ultron. I would suggest seeing these two movies before watching this movie.I have seen all the previous movies(some of them multiple times) so I had a great time watching this as I was invested in all the characters and could feel the emotional tension. So overall this movie has a great mix of Action, Humor and Drama and is one of the best superhero movies of all time and easily the best of this year till now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb Avengers film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Avengers are in trouble. Because quite a few innocent people were accidentally killed during their many battles the government wants to rein them in. They draft a bill that makes it clear that the Avengers only go into battle when the government allows them too. Iron Man, Black Widow and a few others sign it. Captain America, Falcon and others won't. This leads to an all out battle.Just GREAT movie--overflowing with good acting and wonderful action scenes. It moves quickly--the 147 minutes flew by. This did everything right that "Batman vs. Superman" did so badly. It's serious but also has a sharp sense of humor and some VERY funny lines from Spiderman. Only two debits--Sebastian Stan is bad as Bucky and the way Scarlet Witch was treated at the end was vicious beyond belief. Still this is a wonderful comic book film well worth your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>On a grander scale than before, but still more Age of Ultron than Avenger's Assemble</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Following a calamitous tragedy in Nigeria, the Avengers find themselves being hounded for regulation, and to become accountable for their actions. Tony Stark can see the reasoning in this, while Rogers believes the team should have the power to go about their affairs in total freedom. This builds to a climactic showdown between the two opposing sides, before an even deadlier enemy threatens to throw them all into total oblivion.The serious cinema-goer has certainly, over the last few years, been forced to have a radical attitude re-adjustment to the concept of the superhero film, and its possibilities in the grand scheme of filmic merit. It's gone from being the sole preserve of an exclusive, distinctive flock of audience, to being accepted on a more grand, theatrical level. These child-minded figures, in their peculiar and fanciful costumes, have been heralded as almost Shakespearian in their Machiavellianism, and Captain America: Civil War is the logical conclusion to this thumping pomposity.Strangely, with all this in mind, the film is ultimately still most impressive as an action spectacular, dazzling when brought to life in 3D, and taking you on a magical, mystical action packed journey that bursts into life at various points in its nearly three hour length. This is truly aiming to be the biblical comic book film, exploring relevant, human themes and placing the various iconic characters in respective roles. All of this, though, is its curse as well as its blessing.As sensibly impressive as it is, ultimately most of it's problems can be started with the word over. It's overlong, overblown, overwrought, overbearing, overwhelming and presumably over-budget. All of this causes it to lose the fun factor a bit, and so Avenger's Assemble remains the best of the lot. ***</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most mature Marvel film ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To be exact I probably say this is a 9.5/10. This movie works on so many levels. It is so amazing and is a great follow up from Captain America: The Winter Solder. There are so many great and amazing moments in this film and they all work and it doesn't fill to crammed in. The Russo Brothers have done what Joss Whedon was unable to do in Age of Ultron which is find a way to connect all these MCU movies in a way that makes sense. The movie starts off with all of this political drama that is going on in what are some of the most emotional scenes I have ever seen in my life. There all so interesting and they work on so many levels. The film makes you almost want to well up in tears at times with just how good it is. I will admit it does going on a little too long, but it still keeps you invested and makes you want to no more and learn about these characters, and how they are feeling. This movie also makes Iron Man 3 relevant again. Something I thought Ultron would do but didn't. In the film we get this broken down Tony Stark who is wounded and hurt so much by what had happened previously. He has lost Pepper now and finds himself alone without anyone else. He is more angry now and more unhinged because he created Ultron who almost destroyed the world. This movie makes you understand why Iron Man has chosen to take the side of the people and protect them by locking the avengers up. However it also lets you see Captain America's side who is against the government because he seen the corruption within them after Hydra had taken over. You also see that he desires to protect Bucky who he loves dearly. Both have there reasons and you get that and you really don't want them to fight and it makes you feel so sad when they do. The standout stars were great. Black Panther had a full arc here. He started on one path and ends on another. It is amazing and makes a full circle that is interesting and compelling. Chadwick Boseman also gives off a great performance and accent as well that makes it even better. I really liked that Black Panther didn't tell any jokes or quips. He didn't care he was all business. Spider Man was also great too. This is the Spider Man I wanted since I watched Spectacular Spider Man in the 90s as a kid. He is young, a kid and not so overly hot make actor. He is just the nerdy Peter Parker and I like that.Scarlet Witch and Vison's relationship was also great. I liked the humor there. I also liked Black Widow who gave her all. Really just all the Avengers did well in this film. This film does a good job mixing its humor with its serious moments. One never over takes the other. It all works in many ways. There is a really good mix of everything her that I really had enjoyed. The film does have some bad. Baron Zemo I didn't mind him.. I liked him more than Lex Luthor in BvS, but he wasn't needed. When I went into this film I was going in ready to hate Baron Zemo. Why do these films need a villain. You already have heroes v heroes why do you need some really bad villain to be in it. That being said for the plot of the movie it worked and it worked it spades. The film manages to use the destruction caused by the Avengers to be the crux of why this guy is here and is willing to tear up the Avengers. I also really didn't like the big giant title cards when they changed locations. I thought it was really strange. Just have little words geez. Anyway that is my review of this film. I really enjoyed it. I thought it worked in all cylinders.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best of the Marvel Cinematic Universe so far!! :)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Civil War is the closing chapter to the Captain America Trilogy and it rocks. To add to that ,altough its unlucky numbering, (it is the thirteenth installment of the MCU) it managed to be what we wanted and much more. To start all the characters were awesome and the new Spiderman.. THE BEST, Tom Holland is the most comic book accurate portrait of the friendly neighborhood we ever had in the big screen. Also Black Panther was great and now guys we have a royalty in the team ( OK another loyalty because there is Thor, but is more a God than a prince). The action was mind blowing thanks to the Russo Brothers ,these two are the Coen Brother of Action Flicks. Last but not least the arguing between Captain and Ironman was amazing ,because from either way they were both right and you could get why the had this ideology. I more than like it and go see it now, if you want to see Superheroes battling out , but you wished Batman V Superman be better. Well your wishes came true!</fullReview>

Okay now this movie is what Age of Ultron should have been it's like Marvel's apology note to the fans, and yes you will forgive them after this movie. he movie is just great the Acting is perfect from everyone, the story is better than Ultron but not as good as Winter Soldier, special effects were great not perfect, and the the effect of this movie on the MCU is massive. The Russo brothers understand what they have to do, the comic book is much different but this version fits better to the Movie universe. It shows the conflict and gives the characters reasoning for what they are doing and give them depth and development. It is either a fraction lower or equivalent to the greatness of The dark Knight.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marvel's finest to date</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Marvel Studios has been mostly delivering quality superhero films since their beginnings with 2008's Iron Man. To be fair, though, they haven't made anything that came close to matching The Dark Knight. Marvel's latest, however, is the closest that they would come close to matching that film. It walks a tricky tightrope between fun and seriousness, and emerges triumphant. The film tackles with the themes of friendship, trust, betrayal, the loss of innocent lives during battles, and whether should the superheroes work under the government or independently, and does them well. The directors, Joe and Anthony Russo, masterfully show how the Avengers get divided due to the Sokovia Accords, Steve's growing distrust for the government and Tony, and Steve and Bucky's bond. The final fight between Steve, Bucky and Tony is very emotionally charged. The action sequences are exhilarating, and are shot and directed with finesse. Nothing tops the airport scene, however. That was amazing and very creative. I especially liked how the superheroes used their biggest strengths and abilities to take each other down. It is probably the most entertaining set piece in superhero film history. The acting is very good all across the board. Tom Holland is awesome as Spider-Man, and so is Chadwick Boseman as Black Panther. Baron Zemo has a very clichéd but understandable motivation, and Daniel Bruhl's performance ensures that he is one of the better baddies of the MCU. The film, however, belongs to Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr. Downey very convincingly portrays the transition of Tony Stark from being a brash, egotistical billionaire playboy who refuses to be a government drone to a weary, broken man who regrets his horrible decisions and has no problems working under the government, while Evans gives the film humanity. Technically, the film is obviously very well made. The best film about the film is that it hits all the right buttons at the right time. It knows when to lighten up, be serious and be emotional. In a nutshell, Captain America: Civil War is a total blast. It's my favourite Marvel Cinematic Universe film, and my second favourite CBM (behind you-know-what). Highly recommended to all MCU, superhero films and comic book fans. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is more of an avengers movie than a captain America movie. The "good vs evil" aspect of the movie is more focused on captain America and the "civil war" aspect of the movie is more focused on superheroes fighting each other. One part of the movie is about how the avengers have a conflict about innocent casualties. As we all know the movie (you can tell by the title) is about superheroes fighting each other. Both sides have valid points so you can decide for yourself which side you want to be on. Unfortunately the movie forces it upon you to be on Captain America's side because this is a captain America movie not an avengers movie.At the end of the movie Bucky and captain America fight iron man. This fight lets you chose who you're rooting for which is great. This is how the civil war should've been in terms of outcome.Speaking of the points of views many of the superheroes' weren't explained. It would've been better if the movie shedded some light on the unexplained points of views of Hawkeye, Scarlett Witch and many others. It does feel like many of these secondary superheroes are just brought in for the big fight. It would've been better to focus more on developing these other characters points of views instead of focusing on captain America. The movie focused a lot on iron man, and it was awesome to see what kind of person he was under the iron man suit and the egocentric personality.Ant-man was a disappointment in this movie. Ant-man (the surprise success) was a different kind of superhero movie that succeeded. It was a heist and wit movie. Ant-man was great because of those two things. In this movie they just brought him in to fight which is lame. His one-liners are lame too. He should stay and dominate in his own genreBlack Panther is added to the gang of superheroes and he is the best entry ever. He has the best personality and the coolest abilities. Spider-man is also in this movie and it may be his best incarnation yet. He's easily the funniest character in the movie. They are definitely the highlights of the movie.In the civil war parts of the movie it was very predictable what was going to happen next. I liked the way that the 2 stories were weaved together even if it was probably too much to handle. Even though I found the superhero fight kind of lame, the action was solid except for the rather unnecessary first sequence. After the great action scenes of Captain America: The Winter Soldier, it was rather disappointing to see some obvious CGI, but I forgive the movie because in general it was pretty well done.The story ended in a way that was too well. The iron man and Bucky conflict was not resolved. Even though everything finished too well for a movie about conflicts.The story about that centered around Bucky, Iron Man &amp; Black Panther was awesome. It was a great story and it's a shame that it was only half the story (the other half being the civil war). Captain America didn't seem to fit in though. It was more: Bucky Barnes: Civil War instead of Captain America even if he's the peace maker. I was very surprised at how well written this story was. The villain was a real psychopath who knows how to play with someone's mind. In conclusion, I loved the Iron man, Black Panther &amp; Bucky Barnes storyline and think that should've been the only storyline. The action was great and some new characters were awesome. Unfortunately there were a lot of issues with the characters and story lines.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movies, but it has some flaws...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've watched this movie in the cinema yesterday with my friends and I've enjoyed it with a slightly open mind.I understand that the mood of this movie is a lot more serious than previous Marvel movies, but I thought that the first part of the movie was a little bit slow.However, I thought the acting was great, the action scenes were awesome and it's a lot more serious, which means it's the best Captain America movie adaptation in the whole Marvel Cinematic Universe.But to be honest: I saw that this movie has a higher rating than this year's Deadpool on this website, but I think that score was way too high in my opinion. Tom Holland's portrayal of Peter Parker/Spider- Man was annoying in my opinion and the portrayal of his aunt May doesn't make any sense, because this aunt May is way younger than it's former incarnations. She could be Parker's/Spidey's mom, for God's sake. Spidey used be cocky and sometimes makes fun of his enemies (which he didn't in this movie), but this incarnation is too much of a fan boy in his behavior.And this Ant-Man portrayal is obnoxious as well. And it also doesn't make any sense that the original Hank Pym isn't Ant-ManThis film is not so very true to it's source material,'cause in the comics there are WAY more superheroes involved in the Civial War storyline and so was SHIELD. It's a bummer we don't see SHIELD back in this movie or see Nick Fury back again. Fury is the one who makes the MCU complete, in my opinion. And I hoped to see more activity from HYDRA (we saw a glimpse, but that's all).The villain (Zemo) did a great job by driving Cap and Stark apart and let them fight against each other, but he is not the villain I had in mind (which is kind of disappointing to me). Therefore: He is not really menacing nor villainous, in my opinion. And I hoped for a beat down between Cap, Stark and Bucky vs. Zemo.To make this short: The movie was great, but the fact that Spidey and Ant-man were annoying, that Zemo is not a impressive villain and we didn't see Nick Fury, SHIELD and/or HYDRA back in this movie disappoints me the most. Therefore again: Captain America: Civil War is a great movie, but it had these flaws which make the movie less great than I expected and deserves to be. On a scale on 1 to 10, I would gave it a 7,5. And to be honest: I love Deadpool more than this movie. And Deadpool is worth a 8,5 to me.</fullReview>

There are some really cool stuffs which made me and close to 200 other audience members scream and we all stood up and clapped at the end.. Even though there were lot of superheroes it never felt a crowd. Each had there own stories and every single character had some interaction with captain America. brace yourselves Spider man is coming....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's More than Meets the Eye</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's happened: our heroes have turned against one another. Just the image above proves what the Avengers have come to: turning on one another in a state of civil war over their limit to government control. No more fun and games?it's time to really challenge what they stand for.I'll admit that I don't care too much about the Marvel Cinematic Universe. They're fun to sit through in a theater full of other excited fans, but nothing about them resonates too deeply. But now, Captain America: Civil War has become one of the better of the movies within the trope. It's packed with the excitement, twists, fun, and laughter that we all expect from Marvel at this point. While it isn't worth multiple viewings, it is worthwhile for the teens, as there's more under that shiny armor than what meets the eye.Based on the 2007 Civil War comic books, this third addition to Captain America's misadventures turns him into a criminal that the nation has lost its hope in. It's similar to Batman v. Superman, except done right. The Avengers now find themselves in a public media predicament after a mishap in a Lagos chemical heist ends with several people dying thanks to them. Now, the government decides to let the United Nations Panel instruct the super team. Looks like Captain America now has to clear his name not only with the politicians, but his own close friends and teammates.Minus Hulk and Thor, all the heroes you know and love are back in action: Captain America, Iron Man, Black Widow, Scarlet Witch, Vision, Mass Destruction, Hawkeye, Falcon, and Ant-Man, plus some new faces as well: the smoothly cunning Black Panther and your friendly neighborhood, Spider-Man. Now let me tell you, it's the webslinger's third reboot within a decade, and at last they got the character right! Within the first 10 seconds, you will instantly say to yourself, "Yes! Tom Holland was born to be Peter Parker! And Spider-Man!" His backstory is also smartly left out. After all, we already know it as this point, right? The rest of the heroes also have their share of some great laughs, Vision in particular, and they always seem to have tons of fun with each other on set. But I have one complaint though: it's the same old shtick we've always seen. We've got a super talented cast that includes Robert Downey Jr. and Scarlet Johansson, and they're doing the same thing we've always seen them do. It's not them that's the problem, it's the two directors, brothers Anthony and Joe Russo. They just don't know how to stage actors while getting worthwhile performances. There are some cool decision that these two make in continuing the series, and some not so cool. With the action scenes, it's impossible to tell whether if they're awesome or pathetic.But first, the good stuff: a garbage truck breaks down the arch in front of a medical center, Johansson totally rocks in combat action, there's a tunnel chase, Captain America holds down an entire helicopter by himself, the Avengers fight one another in one of the best moments of the entire movie series, and one hero has a big surprise that I cannot mention out of fear of spoiling anything.Now, the bad stuff: It's hard to see the action because of the sped up footage and shaky camera (you know what I'm talking about), the editing is monstrous, characters who needed backstories didn't get one, the VFX looks fake a lot of the time, Black Panther appears out of nowhere and at an unbelievably convenient time, and there is too much talking that takes away the tension.So therefore, the action is neither awesome nor pathetic. It's awesomely pathetic. Or is that pathetically awesome? Nah, I'll go with the first option.What I love right now about the Marvel Cinematic Universe is how every hero has his own story to tell. What makes it better is how this series makes that concept work so well, almost like it's the narrative of television marrying the narrative of film! I also like how it points out the issue of heroes creating mass destruction and putting the people in danger, possibly out of reaction towards Man of Steel. Although I probably could've done with a shorter film and a clearer plot, it's neat to see how all the subplots come together in the end.It's always a ton of fun to anticipate and sit through these movies on a big screen with hundreds of other excited fans. But you know what else? We can learn a lot about ourselves from the Avengers. It's already clear that we're a divided nation when it comes to things like whether trans-gendered people should use public restrooms of their choosing. It's just incredible how Marvel can take these abstract conditions of our country and simplify them. The Marvel Cinematic Universe may not produce all around perfect films, but it knows how to get the youth of the country out of our state of civil war. &#x200b; Overall Grade: C+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On May 6th, 7:00 PM, at a packed IMAX theater, there once was a group of four- a movie enthusiast, one of his best friends, his brother and his mother that was watching a little film released by Marvel Studios titled Captain America: Civil War. The previews before the film were either already viewed previously or largely unappealing(with the exception of a preview for Finding Dory). During the first act of the film, the group was certainly getting antsy due to the lack of events going on, despite the occasional great scene. However, once the first act starts to come to a close, lots of things started to turn up and as the film gradually moved on, it got better and better, one scene being topped by the next scene. The amount of humor starts to increase at major levels, the action starts to become more inventive and exciting, and the characters start to develop step by step. The two reasons why I have to give this film a 9 instead of a 10 are because one, the politics did confuse and bore me quite a bit during the majority of the first act, and two, the amount of non- action scenes with little to no tension did become bothersome to me. The rest of the film's quality- well, it's just pure gold, no doubt about it. Every set-piece that knows it's tone executes the scene so perfectly- the action is often engaging and having a high intensity level, the characterizations are fully fleshed out, the comedy is extremely brash yet frequently hilarious(Spidey had everyone in the cinema hall rolling) and the script is full of sharp quips and smart twists and turns. Not only that, but seeing all these Marvel heroes fighting each other for an estimated 17 minutes(such freshly imaginative use of IMAX 3D, by the way) will bring back childhoods of many(including me) that loved Marvel in the past. Overall, Captain America: Civil War is a slam-dunk great time at the movies, full of humor, awe, excitement and reasons why superhero movies can be even be enjoyed by non-fans of comics, and it will definitely stand as one of the best Friday nights I've ever had, and the rest of the audience in the theater I was in can agree with that, as they cheered the movie on fairly loudly at the end of the movie. Also, stay tuned for two post-credit scenes; you won't regret it for a second! And while the movie has great 3D effects, especially on a huge IMAX screen, the 2D version would be just as great if you don't care for 3D.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The real culmination of Marvel's work so far</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As much Avengers 2.5 as it is a sequel to Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Civil War brings together all the main players of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, along with a few new faces, and pits them against each other over 2 and a half hours. Dividing the team is the Sokovia Accord, a document signed by 117 of the world's nations which is intended to keep the Avengers on a tighter leash to minimise civilian casualties when the UN deems it acceptable for the team to act. It's this accord which replaces the Superhero Registration Act seen in the comic book storyline of the same name and is a great example of how Marvel uses the events of one film to heavily influence another and take full advantage of their shared universe.On one side of the divide is Steve Rogers, his ideology as Captain America making him believe that the Avengers shouldn't serve any countries agenda, on the other is Tony Stark, still struggling with his guilt after creating Ultron. While the two heroes have had disagreements in the past, they've yet to come to blows in a literal sense, and witnessing it finally happen in Civil War is satisfying as any superhero battle could ever hope to be. In order to further muddy the waters between the two, Cap's childhood friend Bucky Barnes ? last seen being mind controlled by Hydra as the Winter Soldier ? has been accused of a terrorist attack in Vienna leading Iron Man and his team of pro- accord heroes to hunt down the once-Soviet weapon.While there is an antagonist in the film in the form of Zemo ? more on him later ? each of the existing Avengers that are present, as well as the newcomers, are treated as both the heroes and the villains of the film, their motivations making it hard to determine exactly who is right and who is wrong. The film's marketing campaign urged fans to pick a side out of Team Cap and Team Iron Man but in reality, it's not that simple when each of them is fighting for what they believe is right. It's because of this that the confrontation between the two sides is so engaging, neither of them being guilty of fighting for the wrong cause but instead just the one they believe in, and the fact that all of their actions are completely in line with what has already been established within the characters is a testament to just how carefully Marvel treats their heroes on the big screen.This level of care is recognisable within the small character interactions that litter the film whether it be during a set piece, engaging in conversation, or simply a throwaway joke. The Russo brothers are able to expertly balance both action and humour and while Avengers: Age of Ultron tried too hard to make everyone a wise-cracking, ass-kicking demigod to the point that it became irritating, Civil War has much more in common with The Winter Soldier tonally. It's this tone that makes each interaction and quip feel much more natural and earned, and it's pleasantly surprising to see Robert Downey Jr play a much sterner version of Iron Man than has appeared on screen previously which paves the way for Sam Wilson's Falcon, Paul Rudd's Ant-Man, and Tom Holland's Spider-Man to steal all of the films best lines.Speaking of Spider-Man, both he and Black Panther prove to be exciting additions to the MCU and fit right into the pre-existing universe. Tom Holland plays Peter Parker and Spider-Man as equal parts goofy and brainy, expressing his interest in each of the heroes costumes and weapons as he dukes it out with them, while Chadwick Boseman is excellent as Black Panther, exhibiting composure and ferocity as he hunts Bucky in order to carry out his vengeance. The Russo's ability to juggle new characters amongst the old is extremely impressive and both of the new additions are used wisely within the film's narrative, their abilities and personalities shining through enough to understand who they are as individuals, yet not so much that it takes away from the excitement of seeing their solo films in the coming years.If the thought of more superhero films doesn't make you experience euphoria, however, the airport battle that features within Civil War almost certainly will. This may not just be the standout scene of the film but also the greatest sequence ever featured in the superhero genre, each of the characters being given a chance to showcase their own unique fighting style. The Russo's proved that they could handle action scenes with ease in The Winter Soldier but this is unlike anything else seen in a superhero before, an all out brawl which pits the Avengers against one another and all of it being captured perfectly by the directors. The interactions between the characters continue to entertain throughout this scene, particularly Spider-Man's amazement at standing alongside and against his heroes, while the wall crawler and Ant-Man manage to steal the best parts of the battle as it escalates towards a climax of gigantic proportions.When they're done fighting each other though, the heroes turn their attention to the film's primary antagonist who's been hiding in the shadows orchestrating the events playing out on screen. This antagonist is none other than Daniel Brühl who is excellent as Helmut Zemo, a Sokovian citizen stricken by grief after a tragedy that is all to relevant to the film's plot. It's because of this tragedy that their is a hint of sympathy to be felt for Zemo but make no mistake, his plan is nefarious as it is meticulous, the endgame being completely logical unlike Lex Luthor's in the recent Batman v Superman, and the character proves to be one of the best villains that the MCU has delivered so far.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best superhero movies ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Captain America: Civil War was a great start of Marvel's Phase Three and definitely one of the best superhero movies I've seen yet.Although it's positioned as Captain America's movie, it looks a lot like Avengers movie. There's plenty of previously seen characters and also some new, which are as amazing as the old ones. However, the plot, in my opinion, was much better than in the Avengers, because it wasn't just a fight between the good and the bad. It was a fight between friends for what each of them truly believe. That's the best part of the story- nobody's wrong and nobody's right.I indeed enjoyed the performance of this movie. It had great humor, some drama scenes and action all over it. This film is fulfilled with different emotions, it has a good balance between the funny and the sad. These emotions will be particularly strong, if you know the backstory.I also loved how the soundtrack included the themes from previous films. It was like a little musical reminder from the past?I'm glad that they've got the crew with original actors for this movie. It's really enjoyable to watch the relationships between characters that we know for years, while they meet each other only now. And I'd love to point out the brilliant acting of Robert Downey Jr. and Chris Evans. Their performance was incredible and sometimes you could even believe that in front of you actually stands real Tony Stark or Steve Rogers. In movie you truly can feel the contradictions, despair and fury of theirs.I liked the costume designs and how they were transferred from comics to movie. But I must also mention that many characters had CGI costumes. Some were excellently created, but some, well? looked like taken out of a cartoon. So, I think, animation could've been a bit better?Captain America: Civil War makes you think about what really is justice and how far would you be ready to go to protect your best friend. It is a movie which can enjoy anyone, but those who have seen all of previous films, this one will bring specific emotions.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Captain America: Civil War is a superhero ensemble movie directed by the Russo Brothers and starring Chris Evans, Robert Downey Jr., Scarlett Johansson, Anthony Mackie, Don Cheadle, Sebastian Stan, Jeremy Renner, Elizabeth Olsen, Paul Bettany, Paul Rudd and introducing Chadwick Boseman as Black Panther and Tom Holland as Spider-Man.Just by the opening paragraph we see we deal with a huge cast, this movie almost being nicknamed Avengers 2.5 or 3 by some fans. It is really amazing how the Russo brothers managed to handle such a huge cast and yet make a movie that focuses on the main character, Steve Rogers/Captain America. This movie starts the Phase 3 of the MCU and now the heroes start dealing with the consequences of their actions. The United Nations comes up with a treaty called the Sokovia Accords that wants to oversee The Avengers and also control their actions. This will split the team into two factions, one led by Captain America (the ones who refuse to register) and the other by Tony Stark.The Russo Brothers return in the directorial chair after the critically acclaimed Captain America: Winter Soldier and they keep delivering a winning streak. Their effort combined with a very good script deliver a fantastic movie about friends who turn on each other and fight for what they believe to be the right thing. The performances from the cast fire on all cylinders, everyone is doing such a good job acting wise. Chris Evans defined Captain America for the big screen and Downey Jr. brings yet a new layer to a character we assumed we already knew.The supporting cast also delivers but we have to talk about the new players. Tom Holland as the new Peter Parker/Spider-Man is a revelation. He is considered by many to be the best Spider-Man portrayed yet, and I tend to agree. Even though his role is not huge, it will satisfy every Spidey fan out there. Chadwick Boseman portrays T'Challa, the prince of Wakanda, a country from Africa, who gets mixed up in the conflict because of some personal reasons. Boseman absolutely kills it as Black Panther, even going as far as coming up with a wakandian accent for his character, based on his own research of the African continent.The Russo Brothers amazed everyone with how they handled action scenes in Winter Soldier and in Civil War they turn up that to 11. This movie has some of the best fight scenes in all of the MCU, with some gorgeous stunts and CGI. There is the much talked about airport scene which was teased in the trailers. That is a scene that steals the whole movie and it must be seen in the theater. You have never seen superheroes fight like this before, it will blow you away.Captain America: Civil War presents a great script beautifully directed by the Russo Brothers with some of the best performances seen so far in the MCU, with greatly shaped characters and fantastic action set pieces. The only weaker element for me was the villain who wasn't fleshed out enough and had some cliché motivations and the fact that this movie is 15-20 minutes too long. Having said that, Captain America: Civil War is one of the best Marvel movies out there and it deserves a 9 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent film with some flaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>NOTE: This review contains spoilers. If you haven't seen this movie you may want to before reading this review.Captain America: Civil War is a great film with minor flaws. The basic premise of the movie is that the government and the United Nations want to regulate The Avengers because of the collateral damage that they cause, particularly when they operate in other nations. Captain America (played by Chris Evans) believes they should be free to act on their own while Iron Man (played by Robert Downey Jr.) endorses the government interference. This eventually leads to Captain America working outside the law with Falcon (played by Anthony Mackie) and Bucky (played by Sebastian Stan) and Iron Man must assemble a team to bring him in.To begin with, I really liked how they use Iron Man's previous history from the other movies as grounds for his supporting The Avengers being regulated. He feels responsible for the destruction in Sokovia (a fictional country in Eastern Europe) in the previous film as well as the death of a woman's son. I especially liked this scene as the woman who confronted Iron Man spoke with him privately and didn't start some public crusade against superheroes. Black Panther (played by Chadwick Boseman) in his silver screen debut is brilliant here as well. He was given great motivation for wanting to avenge the death of his father after the villain of the film, Helmut Zemo (played by Daniel Bruhl) killed him while impersonating Captain America's close friend, Bucky Barnes (known as the Winter Soldier). Black Panther has some really awesome fight scenes, great dialogue and it was great how in the end he is the one who reprimands and defeats Zemo after he sees how vengeance has consumed Iron Man and Captain America when they are fighting when Iron Man discovers Bucky was the one who killed his parents while being brainwashed many years ago. I looked forward to seeing Boseman as Black Panther again in the 2018 movie. By the end, you could tell that even the writers had a difficult time with who they should side with and to me that is the sign of a great film. I also like how everyone in the film remained true to themselves even in the face of all this tension. I especially enjoyed when Black Widow (played by Scarlett Johansson) says to Hawkeye (played by Jeremy Renner), "but we're still friends, right?" even though they are on opposite sides. You can also tell all the characters care for each other's well being, like when Falcon asks Iron Man if Rhodey (played by Don Cheadle) is okay after he is shot down during one of the fight scenes.This movie is not without a minor fault however. Personally I wish that we had more scenes with Helmut Zemo to get a deeper sense of his motivations and his plan to divide the Avengers rather than the big reveal at the end. Spider-Man (played by Tom Holland) was charming, funny and arguably the best on screen Spider-Man to date, but his presence in the movie felt forced and it was clear he was only there to add levity to the film and set him up for a future movie of his own. I feel that this movie could have been better if we had more scenes with Captain America, Black Panther, Iron Man or Zemo in place of the time Spider-Man got on screen.There is A LOT of content in Captain America: Civil War that you may not understand if you have not seen the previous Marvel movies before so it may be important to keep that in mind, but it is a great film and you get the sense that everyone in here has their moment to shine despite the laundry list of characters here. It's serious when it needs to be and it's funny when it needs to be. My overall rating is 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Slick Marvel Machine Goes On</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now I'm going to begin with what the whole films premise pretty much depends upon...do we believe in the animosity between Rogers &amp; Stark &amp; the answer is pretty much a blurred 'kind of', yes we've seen snippets of their characters butting heads, heard their snarky remarks towards each other in previous films, but what has to be believable is that that can escalate to pretty much them having to take each other out in support of their principles/ideals &amp; as I said it kind of achieves it, now I know the first act has to attempt to build up that animosity between the principles but it feels a little slow on pacing yet somehow feels like that character relationship dynamic is quickly accelerated (yes I know that sounds pretty contradictory).Now I'm going to skip straight to the airport scene in the middle act....oh my word it was just brilliant &amp; one of the best action/fighting segments I've seen in a Marvel film, I'm actually juggling with the concept of whether...now to say it saves a big part of the film would be disrespectful of other things the film is doing really well but there's no doubt in my mind it gave the film one hell of an shot in the arm (pun intended) that was kind of needed, on another note does that Cold War conspiracy feel of The Winter Soldier work when you throw umpteen gifted superheroes into the mix? Hmm I'm honestly not sure it does.On the note of characters there was without doubt some superb character moments with the introduction of Black Panther which I thought was really well handled &amp; I can't wait to see more of him, in supreme comedic form are Ant-Man &amp; Spider-Man pretty much bossing the films entire humor, although Stark does gets a few quips in &amp; Falcon who as a character is really growing on me (there's a nice moment in a car with Bucky), the film does though always seems to be on the brink of character &amp; plot overload but it just about manages to wrangle all it's components in to still tell a self contained story if still with humongous glances towards future Marvel Cinematic Universe films.Ultimately though this is exactly what Marvel is right now, generally slickly made &amp; pretty damn entertaining films whilst trying to juggle an array of characters (although not always perfectly) let's face it it's a miracle these films are as good as they are with the number of things they're attempting to get done, so overall I think it has a few issues but it's still one hell of an entertaining film &amp; I enjoyed many aspects of it</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Political drama with some iconic comic book chaps</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At the outset, I was not very keen on watching Civil War. I felt the superhero genre had hit a saturation point, a plateau on which writers were trying to churn out new ideas, more stars were being hired to play lesser-known comic book characters, and the merchandising was nauseatingly omnipresent. Fortunately (or unfortunately, depending on how others look at it), I have not seen Batman vs Superman: Dawn of Justice, nor do I intend to. So with all that, I walked in for a Friday night screening with mixed feelings.Pleasantly surprised is probably the right description. Yes, the plot is fairly convoluted. I didn't use a timer, but I felt Iron Man had more screen time than Cap. The airport scene is mind-bogglingly devastating and Spidey does add a breath of fresh air to the narrative. But those are not what make this movie stand out from others in recent past.The movie's strengths are its themes and the questions they pose. Since man learnt to draw lines on sand, intervention, especially in international diplomacy, has been THE topic of heated debates, caused embarrassing scandals, resulted in gruesome conflicts, among other unforgettable pages in our history. As much as military prowess is coveted, it leads to fateful consequences that are more often than not irreparable. No wonder, the famed German philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel declared "We learn from history that we learn nothing from history." Another striking reflection this movie renders is loyalty in the face of escalating isolation. Cap is prepared to lose his more powerful friends than abandon his former World War II buddy, who can't help question Cap's judgment during one of his saner moods. Chris Evans' portrayal is convincing in terms of being fiercely protective of someone who has left an inerasable trail of blood. Sebastian Stan's Winter Soldier is almost a comic book version of Arnold's Terminator, barring the iconic bike and shades. The disappointment is in unanswered questions on how or why those in his team are as committed to the cause as he is. The cameos of Ant-Man and Hawkeye are gimmicky as well, but Anthony Mackie's Falcon thankfully adds the necessary humor to keep the interest from flagging.The third feature which is pretty much obvious to everyone is a role reversal between the primary leads. While Cap has morphed from a patriotic soldier in First Avenger to a violent renegade in Civil War via the path of a reluctant leader in Avengers, Iron Man has done a remarkable volte-face of his own from a cocky vigilante to an obedient company man, suffering an identity crisis along the way. The two men were already having a prickly relationship in 2012 and 2015 but in 2016, the arguments are no longer verbal. The punches, jabs, kicks, flying discs, fire blasts are all intended to cause maximum damage. As the curtain draws, we are left with an open-ended conclusion, a bruising battle ending in an uncertain stalemate with neither man a victor.Honorable mention must be made of new additions Daniel Bruhl and Chadwick Boseman. I was very impressed with Bruhl in Ron Howard's Rush where he played the obsessive, cold-blooded Formula 1 legend Niki Lauda battling a life-threatening racing accident to return to the circuit. Here, he does a brilliant job as a scheming military Colonel who is out for vengeance. His motives at the beginning seem distinctly nefarious but as the MacGuffin is eventually revealed, his rationale now pleads for empathy, even if his methods are still highly questionable. On the other hand, Boseman has a promising screen presence and acts with an uncanny restraint, holding his own against seasoned industry veterans. Like Bruhl's Colonel Zemo, his T'Challa swears revenge as payback for a family tragedy but chooses to be a better man. I confess, I will watch the Black Panther movie when it releases (as announced) in 2018.Infusing politics in movies based on comic books is not unlike playing with a loaded gun. That being said, credit must be given to writers of this movie who walked the tightrope of offering us themes based on modern events while still driving and shaping historic characters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent movie, stays close to comic book story-line</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only reason this is not a 10, in my opinion, is because there were some pointless/ drawn-out points that can make some people lose attention. Being a fan of Marvel Comics, this did not phase me much, if at all, but those that are not comic book fans or Marvel fans will get impatient and irritated about this movie because: 1. It ties together multiple characters and story-line, making it to where you need to have comic knowledge plus see other MCU films prior. 2. At times they become repetitive (Stark's parents' death for example) and draw scenes out forcing some views to lose interest. 3. The villain, Zero, has very little character building and significance for that matter. Just basically there in an attempt to tie the plot together.As for a MCU fan, this movie was amazing, with exception to above. It maintains Marvel's style of great action scenes. Additionally they delivered character features like personalities, attitudes, and appearances near dead on. For example: 1. Best Spiderman so far, Tom Holland did very well at maintaining the adolescence of the character and the overall look. Andrew Garfield did good but portrayed an arrogant/ cock attitude. 2. Black Panther was everything that was expected. Chadwick Boseman did a phenomenal job and I don't think anyone could have done better. 3. The main Avengers continue being close to image; how Captain America's strong morals and disapproval of government corruption or how Stark's overzealous determination to have world approval and create world peace cause him to lose faith in the team and himself and take actions causing the team to divide. Overall, there were areas that could have been shortened/deleted and areas that needed more focus but all-in-all a great movie that I have seen and intend to continue to see again and again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a marvelous movie, I have watched all of the Marvel movies from the beginning and this held up to the reputation of the previous Marvel movies. There was a slight thing that annoyed me but it was nothing Marvel could prevent themselves; I personally disliked that Spider Man had to be played by a new Actor, who also acted childish compared to the Spider Man movies by Sony. I was team Captain America by the way. Overall Marvel did a great job to explain what was happening in the movie, as at first I was slightly confused to what was happening but my confusion went away quickly and I was very happy with the final outcome of the movie which leaves me to wonder what will happen in the next Marvel movie(s) to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Captain America: Civil War (2016)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The bad news is, there are about ten movies going on in "Captain America: Civil War," which is at least seven too many. The good news is, most of them are fun, and there are enough rousing moments to elevate the movie to Marvel's top tier.Although Thor, the Hulk and other recurring characters have gone missing this time (with somewhat vague explanations for their absence), nobody's going to mistake "Civil War" for a chamber piece. Trailers sold this installment as a tale of intra Avengers warfare, set off by the government's demand that Captain America (Chris Evans) allow the arrest of his old friend The Winter Soldier, aka Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan), an assassin whose moral compass has been scrambled by brainwashing, so that he can be punished for his presumed role.There are more than a dozen major characters and another dozen minor ones, including Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and Spider-Man (Tom Holland), all running, flying, stomping and blasting through a long, lumpy story inspired by the 2006 Civil War graphic novel arc. Thematically, it's potluck. Like "Avengers: The Age of Ultron," "Captain America: The Winter Soldier" and "Iron Man 3," "Civil War" is simultaneously about the ramifications of US intervention in a post-9/11 world; the responsibility of private military contractors (which is basically what the Avengers are here) to defer to their government and the United Nations; the question of whether civilian casualties negate the righteousness of a noble mission; the allure and price of vengeance; and individuals' ongoing, never-finished struggles to understand how their pasts drive their present-tense actions. (Several characters confess that they act from compulsion and then find ways to rationalize it.)There's a fair bit of "The Dark Knight" logic, or "logic," to the storytelling. Characters do things to other characters because they know it'll set off a chain reaction that'll eventually lead to a very specific moment at the end; luckily for them, each step goes according to plan, because if it didn't there would be no movie. And, as in the inferior yet thematically similar "Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," the hero-versus-hero slug-fest only seems to spring from real and deep philosophical differences. It turns out that the real problem is that these characters don't talk to each other when they should.All that said, this is a satisfying film that takes its characters but not itself seriously, and mixes sequences of wonder, visual wit and pathos in with the world-building and dramatic housekeeping. Reuniting the Cap creative team of directors Joe and Anthony Russo and screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, "Civil War" gets better as it goes along, both as an action movie and a sprawling ensemble. I've seen reviews complaining that no character gets enough screen time, but to me the distribution felt just about right. We know a lot about the established characters by now. There's not much this film needs to say about Peter Parker except that he's a lovable wise-ass spider-teen who lives with his Aunt May (51-year old Marisa Tomei, looking more like Aunt February) and has only been slinging web for six months. Nor does this story require much more of Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) but that he act starstruck by Tony and Cap and the gang and try too hard. Black Panther, aka T'Challa? subject of an upcoming Ryan Coogler solo movie?is defined by his righteous anger over an injustice perpetrated against his family and his nation, and that's exactly where the character needs to be for this film. The action is solid, sometimes inspired. The best set piece in "Winter Soldier," Cap taking out a bunch of would-be assassins in an elevator, had a frenzied smallness that was much more exciting than watching heli carriers crash and monuments crumble; it seems to have inspired the better action scenes here?not just a stairwell punch- fest that finds Bucky swinging from a torn-up stretch of railing like Tarzan on a vine, but in a bigger, louder, wilder clash between Avengers (including emergency ringers Spider-Man, Ant-Man and Black Panther) on an airport runway. Although the clichéd hand-held, whipsaw-crazy action still lacks beauty and personality (a problem throughout Marvel's filmography, which has an assembly line quality) it's clean and exact, it makes clever use of the various heroes' powers, it's more comedic than vicious (Buster Keaton and Steven Spielberg are clear influences), and it leaves no doubt about the characters' angles and methods of attack, where they are in relation to one another, and what's at stake.The script never convincingly squares this film's vision of Cap as a guy who's willing to go it alone against government forces (led by William Hurt's Thaddeus "Thunderbolt" Ross) who want to regulate super-heroic interventions with the Captain America of "The Winter Soldier," who decided he'd rather go against his own government than allow one of its highest ranking military officials to order extrajudicial assassinations. "We may not be perfect, but the safest hands are still our own," Cap tells Tony, a sentiment that could easily have been placed in the mouth of Robert Redford's "Winter Soldier" character Alexander Pierce. It's as if Cap is a hypocrite who thinks vigilantism is OK as long as he's the vigilante?which would be a solid point if anyone in this movie raised it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Captain America Civil War *Some Spoilers*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Captain America Civil war review. *Some Spoilers*Where do you start? Well considering the amount of characters in this movie, Nearly everyone has a story Arc and ample screen time. The new character Black Panther is outstanding and well played by Chadwick Boseman. His character already seems to fit so neatly in the MCU. The new Spiderman Wow, as soon as I saw him playing Peter Parker I knew it was Spiderman , Tom Holland to me looks like a young Tobey Maguire his mannerisms and the way he acts is very much like Tobey's Portrayal of the character.For me it's more important that characters are written properly, and are true to that character from one movie to the next than comic book accuracy. Garfields performance was all over the place, he was far too cool and tall to play Spiderman / Peter Parker.The action Scenes. These were by far the best we have seen in any comic book movie. It helps having over powered heroes like hulk and Thor absent from the movie. Large destruction or flying scenes like in age of Ultron take you out of the movie to some extent, with there over use of CGI, there was CGI in this of course, but mixed so well with the live action.Here most of the action takes place at ground level, particularly the Airport scene we are able to enjoy small character moments. I heard the Directors of the Keanu Reeves action movie "John Wick" helped with the action Choreography and it shows.Small parts for Martin Freeman (Sherlock) who presumably is Secretary Ross's son, Alfre Woodard, and Marisa Tomei who plays Aunt May, a very young Aunt May! I could have done without the Ubiquitous Stan Lee Cameo however.Robert Downey Junior steals the show for me though. His character has gone full circle, from being irresponsible and reckless albeit a genius Billionaire Playboy Philanthropist, to being a responsible protector, whilst understanding the value of loyalty to his friends. Also this time you actually feel sorry for Tony Stark when he is battling both Cap and Bucky, we learn Bucky was sent to kill both his parents, I did feel this back story was slightly tacked onto the script however, to add emotional weight to the fight, we didn't need it as there was ample motivation there already. Both Chris Evans and Robert Downey are the stand out performances for me.The value of friendship is a key part of the story here, particularly Steve Rogers a man out of time, his only link to his past life is his friend Bucky Barnes, of course he wants to protect him, no matter what. The movie makes you understand this connection and the motivations behind all Cap's actions. It also expands the friendship between Roodey and Tony, which adds balance and further empathy to both those characters.The directors Russo Brothers know what they're doing. There proper motion picture directors. Whilst I like Joss Wheedon (and the same could be said of JJAbhams) the tone of their films never seems to be that cinematic in its execution, more like a feature length TV pilot with a bigger budget, there good directors sure, especially Wheedon, but not great. Just my opinion.Go and see Captain America Civil War, the first movie in Marvels phase 3. Stephen Adam Clarke</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Captain America Civil War fools us into thinking that it will be another marvel movie, just bigger, badder and more spectacular, with that old fashioned formula, heroes think they are enemies because someone is manipulating them, and then they find out and defeat the bad guy, i think you shouldn't read before watching it but, it's not like that at all, the villain uses only the truth to make them fight, and the closer they got to the truth, more they needed to face each other, in the end, this is no hero-villain movie, it's about a real antagonism between 2 protagonists, the type of antagonism i've never saw before. Marvel keeps finding new ways to amaze us. Splendid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good movie on flawed premise.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only spoiler here is what you've seen in the trailers. The world doesn't want rogue Avengers having freedom to go anywhere, do anything. However, the whole issue is collateral damage done when the examples the political leaders show are minute in regards to the possible outcome. A huge space worm going to destroy a major city? Aliens coming to enslave and kill? Well, you ended up killing scores of people or even hundreds against possible extermination. The other examples weren't even caused by Avengers but only stopped by them at much less loss of life. So the reasoning behind controlling them is weak. But if you put it in the view of political leaders wanting control over them for political power, then you have a better motive.Aside from that the movie does a great job of weaving the stories of all the heroes and their entrances into the film. Action is as you would expect along with humorous lines (though much more subdued in this version). I also didn't like the bad guy as others have stated. I don't know if it's because he reminds me of Tobey Maguire on valium or his acting but I found him irritating.But overall a good entry in the library and as much character interaction as battle action.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very fun, but very flawed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK... I saw this movie like half an hour ago, so this review is as fresh as your neighbours mowed lawn on a Saturday morning. Please keep in mind that i did not read the comics, and don't know a ton about the characters backstory, so i'll only review this based on the movies. A movie should be able to stand on its own.As is custom with my reviews: good sides first.It has proper acting: This is basically a no-brainer. Marvel always has good casting choices so even the new comer Spiderman (Tom Holland) did a pretty good job as a jolly kind of Spiderman. All of the characters do their jobs and give you a feeling like time is not even passing. Thumbs up. Proper CGI: It is a Marvel movie so there will be tons of CGI, and it payed off quite nicely. Remember the third Hobbit movie? That moment when you saw the Elven army? HOLY CGI! That is not the case here. It all looks good, so i got nothing else to say here:) Thumbs up.The Story is also nice: The movie has a nicely developed story-line, and with a few twists and turns along the way, made it very entertaining to watch. Again; thumbs up.Now for the bad parts, cause the movie does have them.The story is weirdly developing: I know i said that the story is nice, yet there are also moments that are weird. Characters jump into the action without any previous knowledge about said characters, and they seem to change their opinions about each other very quickly. There is little consistency in a bunch of characters when looking at their opinions. Plots seem to disappear: There are several plot moments that just seem to vanish in the background because other stuff is happening. Someone stole a deadly virus, and we'll never hear from it again after 10 minutes.... What? What happened there? (Also, very quickly, there are more references to The Avengers movies. Like Marvel really needs to remind us about those movies that were already shoved down our throats)Characters jump in suddenly: We get to see a new character: Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman), but where did he come from? Honestly he just shows up and everyone is like; "Ok... new character. Welcome to the club." Who is this guy? What do we know of him? What are his powers? Does he have powers? I want to know Marvel! Don't keep me in the dark here! No consistency: We have seen how Cap' can hold his own against Iron Man, but in this movie he gets tossed around by characters who (as far as we know) have no special powers. There is also this moment when he runs past cars on a freeway, so like 50ish mph. But that happens only once. Later, when speed is needed, he just runs like a normal person... He couldn't run any faster? Whas there a speed limit now?These and more moments make the movie very flawed, but i'll never say it wasn't entertaining. But i guess that is what Marvel does. It is always very entertaining, but when you search for the logic, you can just keep searching...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This takes it to Next level</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To be true Captain America has always come out to be the most boring superhero to me after Superman so far, but with the coming of Civil Wars the perception has turned around 360.With a great story line and brilliant cinematography the movie illuminates the screen with the lights of interest. The character build up, the twist in the tale and the coming together of superheroes to fight against each other instead of the usual alongside is what makes this one stand apart. I think it would only be fair to say that it confuses the audience to choose the side you would be on. Be it the debut of Black Panther or introduction of otherwise naive but humorous Spidey or the looping in of Ant-man all credits to the script writer it blends in perfectly and seamlessly. The stand out scenes for me would perhaps be the revelation to Iron Man about his background and the Spidey take on Ant Man. Though, considering the movie standards might seem a little normal (that's probably because of the overall execution being next level) but as compared to the rest of the movies looks much better. I particularly enjoyed the clash of both the Superheroes to the core. He is my friend, So was I..!! had a bit of snappy emotion attached to it. Performances for me Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr. (of course the sauciness) steal the show, Scarlett Johnson reprising the Black Widow role is a delight to eyes. Paul Rudd and Tom Holland (as Spidey) do accumulate the humor in the action sequence. Martin Freeman and Paul Bettany have been wasted as they don't have much to do in this edition. Daniel Bruhl, I feel is the weakest link in the movie, as I had expected much better from the Rush Star this time around.Russo brothers have made an impact for me definitely. But all in all I think it is a great ride throughout. Captain America : Civil war</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Captain America: Civil War' delivers on all cylinders as MARVEL and the Russo brothers serve up the best MCU film thus far. 1. The plot is quite intriguing yet simple at the same time, as the movie opens with the Avengers trying to thwart a terrorist attack lead by former SHIELD agent now mercenary; Brock Rumlow/Crossbones. Things end with casualties, leading the Avengers to not only have to answer for their previous mission, but the events from earlier films (The Avengers, The Winter Soldier &amp; Age of Ultron). Captain America (Chris Evans) and Iron-Man (Robert Downey Jr.) are divided when when accords regulating their activity is presented, thus leading to high tensions and an ultimate all-out war. What's even more interesting are the sub-plots involving Bucky Barnes/The Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan) and Zemo (Daniel Bruhl) respectively.2. This film consists of more characters in one film thus far and the Russo brothers balance things just right (even better than Joss Whedon to an extent), giving each character their time to shine yet keeping the focus on Captain America since he's still the focus of the film. The action is spectacular and the best MARVEL has shown so far. 'The Winter Soldier' had one of the best hand-to-hand fight sequences and this film also has an outstanding fight and chase scene between Bucky and Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman). Of course the main set-piece is the mind-blowing sequence between Cap and Iron-Man's team as they clash heads during the airport sequence. IMAX is used to superb effect for this sequence so the action leaves the audience breathless.3. Even though the movie is mainly focused on Captain America, Black Panther, Spidey (Tom Holland) and Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) are the standouts to the film (of the latter I can't say why, but if you've seen the film, then you know what I mean;). They never seem forced or misplaced, even though Spider-Man was a late addition to the cast, they all just leave you wanting more and hyped for their future respective films. I believe 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2' and 'Thor: Ragnarok' will play a bigger role in setting up 'Infinity Wars', cause this film is undoubtedly more grounded than the others. If anything else, it leaves you wanting more and curious as to where Steve Rogers' story will go from here.4. If there are some complaints, they are very few and far between. There's one thing I can say without spoiling anything, is that a very interesting and potentially threatening character (who was introduced in a previous MCU movie) is eliminated near the beginning of the film. Bucky feels a little less sympathetic than he did in 'The Winter Soldier' considering he plays a major part here. A potential love- story arises in the midst of the film, but it seems just a bit misplaced in an already crowded film. However, these really aren't major complaints to linger on in the film because everything else is so fantastic that it makes you forget.The Russo brother have outdone themselves once again, and it's safe to say that 'Infinity Wars' are in the right hands. Joss Whedon only wishes the previous 'Avengers' film could have come together as well as this did. 'Captain America: Civil War' is surprisingly unique and presents elements audiences haven't seen before, and that makes it a fun and action-packed feature.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, not Great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reviews are in the eye of the beholder and are so subjective, they are only really useful if you share similar interests. So with that already said, I am an avid Comic book fan. For the most part, have enjoyed the MCU. Loved Avengers, Thor, Winter Soildier. I like what they are doing on TV. I lean towards the DC characters but that will no way influence this review. Civil War, the graphic novel series, was one of my favourite comic book arcs. An early worry of mine, was that by using that name, it was creating a rod for its own back. The issues in the comic book arc could not be an issue in the MCU. There are no real secret identities ? the emotional themes and pertinent questions could not be asked. While that fear does manifest itself, its not really the problem I thought it would be. My main issue with Civil War is that it really doesn't make sense. The stakes never seem that high. Even the opening scene which kicks off the whole Accords doesn't really have the fallout to deserve such a reaction. The scene from the trailers, running through the Avengers collateral damage is even worse (New York ? you know, when you repelled an Alien Invasion, Washington ? when you stopped Hydra killing millions of innocent people). The only one that really makes sense is Sokovia, which makes it even more of a hypocrisy to put the person mainly responsible for that in charge of the UN controlled Avengers. Having said that, IM is one of the things that actually works. Perhaps too much. I came out thinking that he was actually the one that was right all along and it was Cap that was completely unreasonable. Cap's reasoning for not signing the Accords starts off weak, then just gets weaker. Its also a complete reverse of what has been happening in the MCU up to now. There are some real left-field choices in the film. The choosing of teams reminded me of a sports day. There is no real reason for IM to pick Spider-man and plunge a 14 year old boy into a fight against Super- powered adversaries. There's also no point for Spider-man to agree. Apart from launching his own movie of course. That whole recruitment section seemed forced and totally out of sync. Likewise Hawkeye and Ant-man. What's the motivation for these two? Why would Ant-man risk everything for Cap? It makes no sense. And what's happened since Age of Ultron that means Vision doesn't know what the mind stone is? Or how to use it. As I'm pretty sure he shot Ultron with it. There's so much more that doesn't make sense but that's not to say it's not a good movie. There are some outstanding action scenes and its well directed. Black Panther works and is a good introduction. It just doesn't feel like its own film, it feels like a filler film, an episode. It's no Winter Soldier, its more Age of Ultron. Enjoyable, but expected a whole lot more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A slow intermission in the greater story arc</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Who is Bucky? Why is he here?He's a Winter Soldier, and he reminds us that we all do crazy things we don't remember, and we shouldn't be throwing stones at glass houses. No, we should be throwing explosive lasers and bombs and rockets at each other, for roughly two hours and 27 minutes.How did we get here? Captain America: Civil War marks a humdrum intermission in the greater story arc about the Infinity Gems and the Infinity Fist, a devious device unthinkable in Eishenhower's America. It's easy to criticize the movie for being too long and featuring too many characters, but the key flaw here is what the movie lacks: a viable, interesting villain.Whatever happened to the bad guy wanting to destroy the world? Ultron tried. Loki tried. That creepy Egyptian guy from X-Men: Apocalypse is gonna try. If there were a real villain in Captain America: Civil War, then it would totally destroy the premise of the movie.That's because the Avengers are being globally criticized for saving the planet in the face of total destruction because they "break a few eggs" along the way. Um, I'm sorry, but Ultron was about to destroy the entire planet, so, um, I'm sorry, but people are going to die, no matter how carefully Iron Man aims his rockets. So the solution is to have an all-out battle at a deserted airport. Yawn. Did I mention I hate being at airports?The upbeat fun is mostly gone, although there are some good laughs involving Spider-man and Ant-Man. Captain America and Bucky continue their super-not-straight relationship. Vision continues to be a waste of an Infinity Gem. Black Panther and the Scarlet Witch appear without explanation or development.At least we don't have to watch poor Uncle Ben die again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mediocre popcorn flick.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Captain America: Civil War was is a mediocre action flick which can not decide whether it should take a dark and gritty tone, or continue with the silly popcorn style. from the outset it starts to build up some seriousness with a death scene and asking questions about consequences about previous movies. but fails to build on this soon enough when the action starts. The destruction of previous movies are something which didn't go unnoticed and warranted the signing of the sokovia accords. This tries to establish the MCU as an universe where actions have consequences. at the same time no one seems to care that scarlet witch aided and abetted Ultron in the last film. Iron Man did not have to face any grave consequences from the government or the public for creating Ultron in the first place. These issues fly in the face of the realism that was tried to be created here.things that were good: Nicely choreographed action sequences and set pieces. good portrayal of new heroes such as spider-man and Black Panther.things that were not so good: Soundtracks were forgettable.for a lot of cases, No reasons were offered to explain why the supporting heroes joined the teams they joined. Antman and Hawkeye randomly joins cap team while Spidy and Romanov randomly joins Iron Man. This felt like football team selection for the school yard. The main fight scene between the superheroes felt unnecessary and forced. While they are fighting in the airport, which is very conveniently empty, the joking took away the seriousness. The hitting felt fake and inconsequential. It felt like a WWE wrestling match more than a life and death situation.There are few inconsistencies in the plot as well:Iron man is given a tough deadline to catch cap but he still has enough time to design a spider-man suit.Main villain Zemo has enough resources to bomb UN but not enough resources to kill avengers while they are offgaurd? his plan depended completely on luck. What if cap failed to save Bucky? What if the agent carter hadn't died at that exact moment and cap never met her niece? What if she never helped cap to get his shield back? these things couldn't have been planned by zemo but cap getting his shield back and meeting him in that hydra site was critical to his plan. this is not explained properlyHow did a single CCTV camera record Bucky killing the stark parents and cover so many angles in such details? enough details to see stark moms facial expressions? With a cctv camera in the 90s? why did hydra even have a camera at that exact spot? Bucky catching up the the Stark car could be 2 minutes before or 2 minutes after. in such case there would be no recordings.What if Iron man team won the airfield match and arrested Cap and killed Bucky? overall, It was good to watch for the fight scenes but lacked in immersive qualities.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing new</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>CAPTAIN America: CIVIL WAR: This is Marvel Comics' answer to DC Comics' Batman V Superman, and just like the latter, the conflict between the Avengers, with Caption America and his team vs Iron Man and his team is rather contrived. And just like Batman V Superman, when indestructible forces collide there is considerable collateral damage to the surrounding environment as well as huge civilian casualties. When an accident causes a building to be destroyed and lives lost, the UN plans to form a panel to oversee and control the Avengers, who, while defeating threats, apparently have no regard for the ensuing damage that occurs as the result of their battles. Tony Stark thinks this may not be a bad idea, while Steve Rogers feels he alone is fully capable of deciding what actions need to be taken. Thus, the lines are drawn and all hell breaks loose. There are the requisite action scenes; the car chases, air assaults with our flying heroes, etc., etc., nothing we haven't seen a hundred times before, but exciting never-the-less. The many hand-to-hand sequences are especially effective despite the usual over editing typical of the genre. The production design is fantastic as always. There are some lighter moments and scene work which are well done. Stay for all the credits. A little better than B v S. Score: 8. Go. Mayhem galore, but nothing new.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the better Marvel films, still not Amazing though</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, I am in no way a huge fan of Marvel. I continuously think that their movies are vastly overrated. This film, however, is better than most of the other Marvel movies (including the horrendous first Avengers movie, and all of the Iron Mans). Do not believe people though when they say it is the best movie ever, because it is not even close. Still, this film was good on some levels and mediocre on others. I LOVED the first half of the movie. The opening scene was sooooo cool. I had never seen Marvel do a scene like that and I was super impressed. Black Panther is AWESOME and I'm excited to see his own movie in 2018. Black Widow of course is awesome, and I love Ant Man as well. Seriously, I was thinking that the 2nd half of the movie was going to be amazing.They had set up such a great story and I was excited to see what would happen.When all of the characters got together is when it fell apart. Iron Man is so annoying and is by far the worst character in the Marvel Universe IMO. (Although I did enjoy the fight scene with him and Captain America at the end.) The new Spider Man did absolutely nothing for me. I wish they would've kept Andrew Garfield (and why in the world is Aunt May a hot 35 year old?? She's supposed to be an old lady!!!)Captain America wanting to always defend Bucky was annoying to me as well. The movie is saved by the twist towards the end and the ending fight scene. And why, and this is the case with almost every Marvel film, do they feel like they have to make stupid jokes when they're trying to save the world? It just makes it cheesy and isn't very realistic to me. I think that's why I didn't enjoy the Airport fight scene at all.Going forward, I think Marvel just needs to take more risks. Many fight scenes seemed pointless to me (including the Airport scene that just seemed to go on forever) and the villains really need working on. DC's villains are way better. I would rate the first half of the movie a 9/10 and the last half a 5/10, with an overall score of 7.</fullReview>

The Russo Brothers (who directed Winter Soldier) did a great job with the action scenes and made them look fantastic! The film also had the perfect balance of Action &amp; Comedy (which we have grown to love from Marvel). One thing I was hesitant about going in was Tom Holland as Spider-Man, but he absolutely killed it! He is the best on-screen Spidey to date and everyone will absolutely love him! Another character that was introduced was Black Panther (played by Chadwick Boseman) who did an amazing job as well. I have loved all of the great portrayals of Icons that he has done, and he definitely hit a home-run with this character as well. Go see this weekend as soon as you can, so you can see the best Marvel movie in existence!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why Civil War has no Villain or "Bad Guy"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really enjoyed Civil War not just for the action but for the meaning behind it. It was different than other similar stories. This time, you could not point at Baron Zemo and say "You are the villain and bad guy," because Baron was also a victim, just like many more others. Civil War really provoked the thought and brought out the old saying "With greater power, comes greater responsibility." The Avengers had the power to prevent evil beings from destroying the world, but they also posed a threat for the same powerfulness.For me, this really drew a similarity between the superheroes and the nuclear bomb. When USSR and the US competed for nuclear power, you cannot say either side is doing the wrong thing. They both fear the other would control a better technology and decimate them, so they both could not let go, kinda like they are in a tug-of-war.Under this premise, it was no surprise that after Age of Ultron, Avengers lead by Iron Man began to consider putting more responsibilities and accountabilities on themselves.That is not to say Captain was wrong in not wanting to sign the agreement. Although their mission killed hundreds at the end, they have saved potentially everyone else on the planet. But that is not a valid excuse to continue to free roam and potentially kill more innocent civilians. This is just like one of the moral dilemmas of choosing between killing 1 person or 3 people tied to train tracks - there is no right answer between the two. The only correct answer is to not put people on the train track in the first place - which brings us to the question of whether the Avengers should be under supervision.My personal opinion is "yes." Although I agree with Captain that when they are regulated by the government, they could potentially lose time and be late to stop the criminals, but if they work with the government, they can avoid harming civilians much better since now they have millions to back them up. It is, of course, another dilemma between being legal but slowed by government bureaucracy and being illegal and harmful but can save more people. That is why I liked the ending of Civil War where Iron Man now deals with the government but Captain is able to act faster if things ever get too slow on the government side.Just another thing that we should keep in mind: The only disadvantage in joining the government is the human nature. Being able to give orders to superpowers can corrupt individuals faster than you may think. This was what Captain was worried about. However, that is not an impossible problem to solve. It is impossible to eliminate greed and other desires, but it is possible to select only conscientious and logical people like themselves to be the governing body. With superpowers present, changing that is much easier than doing so in our world. Everyone in the States knows our government can't get anything done because politicians just want the best for themselves, and average individual lack the ability to change that. However, it should be easy to see that it is not the case in the Marvel World. When the governing body becomes efficient, we would see the Avengers unite publicly again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lots of Action, Too many sub plots, Great but over-hyped</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are a lot of intense action scenes but they are not as detailed, unique, and intriguing as they are being praised for. To elaborate, the fight scenes seemed to be fairly average hand to hand combat that gave me the impression that I had seen all those sequence of moves done before on the big screen. In other words seen one seen them all. After a few days of processing my thoughts about the movie I came to the conclusion that many characters were not even necessary and could have been omitted all together along with their side story/sub plots. For example, the Vision, Ant-Man, Spider Man, and (dont kill me, hear me out) Black Panther all could have been left out of this movie and we would probably love it the same. Don't get me wrong they were all awesome in their own way yet they were also somewhat insignificant to the main plot that they could of all been introduced right before the main fight scene, like Spidey, to do their dirt really. The business side of this movie was evident that they just wanted more characters to push box office sales. Introducing black panther felt very "thrown in there" like. There was no mystery to it, just a "hey, oh yeah Im now the King of Wakanda and Black Panther everyone." I think his inaugural debut should have been an origin story seeing as though he is a lesser known hero in the MCU. Vision being in the movie made was a dud. He is far more powerful than he is made out and extremely under utilized when it comes to major threats against his allies, smh, and he misses his target like he isn't an advanced technological superhero. Did Iron Man really need to recruit a 16 year old to help out. Like where was MARK 50-100 right!? I could go on and on about unnecessary characters so back to the story. It was all over the place and you can tell that they picked and pulled from different decades of the original comics to make the story work for the movie, in which there isn't really a super villain....Zemo. It was like the Mandarin all over again in my opinion. That has to be the biggest upset in the story of all. Idk...I give it 2 star for almost staying true in effort and 4 for good action.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable but not convincing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me begin by saying I was waiting for this movie to come out ever since I saw the Winter Soldier movie. It turns out though the movie was enjoyable, but it didn't do much for the comic book fan in me. * SPOILERS - Don't say you weren't warned *My main grouse was with Tony Stark.. It looked as if he was going through a mid-age crisis.. Perhaps the director wanted to play Tony at one of his low points in life. It also made sense because of the Ultron debacle and Pepper leaving and everything. But Iron man looked distinctly out of character and is manipulated quite easily IMHO and shows no sign of the great Tony Stark. Steve Rogers is steadfastly stubborn and dead set against common reason and firmly believes his old friend must be redeemed. I have heard some people say Bucky represents Steve's dark side, and this movie nails that odd feeling. But the conflict in the beginning between Tony and Steve is not as fluid and clear as one would have hoped to. Collateral damage is a part of the job and one cannot believe that Tony only just realized the other repercussions of their avenging. Natasha's motivations are not clearly explained - is this her way to wipe out red in her ledger? This coming from the person who had to destroy a government agency because it had grown corrupt? It was not convincing at all. Also she disappears leaving her friends to be in jail? Not the Natasha we all know and love.Ant man was there for comic relief and though Paul Rudd does a good job of the "common man superhero" - sometimes you think Ant man had no place in this movie. Spider man is the charming and the talkative teenager you know him to be and does a good job and hopefully is the right Spidey! But the most wasted character was Vision who conveniently disappeared after the airport fight. Tony didn't even call him to accompany him to Siberia (or wherever that was)! The Scarlet Witch looked incredibly powerful to me.. I mean she looked strong enough to take on entire Iron Man's arsenal. In her case she has no choice but to join Cap's team, since the government want her to be responsible for her (accidental) actions. Clint returns because he has to repay a debt (i.e. to Pietro ) and winds up in jail. He is one of the more convincing characters.My most favorite character was the Falcon, who was both trying to be Cap's voice of reason and right hand man Both Bucky and Sam, and their unwavering loyalty to Steve are endearing, and they look like a close knit boys club. I loved their car scene!Bucky looks like a man on edge who would be rightly so.. but I felt the remorse was underplayed and it was mostly the self-preservation instincts of the Winter Soldier that we got to see.. At the end when Steve is helping Bucky, he could have at least looked guilty.. I was however happy seeing Sebastian Stan get so much screen time as compared to the Winter Soldier.. It seemed in all the Captain America movies, he is the one who looks totally different in each one.The Black Panther has got its rightful actor and I cant wait to see how his solo movie plays out.As of the villain, well, nobody thought about him too much. A waste of Daniel Bruhl.The hand to hand combats were great - which IMHO is much better action to watch than things exploding in air.In conclusion, Tony and Cap's fight became real (and personal) at the end I felt, the registration was not a very strong topic that could have driven such walls among friends.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Film, But Very Underwhelming</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Best comic book movie ever? Yeah, right.Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice was a far better film than Captain America: Civil War.Zemo was completely underused in this film. In the comics, he was a very manipulative man, like in the film, but is a very skilled fighter and can go toe-to-toe and hold his own against Captain America. In this, he was basically a terrorist, who was out for revenge. Very original. With Lex Luthor in BvS, he wanted to destroy Superman, both physically and mentally, and he wanted absolute power with it as well. They wasted the potential for Zemo in this film.The story overall was very well done, like it's predecessor, The Winter Soldier, but it could've been so much better. It didn't feel like Civil War, it felt more like a school yard brawl. The action sequences were great though. I loved them, but action doesn't make a film great. They barely touched on the original storyline, and just took the title, "Civil War", and slapped it under Captain America. Like Marcel Tim said, "Should have called this Winter Soldier 2 to be honest." In BvS, Lex made Superman look more like a threat to Batman. That was better executed than Zemo in this film.It seems Marvel/Disney is coughing up money to the critics and give this film acclaim. What every critic is saying about Civil War are complete exaggerations. I think MCU films are losing steam.</fullReview>

(on point and perfect..saved the movie!!)...the big negative..Spiderman(felt rushed into the movie and cgi was horrendous on him..also weak acting)...Villain in this movie is sub- par(not in Loki,Yellow Jacket,Red Skull level)almost don't even remember him.But saying that I was entertained throughout most of the film..yes... it left me highly anticipating the black panther solo film.The intensity between Iron Man and Captain America was perfection...Robert Downey Jr acting is good as when he first played Iron Man..not like in Iron man 3.In all fairness,is a good movie but not a great movie as earlier reviewers has said.People sometimes need to stop drinking the Marvel Kool Aid and realize Marvel once again made another film that is just a facade of what they used to be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dumpster fire for a plot, then spiderman comes in and saves it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Massively disappointed in civil war. Considering how amazing winter soldier was, this was at times a dumpster fire. Plot is a mess. Zemo as the villain is pathetic and the convoluted time table he creates to get what he wants is just ridiculous. Tom Holland though as Spider man was perfection. Truly saved the movie. And Paul Rudd as Ant Man. Nothing else I can say. It's a throw away summer movie and meh. Very very disappointed. I do not want to give anything away, but when the big reveal at the end happens, well you are just left saying "really ? Are you kidding??". My lord what can I say about the ridiculousness of Vision in a cardigan sweater and slacks. And even crowbarred in the potential love blossoming between Scarlet Witch and Vision. Maybe a smidge better than age of Ultron, but a world worse than Winter Soldier.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best marvel movie of recent times.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having watched the trailer and all the build up towards this film, I had high hopes and my god were they met. Completely blown away by how amazingly well choreographed with the scenes of fighting! Tom Holland (Peter Parker/Spider-Man) was better than expected, funny charismatic and overall brilliant. He done the Spider-Man role justice and now I cannot wait for his reboot in 2017. As for Chadwick Boseman (T'Chala/Black Panther) just like Tom Holland done his role justice and was another great addiction to the set. Marvel definitely picked the perfect guy for the job as usual. The storyline was action packed, full of surprises and everything I wanted the film to be and more! My only critique was that Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) nor Thor (Chris Hemsworth) are in the movie, however both are expected to reprise their respective roles for the third and final movie in Thors trilogy for "Thor: Ragnarok". Again I repeat, the best marvel movie of recent times in my own opinion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Marvel movie so far!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't let these fake 1 star reviews trick you into thinking this is a bad movie. This always happens in IMDb to great movies. I had very high hopes for Captain America: Civil War because of The Winter Soldier's success. I was also quite worried that it might end up like Age of Ultron (I enjoyed it, but there were too much humor and felt way forced on us). However, as I exit the theater, my expectations were exceeded. The humor never felt out of place and it was balanced. Each character had a spotlight and they each had an arc. There may be too many characters, but the Russos handled them well. The action scenes were very thrilling and the acting is so much better. Despite my 9.8 rating (gave it a 10 as an estimation to a 9.5+ score), the movie still has some flaws.1. Unnecessary subplot. It involves 5 extra winter soldiers. The main villain traveled all the way to Siberia just to find out they're already dead? Or maybe I didn't understand t.They could've been unleashed to battle the Black Panther, Stark, Cap, and Bucky since his motives are to split the Avengers.2. Shaky camera. In earlier fight scenes, the camera is shaky and can be quite jarring and hard to watch as if it's a Jason Bourne action scene wannabe. Still thrilling, but it's hard to watch.3. Missed opportunity to build Cap and Bucky's reunion. Bucky's already fine, so what about a reunion? I understand the movie is about Cap and Tony fighting over the Sokovia Accords, but this is also a Captain America movie. 4. Dialogue. This is a minor issue since the dialogue was alright, but what Stark said to Cap after their fight was a tad bit underwhelming. The line, "That shield doesn't belong to you! You don't deserve it! My father made that shield!" is fine but he could've also said, "You don't deserve your title! You don't deserve to be Captain America!" right after he says his first line I stated.The flaws are actually totally forgivable. Now for the positives:1. The acting. The acting improved here. The highlight is Robert Downey Jr. I found his acting really powerful.2. Spidey and Panther. They're totally the highlights of the movie. Black Panther is Batman of Marvel (hopefully they won't mess him up in his own solo film). Those who say his accent is fake didn't realize Wakanda is a fictitious country. As for Spider-Man, they got him right! He is young in the comics, and they got a young actor, Tom Holland, who was so good here. His jokes were hilarious.3. Humor. Like I said earlier, they never felt out of place. There's a lot of light moments while there are also dark moments. The first act was very serious with a little amount of jokes. The second act was more comedic because of the airport battle. The third act had the same tone of the first act. Ant-Man and Spider-Man were the most comedic characters in the movie. 4. Arcs. Each character had an arc. This is Cap and Bucky's film while also Iron Man's story. T'Challa, Stark and Rogers are consumed by guilt and vengeance. They have something in common with the villain. Vision goes on a journey where he finds love. He was "human" in this film. This is also a prelude to Spider-Man: Homecoming and Black Panther. 5. Villain. Honestly, I found the villain to be really good. I wouldn't even want to call him a villain. He has no gadgets and no superpowers. Just a normal guy with a simple motive: to split the Avengers. He doesn't want to rule the world; that'll make him so clich?. As I stated earlier, Steve. Tony, and T'Challa are consumed by guilt and vengeance. Same thing with Zemo. He feels guilty for not being able to save his family from the climactic battle of Age of Ultron. And now, he wants revenge on the Avengers. His task was also completed and not foiled by the Avengers. He won. The Avengers have been divided. It's our expectations that made us believe that Zemo is another weak villain of the MCU.I don't seem to understand why every great films (Inside Out, Mad Max, The Dark Knight Rises, etc.) gain negative reviews/hate in IMDb whilst mediocre/terrible films (Click, Pixels, Tomorrowland, etc.) get positive reviews. These fake 1 star reviews here are from those so-called DCtards who will always do this to every single Marvel movie. These comparisons to BvS (before you accuse me of being a Marvel fan, I enjoyed BvS and other DC films) are so laughable. It's clear that they haven't watched it. They even gave BvS a 10 whilst Civil War gets a 1 star from them. And a reviewer said this is the Fant4stic of 2016 but they barely did any black-washing to the characters. How laughable these fake reviews are. Now they're doing the same to Finding Dory. I'll give this movie a 9.8/10 rating. This is the best MCU movie to date indeed!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Only the Best MCU Film Yet, But a New Favorite Film of Mine, Period</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Captain America: Civil War was hyped beyond belief. From Black Panther and Spider-Man being introduced to the classic Mark Millar story being roughly adapted to screen, all the while tying in all of the Earth-based MCU stories in in one epic film. So, logically, I went to the premiere at my favorite local AMC theater. The question is, how was the movie? In short, it was incredible. It was a sequel not only to the past two Captain America films, but also a sequel to the Avengers films. More than that, even, it never feels necessary to know everything that has happened in the MCU (even though nerds like myself certainly watch it all). It introduces characters so naturally that newcomers would never even know this was T'Challa's (Black Panther) first time on screen, and Spider-Man was weaved into the story so well that Peter Parker became one of the best parts of the whole film. If you have watched everything in the MCU thus far (or even just the movies alone), or read the comics, or both, your brain will overload with references, callbacks, and tie-ins to past events. If you are like a few of the people I know and have yet to get that deep into it all, don't worry--the script is so well written that it establishes who everyone is and why they act the way they do without much further explanation, even if you will enjoy and understand it more as a fan.At two and a half hours long, I was worried the movie, being the longest MCU film yet, would feel long. But it didn't. In fact, it almost felt too short. Not because the story felt rushed or because there could have been more character development, but because you really don't want to experience to end. It is the culmination of the past eight years of some of the biggest blockbusters ever. You get to see the plans of an entire fictional universe come to fruition on a larger scale than ever before, and even non-comic book fans will not be able to help but smile when Spider-Man cracks a joke, Black Panther displays his regal personality, or when Scarlet Witch uses her powers to hurl objects hither and thither in a beautiful display of magic that, besides the obvious Harry Potter, has yet to be rivaled in pure spectacle.Overall, Captain America: Civil War is an amazing film, and a feat some, I feel, take too lightly. As someone who writes, having everything in this film work so well and nothing but nitpicks being worthy of mention (oftentimes being common or unavoidable things that are part of the process of filmmaking, only sidestepped by the very lucky or the very lucky and very talented) is an incredible achievement. Everyone involved with this movie should be proud. Not only is it the greatest comic book (or superhero) movie ever made, it is a film incredible in its own right. Seeing it on the big screen was spectacular, and I cannot wait to watch it over and over at home in a few months.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marvel delivers with another satisfying entry in the "Captain America" franchise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Captain America: Civil War is the third entry in Marvel's "Captain America" franchise, and the second to be directed by the Russo Brothers.I walked into this movie hearing about all the hype that surrounded it, and the praise by critics and comic-book fans. Having enjoyed the previous film "Winter Soldier" as a standalone espionage-thriller that also worked well as a superhero movie, I was unsure how this one could match it in terms of quality.My doubts were laid to rest, as "Captain America: Civil War" is a worthy sequel and highly entertaining from beginning to end.The story spans several countries and time-lines, and features new appearances by heroes Black Panther and Spider-Man (whose incarnation here is the best yet).The premise of the film is great, with Captain America and Iron Man at odds with each other over signing the "Sokovia Accords" (in response to the collateral damaged caused by the team in the last "Avengers" movie), which would put the control of the Avengers into the hands of the United Nations, relinquishing them of their own control.There's also an interesting espionage story, with the Cap having to clear his friend Bucky Barnes' name after he is blamed for causing a terrorist incident. The supporting roles featuring Sharon Carter (Agent Peggy Carter's daughter), and Helmut Zemo as the villain also play important parts, adding extra depth to the story.The two split up and assemble their own teams, Captain America having with him Scarlet Witch, Falcon, Hawkeye, Ant-Man and Bucky Barnes (the Winter Soldier); and Tony Stark having Vision, Black Panther, Spider Man, War Machine, and Black Widow.Performances are fine all around, and the usual funny chemistry is there between the heroes. But this time, there is more tension now that everyone picks sides. It all builds up well throughout, the script balancing an intriguing plot with plenty of twists, turns and action in between and giving time for each character to shine in spit of the large cast. "Civil War" still keeps the great tone of the previous film, being a mature entry into the Marvel Cinematic Universe without having to be gritty or overly violent.All the fight scenes are well done and incredibly exciting, especially the showdown between all the heroes at an airport, which exceeded expectations. Ant-Man and Spider-Man especially are the highlight of the film here, with their quips and awesome moves."Civil War" does everything so well it works both as a stand alone feature, and as a continuing piece in the Marvel movie landscape. I'm looking forward to their upcoming movie releases, just to see if they can keep this same level of quality.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to a first showing at my local Imax, and as with all first showings the atmosphere was good as always. Thing is with all Marvel movies now is that there isn't very much you haven't seen before. Unlike batman vs Superman this movie introduces new characters in a easily accessible way to non fans. That being said there is very little else i can say that hasn't been done in every other Marvel film to date. Except in the last 2 minutes of the final battle i felt no character was in any danger at all. Its like WWE, you know everything will be OK in the end. Both leads are brilliant as always the supporting cast was brilliant and the new comers were very good. I cant seem to shake this feeling of I've seen it all before and the knowledge that Disney is hyping this into a masterpiece when its just a rehash of a rehash. To avoid spoilers its limiting me to what i can say all i can say is its standard Marvel, forgettable villain,lots of mid fight quips and no sense of danger at all. Considering the story its based off i expected more, like Age of Ultron its the story but no peril. Is it better than AoU for sure, but i don't agree with the 5 star reviews its nothing you haven't seen before but still enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Captain America: Civil War is bold, innovative and altogether refreshing. Impressively switching between character-driven dialogue development, all-to-the-wall action scenes and a depth to a war and conflict that others could only dream of (looking at you, Batman vs Superman), Civil War is impressive because of what is at stake and what we know lies ahead. It wins by building to this point thirteen episodes into its Universe run and offering more for the audience to invest themselves in - there is no winners, or losers, or good people or bad people as such, just individuals with different approaches, opinions and emotions and Civil War wins by accepting each of these and exploring them in thought provoking and progressive ways. I genuinely do not know where this Avengers unit is going next and as long as Marvel do not hit the reset and send everything back to being peachy keen, they will have myself and many others beside them for the journey.FULL REVIEW: http://goo.gl/LsfQzS</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ignore the insecure DC fan-boys down voting this film and giving it 1 star. It was a masterpiece and quite possible the greatest superhero film of all time. Marvel continues to display its superiority with another masterful addition to the MCU. Everything is prefect, the action, the direction, the pacing, the effects, the performances. Spiderman is amazing and ant man also steals the show here. The conflict is explored masterfully and doesn't feel ridiculous and fake like it does in BvS. We actually feel and care for these characters and understand their motivations. The Russo brothers make zack Snyder look like a complete amateur. Do you see Warner bros and DC? This is how you make a movie!!! Do yourself and favor and watch this masterpiece!!! Absolutely incredible stuff!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Comic Book Movie ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a direct sequel to the events in Avengers: Age of Ultron. Where the entire world considers if having the Avengers saving the world is a risk worth taking due to the destruction and human loses they cause.Daniel Bruhl plays Colonel Zemo, a Sokovian military man who after losing his entire family sets up a plan to do what gods and aliens have not succeed at, the destruction of the Avengers.When the United Nations meet to sign the Sokovian accords, which is a document where the Avengers will act only IF the United Nations authorize it, Colonel Zemo coordinates a terrorist attack and blames it on The Winter Soldier, who was Captain America's best friend.And as Captain Rogers fights to clear his friend of any wrong doings he has to also hide one of the crimes his friend is actually responsible for.The performances are great and the writers went above the call of duty in combining the tone of Captain America: The Winter Soldier which is a bit more somber, and the lighter side of the Avengers films, something the directors have already mastered at.It brings all but two of The Avengers and introduces us to The Black Panther and to The Friendly-Neighborhood Spider-Man. Whose entire time he's on the screen is absolutely enjoyable, some said having a teenage Spider-man in the mix was a bad idea, I respectfully disagree. This is THE BEST live-action Spider-Man we have EVER seen.This has to be the most emotional movie that Marvel Studios has ever released, it balances the action packed sequences with real emotions and a truly outstanding villain, arguably THE best villain in the entire saga, yes... arguably at the same level as Loki.But while the villain is great, the real components that make this movie as outstanding as it is are the Avengers, who have faced Gods, aliens, terrorists, robots, but they have never faced the consequences of their actions nor do they had their friendships tested in such a powerful way before. This is not just about Tony Stark against Steve Rogers, this conflicts involves the entire team and the compromises people face when they are forced to choose between freedom or security, and the overreaching power of global politics.I will go on the record and say this was The Best Marvel Movie as of yet.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The amount of collateral damage leads the UN to pass the Sokovia Accords. Accountability for The Avengers. This leads to a split down the middle of the team, for reasons political as well as personal. Can they trust the government? This time? Which matters most: Security vs. civil liberties? Which side is right? Who's to say? Well, who will emerge victorious? Will they be able to all work together ever again? And just how far might they go, for their point of view, against those they've fought beside, some for several years? This joins the select, short list of the very best of the whole franchise, with the two team outings and Cap's second movie. Marvel... this expanding universe, just, keep the pictures coming. We'll keep going to them. As long as they're this compelling we will. Do note that this expects you to be well-versed in these. Of course, you can just take in Age of Ultron, and you'll be completely prepared for this.If the Russos needed to prove that they could take over from Whedon, then this film should settle the matter. Every character is well-represented, in every respect. They make the juggling act look easy. And yes, they have a sense of humor in there, and it fits. Do expect less quipping. Even Tony(Downey Jr., reaching a new level of loss), as pointed out in this, is subdued in this aspect. And the first MCU all-out, heroes taking each other, not the villains, on... so many potential match-ups, exploring interpersonal relationships, power dynamics, trust, and this just plain delivers. Oh, and, are you even remotely into Spider-Man? Watch this, even if that's the one element you're interested in. He's not in it much, of course, but he's spot-on every second of it, he gets a lot of the best moments, and it's just such a sheer joy to see, sixth live action appearance, and Feige's first shot at it, they completely understand him and bring the panels to life. No one could have convinced me that I'd be eager for the third continuity in less than a decade.There is some dark, disturbing and violent content in this. I recommend this to any fan of modern spy thrillers. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Languishes without a moral center</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a long-time fan of Marvel it pains me to deliver such a review. I cannot fault the special effects, the production, the integrity of the story-line in spring-boarding off of past stories/events. The introduction of some new faces and powers is good, including a truly twitchy, nerdy, genuine-teen SpiderMan. But this movie very quickly succumbs to a kind of Americana propaganda where "freedom" means nothing more noble than a lack of accountability for one's actions; and what is "truly American" is defined by the person with the biggest "gun". Captain American apparently has that gun, in the power to do "what he thinks is right" even unto becoming a criminal in the eyes of the nation he alleges to represent. Because he has the power, he gets to decide what is right and "American" over everyone else; and one ends up with a person or a group of people causing terrific damage to property and life because they feel their cause is noble. In any arena other than "Americana entertainus" this would be called terrorism. Especially when Cap's "justification" for even more loss of property and life . . . turns out to simply be the machinations of one man imprisoned by a need for revenge and willing to go to terrorist ends to sate it. So the movie ends with even those allegedly championing "freedom", all being "imprisoned". To vengeance; to terrorism; to even a propagandacized interpretation of "freedom". A good mindless story, no doubt . . . and well-done in this regard. But not the usual caliber one has come to expect from the franchise of Stan Lee. His "flagship" creations usual have just as much if not more to do with moral fiber as with action and destruction. I reserve my highest ratings and reviews for movies that leave you with something beneficial to chew on. Captain America: Civil War lacks this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Its quite similar to BvS honestly, but ....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, I like this movie, but i still prefer CAWS better. so far in the MCU universe (not including the X man) I only like Cap, and maybe... antman. The others are just purely entertainment without no thoughts at all. I love BvS despite its flaws, and somehow I saw so many people (especially the critics) are so biased in these 2 movies. This movie, for me is weird. How do these super hero choose sides? because of friendship? because of ideology, or because of who's the leader?? especially spiderman and antman, which i think their addition was just to make the movie merrier... no depth at all, sorry. the editing and storyline is better than BvS but that's thanks to the previous MCU build up which BvS doesn't have. this is the advantage that MCU has, good work on it! Snyder and Warner has to learn about this process from MCU... but the writing is bad! but the idea of the villain was too simple... revenge by making the superheroes fight/kill each other? how did Zemmo know about Seb's situation unless he is a HYDRA and not just a local Sokovian? and a man with such intelligence would only see these superhero fight and not using the advantages he can get from the winter soldiers? and just relying on a camera record? (how on earth can there be a video camera in the middle of nowhere shooting Bucky's incident from DIFFERENT angle when there's NO one around?) and the airport fight? its just like a training ground including the fight itself... nobody believes that they would harm each other, and vision's mistake was because he was distracted? by what? he was barely visible in that fight! This Avengers ALWAYS SELF DESTRUCT!! Problems are there because of their own creations! (Stark is always the cause in this case). Whenever these superheroes are together, they always created a HUGE Mess with tons of people being killed! Does anyone know what happened at the end of the airport fight why the rest of cap's side were suddenly in that prison? aaannd...as a superhero, they should have the ability to investigate the truth and not just to believe a very simple statement. I wonder if its not Bucky, will Cap defended him till the end? I find all this frustrating. The good side of this movie are the jokes. it was funny, although it only happened a few times, notoriously when Spidy was around. Credit to Tom Holland. He nailed it! I can't wait to see the next Spiderman movie. I hope the writing and storyline would be good because the actor certainly proved that he is GOOD! costumes were great (didn't understand why BP took of his mask right after their first fight), acting were good. Fighting was okay (I prefer BvS fight sequences which was awesome), conversations and dialogs are better than BvS for sure. so yeah, I think this movie is a must watch for superheroes movie lovers and also for comic book freaks! its entertaining (just shut your brain and enjoy it, that's the trick) and light, with some comedies here and there. I would title this movie REVENGE though, because this is what is all about.I don't see a Civil War definitely.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Captain America: Civil War was good and fun.I'm not really into superhero movies (with the exception of Batman Begins &amp; The Dark Knight) but love a decent flick nonetheless. This is no different. It doesn't get much better for the inner-kid when Iron-Man, Spiderman, Captain America, Ant Man, Black Widow &amp; tons of others are all on screen at the same time in one movie. But that's about it really: The inner-kid was excited. The special effects are what we've come to expect these days: Nothing short of phenomenal. But these comic book stories just seem to be continuous fillers and preludes to the next movie. Never really delivering a satisfying plot. Which is something sorely lacking in modern cinema. I particularly enjoyed the cinematography of this Marvel installment in comparison to some of the previous films.Overall it was good and it had its moments. A rather bland summary, which is just about fitting.A solid 8/10 for me, but anything below 9 can wait till Blu-Ray anyway.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Captain America; Civil War demonstrated,.. The best superhero action any generation has ever viewed. If you are are true Captain fan, and your concerned about him sharing screen time, I assure you, there is more Captain tear-downs than in any of his other movies. That being said, the movie also showcases the very best sequences from many other formerly introduced Marvel characters. The new characters as well, got better treatment than some may have felt about "Age of Ultron", (for me personally), where I felt I got just a taste of Vision and Scarlet Witch, and a very dead Quicksilver. The most emotion we have seen from any Marvel movie, and very delicately handled. If you have any feelings for the characters that have been build up over the years, you will probably shed a tear or two. Vision and Scarlet become more solidified which was very satisfying. I went into Civil War with Black Panther very low on my excited about list, but I must say, he was impeccably cast, and added a great deal of heart, (as well as major action) to the movie. An absolute "win" for his introduction, and I actually look forward to his 2018 solo film. The most diverse and well played superhero interaction we've seen to date. A gripping plot that will have you riveted from the very start. This movie has more depth than what I was led to believe from the clips, interviews, and reviews. Get your snacks and empty your bladders because you will be cemented to your seat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film is just "marvelous"//minor spoilers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where to start of with this film, first of all it was amazing and sorry DC fan boys but marvel have won this time not all will agree but I would say this is marvel's best film yet.Throughout the film you are treated to a wide range of exiting action scenes, a plot that is as good as any Oscar winning film and acting that could not get any better if it tried. The Russo brothers (Joe and Anthony) have created a "marvel" (pun intended) of a superhero film that any marvel fan or any film buff would be proud of.The all star cast really says it all. It certainly proves that they are all still at the top of their careers and they don't look like they will be coming down for a while yet. Every actor put in as much work into this film as each other. The acting in this film is something that any movie watcher would enjoy and they would find themselves wondering if they are actually there themselves. Not one part of this glorious work of a film will leave you bored or wanting more.The plot unlike most superhero films actually gets better as it goes on. One of the films directors Joe Russo described this film as a "psychological thriller" and that I can agree with a film that will make you look behind you after going to see it. Civil War is a roller coasts of emotions and intensities, and with surprises that lets be honest no one expected especially that while agent 13 debacle anyway back to the review.This film will make you laugh with the perfect amount of humour from each character the balance out the politics of this film you will not go home disappointed. With well choreographed fighting scenes and intense level of action even Michael bay would be impressed. But not to much to ruin the whole aspect of the film, it's not just about a fight between two friends it's about what's wrong and what's right. Although in my eyes captain America is right! Each character gets plenty of screen time contrary to popular belief and you will be happy that you get the see each character in a way you haven't seen them before. Every character has their own little plot In a much bigger story and they all come to an end by the end of the film. The only problem I have is that it wasn't longer, but...What marvel and their amazing directors have to work on now is the villain although this film is amazing without one, a villain always adds to the tension of a film. Don't get me wrong he was acted brilliantly but marvel just can't seem to get villains right but I can forgive them and so can everyone because the film was so spectacular.This film has changed marvel forever in a good way from a kid friendly film to a kind of gritty suspenseful movie that has elements of terror and realism in it, well for a superhero film that is.To finish this off I would like to say that they did not let us down with the end credits "BOTH" (so stay until the very end) gave us teasers for two new films that got girls and middle aged men alike screaming with excitement after they had finished. To summarise this film is the perfect start the phase 3 marvel films and a great influence on many films to come.Well done Captain I salute you. 10/10 30th April 2016</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Marvel (not just MCU) Movie For Now</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a while, many fans were worrying about how this movie will compare against a particular movie which the title I forgot maybe because it's awful, something that rhymes with "Blackman" I think.Well,no need to worry anymore, because this is by far the Best MCU Movie to date (for me). No spoilers here,just want to say how awesome this movie is. We have the best action scene, the best story, and also the best Spiderman that Marvel movies have given us till now. The Airport battle, as you hope for, amazing, absolutely amazing. The characters have so much complexity and depth that you can see a big change among them especially Tony and Cap. Emotional ending, brilliant, the only letdown probably is Zemo, maybe Marvel really wants to stick with Loki . But, that doesn't matter, with all that's going on in this movie,I give it 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>DC fan girls are shaking in their boots, so you know it's going to be good. BvS was okay but DC should really just stick to animation. I hold out hope for Ben Affleck's solo batman film I think it will be a winner. Also I think Wonder Woman was well represented and look forward to her solo project. Marvel knows they have a winner here, though. Thats why they lifted the review embargo 3 weeks before the movie comes out and they were right. BvS lifted their review embargo 3 days before release, assuming they too had insight to how their film would be received. Let's be honest with ourselves please DC fans. Everyone who has seen Captain America: Civil War, and reviewed it, has come to the same conclusion. So these DC shills come onto sites like these trying to drive down the review numbers in hopes they can prevent some ticket sales. The thing is, they know it's coming and they cant stop it. Like a tsunami on the horizon. A tsunami made of money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Expertly Balanced, Inherently Focused &amp; Emotionally Dense Summer Extravaganza</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Phase 3 of Marvel Studios' shared universe is off to a rousing start as the 13th instalment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe is an expertly balanced, inherently focused &amp; emotionally dense example of blockbuster filmmaking that, despite being stuffed with too many characters, is able to provide each one of them their fair share of screen time but what's more impressive is that it is able to accomplish all that without ever taking the centerstage away from its titular character, thus succeeding as a Captain America sequel rather than coming off as Avengers 2.5.Set one year after the events that transpired in Avengers: Age of Ultron, Captain America: Civil War follows Steve Rogers whose latest mission to prevent a few mercenaries from stealing a biological weapon results in the inadvertent deaths of few civilians, after which the UN decides to introduce a measure to keep the Avengers in check. With some in favour of the Accords while others against it, the group is split into two opposing factions, one led by Rogers &amp; the other headed by Tony Stark. Meanwhile, a new villain emerges and attempts to exploit the weak spot within the Avengers.Co-directed by Anthony &amp; Joe Russo, Civil War finds the duo filmmakers in splendid form as they successfully juggle with the arcs of reprising &amp; new characters without deviating too far from the main premise. By capitalising on the plus points of their previous venture, the Russos make sure that the focus remains on Steve Rogers &amp; his journey while other characters weave in-n-out of his story. The swift pacing &amp; uniform flow is effectively maintained as all the subplots end up contributing to the bigger picture, and is evident in the final showdown, for all the heavy emotions that come into play in that segment feel genuinely earned.The screenplay is no slouch either, for the writers move the plot forward by betting on the emotions at play here instead of letting its big-budget spectacle steer it to the finish line. Unlike previous entries, the collateral damage incurred in the presence of the Avengers is continuously questioned and there is valid reasoning behind all the choices these characters make. The disagreement between Rogers &amp; Stark over international oversight stems from their own experiences as the former's faith in the government is shattered after witnessing the corruption in The Winter Soldier while the latter is willing to submit because he doesn't trust his actions anymore after what happened in Age of Ultron.Captain America: Civil War doesn't sway away from the established Marvel formula. Instead it distills out the impurities by stepping back from the reckless destruction of buildings &amp; cities, and chooses to introspect its characters &amp; their actions on a deeper level while addressing a few serious themes simultaneously. But its effervescent wit is never lost in the process and is consistent in delivery &amp; timing. However, apart from its top-tier editing, the technical aspects don't improve by much and retain the iconography of its predecessors. Set design impress only in bits n pieces. Cinematography employs the frenzy hand-held camera-work at first for its action sequences before correcting itself yet it remains ordinary for the most part. And as far as Henry Jackman's score goes, it's just forgettable.Coming to the performances, Civil War features a marvellous ensemble in Chris Evans, Robert Downey Jr., Scarlett Johansson, Sebastian Stan, Anthony Mackie, Chadwick Boseman, Paul Bettany, Elizabeth Olsen, William Hurt &amp; Daniel Brühl, with further assistance coming from Jeremy Renner, Paul Rudd, Don Cheadle &amp; Tom Holland. Evans remains the lead despite sharing space with so many people and his performance is very measured. With welcome depth added to Tony Stark's arc, Downey Jr. chips in with an emotionally hefty work without discarding his innate charm &amp; magnetic screen presence. And with her allegiance torn between the two factions, Johansson's character finds herself in an interesting spot, which the sultry actress explores quite ably.Black Panther's solo-feature is in the works but his arc still comes full circle in this movie plus Boseman truly nails his part, managing to steal the limelight from the big players on more occasions than one. Stan gets more screen time as well and does a brilliant job in maintaining the dual nature of his character's persona. Olsen plays her part sincerely. Brühl's character silently develops in the background and the rationale behind his sinister plan is believable, relatable &amp; fitting. Rudd definitely makes full use of the window that was available to him yet the most memorable character of them all turned out to be the web-slinging, friendly neighbourhood known as Spider-Man. Appearing in costume in just one sequence, Holland leaves a lasting impression with an energetic performance that brims with vibrancy, excitement &amp; just the right amount of cockiness. The remaining cast members contribute as per the requirement and play their part convincingly.On an overall scale, Captain America: Civil War is definitely one of the strongest films to come out from Marvel Studios' canon and is the summer blockbuster to beat this year. The airport fight scene that was so heavily promoted in the trailers fell a bit short on my expectation scale but the film more than made up for it with an intensely fought-out, masterly choreographed &amp; emotionally involving battle between the two team leaders during its climax. By neatly balancing more than a dozen characters in its 2? hours runtime, the confident direction by the Russos comes with a respite as well as an assurance that the fate of Avengers: Infinity War is in good hands. The latest offering in the MCU is no gamechanger but it is quite possibly the finest implementation of the steps the studio follows to create its recipes, and it benefits greatly from its deftly written script. A thoroughly enjoyable, entertaining &amp; satisfying extravaganza for the masses, Captain America: Civil War is absolutely worth your time &amp; money. Delightfully recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hey guys I just wanted to say first hand I thought BvS was fine. I didn't think it was bad but I didn't think it was great. Now we have Civil War though is awesome! As a film major I tend to look for flaws while watching any movie and I admit there were some flaws and there are a few little plot holes but none of those took away from my experience at all! The movie was fun and I had a big smile on my face the entire time! Of course there are slower parts however those are used to set up the story in a fine way. The acting was superb by everyone, the jokes were on point, the action was great I could praise this movie all day. Definitely my favorite Mavel movie. Now to what I was referring to the review section of BvS was flooded with DC fans saying not to listen to Marvel fanboys that there movie was bad so I thought I could return the favor by saying not to listen to them trying to trash this movie. You're going to enjoy yourself. Black Panther and Spider-Man steal the show and I couldn't stop laughing with Ant-Man and everyone does a great job so do yourself a favor a go have a good time seeing this in the theaters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Captain America: Civil War Review: Very Exciting, Hardly Memorable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 3.5/5 stars"Captain America: Civil War" ushers in the next phase of the Marvel Cinematic Universe with action and thrills galore, but it sacrifices a lot of the wit and does away with the strong adversaries that had made our favorite superheroes' battles all so exciting. Also, unlike "Winter Soldier", Directors Anthony and Joe Russo aren't able to strike a perfect equilibrium between action, drama, humor, CGI, and characterization this time around. However, where "Civil War" scores major points is in having the gumption to delve into thought- provoking themes.After another incident involving The Avengers results in collateral damage, political pressure mounts to install a system of accountability, headed by a governing body to oversee and direct the team. With many people beginning to fear the actions of superheroes, the government decides to push for the Anti-Hero Registration Act, a law that limits the actions of these extraordinary individuals. The new directive fractures The Avengers, resulting in two camps ? one led by Steve Rogers and his desire for The Avengers to remain free to defend humanity without government interference, and the other by Tony Stark following his surprising decision to support government oversight and accountability. Eventually, things escalates into an all-out war between the superheroes while a new foe emerges from the shadows to take advantage of the volatile scenario.At a time when superhero films dominate the summer movie calendar almost every year, "Civil War" aims to lodge itself in the upper echelons of the very best of this action-subgenre, but, somehow, manages to fall just short despite its best intentions and obvious efforts. The movie is very, very good, make no mistake about that, it's just not among the finest from the MCU (like their erstwhile sterling ventures such as "The Avengers", "Guardians of the Galaxy", and this one's own predecessors, "Captain America" and "Captain America: Winter Soldier"). You may love it while watching it, but it's more of a flirtatious kind of love that'll soon dissipate, unlike the profound connect one may have for the other aforementioned titles. Still, it succeeds in being another shining example of how Marvel transforms comic-book action figures into larger-than-life action heroes with real-life character traits and issues, which is one of the prime reasons that it has met with so much success while other superhero franchises have faded away."Captain America: Civil War" is certainly an enjoyable action- adventure that'll appeal to everyone from fan-boys to adrenaline- junkies, to entertainment-seekers to those looking for a well- crafted movie. It just falls a tad short in terms of plotting and believable conflicts in drama, which provide a few obstacles along the way ? especially in the final act. So while "Civil War" may be an appealing movie, it does not end up being a memorable one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WARNING: This review may contain spoilers. This is the first time I write s review in the IMDb site. Captain America: Civil War is amazing, action packed and have incredible visual effects. The story is great, the acting is great, everything is great. Marvel did it again! I'm a big fan of superhero movies and I was really looking for this movie, when I finally got the chance to see it I was completely amazed. My expectations for this movie were huge and it still blew me away, far better that I expected it to be. All the characters are great, specially Ant-Man, Black Panther and of course Spider Man. Tom Holland is great as Peter Parker, you will end up loving his portrayal as spider man. In resume: great movie with enough action and humor and it surely will please Marvel fans, and even people who don't are big fans of superhero movies. Looking forward to Spider-Man: Homecoming. Anthony and Joe Russo did a great job and I'm sure that Infinity War is in good hands.10/10Thanks for reading!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesomeness here and way better then Batman vs Superman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a really awesome superhero movie and definitely better then Batman vs Superman. The battle between 2 sides of Marvel heroes is a great take on what happened in the comics. Also Tom Holland makes a great Spider-Man in this and is way better then that idiot Tobey Maguire. Andrew Garfield was his own Spider-Man and there are many people out there who didn't like Andrew Garfield very much either. I say that Tom Holland makes the best Spider-Man yet and I can't wait to see him again in this new upcoming Spider-Man film next year in July. I also thought that since that this is based on the whole Marvel Civil War that Captain America was gonna die in this cause after the war had ended Captain America is assassinated by Crossbones who was hired by the Red Skull. In this Crossbones is a suicide bomber and when the Falcon tries to stop him from blowing up some people, the bomb destroys a building in Wakanda which is the home of the Black Panther. Then when the government tells Captain America and the other Avengers that people wanted them to work under government vision, Captain America sides with some of the heroes who oppose this while Iron Man sides with other Avengers of his own including Spider-Man who accept it. All this battle between Captain America and Iron Man was because of one man who became a terrorist after he lost his family during the battle against Ultron in Age of Ultron. Then Captain America and Iron Man officially went their separate ways and they both try to do good for the world again. Iron Man became the new leader of the original Avengers while Captain America owns his own team of superheroes. The Secret Avengers. All in all this movie kicks butt and more butt then Batman vs Superman. 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Russo Brothers previously made an excellent film with the Winter Soldier I am happy to say they have done it again. It has been two days since I have seen this movie and I still cannot get it off my mind. The action sequences in the movie are some of the best crafted scenes I think I have ever seen. This film also gave us the best adaptation of Peter Parker ever. The writing, acting, and visual effects are all great. I know a lot of people had problems with Zemo all I can say is I really liked him. Is he the next joker no. He was very important to the plot and I did understand where he was coming from and the motivations of his character. I think this may actually be my favorite superhero movie since The Dark Knight(my favorite movie). All I can say is if you don't go see this film you are a moron. I am very happy with my 10/10 and I am saying this movie is a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Marvel continues its good form with Civil War,a movie which brings together Marvel's best superheroes and makes them fight in a tag team match.This movie has an amazing cast and great performances from Robert Downey Jr.,Chadwick Boseman and Tom Holland.The introduction of Spider-Man to the MCU was one that made everyone want to see him again.The plot is also well written and the final act is thrilling.The after credits scene,where Parker tests a new gadget he received from Stark,is one that planted seeds of suspicion in my mind.On the downside,Daniel Bruhl was wasted as Zemo,a villain so forgettable,I wouldn't have remembered even if he did commit suicide.Also,the fight between the 2 factions is unnecessarily talkative.Just stop talking and fight,Spider-Man!But overall,Civil War is a good superhero movie that shows that Marvel isn't running out of steam anytime soon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Its good but not great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie wanted to be something its not. It wanted to be a psychological movie, it wanted to explore some deep themes but it just sort of scratched the surface then half way through sort of says "well I'm bored of that let's go back to the original marvel family friendly formula". Psychological movies go over the head of kids and it was about the airport scene when it sort of realized this.My biggest thought walking away from this movie was that marvel really dropped the ball with Pepper Potts. You might ask why I refer to a character that is only a throw away mention in the movie. But it was starkly clear to me in this movie that marvel lacks strong female heroes. And Marvel had a female character they could have developed into a very strong female hero. Black Widow and Scarlet Witch have their good points but they are stuffed into support character roles. Pepper could have evolved into Rescue over the course of the now nearly 10 year run we have had with marvel and been tony's equal in a number of ways. Instead she became his mum. And then dropped out when the times got tough. I think this movie could have taken a vastly different and better tone if Pepper had been part of this movie as Rescue, standing beside Tony and not letting his paranoia drive his motivations. And that is just such a let down to the movie. It really is just Tony Stark's paranoia on steroids driving this movie. I get he's supposed to be some what damaged by this point. However using this to drive what should have been a killer movie just seems ... lazy.In saying that I did enjoy Civil War. It was reasonably paced. I like Black Panther. He was a great character and showed the most depth. Black Widow showed depth in being able to take both sides. However the other heroes were just sort of watered down to stereotypes in the end and became a bit one dimensional. I felt this reminded me of Frozen ... it tried to please everyone and it tried to fit all the stereotypes into one movie and in doing so it missed the mark. I give this movie a B-. A good effort but go away and polish it a bit more and you will get an A+.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marvel films are usually pretty good. This gets only a 6 from me.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I always loved Marvel films with all of the comic book characters coming to life. The action and special effects are always great and they are here too. Tough to beat what they had in Deadpool though. This is is little too long and had silly cross stories to fulfill the Civil War prerequisite. They want to fight each other and it gets a little silly through most of the film. If you are into explosions and such, this is fine. But to work your mind and follow what is happening, not so much. I guess I need to write more so I will to get his review in. I really don't have that much to day about the film since none of really sticks to my brain. Great films do that. This one didn't The great part of all these Marvel films is the cameo role of Stan Lee in every film. This one is very late in the film. Also, there is great info about a new Spiderman movie coming in the future with Marissa Tomei as his aunt. She has more lines in the but after al the credits roll than in the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yay! It's better than the mindless garbage that was Age of Ultron!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*Real Rating: 7.5/10*My title says it all. Yes, I was not the biggest fan of Age of Ultron. I thought it was very average and as the months went on, my opinions split from my review: I thought it was worse than it originally was.Civil War is a breath of fresh air but I'll have to start off with the negatives first.1. The plot structure is a bit messy: I feel like Civil War has a bit of an identity crisis. Is it about terrorism? Is it about Bucky? Is it about Captain America? It is about Cap vs Iron Man? Is it about this new team of Avengers? Is it this? Is it that? I feel like there are too many plot elements and unfortunately the strings were not pulled tight enough. One moment the movie was about Cap vs Iron Man. Next moment it was about some terrorist.. All these elements together made it a bit confusing. Yes, things tied up at the end, but it still felt... sloppy. Just a little.2. Bucky: I feel like Bucky is just a little moron who needs to leave these movies ASAP. No questions about it. Just GET OUT! One moment, Bucky is EVIL! SO EVIL! *GASP!* Next moment, he's supposed to be.. good..? It all feels very forced, very unnecessary. I definitely see why he is very useful to this movie and further installments, but I just don't see why he is so important. In this movie, he is literally nothing. Just imagine air. He's there, but we can't see him. Nothing to him. He is just plain air. Now imagine plain air is SUPER, SUPER IMPORTANT to the plot for some reason. He is really annoying and I don't see how I can ever like his character EVER after this movie.3. Crossbones: what was that all about? If he were actually the villain in this movie, this movie would have been better. Is it even a spoiler to say that he is irrelevant?4. Underused characters: Vision? Scarlet Witch? Ant-Man? Oh, you mean those characters who didn't get to show off their powers as much as I had hoped?5. Editing in action sequences: sometimes it was good. Seconds later, I found myself aimlessly staring at the screen as the cuts were too quick and the use of (dare I say it) SHAKY CAM was annoying.---Time for the good stuff.1. The airport scene: YES!!!! JUST YES!!!! That scene was almost perfect. What would have made it perfect for me is if I got to see Scarlet's powers more and Black Widow use some of those amazing moves we see in earlier scenes.2. Black Widow: yes, she gets her own section. She's just so good! There's something so satisfying about this character. The choreography of her literally crawling like a widow up her enemies and tackling them down was AMAZING.3. Visuals: once or twice, there was an odd visual that didn't blend in right, but overall they were beautiful.4. Action Scenes: they were AMAZING! Editing on them could have been better and they could have used some wider, slower shots, but I loved them. My favorite has to be Black Panther's introduction. It was truly beautiful to see this dark creature looming over his prey with the sun glaring behind him. It was beautiful. The scraping of the claws against the walls... His introduction was very well done.5. Directing: overall, the Russo brothers should be very proud. This movie was very well made.---So that's my review I guess.. A well-made movie. Some glaring issues for me that simply cannot be disguised by the positives, but at least the positives are able to balance them out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good for one time watch, don't expect too much</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Its good enough for a one time watch but its not that great. Too many characters make it look crowded. The story seems clichéd and Captain Americas roles seems prejudiced. Robert Downey Jr is great as usual, Evans also does justice to his role too. Rest of the characters like spidy, ant man, hawk eye appear for one fight scene which was shown in the trailers. Action scenes are well directed which has become a hallmark for Marvel. The movie over all despite its aww and pomph movie lacks the usual Marvel punch. The ending of the movie is very emotional and creates an upset in the Avengers story line. We will see how they follow up this plot twist in the coming infinity wars series. Don't set your bar too high if you want to enjoy the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Marvel Movie to date</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just wanna say that your money will be well worth it just because of that one scene where Team Captain America And Team Iron Man finally duke it out. What differentiates this movie from the rest of the other superhero genre is that each character is justified and explained on who they are and why they're here. Yes, the story does revolve around Captain America but each Avenger is given time to be fleshed out at just the right amount to still call this a Captain America movie and not Avengers 2.5. My only problem with this movie is the villain, the problem with almost all Marvel villains (except Loki), his reasons are justifiable but lack a certain depth of antagonism. Finally, one of the best Marvel films out there as of right now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>With Civil War, the Captain America trilogy takes a big step back in the story department and tries making up for it by adding more spectacle.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 2014, when Marvel announced Civil War at their D23 event, it was obvious that they had taken inspiration from the (then upcoming) DC comics' movie Batman v Superman. Superhero accountability, superhero-vs-superhero fights, villain pulling the strings from the shadows, the similarities were countless.So, when Marvel announced this movie, I wasn't very pleased with the idea of trying to match the firepower of your main competitor's biggest weapon by almost copying it. But simultaneously, a part of me was also happy that Marvel decided to go this route for the third Captain America movie because that meant Marvel knew their movies were getting somewhat formulaic, that they had been playing it safe for too long and they were willing to change that.First off, Civil War isn't centered around Captain America, it's centered around the Avengers and that raises the question; why is this movie named Captain America: Civil War and not Avengers: Civil War? Secondly, if, like me, you were expecting this movie to play out like the comic with the same title did, you are going to be disappointed, because in this movie the Superhuman-Registration-Act/Sokovia-Accords take the backseat while the Avengers fight over Bucky.Honestly, the plot of Civil War has a few plot-holes to say the least. But before I talk about the story, I'd like to talk about the cast and crew. Russo brothers are the best directors MCU has ever had and it's good that they will be at the helm of the upcoming Infinity War movies.Robert Downey and Christ Evans gave some pretty strong performances; in fact, I believe this is the best performance Evans has ever given as Captain America. And although I think that this movie would still be the same without Hawkeye, Black Panther, Ant-Man and Spider-Man; the strongest performance came from Paul Rudd. The rest of the cast was good-to-average, nothing special from anyone. Getting tired of the scared/worried expression Johansson keeps making.Talking about the new heroes, nothing really special from Boseman except that his accent was really good, he succeeded at capturing the essence of an African accent. One issue that I had with his Black Panther suit is that the design on his mask seemed convoluted. There's just too much going on and as the face is what the cameras focus on the most, looking at that convoluted mask got a little distracting.Holland's Parker was good but his Spider-Man failed to impress. The suit is okay, nothing special, and his Spider-Man alter-ego was way too comedic and sounded like a 12-year-old. That is pretty much what obliterated the whole tension build-up in that airport battle.Another thing that I found distracting was that the movie had quite a lot of scenes where the CGI felt mediocre. Marvel Studios is home to some of the best FX experts, so I'm not sure how this happened.Coming to the story, there were a lot of plot-holes and unanswered questions. Some of the main ones were; Tony's parents are taking something top-secret to the Pentagon and apparently, the road that they are using is an unsafe and desolated one, moreover, in the middle of nowhere, there happens to be a CCTV camera in one of the trees that records how Bucky murders Tony's parents.Iron-Man isn't even an Avenger anymore, so why is he trying to keep the Avengers together? Stark knows Bucky was under mind-control when he killed his parents, so why does he want to kill him?How on Earth was Wanda not able to break out of the prison but Cap broke in and freed his friends ? How was Rogers able to damage Iron-Man when his suit is made out of the same material that could withstand blows from the Hulk? And how did Iron-Man not kill Rogers when his suit is made out of the same material that knocked out the Hulk? How did Zemo locate the Hydra employee which had the Winter Soldier activation code diary? Zemo killed 5 Winter-Soldiers just because he was sure the video will be enough to make Stark want to kill Bucky? How did Zemo even get into the UN building?Ant-Man's ready to risk his life and become a most-wanted criminal for a complete stranger? Forget getting in touch, how does Sam even know who Ant-Man is? And these are just some of the main ones, there are a lot more. There are a lot of inconsistencies in the plot and many of them are huge. As a weekend popcorn flick, this movie is great, but if you want sophistication and depth, look elsewhere.The only reason why I think they added Hawkeye, Ant-Man, Black-Panther and Spider-Man was probably because they wanted the Civil War to look like a war and not a puny group fight. But even at this, the movie failed to deliver a strong punch. This was a war where no one died and only one person got injured. And how on Earth did Rhodes survive that huge fall? Oh, and Stark's helping Rhodes walk again, so in the end, it was a "war" which had no outcome and during which, nothing permanent happened.But the biggest disappointment comes from the end fight. I'm all for originality and trying something new but if you're doing that, at least have the courage to kill off a few characters. In the comics, Rogers died in the aftermath of Civil War and if the movie wasn't ready to kill him off, I can understand that but the least they could have done is kill off Bucky. What good is he in cryosleep? His death would have added so much more emotional depth and weight to the conflict.In short, Civil War is a solid movie and a great trilogy-ender as long as you don't take it too seriously.Final score 6.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good &amp; Fun movie, potentially overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(another warning that this has spoilers)So, leading up to this movie, I completely lowered any expectations so that I don't bum hard on it because Captain America: Winter Soldier was pretty awesome.Based on the movie overall, it was a good movie. The plot in it's own of hero vs hero is incredible. The biggest downfall for me was the lack of stakes. There was no point in this movie that I thought off that ANY of the heroes would die (war machine falling was in the trailer so going in everyone knew he would live). Death of an important character would have added great emotion and added actual STAKESThe villain was awesome (Baron Zemo), his motivation was quite generic unfortunately (his family was collateral in Sikovia). Black panther was the most intriguing and just plain awesome, looking forward to his solo film. Spiderman was insanely fun, added to the general dull feeling of the movie, and deserves his solo film (homecoming). The moment with him punking Bucky when he grabbed his arm was great. He is like a pg-13 deadpool.Iron Man/Tony Stark was the best part of this film by a mile. His character development since Iron Man 1 is great.This thing about the government having a problem with the superheroes creating collateral after saving the world is just ridiculous. It's a major plot-hole and seems poor and lazy. (i would say they should have a problem with it just because they work in secret, collateral damage happens in government ops too).The infamous 'airport scene' for me is becoming overrated by people clamoring that it is the greatest action scene ever. It is fun and really action-packed but again lacked stakes which makes an actual fight. I know they losing team got locked up in the villain prison, but it was like a scene of pulling punches because one team wants to capture the other and the other just wants to get away. Also who thought that they would be there for long. To top it off, Team Iron Man was OP and could have stopped the others in a second if it was portrayed to match their powers. Still, great action no doubt.The last fight with Iron Man, Captain America and Bucky was awesome. Iron Man wanted to kill Bucky, Cap wanted to protect Bucky and Bucky wanted out. Had a real emotion to it. Again, not to sound like i love death, but one of the 3 should have been killed. (which I know doesn't work because of Avengers coming up)The movie as a whole had a darker tone which is cool but can still fit marvels general sense of humour added to it which this one missed (not just one liners, but rather the general tone). I wasn't let down at all, this is all nitpicking, and really enjoyed it. I still believe that compared to BvS: Dawn of Justice it ranks 1 score lower (only comparing since the release dates were close)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie is great, it's at same level as an Avengers movie, really cool. I was enjoying it fully, until guess what... WORST SPIDER-MAN EVERRR! Andy Garfield, we miss you. This Spider-Man has no appeal as Peter Parker, the costume is ugly, and adds ZERO elements to the plot. They could have included any other Marvel's character, instead, like Wasp or Spider-Woman. But no, they had to trash a previous saga that was going great to insert Spider-Man to the Avengers (another bad move, by SONY). With all and all, the movie is neat and full of action. I want to see it again, it's worth it. Kudos for Black Panther, Vision, Scarlett Witch and Falcon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't get me wrong, this movie is good. It's a masterpiece in comparison to some of the schlock that Marvel Studios have put out in recent years. Iron Man 3, cough, Age of Failtron, cough. In comparison to others movies, it's seems fresh and new. But from a movie quality standpoint, or comic book movie quality, this movie provides nothing exceptional to be crazy about. The story is coherent but there isn't much complexity to it. Don't expect to see The Dark Knight level of writing, or even Batman Begins. My main positive will be the fact that this is the most serious MCU film to date. There are still jokes, and some of them are too cringey, but it's better than have an entire movie that is filled with corny one-liners, Cough, Thor movies, cough, cough. The best thing about this movie is the fact that it's the first time since Iron Man one when we saw a comic book accurate Tony Stark, who's not acting like a clownish cheese ball. This Tony Stark is more darker and serious than ever before, for what I'm thankful, since I'm a die- hard Iron Man fan and I don't like the fact that his personality was so fundamentally changed in movies (along with other thousands of comic book aspects). Now he's little bit more accurate, which is, of course, one of the main qualities in comic book movies adaptations. You have to respect your source material, which MCU doesn't do very often. My main gripe will be that this movie doesn't have big scale. The title is quite misleading, since there is no Civil War in here. The thematic subtext of the Mark Millar's comic is present here, but it's touched not as substantially as in the comic. Other gripe will be the lack of development for a villain, which is the main problem of all the MCU films. Let's face it, no matter how much in love you with the MCU, you have to agree, they don't have good villains in their movies. None of their villains, and that includes beloved by everyone (except me) Loki, are a threat. Their villains are either uncharacteristic plot-devices or uncharacteristic punching bags. Zemo is in the first category. Not really a character with personality, more of a force that pushes story forward. Spider-Man was fine. I wasn't blown away by his appearance. I think if his role in this movie was more subtle and justified I would have been more complementary about his character. However, in reality, he was just a cameo. Fun cameo, but cameo. All in all, 7 out of ten is the best I can give this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good superhero movie doesn't necessarily mean good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK so the consensus regarding this movie is that it is spectacular. I had heard many reviews beforehand plus I was also excited on my own because I would finally get to see the latest incarnation of Spidey, this time by Marvel. (I am a big Spider-man fan). But...is it?Overall the movie flows well and features enough action to justify its ticket price. Definitely a good superhero movie. Well staged choreography with good shots for the most part (e.g I didn't appreciate the "shaky cam" in the beginning) and many characters- heroes whose existence in the movie made sense, or at least they didn't feel "forced". CGI could have been better at times. As far as plot is concerned it was great to explore the moral aspect of the Avengers, did they have the authority to protect, who would supervise them, who is held responsible for all the casualties etc. The scene where they all sit in the living room, talk to each other and offer arguments is one of my favorites.Black Panther was very interesting (the accent was cliché though) and the chase sequence with him, Captain America and Bucky was a charm, although I would have preferred Black Panther to flee the scene. Spider-man set me off quite a bit, mostly due to the fact that he looked too CGI-ish, as if he walked out of a video game. (I like the suit design though). Hawk-eye making an appearance to help Scarlet Witch escape was also a highlight for me. Ant-man was very refreshing and fun to see.Let's get to the problems of this movie. Was it a civil war? Was there hatred? Did they want to kill each other? (Black Panther excluded, he wanted Bucky dead for sure). No is the answer. In truth, Captain America and his team wanted to keep doing what they do and team Iron Man wanted to stop them and bring them to custody. What's the point when you know they don't really want to hurt each other? It's like when Rocky and Apollo Creed decided to fight each other at a private match just for fun. We should have felt awkward to see our favorite superheroes come to that (to say the least). I don't think anybody feared the possibility that someone might get hurt at any point. And Rhodi was merely an accident! Point is, it was just shallow showcasing of everyone's abilities.Then they wanted to finally create the feeling of vengeance to Tony against Bucky (and Cap). And what did they do? They used footage of Bucky killing Tony's parents, I mean come on! (Also how could a security cam capture so many details is beyond me, it even zoomed in Maria's face...). I hate it when they make everything relate to everything. Would it be bad for once to see a sequence that doesn't serve a purpose later on? (I am referring to the great virtual reality scene in the beginning with young Tony and his parents). Furthermore, the villain not only wastes too much screen time, he also has a sincerely stupid plan. How the heck could he know that Captain would get to that Hydra fortress? And that Iron Man would go there too! That stupid villain could sit and wait there for months and months and nobody arrive! Besides, he had nothing to do with the Sokovia accords, which "divided" the Avengers in the first place. He only managed to blame Bucky for that conference explosion.Acting-wise, the trailers promised more than the movie actually delivered. For instance, Tony Stark seemed as if he would be very expressive, but really it wasn't that big a deal. Not much emotion, not even from the scene at the end where he is lying down on the floor with blood on his face. Why? Because just as the audience starts to feel for him, seeing him in this pathetic and humiliating situation, he soon starts talking childish to Cap: "You don't deserve this shield, my father made this shield". For the love of God! Shhh! Just have him stare at nothing for a while with a sad bloody face, or even cry a tear. Which brings me to my final argument. I know Marvel loves to throw a funny line here and there, but isn't it time this stops at some point? So that we know it's a more serious situation here? Every now and then it was a constant pattern, e.g somebody falls, he says something funny. Oh and Spider-man was not funny, he just talked all the time as if exploring the world for the first time, very naive. I know he is supposed to be 15 but even he himself could have freaked or panicked at something during the airport fight. Was everything so charming to him? Is he so accustomed to fighting superheroes?"Civil War" is very entertaining and a pleaser for every superhero fan. It is money well spent and a 2 and half hour spectacular show of visual effects and stunts. But a good movie it is not, sadly. Eventually you will neither come out of the cinema any wiser from seeing this nor feel you experienced anything groundbreaking or highly artistic. To me it doesn't seem to surpass films such as the first "Avengers" or the "Winter Soldier". So for all of you seeing reviews praising the film, know that they are exaggerated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Marvel Movie which completes an A+ Cap Trilogy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It feels like everything that Marvel touches turns to gold - CA:CW is no different. The greatness of The Avengers was in seeing all the heroes we'd seen in solo movies coming together, and apart from a couple of minor blips (Iron Man 3, Thor 2), Marvel has continued to build on the great story-telling.The Russos have knocked it out of the park with Civil War. Some call it Avengers 2.5 - but this is most definitely a Captain America movie. Continuing on from Winter Soldier and picking up the Bucky Barnes narrative, woven into the wider MCU, introducing T'Challa and Spidey, makes this (almost) the largest scale, yet most personal Marvel movie to-date.Seeing Steve and Tony on opposite ends of a grey spectrum, trading physical and psychological blows, was immense. This was not good v evil - this was the trauma of real world, life-changing decisions.To see Iron Man see that Bucky was not the villain he was framed as, only to give in to the understandable emotion of watching the grainy footage of The Winter Soldier killing his parents illustrates the nuanced story-writing that permeates this movie.The are great moments of humour as well - especially from Spidey, who the Russos absolutely nailed. Big expectations for 'Homecoming' but i'll be surprised if that doesn't become the biggest Spidey movie yet.There are real consequences from the decisions made by the major players and the emotional beats at the end from Steve and Tony underpin that The Avengers have been torn apart from the inside and the MCU will never be the same, perhaps until a certain common enemy in the form of Thanos units the Infinity Stones, bringing The Avengers back together.While Bucky's story hasn't ended (I'm sure of it), Civil War, as well as serving the wider MCU narrative, is a fitting finale (?) to the Captain America trilogy. I would thoroughly recommend watching The First Avenger, The Winter Soldier and Civil War back to back. For me, it's up there with the best movie trilogies of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where is the Plot?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The new Marvel movies seem to follow a formula these days. It's obvious executives have a chart of what sells and what doesn't. Riskier Marvel movies have not sold as well and the more serious they are it seems the less revenue they generate. So executives basically have forced the studio to use a plot that revolves around elaborate CGI action sequences mixed in with a little dialogue to keep the movie going along.Except... this movie doesn't really have any plot at all. It doesn't really have a conclusion.The movie seems like Avengers on steroids but without the climax. A Civil War with more characters than most fans can even point out at this point. They introduce Black Panther and even bring yet a newer version of Queens, NY's finest. How many renditions will they do on the web crawler? Ironman, Captain America, Black Widow all appear the same and their newness has faded movies ago. Their sidekicks have returned to but are even more forgettable.The villain in this movie is just bad. I don't mean a bad man, I mean just a terrible villain for a movie of this magnitude. Captain America Civil War? Where was the war? Seemed more like an argument and a 10-15 minute battle with a few punches.In my sold out premiere, many people walked out before the after credits scene. I probably should have too. 6/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This mid avengers movie (as it is about as much as Cap. America as Iron Man) gives the usual perfectionism regarding the big screen fights of several super-heroes. But there are 2 problems which bothered me during watching the movie. The story tries to be different. Not the usual good against the evil, but how shall we act to be good otherwise you will be bad. It would be a positive thing, but then there is a twist: a good man turns into evil due to his acts just to punish these super-heroes because of their former acts. And then it turns to much for a comic based film. We got a personal revenge hierarchy (at the end it closes with the meeting of Black Panther and Zemo) which I feel completely useless and unreasonable. A good man(?) is ready to kill several innocents just to take a revenge on the super-heroes due to his very personal innocents' death. Should the movie take this whole revenge story so personally? The other problem is: its more sadistic/explicit violence. The water-boarding torture scene was completely useless again. Hey! This movie is for children as well, on the other hand the mood of this movie just does not need such things. I can say it is almost as good as The Avengers or The Winter Soldier, but these 2 bothering things affecting the story and the mood makes it not so enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>People will probably be mad that I only gave this a 9/10, but come on, I still love this movie! Anyway, I was expecting this to be an adaptation of the "Civil War" Marvel comics, but it really wasn't. It didn't feature much of the story elements, although I haven't officially read the series, so I can't judge. Let's hope Spider-Man doesn't end up making a deal with Mephisto. Speaking of which, Spider-Man is probably what attracted people the most to this movie. It's amazing to think that in only ten years, this character has been played by three different actors in three different continuities. It just seems a waste to not put "The Amazing Spider-Man" series in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Now, of course this Spider-Man is better than that version.A lot of people were afraid that Spider-Man would just immediately appear, or would at least only be seen briefly. As someone who has seen Agents Of Shield or more importantly Agent Carter, it was great to see a connection to the TV shows with her funeral being held. It was weird how they didn't mention Nick Fury. At least Thor and the Hulk were mentioned. It's too bad that Thor did not appear as he happens to be my favorite Avenger. I admit to being confused as to why they were deemed too powerful to be in the movie. I mean, just put them on different sides, duh! I've complained way too much. What matters is that we get to see more development with Bucky, who probably shines here the most. He even set a record for longest time to resurrect a character in the comics, as it was forty years! It seemed downright insane, but it ended up making some great movies out of it. I love how these characters all have unique personalities. It's always great to see new developments featuring superheroes who have to deal with the consequences of their actions. The fights the characters have with each other make a lot more sense. We even get some great personal stuff with Iron Man. The action scenes are amazing with all these wonderfully bright characters taking part in these great fights.Black Panther is also introduced and really gets a great scene at the end. This movie may not have affected the status quo of the Avengers that much, but is definitely worth watching. ***1/2.</fullReview>

But this epic movie is not one of those boring movies. It mixes in the various complications of the real world, where superheroes should work according to governments. But captain knew these governments very well and this started all the action and drama. Action , I mean just action with a very little history or reasons behind doesn't gives much. You always asks yourself ,this much fight just for gold or some superpowers. But here ,there is a whole lot of reasons due to which heroes turned against heroes.All in all, this is a great superhero movie in which you will not find anything stupid, but if you find it stupid , then you are negligent to drama which creates action.

		<shortDescription>Don't be fooled by the overly positive reviews- Captain America Civil War is a perfectly average blockbuster.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was good. Nothing more, nothing less. As with every Marvel film, you'll get a few laughs and some good action, with a hard-hitting and emotional ending (this film in particular tugged at my heart-strings).All the acting was reasonable, and the points it raised were developed quite a bit more than in its DC counterpart. Though the action was thrilling and quick paced, the amount of shaky cam made it extremely hard to distinguish the different characters in each fight scene. The giant host of characters all played a significant role, especially Black Panther and Zemo. Both Spiderman and Black Panther were introduced very well into the story, offering an insight into what effect the Avengers have on the world when they are not saving it. The most intriguing and compelling character is not Captain America or Bucky, but the new villain, Zemo. I find him a lot more interesting than a lot of the other Marvel villains (the only other memorable one being Loki) as he is not trying to shoot a giant laser-beam-thingy into the sky, or cause citywide, CGI destruction, but avenging his family in a personal vendetta against Captain America. Tom Holland is perfect as Spiderman, with an eagerness and authenticity not portrayed in the previous adaptions of his character. Tony Stark finally relinquishes his role as the walking quip-dispenser in this film, instead having an emotional story arc that makes the last 20 minutes of the film a violent yet tear-inducing action fest.Captain America and Bucky's relationship is at the forefront in this film, a great continuation of what the Winter Soldier started. However, the Captain America part of the film is very unbalanced with the 'civil war' part. Whilst it is a good film, I can't stress enough that it is only an average film. Nothing outstanding happens, nothing awful happens, there is not a single bad action scene, but there is not a single good scene that involves the signing of the Sokovia accords.All in all, I enjoyed the film but I am not really invested with the Marvel franchise anymore; there are too many characters, films and subplots for me to even bother remembering. Don't let my review dictate whether or not you see the film, as I am slightly biased to DC and have a long - withstanding dislike of Marvel after Age of Ultron and Thor:the Dark World. You should definitely not miss this film.</fullReview>

You do, however, not feel this movie had any consequences - and we kind of find ourselves in roughly the same spot as before. The Avengers, for instance, do take sides throughout the film, and yet it ends saying that "oh we're not REALLY parted after all". The film, instead, should have worked more as a point of no return- thing, so that we felt it mattered and that it had part to play. CA:CW is great movie that - regretfully - didn't really matter.This movie sort of feels like the good version of BvS.

If I knew the final scene is just about iron=man being beaten by captain America the winter soldier, I will leave the cinema after the fight between team captain America and iron-man team. yeah I'm disappointed, why the smart enemy, which can masquerade as winter soldier, and psychologists do not evoke the other super soldiers? when said many soldiers as strong as captain America and winter soldier are there. Why just make avenger fight each other? if he was not able to beat the avenger, why not use a super soldier? I was hoping when captain America beaten by iron-man, suddenly he was attacked by some super soldiers, when captain America almost lose the support of other avenger come. the film is still pretty good, but only until the team war scene</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Avengers 2.5, Not good Captain America 3</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a Chinese fan girl&#xff0c;I watched CACW. Talking with my friends, now I want to say something, Sorry my English is not good :(Yes, this is a good movie, 3 story lines, so many characters, nice fight. Nice cut, truly. (I am a writer and director, I know how hard to cut a movie have 3 story lines and more than 12 characters) Russo brothers did their best. But it's not a great Captain America 3 movie, it's a great Avengers 2.5 movie.Did the Marvel cut too much Cap and Bucky and Falcon's inner drama time? Most time Cap and Bucky's inner are quite and quick, it's a narrated tricks. Ironman had more lines and......I really don't care how hot about Aunt May...that's the Spiderman movie need to say.) (Spiderman is cute, but the part of Ironman with Aunt May is too long.) (And don't tell me why Cap and Agent 13 had a kiss, a little incest, so much awkward.)If I write this moment, I will write like this:Cap: So...(lines about CA2 story, nurse)13: ...maybe. ( Cap kissed her on her face/Cap hugged her) Cap: It should be happened earlier. (In the car, Sam and Bucky smiled. When Cap back the car, they stared him&#xff09;Cap:...what? No, not you guys thinking - Bucky: I know, pal, I know. (Sam nodded&#xff09;------Marvel, you must to know: A good movie has a good story, and the movie should show a good story to the watchers.Yes, it's a nice popcorn movie, nice fight nice joke nice CGI - I watched movie, I can remember everyone, I understand why they choice their own side, except Cap and Bucky's heart. Cut narrated trick will make some watchers confused, especially when this movie had so much to say.I know Marvel you want 51:49 in the choice side, you win. Take my money.Marvel, do you want more money? How about Director's Cut in Blue-Ray? I am serious. Two edition, the movie and Director's Cut. I think Director's cut could be better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So many Marvel and DC Comic based films popping out like wild fire, though the only question becomes "does the story follow the comic?". Well that shouldn't be the question, the question should be "is it entertaining"? If we were to evaluate each film that is based on a comic, a book, or a true story; then we'd see that none of the stories match up. Yes Captain America: Civil War (2016) stepped outside the bounds a bit from the comic stories, and who really cares. It does say the movie is based on Characters in a comic, it doesn't say this movie is based on book 14 etc.Captain America: Civil War (2016) is a fairly done film with a ton of hiccups within the green screens, graphics, story, and a whole lot more but?.., was it entertaining? Yes the movie was entertaining!!!, and no it didn't follow lick for lick with the comics but it was a fun flick. I love the cast that they have been using, I really enjoyed that they brought in Antman and Spiderman. Is this a blockbuster hit? No and I haven't saw a blockbuster hit in years, so if you like comic related action films then check Captain America: Civil War (2016) out; it's worth a viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After the big success of Captain America the Winter Soldier, you you obviously expect Captain America Civil war to be at least of the same level ! It is more than that ! It surpassed it ! Great plot , solid scenario , unexpected outcomes , tensions between heroes , no way for easy ending. There even was some comedy with the introduction of Spiderman . It was needed seeing the serious tone of the movie !The only catch with that film for me , was the 3D treatment , it sucked ! If you watch it in 2D it's already good .I was literrally stuck to the screen the during the whole film ! Now i can't wait to have it on blu ray to shake the walls of my house ! Go watch it , have a great time</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Spoiler-Free Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Captain America: Civil War would not have been possible if it weren't for the shared Marvel Cinematic Universe. If this was attempted without all the other Avengers movies and Iron Man movies, this movie would not be as good, and it is proof that the Marvel model of making movies works when done with enough forethought. In Civil War, Iron Man and Captain America find themselves at odds over a new bit of legislation that would have the Avengers answering to the United Nations. Cap thinks the Avengers should remain free to make their own choices, while Iron Man believes they need oversight, thus the battle commences. While there are a great many twists and turns that happen, I don't want to spoil that for anyone, because all anyone wants to really know is if this movie is worth their money, and that is a resounding yes.Look, by this point if you haven't jumped on the Marvel Studios train, this movie wont be the thing that gets you onboard, but if you have been a fan of every Marvel movie thus far, then this is going to be an emotional roller coaster ride from start to finish. This is top notch blockbuster movie-making and it needs to be experienced on the big screen. Directors Anthony and Joe Russo really get these characters, which is why it's great that they're also directing the next two Avengers movies. Of course the greatest aspect of Civil War is that while it features a lot of Avengers and can at times feel like another Avengers movie, it still never forgets that Captain America is the main character of this movie. While I still personally would have loved to have seen another Cap solo movie instead, like The Winter Soldier, Civil War is a great substitute.I give Captain America: Civil War a 9 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Assembled Super Hero Movie Yet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the disappointment of Age of Ultron and Batman v Superman, Civil War stood up and taught us why a great script is the stepping stone that every big superhero movie should be based on. It showed how every character must be treated and why their development is important. The characters were all well done. Spidey inclusion made the movie fun and more lighthearted, Black Panther was interesting and important to the story, and both had some cool action scenes. Captain America and almost everyone else were well presented, they had their time to shine and a coherent and understandable reason to choose a side in the story (except maybe for a rushed Vision). However, Iron man was the most complex one and Robert Downey Jr's portrayal of him was perfect, it was very pleasant to see in a character with so many changes of mind that all those changes were rationally and emotionally well motivated.The villain was one of the best of the MCU, he had the most rational plan of all MCU villains (with also a cool twist plot), Bruhl was great and made the most "normal" villain the most harmful one. It was a normal movie technically-wise (same aesthetics in every MCU movie) but had remarkable action scenes. The mayor issue I encountered was the pacing in the beginning, it was quite rushed, and the movie seemed destabilized and messy until it found its way. It's easily one of the best MCU movies and I'm glad to see the Russo brothers will be directing Avengers 3.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Alltime best Marvel movie- Personally my favorite movie of all time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Civil War is a brilliantly crafted, action packed, full of story, fun- fest with deeper meaning. The movie didn't include as much humor as put into most Marvel movies, which I personally feel is right. The jokes weren't rushed and they were really funny. All the heroes got fair screen-time, not as so as Ant-Man, but later in the movie they made up for Ant-Man's missing screen-time for almost half the movie. Spider-Man was amazing, quippy, clever, and spectacular. There were some scenes where he doesn't look entirely real, and more on the CGI side, but I didn't mind it at all. There are many twists, and things you don't see coming, but it's very enjoyable. The last quarter-ish, it get's a little dark, and I loved it. I will definitely be watching it again, and buying it when it comes out on DVD/Digital/Blu-Ray.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant on all accounts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Going into this movie I had EXTREMELY high expectations, upon seeing the trailers in theaters and YouTube I was in awe, and most times would tear up (which really doesn't happen often to me) and I know it seems silly but I was extremely excited to see that Bucky and Steve would be reunited. So it came as a great relief that this movie FAR surpassed my expectations.Civil War gave these larger than life heroes more dimension and allowed us to really connect with the characters. Especially for those we were just introduced to such as Wanda and Vision. Early on we see how great Cap's team is working together, they really have a great relationship and are able to rely on each other's decisions. When Wanda explodes the building you can see the extreme distress over these people's lives in her face and in Steve's voice. And this is essentially the spark of the accords debate. When the remaining in action heroes are called together to discuss the accords both sides had rational arguments but you could see that there would be a divide almost immediately. Because we already know the divide and reasoning due to commercials it wasn't that much of a shock, but Cap's decision defy the government was so uncharacteristic, because of his past, but it makes sense. He believes that the best way to save lives is to leave the decision to the people doing the saving. He knows that after Hydra the government can be corrupt and this is something he doesn't want to happen again.While Peggy Carter deserved more than a 3 minute funeral, it was instrumental in making Steve's decision solidified. I liked how the directors utilized Sharon's speech to apply to Steve's current situation. Moving on to my favorite aspect of the movie, the friendship between Steve and Bucky. Steve is steadfast when it comes to protecting Bucky, he turns his back on 117 countries and his close friends for this man who is his only connection to the past now that Peggy is dead. You can really see that both men care a great deal about the other and they know each other very well. In the fight against Tony they move so well together that you would think that they had fought together all their lives but in reality they haven't. There are two things in this movie however, that I do not agree with. The Sharon kiss was completely unnecessary. The whole premise of their relationship is very forced and awkward, especially because she is related closely to Peggy. They don't know each other very well and their only connection is Steve's love for Sharon's aunt. There is obviously a much better choice for a romantic interest for Steve: Bucky Barnes aka James Buchanan Barnes aka The Winter Soldier. They obviously have a lot in common, they've know each other for a long time, they are all the only connection to the other's past. They care tremendously for each other's well being both mentally and physically and they work very well together. And a bisexual Steve would be incredible representation for the LGBTQ+ community, as would a gay or (even better) bisexual Bucky. The only other thing I am upset with is Bucky putting himself back into a cryogenic sleep. It makes more sense for him to stay awake at T'Challa's headquarters and research and do tests on himself. Because as T'Challa said Bucky is very safe at his headquarters. It just doesn't make sense to me, hopefully by the end of Avengers Infinity War Part 1 we get Bucky back.So I'm sure that was not a very traditional review, maybe it wasn't a review at all. But I hope it is appreciated.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For all the people with sticks up their butts, this movie was excellent. You wouldn't know a good movie if it was right in front of you. Civil War is what every movie should be. It made over a billion dollars and is the 6th all time grossing movie. Clearly it was fantastic. If not, then why did it make so much money? It was fun, exciting, and had a fantastic plot. Watch it again and maybe you'll see how great it is. 10/10! I can't wait to see what's next in the marvel cinematic universe. Where will the heroes go from here? Thanos is coming and it's going to be crazy insane. Will Ant-Man be giant again? Will Bucky show up in Black Panther? Will Cap get a new shield? So many questions to ask and little answers for now. I hope you're excited!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Movie. That's it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I know this review is going to get a lot of hate, which is understandable because superhero fanboys will attempt to destroy anything that doesn't give their movie a 10/10. I give it a 7.5/10, because I thought it was a good, serviceable movie...but it's so stale at this point.There's nothing different in this movie that hasn't been seen in previous Marvel movies. I didn't have any investment in any of the characters ideologies whatsoever. I found points in the movie a bore and zoned out at quite a few points, which isn't that big of a deal because it's a really simple plot and you can easily tell what's happening. The action scenes were cool, but I don't think any of them were really memorable, besides some moments in the airport and besides the final fight between three characters - because honestly, that's when a fight actually had some good emotion behind it.I know that it looks like I'm shitting all over this movie, but I would recommend people to see it. It IS a good movie. It IS good big screen entertainment. I've only ever really liked about 4 of the 13 Marvel cinematic universe movies, so at this point, it seems kind of obvious that the world has grown stale to me. If this had been one of the first Marvel movies I had seen, it probably would've blown my mind. But it didn't. There hasn't been any unique visual or story telling styles, despite the various directors that have been involved with the film universe. There's no flare. They're just studio films at this point. No originality to their look. It grows tiresome and boring.Now we get to the obligatory "is this better than BvS". The answer for me is...not really. They sit on the same level. Both a 7.5/10. Although BvS had its problems, its visual flare was enjoyable to watch and it did have some brilliant moments scattered about poor decisions. Civil War doesn't do anything poorly, it just doesn't do anything brilliantly either. At this point, I attribute it to Marvel fatigue. I'm sure that when DC starts releasing movies I'll have the same problem with it eventually so don't act like I'm hating on Civil War for the sake of hating it.Besides the fight between three towards the end of the film (the one in the trailer), my other favourite moments was everything Spider- Man. Although we didn't have enough time to get fully acquainted with the new Spider-Man, I enjoyed every scene he was in and I look forward to watching his standalone film. At this point, I still like Toby Maguire the most as Spider-Man but he has a real contender with Tom Holland.Overall, I really loved some moments in the movie....and I think the rest is forgettable. Honestly, it's only been 2 days since I saw it and I can't even remember the reasons they started fighting, the "bad guy" (another weak Marvel movie villain - they just can't do villains well) or the majority of scenes. 7.5/10. You'll probably love it if you're a Marvel fanboy.If you're curious, yes, I am a DC fanboy. But I also love a quite a few Marvel characters. I did grow up with superheroes after all. But that doesn't mean I can't admit when aspects of superhero movies are crap. Because at the end of the day, my love for film trumps my love of superhero movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty much an average film from marvel a lot of mistake in the filming &amp; casting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Likes : People are entitle to opinion which is fair enough , I'm sure i will get a lot fan boy with stupid comments about what I'm about to say here, to be honest i don't care what they have to say because its my job to be objective point out the good &amp; bad about this film, oh boy there is a lot of bad with some good.There are certain part i liked other i didn't , some areas of the film felt awkward like certain things were force , but The film story-line is bad its just felt winter soldier had a better feel than this film. The fight scene are brilliant choreograph the acting is pretty sold , we get to see any ant man with a new power which was unexpected but kind of cool , but can't help feel they copied that from DC atom. The film story follows the aftermath of age of ultron perfect along with some new development that force the government to act on group with the registration act as certain events cause a lot of death , but the story also seem to be a redemption for Bucky which was a good story continuity. Action scene were good but some scene which i will put in the dislike were that great on screen , Were introduced with two new characters x-bones &amp; black panther. Although x-bone's feel more of a cameo which i though he was one of the big villains in the marvel universe which felt a little off. Black panther i will say was pretty awesome in the suit , the picture didn't really do the suit justice, but seeing it on the screen was better.Chadwick Boseman was perfect casting choice for black panther , carried himself amazing on screen for a protector of his country with a brilliant performance. I'm glad they gave Elizabeth Olsen character with a better in depth look at her role showing a more human side to her with an awareness of her own powers we saw more depth to her character with some quick witty humour.Comparing this film with the last one i can say that winter soldier had the better story all round , although civil has more of the emotional drama in it which is good , the tension between tony &amp; captain is pretty clear in this film even more that the tony past come's up in the film adding even more problems between them. There are some problems with this film but its not a bad film to watch , its some i can recommend to watch but don't except anything special from the film. Dislikes : There is several problem's with this film one is starting with the camera work for the film , I've said this a few time in the past shaking camera in action scene is god awful when your trying to watch a fight scene the camera is all over the place. Directors seem to think this add for dramatic effect but its not help the film in any way because your hardly seeing the action because the camera isn't focus on the people fight, its make you sea sick which I'm glad i watched this in 2D, because the shake camera really hurt the eyes when your trying to watch a fight sequences. This happens through most of the fights its hard to see what is going, this is why this shake camera effect need to stop because it ruin the flow of the film.Second problem is character development although Chadwick Boseman performance was brilliant with black panther there was nothing in a origin story what so ever , it felt like they had just thrown his character in just to introduce him with any back story other that a few words of how he became the black panther. This is bad script writing leave the character in an odd position of Iver feeling out of place or just thrown in for extra characters to fill the gaps with out thinking about it, sadly to say its a let down for such a great performance.The third I'm sure I'm gonna get a lot of flack for is spider-man , what the hell were they thinking don't get me wrong the spider-man suit look great, he had the right body size for spider man , as much as Tom Holland is a good actor this was not the right role for him.The scene with spider-man felt out of place even the acting wasn't right for spider-man, this is bad casting because Tom Holland is a good act but he doesn't have the right cocky attitude that peter Parker has as spider man , the only person that has ever come close was Andrew Garfield. Im not being funny spider-man in this film felt so awkward &amp; out of place special with the banter just wasn't the right tone this is a failure for casting. Fourth thing i noticed is the banter &amp; campy joke even they felt awkward at times , don't get me wrong there are a few time its funny but some of the joke seriously fall flat on face unfunny awkward joke at the wrong moments this is not the standard marvel film usual has.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Action packed movie but not better than Batman V Superman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all I want to say this is an Action packed movie but it's not better than Batman V Superman. There are so many heroes that it will impress you, the action scenes and story line are tight and the action is non-stop, you wont be disappointed. There are a few breakout stars, Tom Holland is big in this movie and stole the show, also Paul Bettany as the Vision is just Awesome, he brings an intellect and presence that is better than the Vision ever was in any comic adaption since the beginning, yes he's good, and he must be in Avengers 3! Also Jeremy Renner was really good in this film, he really proved his usefulness, he just gets better with each film, he was good in AV2 so I hope he will show in AV3 and any other Marvel films he shows up in why he's an Avenger. However once we get the Excellent action sequences and the excellent story line, there's the unfortunate consequence of loosing a lot of Robert Downey's marvelous charisma and wow factor, we don't get to see too much of the magic that we've seen on AV 1&amp;2 and the Iron Man movies, the story keeps moving along which is good but we miss seeing his good side, remember he is still a good guy, he's still a hero at the end of the day even if he's not a role model, we don't get to see that good, funny charismatic and charming side of him which makes him radiate. I hope he will in Avengers 3 and we also missed those little brainsy verbal interchanges where they point out surprising and thought proving parts of each of their characters as they did in Avengers 1&amp;2, please keep those sharp verbal exchanges coming they really make the film. Also another consequence of the fast moving story is, there are no supporting characters, Gwyneth Paltro, but they did include William Hurt which could mean another Hulk Movie? To tie in with Avengers 3? I hope you realize how important these supporting characters are and hope to see Stellan Skarsgard, and Natalie Portman, along with Paltro, and a few others at the Final in Avengers 3. However before then please make sure Thor 3 Rocks and if possible have Hulk in it, Ragnarok and Hulk smash, sound great together like peanut butter and Jelly and please make sure Tom Hiddleston (Loki) is there he is just fantastic! Finally Thanos must be not only a force to be reckoned with but should look the part, and the kitari should be done away with for another better alien army like oh say the Skrull (you showed the Kree in Guardians)and maybe you could throw a new F.F. this time get it right (the last one was bad) stick to the comics, Reed Richards is a serious scientist, get a whole new cast this time, better and more serious this time (although the thing and torch should still joke around) lets see Galactus and Terrax the Tamer and the return on a better Silver Surfer this time get his powers right, they don't come from the board, an appearance from the Watcher, and the Celestials would really be sweet. Make sure you get a director that loves the F.F. Like Sam Raimi loved Spiderman, do make Doom look like Doom with the mask, an Iron man type armor, with the dark green robes hood and make him have presence please, a heavy character. It would be great to have the Skrull invasion they are the most visually striking and interesting aliens and they should be kept the way they are, yes green, with the weird chin and the shape shift, and the Super skrull as well as Annihulus could pop in, the Imperial guard and the Kree all very exciting stuff. I mean if we are geeking out then get Geek done right, look up some of the John Byrne inspired comics for these stories no one wrote them better or more intelligently or as exciting as he did. Speaking of which look up his Hulk comics probably the best and before he left he did the incredible to the hulk and banner, on his last issue, check it out and we never found out what would have happened when the two were separated.The last thing I will say is Batman V. Superman made great use of their supporting characters and the story as interesting and tight as it was made use of the characters everyone shined, including the music, the special effects, the attention to detail, the lighting cinematography was not lost on the eye of the beholder and I hope Zack Snyder does not listen to these critics who were ever so wrong about that movie being a flop, he proved them wrong, and I hope he continue the exact train of execution for this cinematic masterpiece, well done Zack. Last thing I have to say After Avengers3 there must be a Avengers V, Justice League film where the public will vote who wins in each fight, this is thrilling stuff the both camps have done, never before has something as wild as this been put on screen, make this happened you hear me out there Marvel, DC? You will make billions!!! and break every record out there and the excitement level will be off the charts!!! P.S. Bring back the Comic Code Authority, don't try to pretend you don't know what it is, protect our kids from objectionable content that these wild writers are penning, you hear me talking to you, alright I'm out of here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Captain America: Civil War is the greatest superhero movie, it was Spectacular, Epic, and had the greatest superhero moments. Captain America: Civil War was Outstanding, it focuses on each hero and gives them enough screen time to make us want to love this movie. Captain America was now considered my favorite hero because he stood up to the government and fought for the rights of every hero. Black Panther was awesome in each scene and made me feel sorry for his fathers death. I thought the villain was a very manipulative and clever getting the avengers to fight each other and framed Bucky Barnes for the murder that made Black Panther join the fight. Captain America: Civil War had great humor, incredible acting, interesting plot, and wonderful action. The movie to me was considered the most ANTICIPATING movie and the GREATEST Superhero movie ever.</fullReview>

People complaining about holes in the plot, how a camera would have been there to see Starks parents death, how captain America could have known about Starks death, why couldn't ironman have got this info before , so many question , but it's a movie , you don't need to know how EVERYTHING came about , the movie would be boring and very very long if everything was explained in such a way. Yes the plot line has flaws, yes it kind of feels like two movie merged together and could have just been called avengers, and yes some characters appear for no apparent reason but to fight , but hey , this is a super hero movie , a fun action movie , that's how it's meant to be entertaining , it's not w novel prize winning novel, it's not a serious drama , it's there to enjoy , not sit there and pick holes in.I enjoyed the movie , I enjoyed the action scenes , and I enjoyed seeing characters like ant man and spiderman join in. Spiderman was pictures as he should be , a slightly enjoying kid, spiderman has never been a really grown up dark character. Sometimes I got a bit lost as to what was going on and the reasoning for such things , and I also got a bit annoyed with the shaky cam, bit over all the movie was fun, it wasn't perfect , but it wasn't the disaster people make out.</fullReview>

They obviously rushed spider man into this train wreck ought of fear of batman and Superman's popularity.....this was supposed to be the movie that changed everything but instead it changed nothing...going in I was on team cap but now I'm on team nobody</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was pretty good there were some scenes in the movie that did not add up but overall it was good. It did not meet my expectations but it was still better than a recent movie that came out. I cannot talk too much about it as it will ruin the story-line for many people. The acting of each character was amazing but the story line had its flaws. I did not know who's side to choose iron man or captain America I was quite confused. Captain Ameriica and Iron Man were the ones who stole the spotlight and made this movie amazing. This movie was a fun action packed movie and I highly recommend it but there were little errors in the story line. But overall loved it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>BvS shouldn't have had that review when it's basically the same movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not different from BvS, plot and pace wise, but it's got comedy...so yeah scratching my head at the critics. plot would've progressed even without the addition of a certain character; same bad review they bashed BvS for and still the critics rave. Well because they're paid by evil Disney. Just one big ploy by an evil corporation. One character wasn't exactly needed in the entire film, and yet they chose to add him to add comedy and a hype factor. Characters disappear from action every upcoming fight scene and you were left to wonder what they were doing when they absolutely can do something when an opponent was incapacitated. What the hell is the all powerful "Eyesight" doing even with the power of the cosmic "brain" gem. If this movie gets that much love from critics then BvS deserves a second look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fun experience, but not a great film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is by no means a great film. It's just solid, good fun. The fantastic action sequences were well shot, but other than that the cinematography was lacking. At times, I felt the framing and color palette made the film look like something that was made for television.The score for the film is lacking as well, especially for a film of this magnitude. It would have been nice to stray away from the generic, somewhat flat score, and instead have something more befitting of the films scale. The score at times undercut the epicness of what was transpiring on screen, which was quite jarring for me. The acting was fantastic. Robert Downey Jr. in particular gives his best performance as Stark to date. And the writing for his character is quite fantastic as well. I think it's fair to say I'm Team Iron Man.It's impossible to hate this film or call it terrible. I would gladly recommend this film to anyone, though I'd tell them to keep their expectations in check. Ultimately, I think this is a film that won't age too well, in the same way as The Avengers (2012). That film was hailed as one of the best films ever when it was released, rated above 9 on IMDb and with a very good Rotten Tomatoes rating. But as time went on, and people judged it for it's cinematic elements rather than the gimmick of seeing those characters on screen for the first time, the perception of the film changed. I think the same should happen with Civil War, because it's more reliant on the spectacle rather than it's cinematic quality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing film, beats The Dark Knight and becomes the best superhero film of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Title. I loved this film. The action, the treats of Spider-Man. One of the best parts IMO is seeing Spider-Man take down Ant-Man like the AT-ATs on Hoth.This did not kick off Infinity War in a conventional stance IMO, but it did great things with the Avengers, seeing them disassemble and duke it out to see who's view was better.And Baron Zemo was awesome, very villainous presence. This movie beats Batman v Superman by a landslide. Would rate 11/10 if I could.To finish it all off - This Movie Was GR8 M8 8/8 pls no h8 i appreci8, l8r h8rs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>meh</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have tried to avoid spoilers in this review to the best of my ability.While there are several good things about Captain America Civil War,including one terrific action sequence, it suffers from the same faults as Age of Ultron. That is to say that the characters don't engage the audience. Their flippant irreverence is amusing at first, but it is impossible to care what happens to them. They all remain plot devices who bicker and make up as the whims of the plot demand, but none of them seem to have a life beyond what is presented on screen. There are too many of them now with characters that I found it impossible to care about. If the directors decided to thin out the herd by killing a few off I wouldn't mind.Not that there seems to be much danger of that happening. Whatever is going on there never seems to be any jeopardy for the characters among all the CGI.In this regard Civil War, is a retrograde step from Winter Soldier.To be honest I doubt that Civil War will be the movie that bursts the superhero bubble at the box office, but I think it is probably a step closer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I walked out after 30 minutes Spiderman CGI costume...??? I've seen better things on you tube for crying out loud Just some mindless constant parking lot battle scenes with bad dialogue and story It seems like people forgot how to make good movies now days its all hype, marketing and CGI.Im starting to think Marvel actually pays people for good reviews and comments just to sell the movies, rather than actually make a good movie and it happens with other movies too.It makes me sick.If you're the kind of type that likes CGI , Iron man 3, Twillight or 50 shades of Grey this is the movie for you, for me not so much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cheesy, Below mediocre, Over-hyped by young marvel fan-boys and total waste of Money</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So i managed to grab the ticket for advance screening of CA:CW yesterday and now i decided to write a review to save people from it. Listen, don't pay attention to the delusional paid critics and Marvel young fans giving this i-don't-know-if-i-should-even-call-this-a-CBM ratings higher than the Godfather and TDK. I say again those are shallow and deluded fan boys. The movie was below mediocre at best like most of the Marvel movies out there. Batman v Superman was for sure a better film with more in depth character development, something to connect to and the movie actually made me care for the characters and the entire story line towards the JL scenario. Well i went to see Civil war with high expectations after the hype Russo brothers created for it. I was expecting more than cheesy fight scenes but all in all as they promised it would be 'darker' than the other movies by Marvel, but guess what, everything bad is still there and way too much cheesy dialogue that takes away the intensity of the action. If you're a casual movie goer, this movie may be somewhat enjoyable, but comic book fans beware, they butchered one of the most iconic story arcs by marvel even praised by the DC fans around the world. Batman v Superman was a couple steps up in many areas but civil war had absolutely no moment that made you use your brain or to think about. It's mainly just mindless action with dialogue as filler the first half is just boring dialog and some flashbacks to make it look interesting, the other half is the main characters taking on each other more emotionally like whiny school boys "i don't wanna fight you but you made me do it" which is an extreme disappointment it will no doubt do well because as everyone can see how Disney paid the critics to give it a rating of 100% and 8+ score even before the actual worldwide release. Chris Evans surely improved as CA but my favorite was Crossbones, Black Panther had the minimum screen time as compared to other characters, Spidey was somewhat interesting but the animated + poor cgi was such a let down and towards the end it felt like RDj was trying his best to carry on with this miserable plot but unfortunately one A list actor isn't always able to push the bad plot and writing towards the success. My thoughts after i walked out of the screening: Totally forgettable like DP, Terrible, overrated and plain boring. It's obvious the critics were paid shills this movie was just awful. Because all the characters. Like all Disney made marvel movies the characters lack any kind of development. Also to make audience feels more connected towards the 'Darkness' of the plot, there's a funeral in there attended by Steve Rogers but they miserably failed due to the cheesy dialog afterward. Not that there seems to be much danger of that happening. Whatever is going on there never seems to be any jeopardy for the characters among all the CGI. In the end instead of the CA's sequel it felt more like unfinished Avengers 2.5 minus the Thor and uh never mind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me start off by saying that after winter soldier I had high expectations, but this movie did not live up to anything I was hoping! I mean it was an utter mess, I cannot believe Marvel gave the green light to these directors it's shocking, it really is. The cast tries their best but is ultimately seen as tired and stuck in these roles that are just beaten to death, the characters haven't changed and they don't evolve in any way. A major step down from Winter soldier in my opinion, there were some moments of shock, don't get me wrong, where I was hyped but they faded much quicker than I would have liked as the movie droned on and on with what felt like the Marevl universe all crushed into one little movie with a flimsy story going nowhere. It's as if they attempted to use star power but they are using the Marvel characters as stars and it doesn't work at all, I disliked this movie very much and would go so far as to say I hated it? Maybe, I'll watch it one more time it I can build up the tolerance to sit through all of it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a shame</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another marvel formula This movie can fit right if they show this at the 1st phase,its boring the direction is horrible and the effects to, what a shame. Like all Disney made marvel movies the characters lack any kind of development. There is no attachment to them and the audience can care less what happens to them. The soundtrack is just another generic computer generated sound and lacks any real soul. The plot is also a rushed mess.However this movie gives the same generic marvel formula that we have come to expect.This is a bad choice for marvel,in critics its always good for they because they pay it all always but with the fans its another thing</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mediocre like most Marvel movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Listen, don't listen to the deluded critics and Marvel fan boys giving this crap ratings higher than the Godfather. Those are shallow and deluded fan boys. The movie was mediocre at best like most of the Marvel movies out there. Batman vs Superman was for sure a better film with more in depth character development and the movie actually made me care for the characters. I couldn't care less what happened in to the characters in this film. The musical score was once again a mediocre score with nothing special about it. BvS had a decent score and you could tell that they actually went for something. This movie shows no effort in making a good musical score at all. The movie gets way too much praise while BvS gets way too much hate. I don't expect jokes to pop up when the world is at stake or people are fighting in the middle of a battle. Why this keeps happening in Marvel movies is beyond me, probably to keep the shallow kids and fans going through the movie. BvS got criticized for being too dark and having too many characters yet this is one of Marvels "darkest" movies and has the largest cast of any super hero movie and this gets praise? The amount of plot holes I found were laughable, but no, people are going to ignore it because it's a Marvel movie and the action is eye candy. But when DC does it it's the only thing people notice. I have a suggestion, instead of watching this mediocre and copy and paste Marvel film, go watch something else. Here are some suggestions, want to still watch a Marvel film? Go rent one or find one on cable, it will be exactly the same, trust me. Want to still go to the theater and watch a real super hero movie? Fine, watch Batman vs Superman. Want to watch a good super hero movie? Go watch The Dark Knight Trilogy. Want to watch a good movie? Go watch the Godfather or Shawshank Redemption. Have fun, don't watch this boring movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very disappointed. Look at the marvel fans. they hate BvS cause the story is too big some of them said there's no stories at all. well news flash. Civil war too. Ugh! Its going to be box office hit because of the fight scenes. But i was surprised by black widow. She's a bad ass. They developed her character more. But that's it. The plot twist was very predictable. Meh. Winter Soldier was still the best marvel movie for me. and i think it will only be a best marvel movie. Sometimes i'm wondering why the avengers movies is very disappointing movie. Solo movies was much better. Ugh! They should change their tone. its not fun anymore. its getting cheesier every time. Jokes while it in the field is very dumb and cheesy. 6/10</fullReview>
