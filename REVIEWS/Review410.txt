		<shortDescription>Atmospheric story of lust, desire and murder</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Drifter Frank Chambers applies for a job at a road side café belonging to Nick Smith, only to fall under the spell of Nick's wife Cora. He falls into desire which leads to deceit and eventually murder. Too late he falls in love but by then things have gone too far. He tells his story to us with the hindsight of a condemned man.A classic bit of noir light. Based on Cain's sexual novel this underplays the explicit references but turns the subtle stuff way up - the film opens with a `Man Wanted' sign, while Cora is so well played that there's no doubt what she's offering. Without the explicit sex of the remake this story is a lot freer to be interesting rather than explicit. The court case and the mistrust between the lovers is as good as the early desire giving rise to murder.Lana Turner is excellent as the femme fatale, she is smouldering and very, very desirable. Garfield is also excellent as the man trapped in her web. The two are the very center of the film and are both superb. If the film has any weakness then it may be that modern audiences need more than very subtle stuff, but that's probably our problem rather than the film's.Overall this is very enjoyable, it has a great sense of mood and builds well to the inevitable conclusion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superior film noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lana Turner and John Garfield generate sparks in this excellent crime thriller. Turner plays Cora Smith, a restless young waitress married to a much-older man who runs the roadside diner. Garfield plays Frank Chambers, a drifter who turns up at the diner and is captivated by Cora. Cecil Kellaway is great as Cora's naive husband Nick, whose main concern is the diner. The fact that it is filmed in black and white helps create the suspenseful atmosphere and highlight Cora's striking cream outfits. This is far superior to the 1981 remake, for although it was made under a strict production code, it smolders with desire and tension and is an unforgettable classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome film noir!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Postman Always Rings Twice is simply the best film noir ever done. Lana Turner, who got billing above John Garfield in this movie, and deservedly so, is stunning as Cora, the most alluring woman I've ever seen on screen, the quintessential femme fatale. John Garfield gives a bravura performance as Frank Chambers, the drifter, who can't keep his hands off another man's wife. The story is by James M. Cain, whose Double Indemnity is another memorable film noir adapted for the screen. Cain's stories are a mix of lust and crime and deceit and double-dealing.But, this movie belongs to Lana Turner from the moment we and Frank the drifter first see her to that fateful moment .. and I won't say when that moment arrives .. when Frank's and Cora's dreams and schemes are forever dashed. Frank says several times in the movie, "I just wanted to look at her..I just wanted to see her..It was horrible to be away from her.." and Frank wasn't the only one who had those feelings. That first time we meet Cora is simply one of the most erotic, powerful scenes ever filmed. Frank is sitting at the restaurant counter, Cora's husband, Nick, has gone to see a customer, and we see a tube of lipstick rolling on the floor. The camera follows Frank's gaze from the lipstick, to the path it took on the floor, to its owner and the reason it fell to the floor. The camera stops - as Frank's gaze does - on Cora's shapely legs, shown in all their splendor from mid-thigh to heel, because Cora is wearing shorts. We see Cora's face, and then Frank's, and we can literally see Frank's breath being taken away. Ours, too. It doesn't take long before nature takes its course with Frank and Cora, but that creates the problem of what to do with Nick? First, they simply decide to leave him, but that doesn't work, because of the three of then, Nick is the only one with money. There is a botched murder attempt which Nick recovers from. Nick isn't the brightest bulb in the array since he never realizes that his wife and the drifter he hired just tried to kill him. Some parts of this first attempt are masterfully done, and some aren't. Frank and Cora's sexual tension builds, along with the fear that they'll be found out for what they tried to do. They succeed in killing Nick on their second attempt, but are soon caught. These aren't master criminals, you see. Cora and Nick are played against each other by the Prosecutor, and we soon see them for their true selves, as they turn on one another. Hume Cronyn plays Cora's attorney here in a role evocative of Billy Flynn in Chicago some 55 years later. This defense attorney has it all under control. He manages to razzle-dazzle the prosecution - and the court, and get both Frank and Cora off! Cronyn is so good here he nearly steals the movie!It's not necessary to say more about the story. We know in a film noir universe that evil schemes never succeed. Frank and Cora will never get away with Nick's murder. Even though they are free, things soon begin to unravel for them. Their relationship is undermined by all the deceit and legal manuevering of the prosecuting attorney and Cora's lawyer. Neither trusts the other. Things go from bad to worse, and ultimately both Frank and Cora pay for killing Nick.This movie is not perfect. There are some plot points that do not hold: Nick's stupidity, the sudden discovery of the life insurance policy, a stupid housecat, and others. It is tedious in spots, especially the middle.The botched first murder attempt is not essential, the legal wrangling takes too long, and the tension that builds between Frank and Cora after they are free takes too long to build. Frank has a dalliance with a waitress that either should have been cut or expanded. But, for all its faults it is quintessential film noir. Frank and Cora for all their good looks are rotten at their core, and that's why we love them. We love the movie because in the end they get what they deserve: justice triumphs over hormones and greed. 9 out of 10.A footnote: the newly released DVD has a bonus feature on the life of John Garfield. He died in 1952 at the age of 39, a victim of the House Unamerican Activities Committee. Garfield was a prominent target, whom the committee sought to discredit and destroy, in an attempt to gain credibility with the American people. How very sad that so many lives could be shattered with such implacable malice emanating from Congress itself. Let us pray it never happens again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very oddly structured movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was not expecting a classic film noir along the lines of "Double Indemnity" or "Out of the Past" when I put this movie in, and for awhile, I thought I might have been wrong. Maybe the cover was too cheesy, I'm not sure, but I didn't have extra high hopes for this movie. Then my mood brightened when it actually started to become very entertaining. I wasn't being blown away, but I did start to enjoy the film noir 101 plot. The reviewer who noted MGM's dramatic lighting of Turner is right, it's ridiculous, but it does come with the territory I guess. Other than that, things seemed to be moving in place very smoothly.Then an odd thing happened. The movie refused to end. It wasn't that the pace was slow, it moved speedily. Something was always happening, and there was plenty of suspense/overblown MGM music blaring out of the speakers at any given moment. But the plot was way too top-heavy. They get caught doing the murder. Okay, time for trial, some final irony, then the movie's over. But it's not! It just kept going. New subplots turned up, bribes, plot twists, double crosses, it just kept happening and happening. It was too much. I was literally standing up sweating by the final scene, wanting it to end so much. The problem was, nothing of any substance was given to the events that kept happening. It was like the screenwriters noted "okay, this happened in the book, but we have to trim it a bit, so we'll make a small 2 minute scene including it in the movie" and suddenly the movie is full of these large occurrences given very brief sketched out screen time. Garfield runs off for a weekend in Tijuana with some random women? What just happened? Things just grew too implausible. I realize that complaining the movie went on too long and claiming that not enough screen time was given to all the events in the second half is hypocritical, but there must have been ways to flesh things out. I haven't read the book, but I suspect it's much better than the movie, just based on other reviewer's comments.During the final embarassing "what does God make of all this" speech to the priest (hey, I thought film noirs where supposed to be existential!), I happened to look at the video case and glance at the title. Realizing it hadn't been referenced in the movie yet I stared at the screen and muttered "out with it" and in return got some over-reaching ramblings concerning how "he always rings twice, always rings twice" ext. Yikes.I have to say though, the movie had some very good irony and employed a load of classic film noir tricks (the final outcome must have influenced the Coen Brothers with "The Man Who Wasn't There"), but I can't help believing the book must have been a lot better. I'd chalk this one up for noir completists and Golden Age MGM enthusiasts only.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Weak-ish Noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has all the ingredients of classic noir without actually being a very good movie.The biggest problem I had with the film was that the characters are an unconvincing blend of naivety and cunning. One minute they're suckered by an old man running a burger bar, the next they're foiling a blackmail plot hatched by corrupt lawmen and wielding guns like they're hardened gangsters.The ending is equally unconvincing, with the protagonist happily latching onto his death sentence as some kind of salvation that gives him moral certainty in the amoral noir world he's been floundering in. It's as if this is a noir made by people who were anti-noir.Noir will always involve a clash between innocence and experience but it's not convincingly handled here. It isn't the first noir I'd make that complaint against, either - things like SHadow of a Doubt and Night of the Hunter have a similar unreal atmosphere.In my opinion the best noir is both believable and hellish; like The Third Man, Double Indemnity, Notorious or Chinatown.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I was flabbergasted by this soap opera</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a child in the 1970s, I cringed whenever I viewed a television soap opera that my mother insisted on watching. Every soap opera I ever, involuntarily, watched was shockingly bad."The Postman Always Rings Twice" is like a forerunner for those horrible soap operas. The innumerable plot turns are often unbelievably absurd, the dialogue is very shallow, the characters are stupid, and everything is melodramatic. The fact that the Lana Turner character is one of the hottest movie characters I've ever seen can't save "Postman."The first half of this 1946 movie deserves a 5 or a 6. I often love movies that focus on a few characters, but I just wasn't interested in this film's three main characters. Turner's marriage to an unattractive small-time restaurant owner old enough to be her Dad is not credible. It certainly wasn't Cecil Kellaway's brains that appealed to her because he is oblivious to an affair that occurs right under his nose. Turner and John Garfield's behavior around Kellaway is abnormal.More importantly, the affair between Garfield and Turner ? which begins when he attacks her ? is uninteresting. They say nothing to each other about their hopes and dreams, nothing in depth about their love for each other, nothing intelligent, and nothing that reveals who they are. I know virtually nothing about their backgrounds and there is little character development.Despite the flaws, the plot is interesting enough that I can understand why people like the first half of "Postman." The second half of "Postman," however, just flabbergasted me. The stupid plot turns include:* The district attorney who prosecuted Turner for killing Kellaway was the closest thing to a WITNESS to the murder because he was the FIRST one who saw the crashed car.* After witnessing and prosecuting the murder, the D.A. decides to let Turner off on a prison-free manslaughter charge after a 30-second conversation with the defense attorney.* Several minutes earlier, the defense attorney ignored Turner's objections and entered guilty pleas for murdering Kellaway and trying to murder Garfield.* Shortly before the two guilty pleas, the D.A. and defense attorney bet on whether Turner will be found guilty of murder ? in front of the other suspect.* After the guilty pleas, Turner and Garfield are placed in the same room in a courthouse and are allowed to move freely although she has just plead guilty to trying to kill him and he has signed a complaint saying he witnessed her murdering Kellaway.* In the room, Turner implicates Garfield in the Kellaway murder in a confession that is made right in front of him ? and typed by someone impersonating an officer of the court.* After trying to put each other in jail for life, Garfield and Turner decided to live with each other.* The community is so unbothered that a convicted killer is serving no jail time that it flocks to her restaurant to solicit her autograph, but it is outraged that two unmarried people live together. Thus, Garfield and Turner marry.* The impersonator tries to extort Garfield and Turner for the paper with the confession he typed although they certainly knew he could have made copies of the paper.* The police suspected Garfield and Turner of an earlier attempt on Kellaway's life, but they stopped probing because he recovered. Essentially, they negligently allowed Kellaway to be murdered.There are other plot twists. They occur approximately every 30 seconds. I kept getting the impression that the writers were aware a plot twist was illogical so they wrote another one to try to explain the previous one. With each plot twist, they dug themselves into a deeper hole.This movie is so stupid that I'm probably being generous in giving it a 3.ZWrite</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Funny, the comment there about the title - it's the strangest part of the adaptation because at least it IS mentioned in the film, but nowhere in the book. It's an absolute mystery to me how this title made it through intact when great titles like "Farewell My Lovely" were dumbed down to "Murder My Sweet" for the sake of Hollywood audiences. James M. Cain originally submitted the story to Alfred Knopf with the title "BBQ" (which makes sense in context) and was asked to change it; he considered "Black Puma" and "The Devil's Checkbook" before settling on the mystifying title by which the novel and both adaptations are well known.Anyway, I like the film and think it's a great straight adaptation of the book, though the dialogue in the beginning seems a bit hurried (for the sake of the quick establishment of character and story) - the book does a better job of painting the hobo/gypsy lifestyle Frank embraces, and I think it's pretty central to the eventual conflict between him and Cora, so it's a shame it wasn't better depicted in the film.Lana Turner is good, but probably just a bit mis-cast - she's a little too "glamorous" for Cora, which is also established immediately in the famous opening shot of her legs and lipstick (in contrast to the book, where she was introduced in an apron, working hard for the business like she always says she wants to.) One note for femme-fatale buffs: Cora and Nick in the film are surnamed "Smith," which in the book was Cora's maiden name. (Nick in the book was Greek - "Papadakis") Is this a statement on marriage in general, or perhaps a desire to eliminate the racial implications in what happens? Seems unlikely; it is what it is, for smarter people than me to unravel."So long mister, thanks for the ride!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A solid murder mystery with star power</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lana Turner and John Garfield are great in this classic tale of deception and murder and its hard to imagine that another actress, save Barbara Stanwyck or Joan Crawford, could have played the role of the wayward wife as well as did Turner. Cecil Kellaway has a thankless role and it's hard to believe that he was as clueless as he was about the fires burning around him as Turner and Garfield carry on their affair. Kellaway seems more preoccupied with pinching pennies than noticing how his young, attractive wife is bursting with sexual energy. Turner is as beautiful as ever but she and Kellaway don't make a credible married couple. Hume Cronyn is good as the smug attorney but the courtroom drama is a bit of a letdown. Garfield brings a restless energy to his role and matches Turner's smoldering sexuality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slightly Softened from Cain's 1930's Novel but Still Holds Its Own as a Noir Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original book published in 1934 by James M. Cain (author of "Double Indemnity") was a gritty unsentimental story of a low-class drifter and bum, Frank, who is taken in by a German immigrant, Nick, who owns a roadside café and his beautiful wife, Cora, who turns out to be much darker on the inside than the facade of her pure white skin. Cora, we learn, is dissatisfied with her life married to this older immigrant and the drifter becomes her catalyst to change her situation. The movie adaption of twelve years later is a slightly sentimentalized version of Cain's noir classic. That said, the movie still holds its own as a noir tale of betrayal and murder, but doesn't quite have the edge of Billy Wilder's adaption of "Double Indemnity".Still, the movie works very well under its own terms, particularly because of the outstanding chemistry between the leads John Garfield and Lana Turner. In fact, the star of the show is really Turner who turns in a tour-de-force performance. Turner continually shows us the many faces of her character Cora Smith who is sometimes weak and vulnerable and other times resolute and stubborn, even unsympathetic, and yet oozing with unrealized sexuality. We gather that Cora is no ordinary woman, or at least not the soft sentimental Doris Day type. More like a cross between Eva Peron and Madonna. Sometimes hard and mean and other times sweet and feminine, she is the complex epitome of the Cain femme fatale of this era. She remains enigmatic from beginning to end which is I think what Cain would have wanted. Garfield, in probably the role of his career, is equally superb, at first rejecting the murder scheme and then later embracing it. Although lacking the enigmatic complexity of Cora, Frank is equally ambiguous and ambivalent to his life choices, and Garfield well conveys the multi-sidedness of Frank.The story concerns a young man looking for work, finds a roadside café up a few hours north of Los Angeles, probably up the 101 freeway, and becomes the hired help. He is employed by Nick, a simple German-stock older-than-middle-age man, who simply wants to make enough money to be comfortable and occasionally play his little guitar. His wife, Cora, is about 40 years younger and wants to make something of their café instead of just eking out a meager living. But fleeing with Nick and beginning from ground zero is not what she wants. She would like to have the café and make something of it. And when the hired help Frank falls for her, she realizes he is the perfect means to get both of them out of their hellish existence.A fine example of 1940's film noir with many of the stylistic considerations, such as the camera panning from feet-to-face when we first meet the woman Cora, the many unexpected twists and turns, and of course the dark desires of the leads. Every series of scenes leaves you guessing as to what will happen next. A couple of scenes were contrived that were superfluous to the book. Unfortunately, the film suffers slightly because of the stringent ethics codes that started to be imposed on films of that time. Probably film noir offerings suffered more than most because of their probing the darker sides of human nature. However, Postman still ranks as classic film noir.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>She's funny that way....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Those movie audiences who think that explicit sexual scenes shown in movies these days make a film sexy, should take a look at this 1946 steamy MGM picture. "The Postman Always Ring Twice" made an impact on the way movies looked at the time, when the censure of the Hays Code dominated what could be shown on the screen for general consumption.James M. Cain's novel of the same title was adapted by Harry Ruskin and Niven Busch, two writers that clearly caught all the nuances of the book. Ty Garnett direction made this film a surprise and a star out of the gorgeous Lana Turner, who was at the height of her beauty when the movie was shot. The great camera work of Sidney Wagner made this movie a classic for its sensual look it focused on its female star.Nick, the older owner of the roadside diner, has married Cora, a woman much too young for him. Cora, who clearly has found her meal ticket, is happy in the way her life has changed. When Frank Chambers arrive at the diner, Cora realizes the mistake she made in marrying Nick; Frank stands in sharp contrast with Nick. Cora's sexual needs awaken when Frank pays attention to her. As lovers, we realize they are doomed.Because both Cora and Frank are amateurs, they botch the well laid plans they have for getting rid of Nick. Everything conspires against them because it's too clear what they have done. They will not be able to get away with the crime, or a life together because unknown to them everyone had seen through them from the beginning.Lana Turner, whose whole wardrobe is white, made a great Cora. She is heartless, but she is all sexual whenever she is around Frank. This was perhaps was one of the best things Ms. Turner did in the movies. John Garfield, who is so sure of himself, at the start, loses all his will because Cora smolders him and he doesn't think rationally. Cecil Kellaway is good as the older Nick. Leon Ames, Hume Cronyn are seen in small roles."The Postman Always Ring Twice" is a classic of this genre thanks to Ty Garnett's direction and a brilliant appearance by an inspired Lana Turner.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Atmospheric Film-Noir With A Memorable Role For Lana Turner</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The good atmosphere and Lana Turner's memorable role make this a film-noir classic worth seeing. The story starts out to be relatively simple, allowing the cast and the atmosphere to carry it, and then heads through a series of twists and turns, picking up the pace as it goes along.John Garfield and the supporting cast are solid, but it is Turner who really stands out and grabs the attention anytime she is on-screen. It's nothing against Garfield to say that in comparison he is almost just along for the ride, yet he does a creditable job and makes his character believable. The supporting cast helps out as well, with Cecil Kellaway on-target as Turner's oblivious husband, and Hume Cronyn likewise in good form as a conscience-free lawyer.The story pulls you in slowly, and then has some good turns as it picks up steam towards the middle. There may be a couple of too-convenient plot developments, but otherwise it is well-written.This classic version is quite a bit better than the early 1980s remake, which required little imagination to make or to watch. Turner's character and performance, in particular (aided by good camera work), demonstrate that the suggestive can be quite a bit more effective and memorable than the explicit."The Postman Always Rings Twice" has just about everything you could ask for in a film-noir. It's probably just a cut below the best of the genre, and still one of the movies that most fans of film-noir would not want to miss.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>SAFETY FIRST ! (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hmmmmm. what did I get out of this movie? A lot of safety tips: beware of poorly insulated wiring; beware of steep hillsides; pay attention when you're driving...all these incidentals which got in the way of the characters' goals.The most publicized aspect of this movie has been Lana Turner's looks. OK, but the real scene-stealer in this movie is the performance of Hume Cronyn as the defence attorney. If they had to make a sequel, he should be the lead character.A superior noir film is Double Indemnity. Postman is so convoluted in the relationship between Turner and Garfield that it really lacks suspense. The ending of the movie was a big let-down, and predictable: so many movies of this era couldn't/wouldn't let the characters get away with their evil deeds. When watching movies, I am always dismayed at characters that look at each other in conversation while one them drives (a car). I'm always thinking, who does that in real life without getting into an accident. This movie answers that question.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Glamorous Spider And Her Tangled Web</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A rebellious drifter named Frank (John Garfield) happens onto a rural hamburger joint, managed by a jovial old man named Nick (Cecil Kellaway). Nick wants to hire Frank. And in Frank's mind, an added incentive would be Nick's beautiful wife Cora (Lana Turner). Thus begins the story.I have two big problems with this film: the script and the casting. The setup starts slow and lasts too long. In the middle Act interest picks up a little, despite some improbable coincidences. But later we're introduced to confusing legalities, compounded by contrived twists. And the ending contradicts the darker tone of earlier sequences.Much of the plot is a tangled web of this and that, held together entirely by the three lead characters. It's like the writers sorted through dozens of script drafts, couldn't decide; then in frustration, hurriedly wrote a final draft that was a compromise of the previous versions.John Garfield is well cast and does a fine job. But someone other than Kellaway would have been better in the role of Nick. Much, much worse than the casting of Kellaway, however, was the casting of glamorous Lana Turner, as Cora. Turner, with her blonde hair and glossy facade, is not at all convincing either as Nick's wife, or as a young, spidery beauty stuck in a two-bit hamburger joint. Further, her acting is awful. She doesn't act so much as she ... poses for the camera, in a bid to show off her glamour for future starring roles. Her presence seriously detracts from the story.I think Audrey Totter, who plays a minor role, would have been fine as Cora. So too would have been Ida Lupino. Indeed, almost anyone would have been better than Turner, even Broderick Crawford in a wig.Critics regard this film highly. I'm not sure why. About the only thing to recommend it is the performance of John Garfield.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many of the comments I've read here are As full of hyperbole as a studio press release. The movie is disjointed and allows most of the tension to dissipate. It has several false climaxes before the anticlimactic ending. John Garfield makes a vain effort to explain the inexplicable title and has difficulty selling the jazzy lingo written for him by the scriptwriters. Lana Turner is only as good as that glamor shot that shows her in the white hot pants when she and Garfield first meet. The George Bassman score is heavy handed and telegraphs every plot turn.

		<shortDescription>Garfield and Turner are terrific...steamy version of the James M. Cain novel is still the best...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Someone previously questioned the meaning of the title. In my view, it refers to the double twist imposed on the story's ending by the author--especially once the legal wrangling between opposing lawyers (near the conclusion) is exposed. Then, finally, after winning a victory of sorts, the unexpected happens--thus, the irony of the title. Anyway, this is as good as it gets--you won't find a better version of this story than this 1946 film. I'm always amused to read that someone on these posts "never looks at black-and-white films", a total putdown of all the great classics that came before color was even possible. How dumb can you get? For fans of complex, hard-bitten murder yarns with gritty background and suspense that tightens slowly like a knot, this is for you. Watch as the two leads get more and more entangled in their own web of deception and lies. Turner established herself as a strong actress who could play a role to the hilt when she identified with it. Garfield, of course, was always at his best in tough guy roles. Watch for my article on Lana Turner in an upcoming issue of FILMS OF THE GOLDEN AGE--much of the inspiration for it came from this particular film noir.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The postman didn't ring for me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie when it was on TV recently, knowing it was a classic movie. I didn't have any expectations, seeing as I barely knew what it was about - I just figured it would be good."The Postman Always Rings Twice" is never boring, but it's too long by half an hour, if not more, and it's hard to believe that Frank and Cora would risk so much for each other when their relationship is based purely on physical attraction. Perhaps Cora, stuck in a loveless marriage, could realistically fall for a handsome man who showed an interest in her - but why does Frank plot murder for the sake of a woman he barely knows? Surely he could continue on his travels and find another, equally sexy woman in a less complicated and dangerous situation? Cora and Frank are devoted to each other because the plot requires them to be, not because they have any sort of plausible emotional connection. I believed they were strongly sexually attracted to each other, but I didn't believe that they were connected on any other level.Throughout this film, I kept thinking of ways that it could be a better movie. I didn't try to, it just happened. At one point I was convinced that Nick had figured out Cora and Frank's plans and was telling them various things just to see them squirm, but no such luck. The movie drags on and on in the last hour, with Frank and Cora going from one melodramatic plot point to the next without really thinking or reflecting on any of them. I got sick of Frank and Cora. I wanted them to be smarter, to do unexpected things - oh, and I wanted Frank to stop successfully punching out guys who look like they could crush him with one arm tied behind their backs.The acting is good. Once you accept the plot dragging on and on, the script is fairly decent. Still, I wouldn't recommend this movie except perhaps to hardcore film fans, and I wouldn't watch it again.A note: There is no postman in this film, and the significance of the title is not revealed until the last scene, where we find out it's a lot more boring than we were expecting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Film noir gone slightly wrong</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked the style of the film in that it did a great job of telling a murder story in which you got to see the police go through the process of trying to figure it out and prosecute. I would have liked to see more of the mystery part. Additionally, I am not sure how I felt about the love story. I think the film could have done without it. It seemed artificial to me. I had a really hard time believing that a trapped woman would meet a man and with him kill her husband, and then stay with him. I think it is easier to believe that she would use him and then leave. However, without the love story, there is no "postman ringing twice," with any significant emotional impact. I also felt that there were a lot of side stories that didn't really add to the plot. Like the story about the woman that he met and ran off with while Cora was with her family. Even the story about her mother being sick wasn't necessary. I thought that the beginning of the movie was really slow-paced, and then the director attempted to fit a lot of the story into the last 45 minutes of screen time. I think that this movie could have been a masterpiece if Tay Garnett and his team had done a better job with the storyboard.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hey! That Damn Postman Never Even Rang Once!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WARNING! - In this "Crime-of-Passion" Drama that simply refuses to end, prepare yourself for something of a let-down when it's finally revealed (in this film's closing scene) what the title "The Postman Always Rings Twice" is referring to.I'm tellin' ya - If you're like me you'll surely roll your eyes to the ceiling, let out a deep groan of exasperation, and literally burst out laughing when John Garfield's dead-serious character (who's waiting on Death Row for his execution) makes a truly laughable, metaphorical connection between the Postman ringing twice and his involvement with that murderous slut, Cora Smith.Yes. I'm well-aware that a lot of people are more than eager to heap piles of praise on this 1946 "Bad-Boy-Meets-Bad-Girl" movie (and, hey, to each his/her own), but, with that said, this vintage flick (which definitely started out in first-gear) really deteriorated in its last hour into a steady, downward spiral of relentlessly absurd situations that defied common-sense thinking.In my opinion - On top of the confusing legalities that got introduced into the story (compounded by several contrived plot-twists), this picture suffered significantly from the casting of that "Barbie Doll" Lana Turner as the conniving minx, Cora Smith.With Miss Lana Turner always appearing as a "vision-in-white", this immaculately groomed "Ice Queen" was clearly way-way out of her league and totally unconvincing in this picture. Since her pouting, whining, irksome character (who was forever posing in yet another smart outfit) was, pretty much, in every scene, I really began to despise her almost right off the bat.I mean, let's face it, Lana Turner may have been a cute, little tomato in her heyday, but this certified airhead sucked as an actress, especially in roles (like this one) that required her to be something more than just an impeccably groomed piece of fluff.All-in-all - I would never, ever consider this poorly-structured, anti-climatic picture (with its heavy-handed music score that telegraphed every plot turn) to be worthy of being classified in the genre of Film Noir.I strongly suspect that anyone who claims that "Postman" is an excellent entry into the "Noir" genre hasn't had much of a chance to see the real thing.And, finally - I think that this film's overall suspense and drama would've benefited greatly had the story's running time been seriously reduced by a good 20 minutes, or so.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>MILD SPOILERS AHEADSurprised that no-one else has noted the strand of queasy religiosity that runs through the last few reels and, remarkably, makes Cora and Frank even less sympathetic than they were to begin with. Between the pregnant Cora's bizarre remarks about giving a life back for the one they took and Frank's spinechilling last wish that he and Cora can be together in death "wherever it is!", they turn from pretty much your standard white-trash alley cats into truly terrifying self-justified sinners, guilt-free psychopaths.Can't be sure whether this is part of the script's intentions or a misjudged attempt to inject a note of redemption into the proceedings - probably the latter - but Frank and Cora make the miserable, nerve-wracked lust-and-money killers of Double Indemnity seem quite cuddly in comparison. I've watched this film often, and its hard-boiled dialogue and fiendish plot never cease to entertain, but its central fascination is absolutely reptilian.Incidentally, can anyone think of a film noir that offers an innocent victim less pity than this one offers Cora's husband Nick?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So, does it make sense that old Cecil Kellway would be married to bombshell Lana Turner to begin with. No, of course it doesn't, but things like that do happen.The problem with this film is that there is no "good guy". This is one of those modern movies (despite being made in 1946) where neither of the main characters -- Lana Turner or John Garfield -- is at all likable. She's trash, he wants trash. Both low class.I guess I'm the odd man out on this film. Critics at the time were fairly positive, and today on Rotten Tomatoes this gets very high marks. I disagree. At first the plot is predictable, but once they get into the murder there are too many plot twists...particularly once they get to court.On the other hand, I have to admit the acting here is quite good. Lana Turner is fine, so is John Garfield. There are interesting performances by Hume Cronyn (quite off base casting, here) and Leon Ames (whom I'm usually less impressed by).So, high grades for the acting. Low grades for the plot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Riddled with "plot-holes" and over-the-top twists, The Postman Always Rings Twice can hardly be considered a thrilling film noir. Among this film's most phenomenal faults is its nonsensical screen writing. The plot starts off very slow and simple, but begins tumbling over itself as it tries to pick up the pace, resorting to a panic of heavy emotional swings and rapid-fire plot twists in a desperate attempt to stay afloat. And although the Nick Smith character (played by Cecil Kellaway) provides us with some well-needed comic relief while Lana Turner is able keep the viewer's interest with her intense performance, the film still lacks rational thought or a believable portrayal of the couple's supposed burning passion for each other. The only fire felt here is the storyline going down in flames.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Postman Had To Ring 3 Times</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It took me three viewings before this postman finally delivered for me. Giving that many opportunities for a film is not normal but my film noir friends all liked this so much, I thought I'd missed something on previous viewings, so I kept trying.My patience was rewarded on the first viewing of it on DVD. Maybe the clearer picture helped. At any rate, if someone else viewed this and found it boring - particularly the first half - I would understand. Finally, however, I, too,I found it interesting all the way through.Hume Cronyn, not the stars of the film John Garfield and Lana Turner, sparked my interest. He gave a fascinating portrayal of a lawyer and I wish his role had been bigger. Cecil Kellaway also is good as Tuner's husband, and I enjoyed Leon Ames as the district attorney.The film almost makes the two low-life leads into sympathetic characters, which is just plain wrong and probably also why twisted critics all like this. They prefer to side with the criminals rather than the victims. Both Garfield and Turner's characters are morally bankrupt. Garfield even jokes early on in the film about how fooling around with another man's wife "is nothing."The ending was a bit strange. Once again, the first two viewings I didn't like it, but on the third I thought was happened was appropriate.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Vortex Of Human Existential Desire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead:Yes, detractors, it is not without flaws. To truly appreciate it more, watch Rafelson's dreadful remake. When I review a movie, I always consider the material the director has to work with. The biggest flaw is Lana's stunning beauty, which while making Frank's lust believable, renders her unhappy marriage to Nick straining credulity. Kellaway was a good actor but miscast in the role; the disparity in their physical appearances makes the coupling seem contrived. The script already had Nick as a tightwad, obsessed with every cent he is spending. This was why he seized upon Frank in the first place, he was bragging to Cora how much Frank's labor would save them. This is why some of the attacks are misplaced, Nick is not an idiot, though drunk quite a bit. Nick has long since tired of Cora's pleasures and now become obsessed with wealth accumulation and his silly greasy spoon. The director has plenty of dialog with Nick fretting about lights left on, his bills, and what everything costs. He really isn't paying too close attention to Frank and Cora, his brain has merged with his profit ledger. Still, the physical contrast between one of the most beautiful women in film and a corpulent, aging actor who could have been her father, is why it garnered so many attacks. What I love about the movie is that it foreshadows Blood Simple.First, little mistakes that go wrong with the planning of Nick's murder. The first attempt with the ladder on the side of the house, by the fuse panel, which the cat ruins, adds reality to the movie. It also comes back to haunt them. Look, I adore Double Indemnity, it is a ten, but the murder goes too smoothly. Life is as you see it in Blood Simple, Body Heat and this old gem, things tend to go wrong, it is chaotic. Right in the middle of the murder, the motorcycle cop drives up and wants to chat. Frank hangs on, but the attempt goes to crap, just like life. The couple initially learns from their bungling and decides to abandon their plans. This is until Nick decides that Cora is leaving with him to be a nurse to his sick relative and, worse yet, he is going to sell the place. This pushes Cora over the edge, she is not a caregiver. One of the best scenes in the movie is also ignored. Cora wants to live the vagabond life with Frank, leaves Nick a note, and they start off for their nomad existence. Watch how quickly the trophy wife loses enthusiasm for the life on the road: the dirt, traffic, trying to walk in high heels, this tiny scene shows you Cora, clearly.The movie's writing is clever, with Keat's anticipating their turning on each other, after Frank sells Cora out first, he has his detective impersonate a cop, to take a confession that would have killed both of them. Later, the fired detective returns to try and extort money out of two criminals, never a good idea. The core of the movie is ontological, that is, the existential cores of these two people are antithetical. Cora seeks a better Trophy husband while Frank can't help going with any other woman who shows the slightest interest. Cora finds evidence of his philandering, while she was away, and the love dissipates quickly. Since this was made in the deeply moral 1940's America, even when Cora regains some interest, they are Evil and they must be punished, so cruel fate intervenes. The crash kills both of them for now it appears that Frank murdered Cora. This is what the ending means, it implies that God saw to their punishment by the accident,"There is no escape." This feature of American culture persisted into the mid-seventies. I was in an audience that booed loudly at Peckinpah's Getaway. He dared show McQueen and McGraw escaping into Mexico at the end. Even this far in the future, papers noted the loud booing of audiences. The ending has always been the focus of critical attack, and truly, to younger viewers, you must remember the Zeitgeist this was made within. Yes, it is a painful plot contrivance but he cannot end his movie with a 'happily ever after the murderers go into the sunset.' I will not own the re-make it is dreadful. While not the greatest of Noirs (The Lineup) it is far from the worst Noir (The Big Clock). A Good Movie. Q.E.D."You Must Train Yourself To Let Go Of Everything You Fear To Lose." Yoda</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Garfield (Frank) drifts into a small town and gets work at a café/diner run by an unlikely husband and wife team, Cecil Kellaway (Nick) and Lana Turner (Cora). Garfield and Turner have an attraction for each other that reaches a dangerous level and we follow the consequences of their actions...The cast are all good - my favourite is Hume Cronyn who plays "Arthur Keats", a very cunning lawyer, and he steals the show in every scene that he is in. Lana Turner is also a very cool customer and one of her best moments occurs after she has just been kissed by Garfield for the first time. Instead of the customary slap in the face that we are all expecting, she just re-applies her make-up and walks past him. How cool is she?As for the story, you need to suspend belief on a few occasions. First of all, it is just completely impossible to believe the marriage between fat, old Kellaway and young, attractive Turner. Even less difficult to take in is the willingness on Kellaway's part to encourage the much younger, better-looking and better suited lover for Turner to spend as much time possible as he can with her. WHAT!!? This Kellaway character is INCREDIBLY stupid. Another corker of an idea is to have Garfield and Turner plan to kill Kellaway by throwing some marbles under him so that he will slip and kill himself. This is getting pretty stupid now, isn't it?There are some memorable scenes but the ending is rather too convenient and the final scene has some rather forced dialogue to try and justify the film's title. Overall, it's an entertaining film that is a little long but deserves another look.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't read the novel(or watched other versions of this, though I understand that this is the one to go with, and I would agree), but it seems like they did do a lot to work as much as they could into this; and some of it, in the latter half of this, does not have the effect or weight to it that it ought to(and probably did in the book). Other than that, there's not an awful lot of negative that I can say about this, and it definitely contains unforgettable moments. A good place to start is Turner's introduction; the woman was(R.I.P., and that goes for anyone else who worked on this) utterly stunning, beautiful and hot(look at those legs!), and made for a wonderful femme fatale. Her performance is spot-on, and in fact, all of the acting in this is excellent. Everyone is well-cast, as well. The editing and cinematography have their share of masterful instances. This has amazing reveals, and the lighting(always soft on Lana) is marvelous. The tension and suspense in this are impeccable. This moves at a nice, fast pace, not wasting any time(pay close attention and don't miss any lines). The dialog is well-written and treated to great delivery. While the score can be bombastic here and there, it's usually good. The plot is smart and the twists and turns are well-thought out. I don't know if the similarity to Macbeth is intentional or not. This has largely aged well, if it does show when it's from, mainly in the sexism, which is, at times, rampant. There is a little mild violence(not graphic), disturbing content and "strong language"(it is by our standards, I don't think it was by theirs, back then). The DVD comes with a 58-minute featurette(that I will review on its own page here on the site), a cool 6 minutes of behind-the-scenes image gallery, a 5 minute intro by a film historian(very interesting, if it does spoil through a bit of its footage), and a theatrical trailer. I recommend this to any fan of noir. Perhaps not the best; however, a classic nonetheless. 8/10</fullReview>

This face paced and thrilling film-noir from 1946 is certainly a classic... one of my favorite films from class, to date. Many elements of film making went into this piece. Great lead role acting, particular camera angles, and appropriate mood lighting make this film the high quality that is. For example, Lana Turner's character Cora is unforgettable, her excellent acting skills allowed her to be enticing on screen but not carnal or even just too dramatic. John Garfield's character Frank Chambers is a strong supporting role and I really liked his sense of humor and the way he portrayed his infatuation with Cora, I felt the passion between those two after that infamous lip lock. The camera aids her in this smooth sense of seduction as well. Lighting throughout the film also helped to make the mood suspicious (in the way of her careless husband Nick) yet captivating and sensual (Cora's form fitting outfits and intense kissing scene) I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and enjoyed it all to myself this time too!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Poisonous Passion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1946 screen adaptation of James M Cain's notorious novel "The Postman Always Rings Twice" is universally recognised as a classic film noir and also one of the most famous movies in cinema history. The story of a femme fatale who draws a gullible guy into a passionate relationship which leads to murder, is typical noir material with its dark themes of adultery, deception, betrayal and blackmail. The scene in which the femme fatale enters the action is very memorable, as is the laboured explanation of the meaning and significance of the title. In between these two episodes, considerable tension is generated as the couple's relationship goes through various changes and the plot proceeds through a variety of turns and twists.Frank Chambers (John Garfield) is a drifter "with itchy feet" who's never liked any job that he's ever had and who breaks off from a hitchhiking journey to visit a diner / filling station just outside Los Angeles. The genial proprietor, Nick Smith (Cecil Kellaway), wants to hire a handyman and tries to interest Frank by telling him about the salary and room that go with the job and as a sweetener, offers him a free hamburger. While the hamburger's cooking on the grill, Nick has to leave to attend to a customer at the pumps. Frank remains sitting on a bar stool and suddenly sees a tube of lipstick rolling on the floor. His eyes follow the direction from which the lipstick had fallen, where he sees a woman standing in the doorway. She's wearing shorts and is dressed all in white. His gaze wanders all the way up from floor level to her face which actually appears to radiate light and it's obvious that he's irredeemably hooked. This meeting leads to Frank taking the job he'd been offered and embarking on a passionate affair with the lady in white, Cora Smith (Lana Turner) who is the proprietor's significantly younger wife.As their relationship develops, it becomes clear that Cora is very different to Frank in that she's very ambitious, she'd like to run the business and put some of her own ideas into action. A life on the road with all its discomforts and uncertainties would never do for her. In fact, she'd even married Nick, a man she didn't love, because of the relatively comfortable and affluent life that the partnership offered.It isn't long before the couple devise a plan to murder Nick as he's an impediment to both Cora's ambitions and the couple's affair. Nick's injuries are treated as accidental and fortunately for Frank and Cora, Nick can't fully remember what happened. Although the matter isn't pursued any further by the authorities, local D.A., Kyle Sackett (Leon Ames) clearly has his own suspicions. A second attempted murder is successful and this leads to the couple being delivered into the hands of two legal snakes who carry out some deceptions which culminate in Frank betraying Cora and their relationship becoming seriously fractured. The legal machinations result in Cora pleading guilty to a manslaughter charge and being freed after being given a suspended sentence. The means by which Frank and Cora eventually pay the price for their crime is very ironical and triggers Frank's rambling speech which explains the meaning of the title."The Postman Always Rings Twice" was well received by the critics and was also a great box office success but strangely didn't get nominated for any Academy Awards. Garfied and Turner are excellent in their lead roles and Leon Ames and Arthur Keats (Cora's defence lawyer) are exceptionally good as the corrupt and manipulative legal adversaries. Tay Garnett's style of directing shows some nice examples of flair, such as the way that Frank and Cora's poisonous relationship, both starts and ends with the roll of a tube of lipstick. The title's analogy involving the practices of a postman and the workings of fate, are of course, amusing and relevant but Frank's protracted explanation could've benefited from being more succinct.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After looking at The Postman Always Rings Twice and comparing it with other works of James M. Cain, I'm walking away with the thought that the man must have been a misogynist. Though at this point in time Cain certainly was at the high point of his career. Imagine having back to back film successes with Double Indemnity, Mildred Pierce, and The Postman Always Rings Twice.But what a view of women these films portray. The comparison with Double Indemnity and Postman is really almost too obvious. A weak and opportunistic man and a tramp of a wife drift into an affair and then they decide to kill the husband. And neither of them can live with the terrible secret of it all. They've even got the same kind of dogged gumshoe after them for Lana Turner and John Garfield it's District Attorney Leon Ames and Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray have Edward G. Robinson.With Pierce though it's a little more difficult, but think of Ann Blyth's character as a Turner/Stanwyck in training. No doubt had she not done her foul deed early on in life she would have grown up to be the same kind of ice dame as these other two. Lana Turner on a loan out from MGM plays for the first time a really bad girl, later on she would play more. Usually up to this time she played wholesome beauties kind of at variance with her private life. Maybe that's where the real acting came in for her. But you'd do just about anything to possess this one, even murder.John Garfield was two films away from ending his long term Warner Brothers contract and certainly they gave him a good role to go out on. Originally the part was offered to Bogart, but it wouldn't have been good for the older Bogey who most would have seen as too street smart and not so hormone driven as Garfield.Hume Cronyn has a neat role as a sleazy, but very effective defense attorney. One of the best roles of his early career.The Postman Always Rings Twice is one great and sordid tale of murder and betrayal. Even operating within the Code it still conveys a really twisted view of humanity.Courtesy of James M. Cain who probably didn't think too much of women in his view of the world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent, if watered-down version of James M. Cain's steamy novel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hard-bitten drifter comes upon a diner run by a friendly, middle-aged coot and his glamorous, sinister-eyed spouse; soon, the dangerous femme fatale is conspiring with the handsome stranger to bump off her husband. Glossy but still potent film noir was--due to the times--a softened variation on James M. Cain's bestseller, yet is helped by the exciting star-performances from John Garfield and Lana Turner. Occasionally overwrought, but tightly-wound, absorbing and enjoyable. Remade in 1981 as an R-rated noir featuring Jack Nicholson and Jessica Lange in the leads, and who proved to be a surprisingly dull screen duo. Stick with the taut original. *** from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dreadful Depression time and small business for great consequences</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The postman always rings twice" (1946) directed by Tay Garnett was at the time the third of four later adaptations from the known and famous novel written by James Cain, explaining just after the economic crisis of 1929 in why democratic values and corrupted minds or institutions were affected by the lack of capability for change. Whilst if other factors were more increased at the time and not as obstacles then in route even when were in social evolution, but simultaneous too much slowly for a new deal of the basic and instinctively people. A small restaurant near an exterior mountain road at countryside, nowhere in California during the Depression era, it is the involuntary stage of a passionate turmoil. Isolated from the normality of surviving life, in these times of unemployment and migration among states, with social hungry and obliging people taking unthinkable actions. The novel is much more rich than the story itself, because of several details omitted in this third screening version barely made fourteen years after its first printing in 1932. Two moments are interesting over all in this movie for the viewer, as while the employee gives a match for lit her cigarette and another when the woman sings with a guitar as if anyway he already belongs to the same family but in an undercover love affair. The husband is like a happy drunken man out of his capacity for this kind of marriage, as if she was bought like a young woman for the kitchen, as well for this new employee in such a promiscuity for surviving inside an abandoned restaurant from the road. Their common conscience is low and their lives are like that, there for the strange cohabitation and it was not implied that the scene must be other than it seems to be, without any bravery expelling it to the boring side of any young life, as here by necessity of things and attraction between ages - him and her out of control from the owner -, by blood, money and illicit love opportunity. Jumping outside of misery without modern instinct from the husband, barely somnolent and even not autocratic enough to understand that his pity is his condemnation by the new couple of potential and frustrated criminals. In a kind of fatalism that took the fascination of this story of young people, aside the bitter end of the less fortuned at the time of sensuality, fighting poverty in Twin Oaks random of destiny. Even when in this case circumstances and ethnicity or vulgarity of human backgrounds acted as apparently non sense and where in a magic triangle of characters destiny as a supposed retroactive determinism explains why institutions were so in debt for Manicheism. Frank Chambers was the individual in question and as man without specific qualities he needs an occasional wage and Cora is the young wife of the owner, in a Greek tragedy with two turnabouts and a bitter end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After watching Mildred Pierce, which to me is frankly chaos, it was refreshing to see that James M. Cain has produced some stories that are that build, take interesting directions, and have lots of wit. For awhile though, from the beginning until about forty minutes in, I felt like I was watching the same movie I'd seem so many times with so many different titles. But that's the charm of The Postman Always Rings Twice. It shoots the next act from a different angle, and from there it ricochets wherever it ricochets.John Garfield has never been anywhere close to my first pick of leading man. I don't think he has enough charisma, but he delivers well enough here, although still as if his body is encrusted. It's funny. When we watch old movies, we start criticizing on that breezy, shallow level on which people did in the old days. But somehow, that manages to sum up the flaws in the acting. Again with Lana Turner, who carried her role well enough, but with not even half the depth or density of quite a few other femmes fatale from the 1940s that I could name like Barbara Stanwyck from James M. Cain's own wonderful Double Indemnity or Audrey Totter from Tension. As a matter of fact, Totter has a small role in this film and has more presence than Turner in those few hardly blooming moments.The greatest flare of the whole film for me was the part of the story concerning the two lawyers played by Hume Cronyn and Leon Ames, friendly competitors who theatrically whip out very cocky displays of their talents, despite being a wee bit cavalier with the lives of their clients. This adds loads of spice to the story and makes it more than just a couple on the lam film.The Postman Always Rings Twice is a worthy entry in the film noir subgenre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So much potential. This could have been a great movie. Scene after scene the viewer is swept along with the momentum, only to find that the final scenes are empty, void of any motivation to watch, except in knowing that the end is near. Weakness in the `legal' aspects would have been insignificant, if only the story had been properly concluded. Lana Turner and John Garfield were masterful. The turns of emotion between contempt and fear and love and hate were brilliantly portrayed. The characterizations were real, Turner beautiful and desirable, Garfield believable as a drifter, as a handy-man, and as Turner's love interest. Yes, the DA was too brilliant and the motorcycle cop too stupid - both minor characters - most of the supporting cast was superb.The emotional tension is kept at a fever pitch until the final scenes, and then a total and complete let down. This movie should have ended at the final calamity. There was nothing more to be said, unfortunately, more was.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERS. The dramatic score is simple and apt, and the period music comments wryly on the events. Poor Cecil Callaway. He plays what looks like a baritone ukulele and sings, "I'm not much to look at, not much to see, but I've got a woman crazy for me. . . She'd be so much better off if I went away..." Meanwhile, at Callaway's own urging, Garfield and Turner are dancing in a dark room, the hormones coursing through their veins. Later, getting drunkenly into his car on his way to an appointment in Samarra, he sings, "There's a tavern in the town . . . fare thee well for I must leave thee . .."The movie evokes a lot of sympathy for the two lovers. Garfield is enthralled the moment he looks into her troubled thighs. What starts off with sex (that long slow glide of the camera along the floor to Turner's toes and up her glorious bare legs) turns into a more mature commitment. Garnett encourages our identification with the two by showing us everything from their point of view, a technique perfected by Hitchcock. Turner is no femme fatale, just a frustrated bored wife who seems to do most of the work running the roadside café. And Garfield is a drifter who has never before wanted to settle down. The two of them are caught up in a whirlwind of plot twists, all of them stemming from their own self interest.Sympathetic or not, after all, they've deliberately murdered a man who has loved Turner and treated Garfield as a nephew, the kind of easy-going not-too-bright guy whom the world could use more of. The movie is kind of unusual for its time in its sexuality. That first shot of Turner is unforgettable, even though her performance may not be. Unusual in its treatment of violence too. When Garfield slaps a would-be blackmailer around, the guy winds up cringing on the floor, blood smeared over his nose and mouth. The conventions of the time called for one or two bloodless clips on the jaw and a cowardly villain who sneers even as he complies with Garfield's demands. But Reed, as the blackmailer, is nothing more than a pitiful fat guy whose ambitions got too big for his britches, and this in the end is what the whole movie is about.Some of the plot twists are unbelievable and some of the performances no better than up to par but this is a good solid example of noir movie making.The modern remake is about as good, sticking to the depression era of the novel, and with better performers in the lead and a more comprehensible plot. Either one gives us a clear picture of how James M. Cain thought the life course was structured.You won't regret seeing this if you have the chance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining, but should have been much better!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an entertaining version of James M. Cain's classic novella. It's far from perfect though , John Garfield just doesn't convince me, and despite what some say, I don't feel any real passion between him and Lana Turner (who is undeniably hot). Unfortunately, the original material is bowlderized, but it still isn't enough to completely spoil it. Now before you say it was the 1940s and go on about censorship, watch Visconti's 'Ossessione' made three years early and in fascist Italy(!). It is much more realistic, earthier and more passionate. However that movie, as fine as it is, altered Cain's story in tone, and isn't a thriller as such, so for sheer entertainment value the Garnett version just beats it. I don't think this movie reaches the heights of other 1940s noir classics like 'Out Of The Past', 'Murder My Sweet' and 'Double Indemnity' but it's still a good popcorn movie. The subsequent Rafelson version starring Jack Nicholson was also flawed, so hopefully one day Cain's story will be given the treatment it deserves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A noir classic that still stings</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Postman Always Rings Twice" is a superb adaptation of Cain's novel and its story of sexual attraction, adultery, murder, and betrayal still resonates beautifully today.I'd like to answer the previous posting asking for an explanation of the title but to do so would give away the exquisite twist ending of the film. Suffice it to say that the title means that you think you got away with it but you didn't really--that old Postman always gets you.In the book "Dame in the Kimono" by Leonard Leff and Jerold Simmons, pp. 127-40, there is a terrific discussion of the struggle between the producers of "Postman" and Joseph Breen, the boss of the Production Office that administered the Hays Code. After considerable controversy about two earlier Cain adaptations ("Mildred Pierce" and "Double Indemnity"), "Postman" was extremely sensitive. Breen blocked this film for ten years and demanded a vast number of changes that tone down Cain's novel and make it much less sexy. The changes leave a lot of the relationship between Frank and Cora ambiguous. The changes also insert the sort of "compensating values" at the end of the film that the PCA always insisted on. What sounds like an intriguing scene involving Frank's earlier girlfriend who had a circus act with animals (lions, tigers, pumas) rolling around got cut out completely.And so it goes. Yet, as with many other great films of the era, none of the PCA cuts and alterations really matter all that much. What remains is just great. The sexual material is quite explicit enough to do the job--much sexier, to me, than a more explicit treatment. Not to be overlooked is the terrific legal strategizing by the defense attorney near the end of the film.To quote Cain, "Postman" is about "a couple of jerks who discover that a murder, though dreadful enough morally, can be a love story too, but then wake up to discover that once they've pulled the thing off, no two people can share this terrible scret and live on the same earth." Leff &amp; Simmons, p. 129. That says it all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film packs sadistic humor and a nice murder with no mystery into a solid punch (the suspense of waiting for the inevitable "second ring" of justice supplies the necessary force to move the plot to its conclusion). Garfield makes the movie with his convincing portrayal of a drifter drawn into murder by femme fatale Turner. What kind of bugs me is Lana Turner's bad acting and MGM's usual insistence that the character she plays be shown in the best possible light -- as if Turner could play a murderess, but only as long as she wasn't unlikeable or unglamorous. Still, a good suspense film well photographed and directed. Audrey Totter makes a brief appearance (she should have been allowed to steal the movie).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think it is totally unnecessary polemics about the moral character of this film. POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS TWICE is tremendously tense and dramatic film, helped with great atmosphere and very good acting. Motives of adultery and crimes of passion are certainly the most thematically processed, but do not compromise the spirit of the novel on which the movie is based.In fact, nothing could be more sensational, besides the beautiful legs. A passionate story of an emotionally torn characters. Love, passion, murder and sentences. I am delighted with the atmosphere that prevails in and around the small diner. Everything important happens at night, of course, is no accident.The tension and passion grow in intervals. The climax is the murder. The violence in the film occurs suddenly and rapidly. John Garfield as Frank Chambers is a raw young rogue who wanders aimlessly and eventually falls into the trap. Garfield maintains a rhythm from start to finish. I think how he is naive character, actually know that he is in love, and vice versa.Lana Turner as Cora Smith It is quite good as frustrated beautiful woman who wants out of life to do something. Crime is not entirely her choice. She was more scared and hurt than determined. She was an ordinary woman trapped in a passion. No way femme fatale.It is obvious that crime does not pay. However, I see this as melodramatic demonstration where emotionally weak and clumsy people destroy themselves in their own sin.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A married woman and a drifter fall in love, then plot to murder her husband... but even once the deed is done, they must live with the consequences of their actions.Surprisingly, this version was actually the third filming of The Postman Always Rings Twice, but the first under the novel's original title and the first in English. Previously, the novel had been filmed as Le Dernier Tournant (The Last Turning) in France in 1939, and as Ossessione (Obsession) in Italy in 1943.Bosley Crowther gave the film a positive review and lauded the acting and direction of film, writing, "Too much cannot be said for the principals. Mr. Garfield reflects to the life the crude and confused young hobo who stumbles aimlessly into a fatal trap. And Miss Turner is remarkably effective as the cheap and uncertain blonde who has a pathetic ambition to 'be somebody' and a pitiful notion that she can realize it through crime." Despite the multiple versions, this is probably the "definitive" one. It certainly is the one that went on to be influential. I even recall such an unlikely place as "Sesame Street" making a parody of it, which is bizarre considering this was probably not a movie that appealed to kids.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Karma Always Rings Twice.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Postman Always Rings (1946): Dir: Tay Garnett / Cast: John Garfield, Lana Turner, Cecil Kellaway, Hume Cronyn, Leon Ames: Psychological thriller about karma that is done in similar vein as Double Indemnity. John Garfield stars as Frank Chambers, a drifter who arrives at a diner and eventually lands a job there. Cecil Kellaway plays the diner owner, Nick Smith whose wife Cora Smith, played by Lana Turner has an affair with Chambers. She doesn't love her husband and schemes with Chambers to have him murdered so that she may take ownership of the diner. Eventually they succeed but not everything goes as smoothly as planned. Director Tay Garnett ups the tension to counter any possible sympathy given the wrong parties. John Garfield as Chambers is a man concealed by lust and lured into a dire scheme that doesn't reveal all of the answers until the consequences surface. Lana Turner as Cora is tired of a passionless marriage and lured by greed. Cecil Kellaway as Nick is blunt in his future plans that would have Cora in a life not desired by her. His weakness is his drunkenness, which Chambers and Cora take full advantage of. Fine supporting work by Leon Ames as a clever attorney pitting one factor against another, and Hume Cronyn as an equally clever lawyer. Theme regards the price of sin and its ability to knock on one's door willing to deliver unwanted news. Score: 9 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although I've been classic movie buff for years, I only saw this movie a few years ago. I'd heard about it, of course, and seen photos, but hadn't actually gotten around to viewing it. I bought the DVD and it sat on my shelf for a while. When I finally popped into my DVD player, I found myself highly entertained, if a bit mystified by some of the plot twists, some of which made sense, some of which did not. But on the whole, it was essential viewing for a film noir fan, or any fan of Lana Turner or John Garfield.A plot synopsis is unnecessary, because so many other reviewers have already done so, and wonderfully detailed descriptions. The heat that is generated on screen between Turner and Garfield is no myth; from the moment their characters cross paths, there's passion and doom written all over them. The attraction is instant, and with the Production Code in place, the subtlety and innuendo does more than explicit sex scenes could. Although the 1981 film version was able to be truer to the details of James M. Cain's novel, the chemistry between the leads was lacking, and no amount of lurid sex can disguise that. Turner and Garfield were Cora Smith and Frank Chambers, period. Their individual coloring provided an intriguing contrast which also contributed to their on screen dynamic. The rest of the cast, including Cecil Kellaway as Cora's elderly husband, Leon Ames as the District Attorney, Hume Cronyn as the defense lawyer and Audrey Totter as the girl Frank picks up outside a diner, are also no less than stellar.The script makes use of the male voice-over/narration so common in the genre, and it works well since Garfield is in almost every scene. There are questions, though as to the first murder plot and the obvious stupidity of Cora's husband Nick, and the legal wrangling in the courtroom sequences. However, the performances almost make you overlook the plot holes. In the end, Turner, Garfield and the rest of the cast won me over. Cora and Frank are not experienced criminals, and they inevitably make mistakes that end up costing them dearly. But their desire and eventual love for each other never really fades, despite the mistrust and anger that often comes to the surface. The title refers to death coming more than once, and it certainly does in this case.Although the DVD was released by Warner Brothers (John Garfield's home studio at the time), the movie was made by MGM, which may account for the lack of grittiness that is to be expected in film noir. Director Tay Garnett had a fairly long career, but was never considered a top director. Both Lana Turner and John Garfield made their film debuts in the late 1930s; while Turner, the blonde glamour girl who proved she had presence on film to make her one of the screen immortals went on to even greater fame in melodramas (both on screen and off) in the 50s and 60s, Garfield only had a few years left; his heart condition was made worse by his interrogation and blacklisting during the McCarthy witch hunts. He truly never gave a bad performance, and "Postman" is one of his best. He continued to work until the last year of his life, and is considered to be one of the finest actors of his generation, and of course, was one of the first Method actors in film. His early passing was a great loss to the film industry, but the impressive body of work he left behind will undoubtedly endure.It's not a perfect film, but a fascinating one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A classic, and a well directed one too, but one that always puzzles me when watching it.A more than tolerable na?ve and stupid guy once stops by at a roadside hamburger parlour where a stunningly pretty, neurotic and stupid girl lives and works. The girl is married to the owner, a babbling old fool. That makes three of them.What's wrong with this picture?Firstly, why would a girl like that be married to an old drunkard? Secondly, why would these two nervous people get the idea that they can carry out a murder? Thirdly, why would they find the outcome - inheriting a hamburger restaurant - even worthwhile? Fourthly, the younger guy claims that he's got "itching feet" i.e. he's the roaming type, and he can't stay for very long at a place. Why would he linger there? The answer is that he's infatuated with a girl, who by all likeliness wouldn't have been there in the first place.The intellectual relief is the zealous D.A. who suspects them from the start. I would have too.In the final scene we get an explanation of the monstruous title of the film, as the young fool realizes in death row that life works in mysterious ways, or something. It's not a good explanation.Despite the decent direction, there are a number of meaningless twists, such as the blond leaving to see a dying relative, while the guy dashes of with another random blonde that doesn't appear again, or the unbelievably flat-footed extortion attempt by an ex-employee of the couple's lawyer (after the killing of the old guy).Lana Turner was not a very good actress in my opinion, and it might even be that the remake is overall better than the original, which is a rare phenomenon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Studio gloss meets noir grit-lite with Lana Turner at the helm</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film noir has Lana Turner as Cora, the naive wife of a much older roadside café owner, clashing with Frank, a drifter, played by John Garfield, who rolls into town and gets a job at the diner. The two begin a flaming romance and eventually plot the murder of Cora's husband, with insurmountable ramifications.Although not perhaps the most realistic or gritty noir, "The Postman Always Rings Twice" is memorable for two reasons: first, because it was perhaps the first instance in which MGM sweater girl Lana Turner was truly able to cut her teeth; and second, its atmosphere is explosively provocative and quietly dazzling.Shadowy and slow burning, the film moves between worlds as Cora and Frank become a singular threat to Nick, and their fate unravels and splinters into a dramatic finale. Based on the book by James N. Cain (who also wrote "Double Indemnity"), "The Postman Always Rings Twice" is less talkier than a lot of noir, but constructs a languid atmosphere and is rife with dramatic (if not always entirely believable) characters. Turner lights up the screen as perhaps the most glamorous waitress of all time, and John Garfield has a great chemistry with her on screen. Moody cinematography bolstered with closeups and subtle stylistic touches accentuate the general mood of the picture.Overall, this is a fantastic noir, but it's not Mickey Spillane or anything of the like; it's a bit more leisurely and the stakes don't feel as grave as they do in other noir of the era, but the performances and dreary atmosphere that lurks in every scene make this worth the while. Lana Turner's vixenish take as the naive-turned-evil waitress is worth the price of admission alone. I'd describe the film as a weird collision of major studio gloss with the gritty tropes of noir, which, while some people may not find it that appealing, I personally enjoyed the dichotomy. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Postman Always Rings Twice" is a beautiful and stellar example of film-noir filmmaking during the 1940's. The plot, pivot characters and settings are truly unpleasant, while the ambiance and themes are literally oozing with sexual tension and morbid melancholy. Based on a novel that I sadly haven't read (yet), "The Postman etc?" is probably one of the most commonly known and often imitated film-noir stories, just because the subject matter is so deeply pessimistic and cynical. The script is actually quite convoluted, seemingly incoherent at times and centers on all the worst and most despicable behaviors of human beings: greed, lust, adultery, betrayal, dishonesty, conspiring and ? inevitably ? murder in the first degree. East-coast drifter Frank Chambers is taken in as a handyman by the wealthy and eccentric roadside diner owner Nick Smith. Nick is married to the much younger and liberated Cora, and a passionate romance between the carefree drifter and the beautiful blonde quickly ensues. They want to get away together, but the proud Cora doesn't care too much for a purposeless life on the road, so the idea of killing her husband and making it look like a banal accident is rapidly put on the table. However, the young lovers are so nervous and impulsive that they instantly make themselves look suspicious, easily manipulative and vulnerable. The consequences of their plan even lead to a complete reversal of their relationship as they are put up against each other by a sly lawyer and a persistent district attorney. Look up the term "film-noir" on Wikipedia or research books and you'll notice that all the typical characteristics and trademarks are more than well-presented in this wondrous film! It's a solidly directed and ultimately grim crime thriller/drama with voice-over guidance from the male protagonist, nasty plot-twists and woeful characters even in the supportive cast. The acting performances are downright phenomenal, with a couple of unforgettable roles. Lana Turner is exquisite as the Femme Fatale and her performance definitely ranks her amidst the top actresses of the era (like Vivien Leigh, Rita Hayworth, Lauren Bacall, Bette Davis?). John Garfield hits the exact right tone as the guy caught in a web of obsession for the woman, but the most impressive male performance come from the (severely underrated) Hume Cronyn as the devious lawyer. Terrific film, highly recommended and much more of a must-see than the 1981 remake, and that's coming from a die-hard Jack Nicholson fan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Frank Chambers (John Garfield) is newly hired at a roadside café run by a jolly middle-aged man, Nick Smith (Cecil Kellaway). Chambers soon finds himself involved with his employer's gorgeous young wife, Cora (Lana Turner). They murder Nick and are even cleared by the law, but they find out that life as murderers comes at a price.What Frank and Cora have for each other at first is no love, it is lust. It consumes them. They would do anything to get together. They act first and realize the consequences later. They run away from the café and only then discover they have nowhere to go. So, they plan on doing away with the cuckold and what they discover after this act is far more terrible. They cannot trust each other any more because they each know what the other is capable of. At the same time, they also realize they have come to love each other through their journey. They can neither live with not without each other. Since this movie was made in the era of Hays Code, it could not be explicitly sexual or let the wrong-doers get away. But it mocks the code. Where it could not show or imply sex, it is rife with steamy atmosphere and titillating symbolism. The murderers are punished but they also get their redemption making them more human.Turner and Garfield make sparks fly weather they are passionately in love or at each others throats. The platinum blond hair never sat better on any other actress as it did on Turner. She wears white throughout the movie, the intention being to contrast it with her dark personality. That idea is dated but it makes her stand out against the blacks and grays of the background. This movie is up there with the best among film-noirs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>pale in comparison with Obsession, the Neorealismo classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A double-bill of two vintage films adapted from James M. Cain's 1934 novel THE POSTMAN ALWAYS RING TWICE, 1946's Hollywood B&amp;W version and Visconti's groundbreaking debut in 1943, while intentionally evade the less-championed 1981 remake with Nicholson and Lange. The 1946 film, directed by the prolific journeyman Tay Garnett, is a less riveting Film-Noir compared to Billy Wilder's DOUBLE INDEMNITY (1944, 8/10), virulently extends the mismatch of the married couple Cora and Nick by casting the stunning beauty Lana Turner and the nondescript good fellow Cecil Kellaway, bar the gaping age difference, they don't belong together in any universe. The interloper is the shifty-looking drifter Frank (John Garfield), the unscrupulousness is all on his face, and driven by lust he falls for her at the first sight. But as the code of this specific genre, the evil thrust is almost inclusively kick-started by the female-fatale, "I wanna be somebody!", as Cora contests, she is stuck in a miasma and Frank is the last straw. As the title suggests, there are two attempts of murder (poor Nick), after a botched first one, in order to facilitate the second one, the film hastily piles up all the stimulus, including a horrid one when Nick decides to wrap up their business and move back to his hometown in Canada, and wait for the worst part, Cora will be coerced to attend to Nick's bed-ridden sister. Nick must die, there is just no other way around. It is a cheap shot. After a fine touch with echoes, Nick is dispatched successfully, then the film spirals with its poorly contrived script including the cringe-making mediation of the justice system and the worst double-cross scam from the DA Mr. Sackett (Ames), who has been ominously introduced in the very beginning of the film. Yet, we must buy it and the two get away with the murder. (An honorable mention to Hume Cronyn's remarkable impersonation as the vile attorney). But wrongdoers can never be spared in the mainstream media at then, unexpectedly, one almost steps into the trap of a bolder and more wicked twist when they return to the beach and swim to their strength's extremity, however, it is only a bluff, the ending is more self-righteous and insignificantly self-serving. Right near the opening scenes, the glaring fake backgrounds almost haul me out of the context, some oldies are simply can not be taken too seriously with today's standards, thankfully, Lana Turner can pacify the sketchy slackness with her engrossing portrait of a woman at the end of her tether, she is good, but not in the same league as Stanwyck's excellence. By comparison OBSESSION, made 3 years before the Hollywood version, is an audacious maiden work which injects tremendous pathos into its two main roles with strenuous character- dissections assisted by onerous fieldwork. Visconti ditched its original title and transposed the story in a village near Ancona with authentic settings, an accepted trailblazer of Neorealismo movement and a tour-de-force of chiaroscuro finesse. A thirty-some Giovanna (Calamai) is the wife of a trattoria owner Giuseppe (the opera chanting Juan de Landa), distressed by Giuseppe's negligence and ill-treatment and disgusted by his obesity, her passion is instantaneously ignited when she meets Gino (a masculine-built and smoldering hot Girotti), a diddling young tramp in his 20s, they sleep together the very afternoon of the day, with a ballsy nuance, the advances are in fact instigated from the female part. For Gino, a mature and attractive woman is like an oasis in the desert, but he is much wiser (and more sensible) than Frank, when Giovanna bails on their elopement, he has the balls to leave her for good, gets going on with his fellow itinerant Lo Spagnolo "The Spanish" (a prematurely- deceased Elio Marcuzzo), this interlude is not in the novel, but Visconti never miss a chance to enhance the ambiguous rapport between men, and here, it has been teased out brilliantly with the side-by-side sitting which will appear again with a different undercurrent. But destiny has its own plans, Gino reunites with Giuseppe and Giovanna during a festival, and this time he has no strength to resist the temptation, after the festive cacophony, including a jolly episode of Giuseppe contests in a singing competition, en route to their trattoria, out of an act of passion, they fake a road accident and Giuseppe is killed. After that, without the distracting offshoots of courtroom drama and the conceited detectives or snooty lawyers, the film fixates on the aftermath where they have to live on with the consequences of their unforgivable deeds, especially for Gino, he is not the type of person who can hatch a murder scheme, he is seductive but never lethal. Yet, his love for Giovanna is too intense and it overpowers his soundness of judgment, Girotti proves he is not just a burly stallion, unlike Garfield, Gino's psychological fluctuations are potently presented, and his fling with a plain-looking prostitute Anita (Cristiani) indicates his unsophisticated nature.As for Giovanna, she is an ordinary wife who needs to break out her mundane life with a man she doesn't love, at the same time, she is afraid of uncertainty, especially under the WWII backwater, she should be content but she couldn't, especially when lust presides. Calamai is less glamorous but more impressive to exert her conversion from a sulky, manipulative housewife to a vulnerable and pitiful captive for the man she wholeheartedly loves. Their reconciliation is genuinely touching and the abrupt ending is much more plaintive and sob-inducing. There is alway a mixed feeling after a double bill because you cannot love or hate them equally, confessionally, Visconti's debut would not be so exceptional if I had not watched the Hollywood adaptation beforehand, peer comparison does have its direct effect, I should try it more often.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Turner and Garfield Simmer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lana Turner and John Garfield generate quite a bit of heat in this screen adaptation of the 1934 James M. Cain novel.The material is pretty racy stuff for a 1940s audience, which explains why it took over a decade for Hollywood to muster the guts to make it into a film. I already knew John Garfield was a good actor, but I was most impressed with Turner. I'd never given her much credit, always thinking of her as more of a bombshell than an actress, but she's terrific in this.As noirs go it's probably not going to go down as one of my favorites. It's too big-budget, too glossy, too studio for me. I prefer my noirs low-budget and gritty, the ones where it looks like the filmmakers could barely afford the film the movie is printed on. But it's a very good movie in its own right, a faithful and worthy interpretation of Cain's book.Grade: A-</fullReview>

It just slinks around, electrocuting people. If ladders and cats are bad luck separately, this Film Noir effort shows that they're double trouble together. Since there is no disclaimer at the end of POSTMAN about "no animals being harmed during the making of this movie," viewers can only assume that the doomed feline shown in full rigor "the morning after" is not just "faking it" by "playing dead." Its late night death screech during the previous scene sounded real (rather than the result of "vocal coaching"), and I still can't forget than Hollywood allowed Thomasina to be buried alive (not to mention what happened to the little daughter's kitty in I REMEMBER MAMA). Some say cats have nine lives. However, Rin Tin Tin, Lassie, the Shaggy Dog and their canine cohorts seem to put out 10 "arfs" on the big screen for each "meow" heard there. Blofeld strokes his Fluffy White Pu$$y Cat as the head of S.P.E.C.T.R.E., just the foremost in a long line of screen villains to favor the nefarious feline over "Man's best friend." The POSTMAN killers are merely one more entry to a very long list.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This writer once lived in Norwalk, California, so The Postman Always Rings Twice, which was partially filmed there, tends to have special meaning. Of course, stars John Garfield and Lana Turner are sensational and make the film as memorable as it is, but it is those gas station scenes filmed in Norwalk that help bring James M. Cain's otherwise far-fetched crime thriller its much-needed dose of realism. Norwalk is located about twenty-five miles southeast of downtown Los Angeles. During the time this production was filmed, the community was much more rural than it is now and comprised mainly of orchards and oil wells. Of course, today it is all part of a massive sprawling suburban landscape. In addition to the scenes in Norwalk, Director Tay Garnett and his crew also make use of real- life locations in East L.A. and Malibu. In important ways, the film stands as historical documentation of greater Los Angeles in the mid-1940s due to its extensive on-location filming.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Toned down version of the book.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a toned down version of the book. Frank is a drifter and Cora is a whore and their relationship is so twisted that the story itself tests the limits of plausibility. For two people to commit adultery and then conspire to murder someone is within the realm of possibility. These things do happen. But the way the murder is committed and the subsequent miscarriages of justice are a stretch, especially since the district attorney is on to them immediately. That murder took place is so transparently obvious that their beating the rap, so to speak, is ridiculous. This is a case of one plus one equals two, period. Yet, the author reconfigures this equation into making one plus one equals zero. And the only reason why justice finally does prevail is because the two protagonists can't live together. She wants to get married and he wants to drift - this after they meet, cheat, sleep together, steal, defraud and murder. The story's suspense lies not in whether they will beat the rap but how long it will be before the Frank and Cora thing unravels. Now, the part of the story where the lawyer pulls a fast one on the DA regarding the insurance companies is pure hokum. The author is implying that insurance companies will cover up murder to avoid having to pay out on a policy. That's pure literary license. As for the movie, John Garfield and Lana Turner are well casted for the roles of Frank and Cora. It is too bad that the movie does not show the intensity of their relationship, which is the core of the story. Passion got the better of reason, and if the passion cannot be fully shown, then the story itself is weaker. These two young persons are so hot for each other that they lose their self-control, which distorts their thinking. In the book, Frank has a sadistic streak and Cora is a masochist. The book explicitly shows the warped nature of their relationship. That's toned way way down in the movie. Yet, it's a good movie with solid performances which captures the essence, if not the visceral details, of the book.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cora Smith (Lana Turner) is married to an older diner owner (Cecil Kellaway). When handsome young drifter Frank Chambers (John Garfield) comes to work at the diner, the two begin an affair. Before long they are plotting to kill her husband. Classic film noir with a star-making performance from Lana Turner. She oozes sex appeal. It's her presence that elevates a fairly standard plot into something sexy and alluring. Garfield plays the type of role he was made for. Hume Cronyn is terrific as Cora's wily defense attorney. Cecil Kellaway seems to get a lot of flack from critics for not being right for the part of the husband. I disagree. He seems sincere as the befuddled trusting man who can't see that his wife is shagging the handsome new cook. Leon Ames is good as the district attorney who puts the pieces together. A solid cast with a nice script and good direction make this a must-see film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It started with a voice over by the male protagonist, Frank (John Garfield). He was starring in a B&amp;W film-noir, so he was required to steer us through the film. He was a man with itchy feet, a wanderer who never put down roots, hitchhiking toward the Pacific Ocean. He found a roadside burger joint/gas station that needed help, so he told the owner (Nick)he would take the job, only to discover that Nick is married to a beautiful, younger woman--Cora (Lana Turner).In the great tradition of many American films, the leading lady is given a stunning, memorable introduction. The camera captures her standing in a doorway, dressed in a white, two-piece outfit topped with a white turban. She is glowing.As much as I wanted to like this film, I found it very disappointing. It has a promising start, but it is the victim of some uneven acting, a rambling plot that contains too many false endings, and a score that is distracting and sometimes comic in its sappiness.The two main characters perform a dance of attraction and repulsion that can only lead to one outcome--primarily due to the prevailing production codes. I did like the performance of Hume Cronyn, the clever attorney who seems to rise above the drama and politics. You could call this film Hitchcockian, but it is not tight enough to earn that compliment, though it has elements that Hitch would have loved, and a platinum blond leading lady who fits the part.Postman should be watched due to its place in the film-noir genre, but don't expect too much. It could have been so much better.</fullReview>

Cain novel that stars John Garfield as drifter Frank Chambers, who is given a lift by the local District Attorney, who lets him off at a roadside gas station café run by Nick &amp; Cora Smith(played by Cecil Kellaway &amp; Lana Turner). Cora is much younger than her husband, and growing restless about his age and laid-back ways, which kindles an affair between her and Frank. Despite the mutual attraction, they have no future together unless Nick dies, and after he announces his plan to sell the café and move in with his ailing sister, they make their murderous move, but complications ensue... Well-cast film with great chemistry between the leads, and interesting story, though having nobody to root for limits viewer involvement(and final scene is a bit corny!).

		<fullReview>It's a classic, folks. Not many people would resort to murder to win the girl of their dreams, but as far as the gorgeous Lana Turner is concerned, who can say? As a femme fatale, she puts in a dazzling performance that leaves the likes of Sharon Stone in the shade. Her victim (not lover) John Garfield may think he wears the trousers in the relationship, but the reality is she's got him under her thumb so hard you can see the indentations. Shame then, that everything than can go wrong, does... And once their scheme reaches fruition, they find themselves under investigation by a particularly persistent DA...It just has quality written all over it, from the taut build up, to the MANY twists and turns, and the surprisingly raunchy romantic scenes between Garfield and Turner. They nearly burn a hole in the screen with all the latent sexual tension, and it's amazing that in 1946 the director could imply that SHOCK HORROR... unmarried people have sex too. The only fly in the ointment is the unlikely ending where of course, 'justice must be served' and we get a raft of coincidences that lead to an unsatisfactory conclusion. But again, this was the 40's... And you couldn't have 'the bad guys' winning, could you? Regardless, it's a brilliant film, and one you really need to catch.Remade in 1981 with Jack Nicholson and Jessica Lange. Was it as good? I sincerely doubt it, but let's find out... 8/10</fullReview>

He's tough and vulnerable and sees Cora as his one chance to turn his life around. Turner is perfectly cast as the sultry wife; dressed almost entirely in crisp, pure white, she exudes desperation and desire. They make a sensuous couple without showing more than a kiss.The acting is superb as is the direction.

		<shortDescription>Crime, Mystery, Morality, Love, Justice ? the Drama of life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most viewers who comment on this film see it as a noir mystery with much sensuality between the two leads. That adds up to considerable entertainment for many. I enjoy good mysteries as well, but there is much more in this film than that. And the more is what makes "The Postman Always Rings Twice" a very good movie. I won't rehash the plot or the outstanding acting that Lana Turner and John Garfield give to their roles ? or that of Cecil Kellaway, for that matter. Some find it hard to accept the "dupe" of the older husband. But who can say that such a marriage is implausible ? especially when the author of the book created the character? Some of us have known just such types of marriage that existed in our family pasts ? or have read about them in real-life stories.So, what are some of the "more" that the Postman has to offer? To begin with, the fear, worry, angst and paranoia the leads show after their first botched attempt. Can we not imagine ? most of us who are not cold- blooded killers ? that we would be like Frank and Cora? Wouldn't our consciences bother us as it did them on and off? Both characters were very conflicted about committing murder. First, they think it's their only way out, and then they have regrets and second thoughts? Would that not be the way most people ? most humans would be and react in such circumstances? Modern movies with all their mayhem have characters who emote about as much as robots after mowing down countless opponents ? good or bad. But the Postman gives us a much more real portrayal of human nature and our understanding of right and wrong and knowing that killing is wrong.Of course, most of us would probably not get to such a circumstance in the first place. But the story is about two people who do. They begin an adulterous affair. The male character, Frank, truly is a drifter who chases after women. Cora is tempted when he comes on the scene. Both know they should be apart, and both try to leave to end the relationship. There is morality at work here. Adultery always involves deceit. Can true love come of such, or last? The film shows so realistically the distrust that arises between Frank and Cora. Finally, when Cora leaves to be with her dying mother and then returns pregnant, she has a resolve to start again, with love for her man. Only, justice has not yet been served. So the drama plays out with an unusual twist that confirms the age-old adage that crime does not pay. The very final scene may seem a little hokey, but for Frank's character ? who actually was NOT very bright or smart, a glimmer of hope in love lost seems to be a fair deal in return for payment for his crimes. All-in-all a very good film, very entertaining, and very satisfying with its conclusion. This film was so well done by all, that the viewer doesn't root for the stars to triumph in their illicit love affair.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>MGM bought the film rights to James M. Cain's novel in 1934, but with the Hays Production Code getting under way about that time, it was decided to shelve the story for the time being. Interestingly, by 1944, another Cain novel was brought to the screen utilizing many of the same elements to be found here. That was "Double Indemnity" produced by Paramount. With the time right, MGM found itself a winner with this hugely successful film, in no small part owing to it's stars Lana Turner and John Garfield, both at or near the top of their careers.With that out of the way, and with the film's significant name recognition among noir film fans, one's initial viewing might offer a bit of a let down. There's no way in my mind that Lana Turner's character ever hooks up with a Cecil Kellaway, even with Cora Smith's (Turner) half convincing explanation. As for Kellaway's character, husband Nick Smith, was there ever a bigger dimwit in screen annals when it comes to putting two and two together? Consider the suitcase scene - it never crossed his mind that Frank (Garfield) and Cora might have been running off together, no, he was more concerned with what Frank might have stolen from the Twin Oaks. Brother.And how about the first murder attempt, and that whole business with the ladder against the side of the house. Why would that ladder have been a definitive clue for the police? Why would Cora even have to use the ladder to get out of the house? I'm still wondering about that one.There's a lot of stuff like this going on, with the best saved for the latter half of the film once Cora's written confession kicks in and her defense attorney (Hume Cronyn) pulls that nifty plea switcheroo with the DA (Leon Ames). At that point, you would think for sure that Frank and Cora got away with murder, but the picture just refuses to end. It's one thing after another between the ill starred lovers, right up till the finale when Garfield's character trips all over himself attempting to link the story to the title of the movie. And yet, with all of the incredible stuff going on, it's hard not to get wrapped up in the film, particularly with the distracting presence of Lana Turner in the picture, lending new definition to the term hot. She was just funny that way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Sensual Version of James M. Cain Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the most exciting and provocative film noir of the 1940's (and of one of the most simplest also) "The Postman Always Rings Twice" brings the bittersweet love story between a drifter and a married woman that turns out into a plot of murder, tragedies and deceptions. John Garfield plays Frank Chambers, the mysterious man who entered in a almost abandoned restaurant conduced by Nick (Cecil Kellaway) and his wife Cora (Lana Turner), who is the main factor of why he takes a job in the place just to be near her. They want to be together and in order to fulfill their lustful desires they decide to kill Cora's husband. But the plan and its executions (yes, the guy just don't die that easily) has its problems, imperfections, complications and they might even forget their original plan when things start to become badly for them.Based on a novel by James M. Cain (who also wrote "Double Indemnity", story very similar as this one), "TPART" follows the book at parts, changes some of the names (Nick's Greek last name in the book was translated as Smith in the film, Hollywood had those xenophobic feelings sometimes) and situations (Lana's Cora is way more aggressive/controlling/smart than the one of the novel while Frank is quite well-mannered opposed to the dirty one of Cain's book), improving other suitable for a story considered scandalous in its time but the basis of the book is present here and is brilliantly presented. The relationship between Frank and Cora is precisely well made, delivering lots of sensuality by showing less than we want to see and this whole thing made the film a perfect stage for Turner and Garfield to show their acting abilities. One must consider two things: 1) in 1946, films had to pass the strict Hays Code to be allowed to pass on theaters which means they couldn't show much in terms of sex and kisses (which could only last for five or ten seconds, and somehow, a tongue kiss passed the censors view in these film) and 2) the remake made in 1981 with Jack Nicholson and Jessica Lange, who had the advantage of displaying more than just looks and kisses on the screen, it was a explosive sexual encounter. As Lana Turner pointed out her task was more difficult given what she and Garfield had to work, and the way they built their relation in the film without showing sex and body parts was more effective than the one of the remake, which was quite gratuitous at times (but I like both versions). But the film is not just a love story, it's also a noir and Tay Garnett directed a wonderful film noir, wise in setting the musical score in a good way (musics were excessive in films those days played all the time) creating tension not only between the attempts of murdering Nick but also during the heated discussions between Frank and Cora, when one turned against the other when things didn't happened the way they planned. Coming as a strange fact the movie decides to explain the title (which never happens in the book) as something like the Postman ringing twice being something like a warning for things, in this case, a warning for bad things that should be avoided before they turn into something difficult or impossible to unmade. Notice that almost everything important in the story happens twice: two attempts to kill Nick; two trials; and the list goes on. The explanation worked as a morality device for the film, things very common in that era (thankfully, the remake avoided this).Great performances by the cast which also includes Hume Cronyn playing Frank and Cora's lawyer, who always keeps repeating to them "I'll handle it" referring about the case; great plot and a great film, this is a really must see for film noir fans out there. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Postman Always Rings Twice" is based on James M. Cain's famous 1934 novel of the same name. In the movie, a drifter (John Garfield) takes a job at a roadside restaurant and falls for the proprietor's young wife (Lana Turner). Before long, she persuades him to murder her husband so that they can be together.The two leads, Garfield &amp; Turner, are integral to the movie's success. Their chemistry suggests sexual attraction mingled with disdain, which is the ideal mix for the way that the story unfolds. The supporting cast is mostly undistinguished, except for Hume Cronyn, who steals every scene he's in.Tay Garnett's workmanlike direction is more than adequate but the script seems to stumble a bit from time to time. I can't say that the score made much of an impression on me either but it must have been passable at least.Ultimately, "The Postman Always Rings Twice" is a worthwhile film noir but not one of the best examples of the genre. I can't compare with Cain's novel since I haven't read it but I suspect that the book is better. In any case, the movie is certainly worth a look, despite some imperfections.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Postman Always Rings Twice" is definitely a classic film noir with its strong suit being its excellent incorporation of atmosphere, both through lighting and set design. The coffee shop serves as a bold contrast to the sterile life that Cora lives.Unfortunately, this movie seems to only be half right. The first half of the movie is weak, dull, and slow-moving. This movie seems to take forever to build up. The poor dialog doesn't seem to help matters either. However, once it has built up, the second half of the movie is a real thrill, full of unexpected treats for the audience.Hume Cronyn steals the show as the sharp and witty attorney. However, when the best character is a relatively minor one, it says something about the cast of the movie. You can either take this movie or leave it. If you make it through the first hour, I commend you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Postman Always Rings Twice" is an excellent film-noir thriller! Lana Turner really steals the show, with her Marilyn-Monroe-looks and doe-eyed gaze, which in some close ups even made me melt. Turner does a great job of playing the damsel-in-distress meets dark and calculating.Although I did not find the film's cinematography to be particularly creative or groundbreaking, it still had excellent lighting, crisp contrast and good camera angles. So, for the most part, I it was visually strong and well roundedI did feel that some parts of this film were a bit silly. Some examples - the slightly artificial acting in some of the more dramatic scenes towards the end as well as a couple of the plot's seemingly unnecessary or off topic satellites. In conclusion, if you ever find yourself jonesing for some simply and good old-fashioned murder mystery, "The Postman Always Rings Twice" will do the job.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>1946 was arguably as near as dammit to the mid-point of the era of the 'studio system' when regular filmgoers could walk into a movie theatre halfway through the main feature - and you could do that in the days of 'continuous performance' - and tell within seconds just by the 'feel' of the film which studio had produced it. The 'feel' over at MGM was sentiment veering toward schmaltz - Lassie - sophisticated romantic comedy drama - The Thin Man - and lavish musicals - Anchors Aweigh. In 1946 they released among others The Harvey Girls, Love Laughs At Andy Hardy, The Courage Of Lassie, Holiday In Mexico, Til The Clouds Roll By, The Thrill Of Brazil and The Postman Always Rings Twice. Hold it. What's that last one doing in there, that belongs at Warners, surely. You tell me. As MGM fodder this was as bizarre as it gets nevertheless they got it right and turned out a doozy of a noir. Jimmy Cain might have written his nouvella with John Garfield in mind except Garfield wasn't around at the time but he inhabits the part as he inhabited ninetey per cent of his parts. Lana Turner is fine in support as is Leon Ames and Hume Cronyn. Tay Garnett did a swell job of directing. What's not to like.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Itchy feet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frank is this drifter who cannot stay in one place for very long. He has very "itchy" feet and very itchy eyes (that comes later). So Frank ends up working at this road side diner and that's when he meets Cora. He falls in love with her but the only problem is that she's married. This movie was very shocking back then but not now. I think that it's a great story of forbidden love and forbidden passion. The scenes are as passionate and full of lust as they could be for the time. "The Postman Always Rings Twice" also has many twists and turns in it. Just when you think that something is going to happen, something else happens that throws the story in a different direction. A story of forbidden love that stands the test of time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Garfield and Lana Turner had the chemistry which sold tickets to this movie. What is interesting is the support they get which makes it into a solid film. Crudos should go to the men who play the Lawyers as they bring off their small roles quite well.The book must do better than this film as there are times where the realism is very much lacking. In particular the story line with Turners character confession and the 2 who later try to blackmail her makes no sense. Why would she offer them money for a piece of paper she can't be penalized for? Because she loves a man who just cheated on her? There are some other flaws in the plotting that ring out as recommendations to read the book too. The strength of the film is the acting which makes you want to watch. Age makes these holes look gaping more to today's audience than the 1946 ones.This original is better than the 1980's remake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Love and lust, love and murder. James M. Cain, John Garfield and Lana Turner make fine, tawdry story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With platinum hair, dark eyelashes and pouty lips, Cora Smith is a slut to dream about. Or maybe she's just an ambitious, dissatisfied wife, married to Nick, the fat older owner of a greasy roadside diner. Or maybe all those banked flames of hers are getting too much fresh oxygen from tough, dumb Frank Chambers, who drifts into her life and watches Cora's lipstick roll across the diner floor to his feet. It doesn't matter. Fate is walking slowly down the highway toward Cora and Frank. Nothing is going to change what passion and murder will bring them, and the twist of ironic justice sets them up for a great ending. There are so many good things about this movie. The four obvious ones start with the story by James M. Cain. We're talking hot lust, dumb love and the kind of ironic inevitability that always comes in first-class noirs. There's the cynical display of the legal process, not quite corrupt -- what does justice have to do with the law? -- but rewarding to those who can best manipulate it. There's Lana Turner as Cora, no actress, but who makes believable the kind of blood-thumping single-mindedness that can turn a not-so-smart drifter into a willing participant in murder. She can offer sex and she can offer love, and neither we nor Frank is sure which has any truth. Frank will settle for the sex, but then he realizes with Cora he might have both. And there's John Garfield as Frank in a perfect performance as this flawed, gullible sap who thinks he can commit murder and call it love. All he wants is Cora on a hot night. He winds up wanting Cora for eternity, and is comforted that she'll be there for him. Do many people remember John Garfield now? He made a name on Broadway and an even bigger name in Hollywood. He was a committed liberal who was ruined during the Commie witch-hunts. By the late Forties he couldn't find work in Hollywood. All those studio heads who made money from his films didn't want to touch him. He was no Communist, just too liberal for the frightened suits. Garfield's film career was in tatters. He was a first-class actor but naive when it came to politics. He couldn't understand what was happening to him. He died of heart failure in New York in 1952 while trying to reestablish himself on the stage. He was 39. To see just how good he was, watch his reaction shots in this movie...when he first sees Cora...when he has to get in the car next to Nick right after he's smashed Nick's skull with a bottle...when at the end of the movie he reads Cora's note and listens to the DA. Garfield's last major movie was Force of Evil in 1948. These two films demonstrate just how powerful a screen actor John Garfield was and how much this nation lost through expediency and intimidation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After a long delayed viewing of this, I was really pleasantly surprised.The next sentence WILL RUIN the movie for you, so don't read any further, mmm-kkay? Along it's length you suspect this movie will be moving directly from point A to point B in the "morality tale" format. Instead it goes to ever richer, ever more sinister places. Around the time Hume Cronyn arrives as very funny, very evil lawyer (who's also a guardian angel... a great part!), the movie develops a more satisfying 2nd act than I've seen in very long time, and it still has surprises in store. Part of the reason this is better than many other famous noirs, is that it is long enough to devote time to sub-plots and supporting characters. In this way it reminds me of Out of the Past, my other favorite noir.Although it lacks punchlines, it's very funny. And though it's only 1946, cynicism about politics (almost like Ben Hecht) is already in full bloom. The D.A.s guesses about what happened are off just a little, so that by the time a charge sticks, guilt and crime have become just a form of political-legal barter; a more trusting and interesting idea to hand an audience than the morally simplistic garbage we're fed today. And also very modern to trust an audience!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I highly recommend this film. The acting is excellent, the direction is superb, and the writing is good. The only thing I disliked about it was the soundtrack-- they should have opted for some soulful jazz rather than whatever bland instrumentation they opted for.The cinematography was simple, and yet that made it all the more effective. Today's movies almost never hold a single shot for more than a minute. The "still frame" used in so many scenes of The Postman Always Rings Twice allows for the actors to really rise to the top of their game-- which they do, and enjoyably so.I won't spoil the ending, but I must admit I didn't like it so much. Watch this movie and decide for yourself.Regardless, this movie is worth repeat watching when you have friends over on a rainy day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The rights for the screenplay of this movie were actually purchased in 1934. Because film censorship was running so strong, they didn't think they would be able to get the movie made as it should be and sat on it for over ten years. After Double Indemnity (by the same author) was made and became a huge hit, they went ahead with Postman. Frank hitchhikes onto the scene and meets Cora. Cora quickly falls for Frank and decides to run away with him. But she doesn't have to walk too far to realize that she doesn't want to start over with Frank, "Like a couple of tramps." Cora talks Frank into killing Nick and things go downhill from there. It's the old "Most accidents occur in the home" trick and they plot out every foreseeable circumstance except the obvious one...

There aren't many surprises for today's experienced movie audiences, and the film goes on about one development too long, but you can't beat its atmosphere and tension. 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

After he is murdered, what follows are destructive patterns for both lovers. The double crossings of the lawyers (played by other great character actors Leon Ames and Hume Cronyn), will make your heads swim.

		<fullReview>Based on James M. Cain's best-selling novel, this film-noir classic features Lana Turner in one of her best roles as a beautiful and sexy little tart who convinces her lover(John Garfield) to help off her dull old husband(Cecil Kellaway) so they can be together. There are several wildly unexpected twists in this ultra-steamy drama. The sex scenes were, of course, more explicit in Cain's original novel, and given the times and strict-censorship, they were toned down considerably for the movies. But that hardly matters. Turner and Garfield are so perfectly matched that you can feel the chemistry between them. You can't easily say the same for Jessica Lange and Jack Nicholson in that ridiculous remake. Stick with the original, even if you have to see it in its colorized form.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Torrid Romance.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frank Chambers (John Garfield) stops at a rural diner for a bite to eat, and after noticing the "Man Wanted" sign-ends up working there. The diner is run by beautiful Cora Smith (Lana Turner), and her much older husband, Nick (Cecil Kellaway). The animal attraction is evident from the off and the pair soon enter into an affair. It's an affair that will have far reaching consequences for all three parties.Forget any remake and go straight to this, the best adaptation of James M. Cain's hard hitting novel. Out of MGM, it's nice to say that the studio, in spite of 1940s censors, let director Tay Garnett put vitality into Cain's novel and more crucially,! let Turner fan the flames of smouldering passion. From the moment the camera pans from her shapely foot to the silky blonde mop that sits above her beautiful face, we know that Frank Chambers, and us the audience, are about to be taken in hook line and sinker.Much has been made of the over-use of lighting with Turner in the film, that complaint is something I just can't truck with in any shape or form. It's not for nothing that Turner's Cora is virginal white for 98% of the picture, surely a sign that Cora is in need of some dark to lighten her dark existence. Sounds weird I'm sure, but there it is, and the lighting only emphasises that virginal quality about to be steered down a troubled road. It should also be noted that the only time she's out of white is for the particularly dark moments in her life. It's a confliction with the Noir ethic to utilise whiteness, but this is a very different femme fatale, more vulnerable and searching for love, even if ultimately it's car crash love. John Garfield matches Turner in performance. A performance that gathers momentum at every quarter. So it's no surprise to find that both actors got a positive response from critics and public alike. But the support is also very strong, particularly Hume Cronyn &amp; Leon Ames. While Kellaway absolutely nails that good old harmless old boy seriously in denial-out of his depth character-with some aplomb.I personally was delighted with a different sort of film-noir viewing here. And I have to say that I avoided this film on account of having watched the Jack Nicholson remake first, years ago; and found it immeasurably dull. This is a different animal, much like the female protagonist funnily enough. Perhaps the final word should come from James M. Cain himself? Who after seeing what Turner did with the role of Cora gave her a gift of a leather bound first edition of the book, the inscription said "For my dear Lana, thank you for giving a performance that was finer than I expected." Tis true that, lighting be damned! 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have not seen the new version but I must say I was very captivated by this one. It must have inspired David Lynch, since the bar is called "Twin Oaks" (Twin Peaks), and I thought the story was really naughty and imaginative like a Twilight Zone episode and a Hitchcock movie (but clearly different from Hitchcock's style). Anyway, it is amazing that a movie from 1946 can still be so intense and interesting today. I thought the movie has some interesting moral issues, such as whether it was OK to kill the old man from the viewpoint of ethics, because perhaps they had no other choice and something good could perhaps have come out of it. I did not know the story. I had just heard about the title, and I had heard about James Cain, so when I watched it last night from 3.am, it was like watching an amazing and shocking dream unfold. I guess, if one knows what is going to happen next it is not going to be as interesting. Anyway, this movie really seemed to appeal to me, and the situation I am in. I am also 33 which must have been around the age of "Frank", the male lead character. I think, the movie, as I have said, is more like a fantasy, also because of the scenes by the ocean, than a real crime story, so what we see here is really a story from the twilight zone, although a real twilight zone episode would probably have turned out a bit differently, such as Frank waking up and discovering that in another dimension he had become the husband that they set out to kill, or something like that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The moment we see Lana Turner, the Hollywood diva, appear in the movie, she looks just like what she is: a Hollywood diva. She looks and is dressed as though she'd just come back from a country club in Beverly Hills where she was playing a game of tennis, and looks nothing like the wife of an old guy on some off-road diner. And Garfield talks and acts like a gangster in a 30s movie. Still, once one gets past the unlikely and extremely glamorous look of Turner (which is a nice thing otherwise), and Garfield's somewhat clichéd acting, the film gets interesting; there are plenty of twists and unexpected developments to keep continual interest for nearly two hours. The car-accident at the end is too coincidental and overly dramatic. Not necessarily weaker than the remake (which I've seen too long ago and I can't remember much of - apart from Nicholson humping Lange on the kitchen table (a scene that later inspired many Michael-Douglas-humping-a-female-co-star thrillers)) but looks less realistic, which isn't surprising considering that it's a 40s film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I love Film Noir,...but wasn't thrilled with this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those films that I just don't see what others see. While I would agree it's a decent film with some great moments, it also is very uneven and I can think of many Noir films I like a lot more. Now before I go on there are a couple important things to mention. First, Noir is perhaps my favorite type of film and I have a genuine love for the genre--and having seen so many Film Noir movies I think I have a rather informed opinion. Second, I just saw this film for the second time because I thought perhaps my original assessment for the film was unduly harsh. While I liked it a little more the second time, my opinion didn't change dramatically.As far as why I didn't love the film, I think much of the problem is that casting Cecil Kellaway as the husband of Lana Turner goes WAY beyond just suspending your disbelief to enjoy the film. He was old, drank too much and wasn't particularly rich or interesting. So, WHY would a lady that looks like Lana Turner marry him in the first place?! And, if she did, of course she'd want to get out of the marriage!! Additionally, the first half of the movie was much weaker than the second. The dialog was pretty sappy and unbelievable between Turner and Garfield until after Kellway returned from the hospital. It just didn't ring true and didn't sound like Noir--it needed to be punched up somehow.For me, the movie improved a lot when the couple were brought to trial for the murder of Kellaway, as Hume Cronin stole the show as the cynical and manipulative defense attorney. He WAS a great Film Noir attorney! And, following his appearance the film just seemed to get a lot smarter. Garfield and Turner's dialog also improved greatly. While I could not believe they were in love (almost instantly) in the first half of the film, their hatred and contempt was a wonderful antidote to their earlier sappy personalities. And, when they began turning on each other it really took off as a film.While not a bad film at all, you could certainly do a lot better with a film such as THE KILLERS, DOA or DOUBLE INDEMNITY. Plus, a somewhat similar but underrated film that came out a year later (THEY DON'T BELIEVE ME), is definitely a better take on the adultery and spousal murder theme.UPDATE: I recently saw a film similar to "The Postman Always Rings Twice" but it handled a very similar story better. In "The Adultress", you have a story that works better because the husband is far less likable and younger--and you could understand ANY woman hating this vapid existence. Making the viewers more sympathetic towards the wife really helped the story.</fullReview>

At times the film is wryly comic with some interesting ironies, and the acting on behalf of Hume Cronyn and Alan Reed is worth watching for. Turner is not really all that believable though - and neither is most of the plot, plus the story does take a while to end. But in spite of the problems that I have with it, the film contains a number of great moments, and at least for those moments it is worth watching, and the film by all means improves after the first 40 or so minutes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"I could never belong to only one man ? I belong to *all* men," said Lana Turner as her character in *The Prodigal*. Lana never lets you (or herself) forget that she is the ultimate sex goddess ? but in *Postman*, at least, she rarely forgets that she's playing a character and not herself. It is perhaps her finest work ? from a body of work that includes very few truly stellar performances. She was a star, and not necessarily an actress, and because of that, so much of her work does not stand the test of time. She is best remembered for the spate of films like *Peyton Place* and *Madame X* that traded on her personal tragedies, but *Postman*, which pre-dates all that, is a stunner ? a cruel and desperate and gritty James Cain vehicle that sorely tests Lana's skills. But she succeeds marvelously, and from the first glimpse of her standing in the doorway in her white f*ck-me pumps, as the camera travels up her tanned legs, she becomes a character so enticingly beautiful and insidiously malevolent that the audience is riveted. It is a *noir* tale of lust, betrayal and murder that, along with *Mildred Pierce* and *Double Indemnity* (all by James Cain ? are we sensing a pattern here?), that remains one of the few truly important women's roles in the *film noir* genre. Turner wears white, head-to-toe, throughout the film ? hot, stark, tawdry white ? and is anything but virginal. But it is a nice counterpoint to the doublecrossing and *noir* feel. Cora is a dame who wants *out*, but killing her husband (Kellaway) was never really part of her plan. And then along comes Frank (Garfield), a drifter with itchy feet who beats Cora at her own game of seduction and manipulation. With a plot hinging on twists and turns that might not have worked as well with less electricity than Turner and Garfield generated, it sizzles and flares with crackling tension, and lays waste to the 1981 version with Jessica Lange and Jack Nicholson. Though criticized for compromising the sexual nature of the story to appease the censors, the envelope gets pushed just far enough to make it one of the hottest of the least graphic variety. A stunning achievement that will live forever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Talky version of Cain's first novel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The best thing about this rather vapid 1946 production of the James M. Cain pulp novel/turned literature is Lana Turner as Cora, but not for her acting, which was ordinary, but because she looked so good. Director Tay Garnett had her in stunning, shapely white dresses, pants and uni's that showed off her figure, complemented by a platinum hairdo that in glorious black and white was so intense it was almost colorful. (People on the set may have needed to wear shades.) After she returns from her mother's funeral, Garnett has her in the blackest black from a black hat to her black shoes--heels, I should emphasize, since she was almost always in heels in the movie, even returning from the beach or crawling up a canyon in the Santa Monica Mountains, she was in heels.John Garfield, who plays Frank Chambers as though wandering through the role (which is not entirely inappropriate), is sympathetic and has the kind of raw animal appeal that we would expect to see in Cain's depression-era antihero. But he too was not out to win any acting awards. Cecil Kellaway, who plays Nick (in this case a "Nick Smith," not the Greek immigrant Nick Papadakis from the novel) does the best acting job as he brings a bit of the delusive psychology of an older man with a beautiful young wife to life when he announces that he selling the café and moving to the backwoods of Canada so Cora can take care of him and his invalid sister! This bit of senile daydreaming was not in the novel; indeed a lot of what transpired in this self-conscious, misconstructed flick was not in the novel, including a sappy post-ending in which the title is "explained." I won't go into the explanation except to say it wasn't convincing, but I can understand why they tacked it on since nowhere else (that I know of) is the title explained. Cain's original, and appropriate title was, "Bar-B-Que." See my review of the novel at Amazon.com for some speculation on how they came up with the rather magical title.A better rendition of the Postman is the 1981 production starring Jack Nicholson and Jessica Lange. It too is no masterpiece, but it is both truer to the novel and less talky. A true to the spirit of the novel adaptation would require a terse, stream-lined directorial style with an emphasis on blind animal passions unconsciously acted out, something novelist Cormac McCarthy might accomplish if he directed film. I think that Christopher Nolan, who directed the strikingly original Memento (2000) could do it.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book "Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"

		<shortDescription>Different after 60 Years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this when it was first released and again in 2002. Are the differences between my unassisted recollection and the movie as I see it on video now changes in me, in movie-making, or in life? Were we living in such an authority dominated world that such a thin case as the DA has in the movie would have prevailed? Fortunately I never found out, but there is some truth in that idea. Locally we used to have half a dozen fatalities among prisoners in the local jail caused by falling down stairs (people picked up for drunk and disorderly, not for murder).But the movies have changed too. There is more texture in the average modern mediocre film than in the best of 1946. The use of an actor with an English accent to play a roadside cafe owner, presumably in California but certainly in the United States, would be absurd today. For that matter, Turner's starlet school accent is pretty strange too. Garfield is the only one who speaks convincingly to an ear in the year 2002.And then I have seen a film or two since 1946 (and a couple before that, starting in the mid 20's), so that the impact of an ominous sound track is much reduced. I probably would have given it an 8 in 1946, but it's dropped to 7 (which is pretty good from me) now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Dynamic John Garfield and Lana Turner, sizzle in this adaptation of James M. Cain's bristling novel of love, betrayal, and murder.Garfield plays Frank Chambers (a role he was born to play), a drifter, whose "feet are just achin to go places," he spots a sign at a cafe that says "Man Wanted," and that's where the fun begins.He meets Cora Smith, a beautiful blonde, silhouetted in the doorway, bathed in white. Chambers is breathless (as we are). This initial sighting of each other is one of the all-time greats in the history of cinema; it's boiling over with sexual heat, and right from the start, Chambers knows she's his for the takingExcept there's one problem: she's married to Nick Smith, an older, jovial man, who seems unaware of his wife's affect on other men.This is the set-up, and to reveal more would be sacralegious. So just hold onto your seats, because TPART is a great ride.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Say what you like about Lana Turner's acting ability, that's probably not what the studio hung on to her for! The scene which sticks in everyone's mind who has seen this movie is the one where she drops the lipstick, lets it roll across the floor to John Garfield's feet, then the camera pans up her lily white costume to see the turbaned Cora. Now, that's sexy. Jessica Lange and Jack Nicholson and their antics amongst the bread rolls in the remake was not!The plot is fairly contrived, from James M Cain's pulp novel about illicit lovers who plot and commit a murder, and what happens after. Cecil Kellaway plays Lana's jovial and cuckolded husband Nick with ease, while Leon Ames puts in a familiar but well-played bit as the couples' lawyer. Others in the cast making less of an impact are Hume Cronyn and Audrey Totter.I have to give John Garfield his due though. His career was cut short far too soon and it is always great to see him on the screen. A thoughtful actor who sticks in the mind long after the picture is through. This version of 'The Postman Always Rings Twice' is the only one worth your time, really. Even if it is to gawk at the much-married drama queen herself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Innocence adrift in a world of cynicism and evil</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James Cain is usually considered the third point of the triangle of writers who brought the hard boiled detective or mystery story to the American public. But Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler concentrated on the detective aspect because of their own backgrounds as detectives (Hammett working for - and eventually despising - the Pinkerton Agency). Also Hammett and Chandler both had distinct styles that made them more literary fans outside the detective/mystery genre. But while Hammett and Chandler wrote best sellers, Cain usually wrote for pulp magazines. So there is an unfair neglect of this fine writer, who gave us not only THE POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS TWICE, but DOUBLE INDEMNITY, MILDRED PIERCE, and SERENADE as other works of fiction To me the original version of THE POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS TWICE with John Garfield as Frank and Lana Turner as Cora is superb: the two doomed lovers who find redemption and forgiveness (and possibly peace together) only by violent death. The rest of the cast is excellent too, in particular Cecil Kellaway as Nick, Leon Ames' District Attorney Kyle Sackett, and Hume Cronym's defense attorney Arthur Keats. Also note Alan Reed (best remembered now as the voice of Fred Flintstone) as Ezra Kennedy, detective turned blackmailer.POSTMAN is in a sense a poor man's DOUBLE INDEMNITY. Instead of dealing in a world of insurance companies, upper middle class Los Angeles families (Mr. Dietrichsen, the victim, happens to be involved in the oil industry in Bakersfield), and a sense of social class (note how Dietrichsen does not like his daughter seeing Nino Segetti - he is after all an Italian - American, not a Wasp). Here Nick is willing to give a job to Frank, who is only a transient, and it is only Cora who is hesitant about the new employee at their gas station/restaurant. Nick is a simple man - he likes to sing and play the guitar. He is also argumentative about his creditors (his meat suppliers and his laundry service). But his very penny pinching is symptomatic of his lower middle class situation. So is Cora's determination to try to turn the restaurant "Twin Oaks" into a fancy success.Garfield, a terrific actor but never quite as helpless as in this film, is struck by the way fate keeps throwing him back to his doom at the restaurant with Cora. He tries to flee - once he and Cora try to flee together, but the dust and dirt on the road makes Cora realize that fleeing with Nick won't better their lives. Every time he flees he returns like a homing pigeon. Cora's physical attraction to him is just too much to escape. Later he is twisted by the vagaries of the law one way or another, until he does not know what his real position is.Turner is skillfully used in this film as in no other for her physical beauty's key point: her blondness. In most of the scenes she is shown wearing white to accentuate her hair. The white also, occasionally, shows her physical points too: when she first is seen climbing a stairs in a white skirt, the rising skirt (because it is white) enables us to see the outline of her hip and rear end. Only when she is determined to either kill herself or Nick does she change clothes and wear black - her soul has reached it's crisis point. Otherwise she is as innocent of evil as Frank or Nick.Nick (Kellaway) is a decent person - his worst flaws is his alcoholism, and blindness to what the situation of Cora with the young Frank is building to. In the end he even wishes to sell his property in order to go assist a paralyzed sister in Canada. For once in a murder story film the victim is likable. His singing is also interesting, because his songs tend to tell the situation he is currently facing. When he is killed he is singing "There is a Tavern in the Town", with the haunting line (given what is going to happen), "Fare thee well, for I must leave thee". Kellaway had his best recalled role here.The conflicts of decent people doing wretched things to each other (Nick condemning Cora to a life of drudgery regarding caring for his sister in Canada; Frank and Cora conspiring against Nick) is shared by the two attorneys. Ames' Sackett and Cronym's Keats, are friends who actually admire the sparring tactics each brings to their courtroom performances. Sackett also happens to be a neighbor (and friend) of Nick, and he suspects what Frank and Cora are up to. But his zeal in forcing a signed statement from Frank when the latter is in his sick room is nauseating to the viewer (by the way, such tactics were and are legal at times). Keats is a brilliant adversary, and demonstrates this at the arraignment and the trial (forcing Ames to reduce the murder sentence to manslaughter forgiven by court leniency!). But he is a cynical manipulator, even willing to fool Cora into thinking she gave a confession of the crime to the D.A. (she gave it to his assistant Kennedy (Reed)). Still he forgives them the fee for getting Cora off - though subsequently he forces them to marry so they can't testify against each other. As for Reed, his blackmail attempt is beaten literally - he is beaten into a pulp, making the sad admission to Frank and Cora that his sole friend was his partner in the blackmail. As I said everyone is innocent in this world, but it is a cynical and evil world.And the end - Cora and Frank expiate for killing Nick - but in a twist wherein the wrong victim is used. Yet one feels they both are forgiven at the end - as are all the innocence of our sad world.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Two quick things about "The Postman Always Rings Twice": 1. Hellooooo, Lana Turner.2. This was a genuinely surprising flick; the second half just comes out of nowhere.It's a sexually-charged murder yarn, and the chemistry between Garfield and Turner is electric. That they're forbidden lovers almost makes their plot to kill Turner's husband sympathetic. And Turner makes for one terrifically demure femme fatale. But the real surprises don't come until the lawyers show up with that insurance policy twist, and the twists just keep coming after that. And were it not for Lana's iconic intro, Hume Cronyn's amazing performance would easily be the best thing about this movie. But I can't get those gams out of my head. 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is the narrator's voice of the main actor to help tell the story, so it is first-person narration, and the movie emphasises the main actor because it is story about him. However, I think the main actress is more dominant than the actor in the role of performance. In addition, there are many background musics that performed almost every scene of the movie; it makes the story is going on smoothly. Moreover, in the scene that after the main actor made the new sign for restaurant, they celebrated by playing music and dancing. While the main actor and actress were dancing, it was interesting to see the light from the sign that opened and closed between dancing. This makes the dancing more classic. The climax of movie is the point which the main actor and actress would want to kill the own restaurant, so I suddenly knew the end of the movie would not be happy, but how ? As a result of, they could become free from accusation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tale of Obsession</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James Cain's tale of lust, murder, and retribution has attracted the filmmakers in different countries in different times. It's been adapted in France in 1939 by Pierre Chenal as "Le Dernier tournant" aka "The Last Turn" with great Michel Simon as a husband who was an obstacle for his young wife's and her lover's happiness. Luchino Visconti told the story in his "Ossessione" (1943) aka Obsession (how appropriate). The novel was also adapted in 1998 by the Hungarian director György Fehér in the movie Szenvedély (1998)aka "Passion". Hollywood has made two films based on Cain's novel of passionate obsession; both are titled "The Postman Always Rings Twice" - in 1946 by Tay Garnett with Lana Turner in her star making role as Cora Smith and John Garfield as Frank Chambers, a drifter who looked for a job but found something completely different and in 1981 by Bob Rafelson with Jack Nicholson and Jessica Lange. I've seen later movie many years ago and all I remember well is the very hot scene between Nicholson and Lange. The earlier film that I saw few weeks ago for the first tine is different. Turner and Garfield are sizzling and although there is no single sex scene between them, the movie is genuinely sexy and perfect in creating the atmosphere of obsession and desperate desire to change the lives no matter what the price would be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great film noir with the sexy Ms. Turner</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cheating spouses were always good film fodder, but once the '40s hit, wives cheated with a twist - their husbands had to be knocked off. "Both Double Indemnity" and "The Postman Always Rings Twice" explore this last option. Was it the war, the live for today attitude that brought on this lack of morality? Postman stars Lana Turner, John Garfield, Cecil Kellaway, Leon Ames, and Hume Cronyn. A drifter, Frank (Garfield) takes a job at a coffee shop and meets the owner's much younger wife, Cora (Turner). They fall for one another and plot to kill her husband. They succeed, but the DA is wise to them and works to divide and conquer. With the help of smart attorneys, Cora pleads guilty to manslaughter and gets probation; Frank gets off scott-free. But the DA isn't through with Frank yet, since he can still arrest and convict him. So not only does the couple have to live with what they did - but do it under the watchful eye of the district attorney.This is an excellent atmospheric film noir that captures the dustiness, heat, and isolation of the coffee shop and the cramped, sterile life that Cora and her husband live. What could it have been like for young Cora to be stuck there. The film also captures very well the pressure the two killers are under during the murder trial. As far as sex, it's left to the imagination and is much hotter than any graphic love scene you'd see today. When you can't show something, you have to be more creative and suggestive.Cora is possibly Lana Turner's best role. Like Hayworth in "Gilda," Turner notches the sexual heat way up, always in white and showing her gorgeous figure to advantage, her face framed either with a turban or overly blond hair. Her first scene, as she stands in the doorway in shorts, is a knockout as she just lets Garfield take her in. She's breathtaking. Turner, Hayworth and Gardner were total, ultimate movie stars/goddesses - beautiful, glamorous, sexy, each with an exciting presence. Of the three, Turner had the most interesting career, starting as a teenager and going from a pouty sweater girl to an ingénue to hot number to mother as she acted in a variety of films over 50+ years. She is at her peak here and really sells this movie. Garfield is very good as an attractive drifter who falls hard for Cora and finds he can't think straight. Garfield brings out the character's vulnerability, making him somewhat sympathetic. Cecil Kellaway is an appropriately odd choice for Cora's older, cheap husband and does a fine job as a the victim who never sees his demise coming, though why he couldn't figure it out with such a young and beautiful wife is beyond me.One of the bright spots in this film is Hume Cronyn as a sharp attorney. He gives a bright, brittle performance, making something out of a small role.This is an excellent film in the genre and should be seen, especially for Turner's performance.</fullReview>

The story however is very much informed by Therese Raquin by Emile Zola even to the extent of having a cat that is killed and the mention of a paralysed woman needing constant attention. The main story is virtually identical to Therese Raquin and I wonder whether James Cain who wrote the novel was aware of this. In any case the idea of a dissatisfied wife and her lover killing the husband is as old as time with resonances of Macbeth and even OEdipus</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had heard of the Jack Nicholson film, but I didn't know it was a remake of this original, I only found out after spotting it in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, and naturally I had to see if I agree with this recommendation. Basically Frank Chambers (John Garfield) is a drifter who stops off at a diner, and soon ends up working there, and he starts an affair with the young beautiful diner operator Cora Smith (Lana Turner) who no longer loves her husband Nick (Cecil Kellaway). Wanting to start a new life together they plot to kill the husband so he is out of the way, and to collect his life insurance and own the roadside diner, their first murder attempt fails. Their second attempt however succeeds when they are in a car, but when they try to make it look like an accident Frank is in the car with Nick's body when the car tumbles down the hill, so they both end up in court for murder. Kyle Sackett (Leon Ames) is the local prosecutor who is sure he knows what happened, but he doesn't have the proof to help them plead their case, he is however able to make Cora and Frank turn on each other for the crime. She decides however to have a full confession written on paper, and she pleads guilt to manslaughter only receiving probation, and after court the couple do patch things up to plan their future together. But then tragedy strikes when Frank is driving and gets distracted, and Cora dies when the car crashes, and even though it was an accident he is accused of manslaughter once again, having been involved in a purpose made car crash. Frank is sentenced to death for the wrong crime of murder on Cora, and his chance for reprieve has been denied, so he is sure he is going to be punished for a crime he truly did not commit. In the end however the authorities tell him that he is being sentenced to death in fact for the murder of Nick, so it is not for killing Cora his love, and he contemplates about the postman will always ring twice with something you expect, and this happened for him. Also starring Hume Cronyn as Arthur Keats, Audrey Totter as Madge Gorland, Alan Reed as Ezra Liam Kennedy and Jeff York as Blair. As the Femme Fetale of the film Turner is indeed a great looking but equally dark and mysterious creature that will suck the man into doing her will, and Garfield does pretty well as the man in the plot with her, the scenes between them are cracking, and the film is full of good sexual chemistry, tense thrill moments and witty dialogue, it is a very entertaining classic film noir. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Postman Always Rings Twice (1946) is a film noir classic that is often overlooked. The soundtrack is superb and it compliments the feel and vibe of the film very well. The story line is fairly straightforward with the occasional twist and turn, but there is no denying the romance that lies beneath the plot. Like with many film noirs the lighting in this movie is great, its dark, yet at the same time one can feel a sense of light perpetuating throughout. One scene in particular that stood out was the scene when Frank, played by John Garfield, and Cora, played by Lana Turner, share their first dance. In a swift one shot scene Frank and Cora dance eloquently to a upbeat song, the lighting changes constantly and the viewer can feel the loving tension between the two. The editing, directions, writing and casting were done very well throughout this movie. To create a quality film every piece of the puzzle must be perfect and fit well, this is the case with The Postman Always Rings Twice, a dazzling film noir classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Postman Always Rings Twice" always had had the reputation of a classic and I think it's fair to say that's one of the best movies within its genre. For a film-noir it shows some serious guts but not without featuring all of the ingredients to make a great film-noir with as well in it.You can say that the story and the way it's being constructed and build-up really makes this movie. It's a movie that jumps from the one thing to the other, with still managing to make it all feel coherent and connected to each other. There is quite a lot happening in this movie story-wise and the movie throws a couple of unexpected twists in it, that makes the story go into many different directions throughout. Whatever direction the movie goes into though, it's always good enough to provide the movie with something fresh and intriguing, which always keeps you hooked on what's going to happen next within the movie.But it's also really quite a daring story for its time, since it very prominently features the theme of infidelity. Marriage was still very much a sacred thing at the time and this movie its plot that features the idea of killing a wives husband so the two young lovers can be with each other much had been quite controversial at its time. It's the reason why the book didn't got turned into a movie any earlier.It's a movie with a story that brings out the best of the genre. It has a great femme fatale in the form of Lana Turner, an original murder plot and lots of backstabbing characters, as well as a rough, scrubby main character, played by John Garfield, who died way too early in 1952, not too long after this movie.An unique movie for its time and still a great as well as original movie to watch now days!9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greek tragedy meets film noir - I mean how many films, even thrillers, do you get the three lead characters all dead by the end of the film... This rightly famous film stands as one of the best of the whole noir genre, perhaps jostling with that other great James M Cain adaptation, Billy Wilder's "Double Indemnity" for the crown itself.Yes, the story and situations are unbelievable but placed in believable settings and peopled by believable characters, the film roars to life from the second Lana Turner's lip-stick rolls John Garfield's way in one of the best character introduction scenes ever.The first half of the film explores the explosive and obviously intensely physical relationship between Turner's downtrodden trophy wife Cora Smith, and Garfield's streetwise can't believe-his-luck drifter, who quickly go on to cuckold her older, simple but still domineering souse of a husband Nick, played beautifully by Cecil Kelloway. Once Nick's murder is achieved, the film paradoxically opens up with an extended courtroom scene, in which more major characters are introduced, which only slightly lessens the heat (it could hardly maintain it!) until the closing denouement where Garfield finally accepts his fate as he heads for the chair.The acting is just great, particularly Garfield (when was he ever bad?), brilliantly conveying his suppressed lust and complete enslavement to the ravishing Turner. She, for her part, just occasionally overdoes the melodrama, but otherwise looks sensational throughout, clad in all-white figure hugging costumes (not forgetting her platinum blonde hair-do) - it's as if her inner thwarted passion has burned away her exterior to leave only a colour-free exterior. She's like a white-hot super-nova with Garfield trapped in orbit around her. It also makes all the more effective the two brief scenes where she contrastingly wears black. The support acting by the likes of Hume Cronyn and Leon Ames as the self-serving defence and prosecution counsels is sharply played and further shores up the film's quality.So many memorable scenes too - I've already mentioned Turner's leggy introduction scene but its counterpart, when her lipstick rolls from her lifeless body after the fatal car crash adds a clever symmetrical touch. You want more...? - how about Nick's murder, which with his echoing voice on his soon-to-be-dead lips is also brilliantly imaginative or the ultra-realistic scene where Garfield beats up a potential blackmailer, blood pouring everywhere out of the poor guy's smashed-up face.All this and a suitably enigmatic title too, thankfully explained by Garfield right at the death. Pulsating and engrossing, this has to be one of the best Hollywood films of the 40's, bar none.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film has its moments, indeed it was certainly easier to watch than the re-make with Jessica Lange and Jack Nicholson.While it could be considered noir, light (similar to "Moontide", a decent film wit Ida Lupino) the film does veer off on tangents. In the middle where there is yet another twist, a blackmail and the signed confession, it becomes unnecessarily convoluted.Lana Turner is lovely, and certainly makes the film, along with Garfield. Underlying rage and dissatisfaction in her marriage (to old and drunken Cecil Kellaway, as Nick) she is scheming to escape. Nick owns a seaside lunchroom, the shots of the ocean add intrigue to the film.At first they try electrocution, there is a protracted scene with a cat, climbing a stepladder, and a motorcycle policeman who checks the scene, saying to Garfield ..."poor cat, dead as a doornail"... . Garfield repeats this, dead-pan. Whether ironic or unintentionally amusing there are little scenes like this which add to the mood.After much ado, Kellaway is finally murdered, the echo scene at Malibu Lake is memorable. Turner inherits an extra insurance policy of $10,000.00, a princely sum at that time. Hume Cronyn enters the film, is very good as a smarmy criminal attorney. Some of the latter half of the film seems a quick add-on, and I had trouble keeping interest.Overall an interesting film, worth seeing for Lana Turner. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a beautiful movie. It is a classic movie. It is a masterpiece par excellence. You could almost smell the sexual tension between the two ill-starred lovers in the stove burner or in the sink or in any place they care to occupy.The acting of both John Garfield and Lana Turner is so natural.I would not say that the movie is a concert. The whole movie is actually an orchestra. What a pity that Garfield and Turner or the director or the movie itself did not win the Academy Awards. One very important thing I notice is the very beautiful, I'd say ethereal, face of Lana Turner. John Garfield's is perfect for a drifter's. Now I understand why Elia Kazan doesn't hold the esteem of Hollywood. Had he not collaborated with the witch-hunters, Garfield and the rest of our blacklisted geniuses could have reached their fullest potentials. This movie has a soul. It will never fail to haunt us forever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bring on the Postman ***1/2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite lapses in the legalities of our judicial system, we have a pretty good 1946 film here.Lana Turner goes from a churlish young lady to a nasty woman plotting the murder of her simple alcoholic hash slinging husband, played nicely by Cecil Kellaway. John Garfield is the drifter who drifts into their lives with mayhem resulting. Unable to kill the dimwitted Kellaway, the two finally succeed the second time around and get off with it from legal maneuvering which could have ruined the film.However, a miserable defense attorney played by Hume Cronyn,in a very good sinister performance, helps salvage the part. We have legal maneuvering, crooked attorney and detective, and Garfield and Turner eventually at each other's throat. Audrey Totter is convincing in a one scene performance as a new flame in Garfield's life.The ending is a corker but nicely done. This was real film noir at its best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Smouldering noir is slightly glossed-over, but very worthwhile</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Postman' is an entertaining film noir that features smoldering performances from it's two central stars, John Garfield and Lana Turner.They play the lovers, Frank and Cora, who conspire to kill Cora's blustering, older husband Nick in order to gain financially. It's a fairly straightforward plot typical of the noir genre, but it's doubly surprising and sizzling all the same. This has been given the glossy studio treatment by MGM, with the characterization of both Cora and Ncik vastly different from Cain's novel. Nick is a Greek and younger in the written work, and Cora is less beautiful and more of a tramp in Cain's work. Still, Cecil Kellaway's old but good-natured innocent buffoon Nick is effective, and Turner's femme fatale still reeks of sex, although she has been glossed-over considerably. Garfield's drifter remains much the same, providing the voice-over to the events in the film.'Postman' has an exciting, live wire script that is just as crisp as any film in the noir genre. The use of shadowy photography is excellent, and the performances of it's two stars are magnificent in their contrast. Garfield, the earthy actor way beyond his time and pre-dating Brando and Clift for bring naturalness to the screen, is the complete opposite of Turner in terms of acting style, and it's a good set-up. Turner was never a great actress, but she had a few good performances in roles that suited her limited capabilities. Here she does well as the ambiguous femme fatale who deceptively wears white and is kitten-like one minute and cat-like the next.Bearing more than a passing resemblance to 'Double Indemnity', 'Postman' is good in it's own right and has some nice cinematic touches. The symbolism of the 'Man Wanted' sign outside Frank's roadside café that draws Frank Chambers to the place, finding it means more than just an employee wanted when he meets the sensual Cora (in THAT entrance, with Turner's lipstick rolling at Garfield's feet), is provocative and intelligent. Every steamy encounter between the illicit lovers is filmed superbly and handled terrificly by director Garnett.The suspense flows nicely in this one, although it tends to drag horribly during the courtroom scenes where Frank and Cora are cross-examined by wily prosecutor Keats (Hume Cronyn) for their crimes. It also has a lot of problems with pacing towards the ending, and is perhaps 5-10 minutes too long.Still, a worthy product of the 'noir cycle', and a very nicely presented film.9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An early film noir, often regarded as a minor classic of the genre. Starts with a near identical premise to another James M. Cain adaptation, Billy Wilder's superior "Double Indemnity" before taking a more convoluted, courtroom based ending.Lana Turner and John Garfield have heaps of chemistry together, and the first two thirds of the film are highly entertaining, regardless of how many times the plot has been recycled since. The courtroom ending is a little less entertaining as the characters and contrivances accumulate, but still enjoyable as a whole. Some amusing negotiating around the limitations of the production code, but the dialogue hasn't the sparkle of Wilder's film, or the directorial style.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Film Noir at its absolute best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is flatout one of the best film noir ever made, and in fact, one of the best movies of the thirties and forties. Whenever I want to see a really good thinking mans movie, I always go for the film noir, which to me, is an early version of giallo to a certain degree. Although I think American film noir is much more sophisticated than giallo could ever think of being. Case in point, "The Postman Always Rings Twice" with absolute knockout performances by John Garfield and Lana Turner. Lana Turner is without a doubt, one of the most beautiful actresses to ever appear in a Hollywood movie, and seeing this movie is a good showcase for her. She absolutely sizzles..... And John Garfield proves he's one of the best actors from that period bar none. Don't get this mixed up with the terrible 1981 remake with Jack Nicholson, the 1946 version is the classic. A drifter, Frank (John Garfield) stops at a remote restaurant/gas station owned by Nick and his beautiful younger wife Cora (Lana Turner). He sees a help wanted sign, and the owner Nick quickly puts him to work in the kitchen. Lana Turner's entrance in this film, is one of the best in movie history, with a stick of lipstick rolling on the floor towards Frank, and the camera focusing on her amazing legs, and then Franks face as he is almost hypnotized by her beauty.Soon they start an affair, and the movie soon turns to "what to do with Nick?". They try to kill him once, and that goes totally wrong, but with some luck, they get out of it with Nick not knowing what happened. So the problem still remains, but now Frank and Cora don't exactly trust each other, and things get more and more complicated. Right up until the climax of this absolute treasure of a film, things keep twisting and turning at every corner, and it's not until the very end that some sort of resolution finally happens for everybody concerned. This is a masterpiece of film-making, and is considered so by a wealth of film critics throughout the years. After 50 years, this movie still stands up because of the fascinating story and the incredible performances by the whole cast. This movie deserves a place in everybody's library for the true film buff. A work of art, indeed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cain his worst enemy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the one Cain novel for which he did the screenplay, and so we have to suffer through the Production Code ending. Even at my age I can't remember when the postman rang twice, except maybe at Christmas time when we had two deliveries. Did we really need that scene in the jail cell?The story is told that when Cain watched Chandler adapt Double Indemnity, he remarked that the great Raymond came up with ideas that Cain never had an inkling of, changing not just the ending of that story, but the voice which told it. Chandler had a low opinion of Cain, but that does not concern this board.That first appearance of Lana should have been the Great Movie poster of the 40's; the white on her forms a triangle that lures the eye. Not for nothing that this siren was the lover of mobster Johnny Stompanato.The story goes through jarring shifts of gear, some smoothly and others not so; Chambers sees Cora off at the station, where fate provides him Audrey Totter sitting in a hot convertible. It is hard to believe there was no light in the bathroom when Cora attempted to bump off hubby the first time; the cat-caused short may have frightened her, but hubby saw nothing. And then there is our Scottish DA, Leon Ames, calling everyone 'laddy' and just happening to be on the same mountain road when Nick and Frank fall go over the edge. What we take from the film are images: Turner, of course; Garfield the guy who thinks he knows everything; Hume Cronyn with that cigar as big as he is; the usual gang of 40's muscle men, always washed up boxers and always 25-50 pounds overweight, and the wonderful Kellaway, strumming his guitar and singing "She's funny that way." It's not perfect, but it's fun to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You can't escape punishment twice</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Basically, Frank is saying that you always worry that you will miss the postman's ring; but you shouldn't worry b/c he always rings again, and you always hear him a second time. This is analogous to the situation in the movie, but from a slightly different angle. The "postman" in this situation would be Fate, God, or some kind of justice, and the "letter" is the punishment or atonement for the crime. Frank and Cora succeeded in killing Nick, and both were able to escape punishment for their crime at first. However, they eventually did face punishment - death, although indirectly. Cora was killed in the accident and Frank was to be executed for his role in Cora's death. The eventual deaths of Frank and Cora can be viewed as punishment for killing Nick. They took a life, and justice eventually found them, just as the postman always finds you.I love this movie. I think it is classic film noir, completely suspenseful and absorbing. Lana Turner in a great performance - definitely recommended for anyone, especially old movie lovers!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tay Garnett's noir thriller "The Postman Always Rings Twice" features a drifter, a dame and a dud. The drifter, Frank Chambers (Garfield) shows up in a sleepy ocean side town in California, looking for work, and in true noir fashion, finding a lot more. He finds the dame, Cora Smith (Turner), who is the young wife of the dud, Nick (Kallaway), the owner and operator of a little restaurant and gas station. From the first moment Frank lays eyes on Cora, he is in love with her, and fairly soon after, she returns his feelings. The problem lies in the little fact that she's married, and though she could simply walk away from the marriage (a marriage of convenience, really, as she is at least thirty years younger than her husband and nothing more than a companion), she has high aspirations for the restaurant and doesn't want to walk away scot-free. So in true noir fashion, she and Frank plot to murder Nick, a plan that alternately works and blows up in their faces. Kyle Sackett (Ames) is the local D.A. who know that they are up to no good, but is content to give them enough rope to hang themselves, and eventually need the help of a smarmy (but effective) attorney named Arthur Keats (Cronyn)."The Postman Always Rings Twice" is just one of many films in the film noir genre that was released in the 1940's, but there are several distinct differences that separate it from the pack. Stylistically, there are great features; just one of many is that while plotting and executing their plans, Cora dresses in nothing but white, yet when things turn sour, her wardrobe changes. Also, the story is terrific; the plot is a simple and almost passé one, until the plans are set in motion, and the two begin to realize that what they think was going to be bliss is really worse than what each had before they had met each other. It is also extremely sultry (for the time), and while I have never been a fan of John Garfield, he and Lana Turner definitely have serious chemistry in this film.One thing about the film that I really didn't like is less a criticism of the film and more an issue with the ridiculous Hays Production Code of the time. Under the tutelage of a former Postmaster, David Hays, films generally could not have an ending in which the "bad guys" didn't get their "due". So in the final moments of the film, inevitability steps in and Cora and Frank get theirs, but not before the film tries to put a positive spin on it, having Frank admit that this was his punishment, etc. Obviously, I'm from the jaded Gen X where a happy ending isn't necessary, and I actually prefer the bad guys to get away with it most of the time, but considering myself to be fairly well-schooled in the ways of classic film, even by "classics standards" this ending is just a big cheese-fest. A kind of counter-balance to this (though perhaps it is one reason why the ending occurred how it did) criticism, however, is the fact that I was pleasantly surprised that the film was as dark in tone as it was. In most films of this genre in which spouse and lover conspire to murder the spouse that is in the way, the doomed spouse is usually someone who is completely despicable; almost deserving of their fate. In Nick Smith's case, he likes to drink, but he's pretty much a happy drunk, and he is basically a kindly older man who likes to sing, take care of Cora, and run his little business, living the simple life. He even takes Frank in and treats him like a pseudo-son, so the decision to do away with him make Frank and Cora all the more evil, and the crime more senseless than those in most films of that era."The Postman Always Rings Twice" is definitely a must-see for anyone who appreciates the art of film noir, and remains a classic, spawning a 1981 remake starring Jessica Lange and Jack Nicholson. In the case of most films, however, the original is still the superior film, and though it is a product of the chaste Hays era, it is far sexier than its remake as well. 7/10 --Shelly</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The unknown Postman of the universe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This has to be one of the most streamlined and accessible of film noir, a beautiful introduction if you're new. It captures the incidental world of sexual whims and violent urges, while constantly propping this with hidden mechanisms that give rise to and control it.The basis as usual is a shady plot where unhappy wife and new lover conspire to bump off the husband for money. This is where a narrative is decided by the conspirators, something that covers up mischief and is clean and in perfect order. By itself, this is no different to a regular crime or caper film and only the apparent layer of reality.Ontop of that, we have what is commonly identified in film noir as fate calling the shots. This is usually rendered as sinister coincidence, something goes wrong and the plot backfires. The detail that floods the perfect story with chaos can be as trivial as an alley cat straying on a bare wire at just the wrong moment, it has to be that trivial for reasons I won't go into. The visual cue is great; lights are suddenly snuffed out, as though the entire world has been short-circuited.At any rate, the point is one; authority of the universe is not fooled as anticipated.So we have all of that here, the Double Indemnity-type plot and gone awry, mistrust, paranoia as the noose begins to tighten. We have a seldom more iconic setting, a diner by a nameless stretch of sweltering Californian road and fiery winds blowing through it every night. A glamorous Lana Turner personifying desire.But it's not until detectives roll into the case that it gets really interesting. This is the finishing touch in a good film noir, inherited by its progenitor of detective fiction. Someone has to be 'looking' for the author of the complex narrative that is life, looking for authority in the universe.So was it fate? Or all of it random and merely governed by which way the cat stepped? Make no mistake, film noir at the heart of it is all about analysis of how reality comes into being, the tawdry plot is merely the microscope that blows-up certain aspects of the picture.So look what happens. The detectives - lawyer and DA - both pretend to be in control. They bluff and all the other court-room tricks, but they don't really know, until of course the two lovers give away the game. Even so, both of them get away with it and are back to a booming business and more money, an insurance claim no one knew about. It would seem that everything worked out well in the end and crime does pay.But things have soured between them, there is blackmail, secrecy, more mistrust, eventually a second fateful accident seals doom for both of them. We come across thinking, as does the man in a prison cell awaiting execution, that there is an unknown Postman pulling the strings after all, a higher order of things.Here's the catch that is pure noir genius and really what is special about the genre.Two accidents. Two deaths, but only one of them murder according to plan. Two narratives brought to light, but only one of them real (the detectives get it wrong again).Why didn't fates, if so benevolent, take care of loose ends the first time? Why isn't the miraculous $10k of the insurance claim seen as fateful accident? Look a bit closer. The second narrative - Frank murdered Cora - that seems like divine payback for the first and is false, is re-arranged by the DA from elements of the first. Frank accepts what he sees as right and fateful punishment because he accepts he was in the wrong the first time. The DA is bluffing once more. Who crashes a speeding car hoping to kill the passenger? No, he doesn't stand much chance in court, yet a guilt-wracked Frank signs away confession papers anyway.In light of that, what is Frank's admission of guilt but proof deep down of authorship of his reality? He was the Postman all along, it was the soul that rung twice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Murder They Wrote</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The background for the film noir thriller "The Postman Always Rings Twice" reveals more about the Production Code Administration's censorship code than anything in director Tay Garnett's sordid tale of murder with Lana Turner and John Garfield as the doomed, adulterous couple. Initially, the novel sat on the shelf for eleven years. Moreover, Will Hays and Joseph I. Breen sought to keep any Hollywood studio from buying Cain's novel seduction, betrayal, and cold-blooded murder. Ultimately, the PCA convinced three studios to abandon this controversial melodrama, but they could not stop the fourth studio that finally produced it. Film historians agree that the studio that made Postman qualified as the least appropriate to handle it. In Cain's novel, the proprietor of a roadside diner outside Los Angeles, Nick Smith (Cecil Kellaway) hires a drifter, Frank Chambers (John Garfield), to work for him as a handyman. Chambers falls in love with Nick's bored, young wife, Cora (Lana Turner), and they plot to kill Nick. They stage an accident to cover up Nick's murder, but they are punished eventually when things beyond their control go awry.Originally, when RKO executive Merian C. Cooper submitted a synopsis of Cain's novel in February 1934, chief censor Joseph Breen advised, "It is our considered judgment that this story . . . is definitely unsuited to motion picture production, and we strongly recommend that you pass it up . . ." Although Breen's warning prompted Cooper prompted to discard the novel, the censor learned three weeks afterward that Columbia Pictures studio boss Harry Cohn wanted to adapt the steamy saga. Breen managed to dissuade Cohn, warning him "the story is a very dangerous one." Later, Breen persuaded Warner Brothers to reject the novel because "any attempts to get a screen story out of it would end in disaster." Breen's admonitions frightened these three studios sufficiently so they wanted nothing further to do with Cain's novel. However, Breen discovered to his chagrin that Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer had bought the rights before he could discourage them. Breen filed a memo, "This information was a shock to us." Added Breen, ". . . Mr. Mannix of MGM did not consult this office in any way previous to buying the story." PCA Chief Will Hays wrote to MGM President Nicholas Schenck and desperately urged him to reconsider. Hays explained, ". . . the story is such, both by reason of the details presented and the general atmosphere, that its picturization would be fraught with the gravest dangers to the company and to the industry as a whole . . ." Hays' letter worked, and MGM withdrew from the project. In 1943, Paramount Pictures approached the PCA about "Postman" and Breen warned them, "The Story seems to be a thoroughly unwholesome and objectionable . . ." Paramount passed up the project, too.In 1945, over a decade later after RKO, Columbia, and Warner Brothers had forsaken the novel, MGM performed an about-face, bought Cain's novel and submitted a script. Predictably, the PCA reported, "In its present form this picture appears not to be acceptable . . ." Breen continued, "The unacceptability of the script in its present form is suggested by the overall flavor of lust, which in our reading, is inescapable. . . This flavor could be substantially reduced if we could cut out . . . all scenes of physical contact?hugging and kissing?between Cora (Lana Turner) and Frank (John Garfield). Furthermore, wrote Been, "We also feel that the scene indicating the illicit sexual relations between this pair should be merely suggested an not emphasized in any way." Eventually, MGM toned down the sexual intrigue enough to placate the PCA. Nevertheless, studio boss Louis B. Mayer liked neither the movie nor film noir as a genre. Mayer hated anything that tarnished the natural glamor of his stars and starlets. While most dyed-in-the-wool film noir thrillers were dark, gritty, urbane, psychologically-driven exposes about flawed human nature, "The Postman Always Rings Twice" emerged as clean-scrubbed as a newborn. Platinum blonde Lana Turner, who played luscious femme fatale Cora Smith, dressed in virginal white. Only twice did she appear in black.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw this film in its initial theatrical release, and recall that I, a younger, relatively innocent teenager, became very absorbed and, in those years of more conservative social norms, rather shocked by the grittiness of the plot and the eroticism. Lana Turner, up to that point in her career as a budding MGM star, here had a chance to move out of her glamorous starlet image the studio had nurtured. This seems to have been her opportunity to develop as an actress. Within the plot she was given the difficult task of making the transition from sultry seducer, to murderess, to vixen; and at the same time to maintain a level of erotic tension with John Garfield, not ideally cast as a ladies' man. She did not manage to maneuver these changes of character with complete success; especially when it came to the point of conveying the vixen quality; she comes across more as bitchy. In the early scenes,however, she takes the next step from girl-next-door ingénue with assurance. The film as a whole suffers from the fact that it is inevitably compared with the later Double Indemnity, and the performances of Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray; especially her embodiment of the archetypal cold, manipulative and unloving female. For me, the difference between the two similar narratives is that between a rating of eight and a rating of ten.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just watched The Postman Always Rings Twice for the first time and found it rather gripping.A drifter stops off at a roadside café and gets a job there. As soon as he see his boss's wife, who is much younger than her husband, it's love at first site. It's not long before they start kissing and then plot to murder her husband. When the lights fuse, they think he is dead at first but it turns out he's OK, but a cat is killed. He is eventually killed when they roll the car down into a lake from a ledge. They are both cleared of murder afterwards but he gets the death penalty when she is killed in a car crash and gets he gets the blame for murder.The only bad thing in the movie was the cat being electrocuted and killed. This scene is totally unnecessary and has nothing to do with the main story. Animal lovers beware of this.Now to the excellent cast: Lana Turner, John Garfield, Cecil Kellaway, Audrey Totter and Hume Cronyn. An uncredited Morris Ankrum (Invaders From Mars) turns up as a judge. Excellent performances from all.The Postman Always Rings Twice is a must see. Excellent.Rating: 4 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Would someone please explain the title to me?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>`It's like when you're waiting for a really important letter,' says John Garfield at the end. No doubt I'm paraphrasing him a little. `The letter's so important you're afraid you won't hear the postman ring, but - don't you see? - he always rings twice.'No, I don't see. HOW is it - how is ANYTHING in the film - like waiting for an important letter? Who is the `postman'? How does this analogy map onto the snaky story? What, for instance, does the `ringing twice' part mean? Is it that one is always given a second chance to hear the postman's ring if one misses it the first time; or is it that the postman has a particularly distinctive double ring that distinguishes him from, say, the landlord? Probably the former, but who knows. You'll notice I'm not at all worried that my speculation might give something away. I've seen the film again just recently, and the plot is perfectly clear in my mind. If I can't work out what Garfield's character is talking about, what hope does anyone else have?Maybe it's explained in the book. Anyone who has a copy of the book, please write to me and clue me in. -Also: I'm compiling a list of mystifying movie titles. If anyone has any suggestions apart from this one (and see also my comments on `It Happened One Night'), please send them to me. I expect I'll get around to putting the list on the web one of these days.I expect those people (intuitive geniuses, I call them) who get whatever point there is to the title, will still be less than satisfied with the ending: it feels less like a conclusion than an afterword by a different author. Basically it's a sound story - I admit a lot happens, and that events succeed earlier events without shedding light on them, but that's perfectly legitimate in this kind of story. It's not a thriller. It's a love story, where the obstacles to love arise out of the character of the lovers. They're a great pair: not at all stupid, but not quite smart enough for their own good. Most of the films that nowadays get called `noir' were second-string, low budget affairs. This one (unlike some of the others) looks it. But what of that?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Postman Always Rings Twice is an excellent movie which is very well acted, I first saw it when I was a child, it was one of my dad's favourite films and I have always loved it. Lana Turner is absolutely beautiful and wonderful as Cora, what I love the best is how back in the 1940's there was no sex involved yet through the superb acting you could see just how much Frank loves Cora and vice versa, it wasn't so good as it had a sad ending, but its the perfect example of how planning a murder can go horribly wrong. I have this movie on DVD and it certainly is one of my favourite films all time, no matter how many times I watch it I continue to enjoy every moment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I reviewed the 1981 remake of the movie and found some of the answers to my questions. Some things are still not clear.1) The husband was to be killed somehow in a bathtub. There was a scene with the boyfriend filling a bag with something that looked like ball bearings. I believe the husband was to be hit over the head with them. It doesn't seem to be a very effective weapon, unless they just would knock him out and then drown him.2) The policeman shined his light on the cat. They could have claimed that this scared the cat and made it run up the ladder. 3) The ladder was not to be seen by anyone (but it was). How can you kill someone in a bathtub by messing with the junction box from the power company lines to the house lines?4) Since the cat shorted the lines, it was an accident, with a cop as a witness of sorts. Why would the DA jump to conclusions of foul deeds over a ladder? The people who installed the new sign may have left some wires exposed.5) It seems that the reason for the ladder was that the bathroom door was to be seen as locked from the inside. They could have killed the husband, and then set the ladder, locked the door, and climbed down. Who was around to see what happened? Yes, a cop came by, but no one else was in the house. In any event, why was it important for the door to be locked? Maybe they could hear the man fall, but not reach him in time - as an excuse.6) The really strange thing- once the power cut off, they go nuts and must get help for the husband. Why? They could have just said that he slipped and fell when the lights went out, or something.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I do not understand how this film deserves such high recommendations. Everything about this movie is second rate-- the acting, directing, music, and editing. Lana Turner, who I consider to be the female Farley Granger, is absolutely horrid. She cannot act. Even John Garfield, who is great in Body and Soul, was wooden and terrible. If you want to see good film noir please rent "Out of the Past", "Double Indemnity", "The Third Man" and even "The Lady from Shanghai" but not this movie. 3 out of 10 stars because it is not Glen or Glenda or High School Confidential! bad but I rented this from the library and still felt cheated.</fullReview>
