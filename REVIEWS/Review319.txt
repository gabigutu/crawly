		<shortDescription>I'm 46, a guy, a Beatles' fan, and I liked it!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm 46 and the father of five daughters, the three youngest being in the One-Direction target age: 12th, 8th, and 6th grade. My daughters (including a 22 and 20 year-old) have managed not to go gaga over the Back Street Boys, N-Sync, the Jonas Brothers, Justin Bieber, and the like. 1D has been a little different, in that they caught my girls' interest and have kept it. My youngest three wanted to see this, and I surprised them on Labor Day by taking them. I thought about just dropping them off, but am glad I didn't. I read a critic's review that basically said that these guys are truly nice, decent guys, and that that comes through in the movie. It does. I'm a huge Beatles' fan, so for me, much of the movie was spent not only enjoying the music (really, it's not bad stuff) and their humble and charming personalities, but also evaluating the sociological aspects of their "Beatlemania"-type popularity. Here's what's interesting in the comparison. Unlike the Beatles, these guys are not skilled musicians and phenomenal songwriters. Mainly, they just sing, and they're good at that. What lies under their popularity are two things that also lay under the Beatles': 1) they are very humorous and relaxed (lots of quick, on-the-fly, funny comments); and 2) they're working-class boys (lads) who are really great friends and enjoy each other. With the Beatles, I've always thought that their palpable friendship and fun humor were the factors that made them so magnetic--they enjoyed each other, were great friends, and had fun with each other on stage and off. This is even more true for One Direction, as you don't have the leadership struggle with 1D that was there between John and Paul, nor the building resentment of a George. None of One Direction is trying to become the leader, and all are avoiding being the Justin Timberlake or the Sting. They really care for each other, are great friends, and, most striking to me, are tremendously and truly humble about their success. Along with this, they verbalize many times how each member is necessary, how they'd be less successful (or may not have even made it) had one member been missing, how it was a freak of nature/act of God, so to speak, that they wound up together, and that they'd all be doing menial jobs back home right now (factory worker, fireman, working in a bakery), were it not for their fans making them big (and they're really appreciative of their fans, and treat them well). Last thing on this: there's a segment when they go back home, and we see none of them acting like a big deal with any of the folks in their home towns. That was really refreshing.Certainly these guys aren't the musical giants the Beatles were--not even close. But just as fun, even to adults? Yes, and maybe even a little more so. This movie, the "Hard Day's Night" of One Direction, was a really fun watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Worst Documentary I Have Ever Seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm gonna start off by saying that I know that I am not the target audience for this movie. This is for the prepubescent little girls who like their "music". But, a documentary should entertain someone no matter what the topic. A good documentary would entertain anyone no matter if they like what the documentary is about or not. That being said, this movie does not do that. It is pretty much an hour and a half long commercial for One Direction; not a movie. This movie was like the first 20 minutes of the movie 'Moonwalker' but if it was the whole movie. I can't exaggerate enough on how this is the worst documentary ever. If you wanna sit through a hour and a half long infomercial then be my guest. But, if you have a functioning brain and would rather watch something that resembles a movie then I'd stay away from this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, so I'm a massive directioner, I can understand why people are commenting saying they do not like it because it is about a boy band whose fans in general are teenagers like themselves. I don't understand though why people are commenting saying its sh*t and a waste of time, surely if they think so strongly that way, they would of realised near enough at the start of the film if it was for them or not, and if they decide it wasn't then go and 'make better use of the your time' I think that it is a perfect film for directioners, and the boys should be proud of their achievements and their stories, and making this film is one of them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Movie!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved this movie. I watched this movie for the first time when it came out. I thought it was going to be just another stupid biography but it was amazingly good! It isn't just a bunch of boys screwing around! There is good and happy moments and then there is the sad touchy feely moments! They are hilarious and loving boys who have made it so far in life. They are there for their families, fans, and friends and no matter how much they get caught up in their career they will never forget about the ones they love. Most people hate on them but after they see this movie they will take interest.I can't wait to see them perform live! Directioners... this one is for you!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really quite good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is difficult to understand why anyone would pan this movie.I watched this on an 8 foot high-definition screen. The images are razor sharp, the color is wonderful, the editing is in a modern style but not too jumpy. The story flow should keep your attention. On a decent 5.1 surround system the sound quality is very good. If there were technical flaws I was in a good position to find them. I didn't find any.You get to see the members of the group perform and go about their lives. If you say (like one reviewer) that it was too scripted then you weren't paying attention. The boys revel in being spontaneous and doing what they want to do and wearing what they want to wear, or so it seems. It kept my interest.All in all it was just fun - and I'm not even a fan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie of 1D</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really love the movie because first I am a big fan of this boy band and I really like them, the another reason for I like the movie its because in this movie we can see the life of the boys of the band, for example his houses and his family's, another reason is that in this movie we can see his concerts of his world tour called take my home tour and really I like this because they have never come to Venezuela, because of this I have not had the opportunity to see them in a concert in alive, other thing that we can see in the movie its all that happens in backstage (for example things like them playing and fleeing of the security guards,they practicing for his concerts, they mitting his fans in the meet and greet from his concerts and another things), also it is possible to see many of his interviews,all the country's that they visit around the world like Japan, Spain, Italy, Mexico, etc. For these reasons really I like the movie and I think that Morgan Spurlock (the director) and all his team did a really good work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This wasn't a documentary. This was an hour and a half long infomercial.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I know I'm not in the target demographic for this movie, but I feel like an interesting and informative documentary can be made about something no matter what its subject matter is. And this movie... ugh. I'm not going to go out on a limb and say that One Direction: This Is Us is the worst movie I've ever seen, because then someone could bring a different one to my attention that's even worse, but I will say that it's definitely the worst concert documentary I've ever seen. And even that feels really wrong, because at the end of the day, this was just propaganda. As a movie, nothing happens in it. As a documentary, it relies on the audience already knowing everything about this band. And as something called "This Is Us," I don't even leave it knowing all their names, much less anything else about them. There's no plot that it builds up to, there's no conflict or resolution, and this seems to be a common problem in the era when any schmuck pop star can get a theatrical movie made about them (such as Justin Bieber, Katy Perry, Miley Cyrus, and the Jones Brothers). And for a 3D movie, there isn't even anything interesting to look at apart from the five guys in the band going around and pointing at things. I actually lost a lot of respect for its director Morgan Spurlock when I saw this movie. It felt like he wanted to make a better movie that wasn't just a huge commercial, but was held back by someone--probably the record company--and instead made this. I'm glad to see that even some of the band's own fans are seeing through this quick grab for cash and are leaving negative reviews. Movies like this are created with zero effort and are only made to steal fans' money, because the people who make these movies know that some people will buy anything as long as it has a popular band's name attached.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad editing. Boring.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Throughout the film i thought, that it's a live concert recording. Songs, that they showed were mostly slow, so it was hard to be awake sometimes.Whole movie was like all their bloopers put on in one film. It was without core. One Direction guys are too young, to make a movie about them. It was clearly seen, that they had nothing to show us, apart from their childish jokes on tour.Overall, you can see, that directors of the film knew, that theaters would be full of little One Directioners, so it was easy money to them. But from documentary view, there isn't much bad to say. I mean, you can't actually shoot wrong with documentaries.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice concert film about One Direction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start off by saying im not a crazy fan of 1D,in fact I knew them since X Factor back in 2010 while they were runner ups to Rebecca Ferguson so yesterday I bought the DVD for a bargain at my local supermarket and decided to watch it today. The film chronicles the 5 boys Louis,Zayn,Niall,Harry and Liam who all rose to fame thanks to The X factor as they were all solo artists who got together by Simon Cowell and since then they are the biggest boyband in the world. They have been to London,Berlin,NYC,France,Amsterdam you name it even Japan and Sweden. What interested me was the fact that EVERY girl is stone mad over them and there is hardly any male fans since 1D is aimed at tweens.So in the film it goes into depth with the 5 lads who are all devil may care average teenagers who are enjoying the fame and spotlight. Also the 5 lads parents are also in this film as they talk about what its like for there sons to be in the biggest boyband ever and there is one where Zayn Maylik buys a house for his mother which was nice of him,and another scene was Niall Horan going undercover as a Scottish bodyguard and his saying oh One direction is crap. Overall there isn't much to say about the film as its just an everyday life of what its like being a pop star and the pressure it has on you. If you seen Katy Perry's Part Of Me concert film you will get the jest of it as its basically just a behind the scenes documentary. Their greatest songs are in this film like Live While Were Young,All These Little Things,Best Song Ever,and One Way Or Another to name a few. If you love One Direction than this is for you,if not then skip it.5/10Out of 5 stars: 2.5/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>AWESOME Movie for Directioners!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a must for all directioners out there. Believe me It's awesome!! But I'll advice you to watch it in 3D because this movie becomes an out of the world experience in 3D. I loved the way 1D's life is shown in this movie. And the best part is when all of them change into superheroes for a second or two. Its just amazing how their life has taken a toll. From X factor to this! They just do what the do best and do it with all their heart. They are like brothers and are really funny and that's what is shown in the movie. In my opinion ,Nothing important is kept away from the audience. They are down to Earth guys who made it big just by believing in themselves. They are there for their families, fans, and friends and no matter how much they get caught up in their career they will never forget about the ones they love.I don't understand though why people are commenting saying its sh*t and a waste of time, surely if they think so strongly that way, they would of realized near enough at the start of the film if it was for them or not, and if they decide it wasn't then they should have gone and 'made better use of the their time' though I think that it is a perfect film for directioners.Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but when it is based on what others thinks and isn't logical, it's just pathetic. The boys are amazing lads and anyone with eyes and an open heart would realize that even if they don't understand why dedicated fans like me feel so proud and in love with them. They empower and have saved a lot of our lives, they're an incredible significance to us and will always have a special place in our hearts.I'm a massive directioner so I loved the movie.Thank you Morgan for bringing us such a fantastic movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very HONEST, unbiased review!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From what I see on here, the reviews are either written by hardcore fans who gave the movie glittering reviews or (jealous)people who are determined to hate on the band by trashing it to no end (people who probably didn't even watch the movie). So let me waste a bit of my time to write an honest and unbiased review about this movie.First of all, I'm not a fan of this band, but I'm interested in Simon Cowell, not the man himself, but his business ventures. As someone who is not a fan and who watches the movie with no expectations at all, the first one hour of the movie appeared to me like a very long and dragging commercial advertisement where the "product" here is the BAND itself. The producers and director had nothing else in their minds when they set out to make this movie. They wanted to tell us what we, the mass public, SHOULD think of the band.The whole movie was actually made based off that. Like how you see a McDonald's ad on TV and it wants to tell you how delicious and fresh McDonald's foods are? And how you know what you're seeing on the ad isn't even half true? Yes, this movie is JUST like that.Anything that happens in the first 60 minutes of the movie comes off as dishonest, all the interviews with the band's security, tour manager, the musicians, sound very scripted. Everyone talks the same way of someone or something, there's NO WAY it's not scripted or they weren't being told of what to say.One of the major setbacks of the movie to me is how the boys are forcefully portrayed as very down to earth, fun, stupid, naive, and harmless. It was obviously done to show that they're very safe for their fan base of very young girls. But here's what I didn't like the most: - They made it as if the boys DECIDE for themselves not to be a dancing boyband.- They made it as if the boys DECIDE for themselves how their music sounds like.- They made it as if the boys DECIDE for themselves on what to wear.For a record, we all KNOW, they don't decide on all the things above, so who are they kidding? The last 30 minutes of the movie is pretty close to how the movie should be. To me the good part of the movie is when they went back to their hometown to see their family. Any part that has a family member in it can be considered as a good part. It shows where they came from, the life they had before the band, what changes they made to their family. The very brief interviews with the family members are golden.And there's this part where one of the boys said there was time when he's not enjoying everything and had to take a step back. This part is good because it shows how vulnerable the boys are, being very young and had to adapt to the drastic changes in their lives. But sadly this part only last for a few seconds, and no more exploration of this kind was made again.It's such a shame really, that the people behind this movie decided to be on the safe side and put out something not much of a value rather than going all the way to tell an honest, interesting, and unique story about the band and the band members. But who am I kidding, the movie is obviously a project to make (Simon Cowell)their record label more money, not to create some art.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When i first saw it in the cinemas with one of my school assistants i thought this movie was very interesting and better than the band. But this movie had the best songs like '''Best Song Ever''' and '''Kiss You''' but the only problem is this band but the movie was funny and music entertainmentBut i don't love is Harry Styles but i am a big fan of Liam Payne because he's so sexy when he's shirtless and have been the most memorable guy in the band. This movie really say should have a higher rating. This movie is the best movie from documentary ever. This movie is so funny and most memorable because it also shows scene s from Norway and my assistant has seen that concert</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One direction This is us review This film is about: Niall Horan, Zayn Malik, Liam Payne, Harry Styles, and Louis Tomlinson are the members of One Direction and they have grown into one of the hottest music groups on the Planet. 1D has been a little different. There new album is totally revamped. I loved this movie. I watched this movie for the first time when it came out. I can't wait to see them perform live! Directioners... this one is for you! Okay, so I'm a massive directioner, I asked the guy beside me, he was around 19 years old and he said he is embarrassed to say he really enjoyed it. He said he only came to see the film because of his girlfriend. Before seeing this movie I was on the fence about being a One Direction fan. They were very teen-bopperish and I only liked their mainstream songs that I heard on the radio. But I decided to go see the movie and had to literally almost drag my best friend along with me since I didn't want to go alone. Anyways I saw the movie and came out loving the boys. I still wasn't really into their music after it, though. But what I enjoyed was seeing behind the scenes of what their job really entails and their rise to fame. The parts with their family were cool because as an average Joe you don't usually get a look into musicians lives (unless they have reality television or something like that). I'm fifteen so I was definitely in the target age range but I still feel this movie was way better than the low scores most people on this site have given it. Sure if you are older and like different music this movie probably won't resonate with you like it did me, but I definitely don't think it deserved being called crap" or "not worth the money". I loved it and have talked to several people (adults included who tagged along with their daughters/nieces/cousins/girlfriends) have liked it as well. went in to this movie with uncertainty. I saw it because I wanted to see if it would turn out to be decent. I went in as a semi fan but I drug along my best friend who was only going out of obligation. We became fans. Yes this whole thing was about staying relevant and making money but that's what artist do. But seeing Zayne give his mom a house or Niall be in his brothers wedding those things are what make the boys who they are. No doubt that directioners like me enjoyed the 3D and 2D experience, especially with all of the screaming occurring during both showings I saw. It gave a great general look at the boys' lives and definitely personalities. It shows how well and what they think of each other. What I love the most was that this movie was also mainly for the fans who never have gone to a concert, it was such a fun experience even if they weren't exactly there. It was also a chance for those who think so little of them to see who they truly are and hopefully change their opinion if they're not too guarded by their close-minded opinions(no offense). I've seen a lot of films but this is us is the best so far it will make u laugh and cry its funny and sweet like when Zayn is on the phone with his mum when she's in the house he bought her this is a must see film It even shows them on stage singing teenage dirt bag and turning them into superheroes Even though they have saved more lives then superman and batman put together. They are being them self's there not just five best friends they're five brothers. The film even shows them pranking there fans but that's with the end credits I really enjoyed this film. They showed the concert when Liam pulls down Harry's jeans When Zayn leaves them to go home it even has there family's in it. They're not just one direction they're are Zayn Malik from Bradford Louis Tomlinson from Doncaster Liam Payne from Wolverhampton Harry Styles from Cheshire and Niall Horan from Mullingar These five boys may have lost the X-Factor but they won the World.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An overview of the rise, and current members, of One Direction.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back when I used to watch the original X-Factor these guys were on, but being that boy bands are more miss than hit, at least with my music taste, I would skip their performances. A few years later, after them losing, they are now following in many other musicians' footsteps and releasing a documentary/ concert movie. But, the question is: can this movie convert you into a fan, or is just made for their established audience?Characters &amp; StoryOf the band you can see Harry, Zayn and Niall are the potential breakouts with Liam and Louis having their place, but not being as charismatic or interesting. The reason for this is three (Harry, Zayn and Niall) all have this sort of appeal in which they seem like they could be the leads. For example, Harry comes off as the sort of modern version of Mick Jagger, though with less drugs; Zayn seems a bit more modern in comparison with him seeming like he would work within a modern emo-pop band; and then Niall seems like your general boy next door, which is his appeal. Together, though Harry and Zayn more so, they seem to get the most focus when it comes to interview segments, seeing their families, or life before fame, than the others.As for the film as a whole, between songs from their first two albums and interview segments, as well as us seeing them venture around tour stops, that is what makes up the movie. You learn what they did before X-Factor, slightly, and then what happened in the lead up to their audition; you hear about some of the band drama like Louis and Liam not being fond of one another, during their time on X-Factor; and them once thinking of kicking out Zayn; but for the most part you see a strong brotherhood in which it seems together they are far stronger as a group than they would be as solo artist.PraiseBe it the fact that some members, naturally, have more name recognition than others, it was good, to me, that the people who you'd recognize the most are the ones who got the most screen time. And while I may not be the aimed for demographic, I did like two of the songs within the film. Those two not so great I would want to download them, but I do think when you watch the film, despite how asinine the idea is, you can understand why they are being compared to The Beatles, past them both being British boy bands.I mean, One Direction seems physically/ visually fit for the times. They are a bunch of tattooed model looking boys, but they aren't cookie cutter per se. More so, they are almost like a PG version of the Jackass crew. And, like The Beatles, currently they are in a phase in which their aim, more so, is mainstream music to appeal to a female fan base, no different from when The Beatles were doing "She Loves You," "I Want To Hold Your Hand" and their other classics. But, the question does remain if the boys' music will grow up and become deeper, or if they simply will just look edgy, but continue to sing songs which are as shallow as a kiddy pool.CriticismLet it be known, this film isn't likely to convert you. For one, there isn't really any background into any of the songs to make them seem deeper than they appear, and while you must admire their fans for taking them to where they are, between the songs and who we see of their fandom, you can tell that they aren't trying to appeal to anyone past a female demographic.But perhaps my main issue is that there isn't much of a narrative when it comes to the film. In other concert films there is usually a build toward something, be it like Kevin Hart's Let Me Explain in which we followed him on his way to Madison Square Garden or Michael Jackson's This Is It which chronicled his preparations for his would-be arena stay. However, for This Is Us we are basically just following them around in a style no better than what fellow British Band Little Mix had when their band went to Japan, with the only difference being that One Direction goes to more places and Little Mix posted their videos to YouTube. Thus making the film, outside the concert element, feel like bits which could have been put on YouTube years before the film, but they were saving it for a movie in hopes of making as much money Miley Cyrus or Justin Bieber made with their concert films.Overall: TV ViewingHonestly, I'm not even sure why a fan would buy this unless they are the type of fan which likes to collect everything the band ever put out. I say this because there are likely full, uninterrupted, concerts on YouTube and better interviews also within the same site. So, it makes this film seem like just a ploy for cash, more than something really trying to let you into the boys world and give you the opportunity to get to know them and their music. Because of that, I say this is a TV Viewing type of movie. Something which doesn't need to be bought, or rented, for it doesn't have that type of value where it needs to be seen as soon as it is accessible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you dare venture into a theater for this weak concert film, bring earplugs.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was only a matter of time before someone made a concert film about One Direction, but I never could have guessed it would be Morgan Spurlock, the guy who gave us the Oscar-nominated documentary 'Supersize Me' and the FX cable series '30 Days'. When I asked Spurlock about his career and why, out of all the musicians and performers in the world, he chose to film 'One Direction', he simply explained, "I wanted to tell a story on a band that was nothing a year or two ago, but is now at the top of the charts." I get where Spurlock is coming from, but he must have had studio execs hovering over him at all times, because this feels more like promo spot for the band than a documentary.Unfortunately, I imagine that 'One Direction: This Is Us' will make loads of money, due to the boy band's rabid fan base. I'd never even heard of One Direction before I saw the movie, but come to find out, Simon Cowell is to blame. In his short interview, Cowell takes full credit for the band doing so well.The film takes us on a 100-city worldwide tour. We go backstage with the guys, and even back to their hometowns. Professional concert footage is interspersed throughout. The movie really offers no insight behind the scenes at all. It seems to only consist of the boys clowning around, pulling pranks and talking to the press. Some of the kids' parents are interviewed occasionally to tell us about their humble beginnings, and how they're still down to earth even though they're superstars now. Other segments show the band interacting with fans by standing on their hotel balconies and waving at the gigantic crowds of insane girls below. Somebody thought it would be funny to have some of the band-mates get made up to look like roadies and go out on the concert floor before the show starts, yelling "One Direction sucks!" It feels completely staged, as if everyone is reading from a script.The music couldn't be worse. It's cheesy and sappy, with no real message. Sure, the boys might be able to carry a note from time to time, but none play instruments, with the exception of one who attempts a few guitar chords that my six-year-old cousin could play just as well. Their dance choreography is dull and uninspired, and half the time doesn't sync up with the rest of the show. It might have been nice to see the actual musicians playing their music on-screen, but they're left out here.Spurlock injects some 3D effects into the concert footage that might excite the type of people who will rush out to see this band, but other than that, don't expect spectacular 3D. I can only assume that Spurlock wanted to make a different movie entirely, and was shut down by managers and execs. Hopefully 'One Direction: This is Us' will make enough cash to pave the way for Spurlock to make more meaningful films, as he's done before.If you dare venture into a theater for this weak concert film, bring earplugs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Direction get intimate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, so I watched this movie as part of a thing I do where I watch the US box office number ones from one year prior and now it was time for the 1D flick. Apart from a few guilty pleasure songs, I don't really love this band like a lot of the screaming teenagers that the movie shows. Still whether we like them or not, there's no denying they're huge right now. Now if this success is to continue, that's another discussion. So I sat back and grooved to some songs I like and learned a little more about them. It wasn't something I desperately needed to know, but since I was already watching it, I ended up just finding out about this. Now as far as the boys go, I can see that this can be quite overwhelming for them and that they are just normal young people looking for a good time. One Direction has become a very loved, but also hate band. Personally I always separate the music from the individual and as far as I'm concerned, they seem like nice lads. So my advice is if you're a directioner definitely watch this, and if you're not, well if you don't mind them, see it just for the sake of actually seeing them as they are and not the product they're sellingRating: 4,5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would rate this a 10 if the documentary was actually real. You can tell the whole movie was faked. As if they gave them a script and told them to read off it and rehearse their lines. This movie is more for their kiddy fans, this is coming from one of their older fans. It's a concert in a movie, as if that hasn't been made before (hence the UAN DVD). They had tapped days/weeks for this movie &amp; they choose to put together the least interesting parts. Basically another way their greedy management could squeeze more money out of our pockets. It's not great at all, they only showed us what they want us to see. It's a shame really, I'm only giving it a 7 bc I love these boys &amp; that's only why.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay so I am somewhat of a 1D fan but that doesn't mean I am blind to bad movies. Of course the movie is going to rate low because it is a concert documentary and these types of movies never have any sort of substance. So if you don't even like the artist that this type of movie is about then you are stuck having a miserable time.From a non fan perspective i would give it a 2. All it is is the famous boy-band singing their songs. If you don't know anything about the band it may be informative to you because it teaches you the basic one direction facts like how they got started, where they are from, what their family is like etc.For the same reason as a fan of 1D i would give it a 4. The movie was very repetitive. All of the fans know these basic facts already so you don't really learn anything. Most of the interviews and backstage info they talk about is the same thing like "Oh we're just normal humble people that are amazed at what's happened to us." There was no conflict/dramatic event in the movie so the plot was pretty much boring the whole time.I am someone who enjoys listening to 1D so I thought the music was really good. If you don't like their music you will hate it because the whole movie consists of them singing it. But since I am a fan I did appreciate the music because I haven never gone to a 1D concert. It was cool to see the setup and everything too. Also I liked how you could tell they we're actually singing. (...at least i think)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not a twelve year old girl; I am a 40 year old woman who likes a few One Direction songs. I've heard them at my daughters' ballet class and I like to run to them. I thought I'd watch the movie on a two hour drive. The film was fun to watch and a really interesting story. It is fascinating to hear the story of this band became so successful so quickly. After their formation on the British version of the X-Factor and earlier than expected exit, the fans took over in the forms of promoters on social media. As it turns out, they were more than effective and the result was instant worldwide success for One Direction before an album was even released. Further, they began performing at stadiums the size most bands spend years working their way up to at smaller venues. They were understandably very nervous and it is entertaining to watch this play out. The family suffers and it is compelling viewing. Overall, I really enjoyed this. I did get a little tired of the theme "we're just ordinary boys who love a joke" theme and would have liked to find out a little bit more about who the boys truly are. I think the fans that created them deserve that. However, it is a fun show and the concert performances are great. If you're not ashamed to rent it out, it's definitely one to watch. Tell them you are getting it for your children!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I suppose this is a bias opinion but I didn't go to see this film with anyone that do actually like the band, I saw it with family members and friends that do not like One Direction. The movie wasn't just promoting, it gave a real insight into their lives. None of it was scripted they said quote; "If something cool happened and the camera's missed it they wouldn't ask us to re-act it because that's just stupid" They let the cameras into their lives and it shows what it's like to be at one of their concerts. There are funny parts to the movie and it really shows their personalities behind there newspaper titles.I asked the guy beside me, he was around 19 years old and he said he is embarrassed to say he really enjoyed it. He said he only came to see the film because of his girlfriend.I wouldn't tell you this as a lie, because that is pointless and I wouldn't spend the time to write a lie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went in to this movie with uncertainty. I saw it because I wanted to see if it would turn out to be decent. I went in as a semi fan but I drug along my best friend who was only going out of obligation. We became fans. The way the guys interact with each other and seeing how different they are and how that affects the whole group as a whole was so cool. Sure if you aren't a teenage girl the movie probably won't appeal to you but it doesn't appeal to some in the same way The Hangover had no appeal to me. If you go in there with a semi-open mind you will be able to see that they are genuine about what they do. Yes this whole thing was about staying relevant and making money but that's what artist do. But seeing Zayne give his mom a house or Niall be in his brothers wedding those things are what make the boys who they are. So before you say this movie isn't worth something it means something to the fans who have grown to love the boys from the time they auditioned on X factor to now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>. . . and One Direction's traveling wardrobe is totally "low rent" compared to hers, too. Though these five young guys claim to know that their fame--as a whimsical creation of British media mogul Simon Cowell--will be as fleeting as the earlier thrown-together-for-a-TV-show group The Monkees (from the 1930s?), the boys of One Direction do not seem to really believe their own words. While Shayne's mum and sisters are thrilled getting new digs thanks to his sudden windfall, Liam's dad is woefully sad about what's become of his son, and rightfully so. These youths were on track toward making honest livings as coal "scoopers," hod carriers, and grease monkeys. Now, their families are saddled with the heartbreak of having spawned plastic people action figures. There always will be "boy bands," just as we'll always have serial killers and mass shooters with among us. This movie helps to illustrate why few parents would want their sons to grow up to become either.P.S.--I saw the "Extended Fan Cut" of this flick in 3D. Perhaps if I had seen the ordinary version intended for the general public in just two dimensions, my reaction to this documentary would have been completely different.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Its same as watching 1D's BTS on their youtube vevo channel. I expected videos of their concerts from their tour. But the only concert video was the O2 Arena concert. They did show what celebrity life is, everybody kept saying that the boys are down to earth, but who are we kidding! The other band without a name (Wrong Direction) that went on tour with them is just awesome. Dan Richards (guitarist) is cute as a button. By this movie, I learned that 1D gets credit for a lot more than they really deserve. The movie was more like a music video album. Not good. I tolerated it only because, well, the boys are cute as teddy bears.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was well worth the wait and seeing it twice! No doubt that directioners like me enjoyed the 3D and 2D experience, especially with all of the screaming occurring during both showings I saw. It gave a great general look at the boys' lives and definitely personalities. It shows how well and what they think of each other. What I love the most was that this movie was also mainly for the fans who never have gone to a concert, it was such a fun experience even if they weren't exactly there. It was also a chance for those who think so little of them to see who they truly are and hopefully change their opinion if they're not too guarded by their close-minded opinions(no offense). Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but when it is based off of what others thinks and isn't logical, it's just pathetic. The boys are amazing lads and anyone with eyes and an open heart would realize that even if they don't understand why dedicated fans like me feel so proud and in love with them. They empower and have saved a lot of our lives, they're an incredible significance to us and will always have a special place in our hearts.Thank you Morgan for bringing us such a fantastic movie with our genius and I can't wait to get the DVD and possibly see the sequel(please be a sequel!)</fullReview>

Movies like this make me miss Guns N' Roses,, AC/DC, etc, back when music was decent. This band sounds like they are constantly sucking on Helium.

They are being them self's there not just five best friends they're five brothers. The film even shows them pranking there fans but that's with the end credits I really enjoyed this film. They showed the concert when Liam pulls down Harry's jeans When Zayn leaves them to go home it even has there family's in it. They're not just one direction they're are Zayn Malik from Bradford Louis Tomlinson from Doncaster Liam Payne from Wolverhampton Harry Styles from Cheshire and Niall Horan from Mullingar These five boys may have lost the X-Factor but they won the World.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My girlfriend blasts One Direction loudly through blown out speakers of my roommates car, on our way to see their new concert documentary. My ears are already ringing. But having a natural liking for film and documentaries, and not knowing much about the boy band, I was hoping Morgan Spurlock would provide some insightful details into their lives. But no, it never happens. When the boys are not on stage performing their incredibly, ridiculous, sappy pop songs, we see them fooling around backstage, conversating in hotel rooms, and even returning home when they have a break from the tour, I didn't learn anything of importance, or if I did, I didn't care, because I don't have a "Y" chromosome. Spurlock falls short with this one. But I feel like he only made this one because he saw dollar signs attached to it. There was no real personal investment for him, unlike Super Size Me, and Comic Con Episode Four: A Fan's Hope. Hopefully now that Spurlock has ranked in the big bucks with this one, he will invest his time in something that is truly special too him. I give One Direction: This Is Us a 6 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pleasantly surprised</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off I have to say that I haven't been a One Direction fan for very long. I saw them on the X-Factor and thought they were quite good but they were a little teeny-boppy for me and I promptly forgot about them. In fact a couple of months ago I was 'forced' to buy a 1D t-shirt for my 10 year old stepsister who adores them. And by 'forced' I mean that I felt like hiding my face as I went up to the tills. Then recently, and I'm talking about a couple of weeks ago, I stumbled across their music video for 'Best Song Ever' and gave it a listen, mainly because I was bored and intrigued by the title. I loved it and I haven't looked back.Despite this, I was reluctant to see 'This Is Us' in cinemas. I was worried that it wouldn't be worth the ticket price and also I had literally NOBODY to go with. My best friend isn't a fan and although she put up with my liking for them with good humour I doubted I'd be able to drag her along to the cinema with me.So I decided to drag my husband along instead. He put up a fuss but eventually capitulated although he insisted I pay for everything and even debated bringing a notebook along so that if he got any funny looks he could pretend to be a journalist having to review it. We got in and thank heavens it was virtually empty. Even luckier was the fact that my husband clocked another guy who sat with his wife/girlfriend/sister/friend in the row just in front. Ignoring his incessant whining about how he would walk out at a moment's notice, the film began.As a documentary it's pretty good. As a film about a band, it's brilliant with fantastic coverage of their concerts. More than that it lets you into their lives and affords you a sneak peek of what it's like to be part of one the biggest bands in the world at the moment. The boys all seem very genuine, funny and sweet and there are really touching moments especially when the parents talk about waving their sons off for the X-Factor audition and basically never seeing them again.As musicians, they're not the best. Niall plays guitar and Louis is seen to mess around with the piano but that's about it. As singers however, they're brilliant. Unusually for a band they're all strong singers with none of them taking the lead. This, coupled with their antics onstage, makes for very watchable viewing.At the end my husband announced that he thought it was 'brilliant'. He'd enjoyed himself and even stayed for the credits. He said that the film had changed his perception of One Direction and even though he wouldn't call himself a 'fan' he had a new appreciation for them. I think our reactions to it sum it up in a nutshell. If you're a hardcore Directioner, it's a no-brainer. If you like them but don't go crazy over them (like me) it's incredibly enjoyable. And if you're like my husband you might be pleasantly surprised.Go and see it, it's worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...I think you'll be pleasantly surprised. The movie shows the world a side of One Direction that's much more personal and real than the processed music might have you believe. They really come across as genuine, nice, regular guys...who just happen to be internationally famous. I think even if you come out still not a fan of their music, you'll have a new respect for them. You come out feeling like you know them, which I think means the film will have succeeded. By the way, I'm not saying any of this because I'm a One Direction fan--like, I promise you, go see it, because it's worth it. It's sweet, personal, hilarious, and so genuine.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the worst "documentary" I have ever seen in my life. Not that I am a One Direction fan anyway or anything but still all that means is I went in with zero expectations and still was blown away by how unbelievably awful this is. The only thing worse would be to hand a bunch of kids a video camera and let them tape themselves go to the beach, ride in a bus, do some shows for their friends, because basically that is what this "professional documentary team" has given us here with this band. They're not a terrible band as far as boy bands go, with OK voices and dance moves, but most boy bands stink and this one is no different. Play some instruments well or something! What is the point of these guys? Almost as little point as there is in this movie existing, watching a bunch of guys pretending to be younger than they are and desperate to look "real" and "cool". Skip this movie if you don't want to get the strong urge to stick knives in your eyes and ears.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought it was a great movie, going into the cinema I was thinking that it's going to be boring and footage I've already seen, but 90% of it wasn't. The special effects and the 3-D were AMAZING, the quality of the movie was really really high. It was a really good movie, you get to see behind the scenes into their personal lives and also their thoughts and experiences of travelling the world. Although I am a huge One Direction fan, I recommend everyone to go and watch it, it really does show you the other side of the guys without the media and losers from school influencing you. I don't understand why people dislike the boys so much, it seems that everyone is the same and cannot respect others opinions on them. It shows a lot of concert footage and the boys lives on the road. It made me cry, laugh, smile and i thoroughly enjoyed the whole lot of it, and I wished it never ended! 10/10 FOR SURE! :~)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is crap. Im just going to get that out there. We all knew i was going to be this way, but for some reason people felt obligated to see it. ALright let's get started. 1. Everything. This movie is like a commercial, there is no appeal to anyone other than those who are fans of the music, you know, like less than 10 percent of the people at taco bell, but seriously i wasn't interested, and im not sure why you would be. It's a cornball fest of cheesy almost obviously scripted dialogue and clichs that even dear old grandmother could see. 2. Now I'd like to debunk a few things before i continue, 1 direction is better than the beatles, no. ! direction will always be popular no. This band is not timeless. 3 . Jesus why am i still talking about this. The movie sucks, it was awful your not going to like it. So if you did like it and you find yourself making the argument that it is meant for one directions fans only, then you have missed the point of cinema. It's to make a zillion dollars, not appeal to like 20 people.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great, especially for the fans.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film today, and didn't have very high expectations. As expected, when we arrived, there was a long winding queue of teenage girls, most a year or two younger than myself.However, the film itself was good, and the excited teenage girls created a great ambiance (surprisingly). There were many laughs, including the members of the band dressing up in disguises. I think that the factor that will appeal most to people about this film is looking into the on-tour lives of the boys and understanding what it's like to perform to so many people, as well as having the pressure of so many fans supporting them. The film also shows the troubles of being away from family for so long; and the stresses of being 'famous' as Harry says. He specifically finds it difficult because of how evasive the press can be, and this aspect is also looked at.Whilst this film is definitely a documentary (don't go expecting lots of action or drama, like my little sister did) it keeps you entertained and for the most part, interested. An open mind is also required, as so many people decide that they 'hate' the band etc, and with that attitude, you will leave the cinema still feeling that way. The film portrays the boys as fun loving, normal and genuine, making them very likable and has rekindled my love for the personalities of the band! I would highly recommend the film to anyone that loves or likes the group, unlike the Channel 4 Documentary, which was just awful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If Lee Daniel's The Butler business is surpassed by this crap,then i would say that everything is possible.The film contains enough gratuitous naked torsos that it is sure to satisfy those fans. But is it of interest to anyone else? It is a chance to ponder just why these five "boys," who range in age from 19 to 21, are pegged as the new Justin Biebers. Unlike Mr. Bieber, they don't seem to be musical prodigies. Only one plays an instrument on stage, and none of them dance well.With a group so evidently versed in the visuals of rock history , it's a shame that a filmmaker wasn't hired who would pay homage to classic pop films instead of offering a satisfactory paid promotional. In the end credits ? Richard Lester-style scenes of the boys in costumes doing pranks ? we see how this film might have been more successful: as an obvious fiction starring these appealing personalities rather than a tame and somewhat fake documentary.Another addition to worthless crap movies that's business is surpassing precious gems like The Butler.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love One Direction SOOO much that it hurts. Anybody who doesn't like agree with me, shouldn't even look at me. One Direction are literally the most perfect people on this entire planet, and I would literally love t meet them!!! This movie legit made me laugh out loud and also cry SO much!!! And it pretty much allowed me to relive the One Direction concert that I went to on 7-18-13. To all of you haters, you should know that we love our five angels SO much and you shouldn't comment all of these mean things. I love One Direction. To all of you Directioners. I just want to say, Turdy sheven and snake habitats. I would most definitely recommend to anyone, however, if you are going to hate on the boys, please don't go watch it because no one wants t hear your hate.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'm not a Directioner but its an interesting film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So yes, I watched One Direction's biographical/concert movie. Wasn't planned at all, a spur of the moment thing that wasn't my idea. Anyway originally I thought I wouldn't like this movie and would find it boring because I'm not a fan of One Direction at all because they are very generic and the celebrity gossip side can be annoying. But then I watched a review of it and it peeked my interest. After watching This Is Us I've noticed that they didn't make the group out to be perfect people who are easy going; One Direction do really act like a bunch of teenagers - they literally don't do much at all, they don't write the songs, pick the tour venues or anything. So in that way it shows they're not responsible for a lot of things their disliked for such as copying other people's songs or doing things past boy bands did - that's all down to Simon Cowell. It also shows the strain of being that famous such as the sudden change of life for them and their families had. So the documentary side of it was quite interesting. The movie side of the production (which was basically the concerts) were also quite entertaining, if you do go watch this then definitely go in 3D, this movie has excellent 3D effects, they did that really well, some of the things they did to amplify the 3D was quite clever as well. The bad points about the film is that some parts can be very cheesy such as getting a neuroscientist to explain the effects of 1D on fans; also Harry Styles got a bit annoying constantly going shirtless every time the camera was on. So all in all it was interesting to watch and the pranks at the end were entertaining but I still find them to be a very generic boy band and probably wont watch this movie again ever but for for my only viewing IT WAS OK+.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful Behind the Scenes Look at One Direction-This Movie will turn everyone into a 1D Fan!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I LOVE One Direction and was very excited to see This is Us. However, I had read some negative reviews. But after seeing the movie I completely disagreed with the reviews! It was a great movie that really showed the boys true personalities when they are not performing. The movie showed how much fun the boys have together. They are not just 5 boys who are in a band together, but 5 boys who have such a strong friendship. It was great to see how they were put together as a band. Even if you are not a One Direction fan the movie is enjoyable. It is very touching to see the boys being so successful, but still going home to see their families and Zayn even bought his mom a house. What I think people really want to see is the behind the scenes look. They want to know what One Direction does in their free time, who their parents are, and what they think about their fame. And This is Us showed just that. From family interviews to their fist X-Factor performance to behind the scenes at concerts, the movie showed it all. You might love their music and you might have been to a concert, but not until seeing this movie will you really know who One Direction truly is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well, It Was Enjoyable.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now I didn't start out as a 1D fan. In fact, I was a hater of them but I didn't know very much about them. When I saw the trailer for this I was like: Well, I probably won't see it in theaters. But, after Best Song Ever came out I liked it and started listening to their music and I became a 1D fan.This documentary is very exciting with some of the best 3D I have seen all year. Morgan Spurlock captures the spirit, music and humor of the boy band as they go through a exciting journey in their worldwide tour.One Direction for those who don't know started out as just five guys on the X Factor, Simon Cowell loved them and decided to put them together as they started to conquer the world of music. They have fans in every part of the world. This, dare I say it, out numbers The Beatles Fans by 100 times.Spurlock, coming off his Comic Con Documentary makes his first concert movie as this is his dream project as he wanted to work on JB Never Say Never but failed to get in the chair. He documents basically them fooling about around the stage. The problem is that they never show the studio or studios they record in. They only show it in one scene and that's only with Zayn.The film also has a scene where the boys go camping and later on questioning the future of 1D. I would like this boy band to go on as they are some of the nicest people you will ever meet. They care about the fans, they care about the group and they have no conflict whatsoever.The 3D is some of the greatest of the year. I wish I had a 3D TV so when this comes out I could watch it in 3D again. The depth is fantastic and Tom Kruger does a excellent job with the cameras and how they are placed so they can give a realistic 3D effect. Kiss You is the best part of the movie as they add tons of retro effects that make the 3D look great.Now Is One Direction Bigger Than The Beatles? Fan-Wise yes, Musically no. While One Direction has some good lyrics, Lennon-McCartney were the better of songwriters. They had complex music and knew how to create art. One Direction isn't art. But it is real music. One Direction This Is Us is great for the fans. I was one of four guys to see this movie. The rest were all girls. It was crazy. I thought when they first came on screen all the girls would scream "OMG ITS ONE DIRECTION!" But they were pretty tame about it. Many will hate it and give it a one because they haven't seen it. But if you see it and you are a hater of their music, you will see that they are great people.91/100 A-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You must be way over-thinking this movie to call it crap, yes it may not be for everyone considering it is about a boy band but with that said, the movie is enjoyable. It is just an insight into these 5 boys lives, past, present, things they have accomplished, behind the scenes, a part that most people don't see or in this case do not know about. It is not an in depth documentary about all of them, it is just a slight taste of it because it is more fun than ordinary documentary's. If you are a fan, then you will love the movie, if you are not a fan, it isn't terrible. Try and put yourself in these boys shoes, or even imagine if they were your kids, you will understand. If you are not a fan of boy bands or this generations music, then it is just not the movie for you to see, but that does not mean it won't be enjoyable for anyone else. It is a lovely film, and if you can stand a little concert music then you will enjoy it. They are 5 lovely boys, give them a break will ya!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They're 5 normal boys and it's their story...there's nothing to hate about.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seriously?! I really don't get these hating and mean comments. It was a beautiful movie. The whole story was about 5 normal talented boys that their life has been changed. It shows their feelings, problems, personalities and stuff like this. And let me remind you that they're just 5 NORMAL guys. And I think their success beyond being handsome, is their differences with other bands. Yeah, they don't dance and they don't wear same clothes which is unique for a young band like them. Because far from anything else, they're singers. And the most ipmortant thing for a singer is to sing. That they can do very beautifully. So there's no point in saying that "they can't even dance!". Please think a little before speaking. Yeah, they didn't show any thing about drugs or sex in their movie not just because they have young fans but because, they're just trying to show their real selves to the people. Is it something bad that these boys are just trying to stay good??? If they were smoking or doing sex in the movie, then the movie was enjoyable??? This is a really cheap thing to say. It's how they are! If you want to see a movie that includes sex or drugs there are always porn and blue movies to watch. You really shouldn't watch this. And beyond all of this, a vary important key to their success is their loyalty. And how humble they are even after all of the dramatic life style changing that they had and the huge fame. The movie wants to show us all of these. The 5 boys that are still so down to earth, sentimental and always fun to be around. There really should be something wrong with you if you don't like this boys, trying to be themselves and trying to stay away from the things that makes them change to some one like Lindsay Lohan. They're perfect as the way they are.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A musical documentary following One Direction (a British boys band) on their European tour. They interview the band, their families and crew members along the way and it's intercut with concert footage.This is basically nothing more than a 90 minute commercial for 1D music but ON THAT LEVEL it's not bad. The members come across as nice, normal guys who just happened to hit it big. They make it clear that they're friends and don't take things too seriously. The concert footage is great--the songs are fun, the band is full of energy and the setups for the concert are incredible. You'll enjoy it if you're a 1D fan and accept it for what it is--a fun piece of fluff.</fullReview>

I am not crazy for them, but I am fond of them and love Harry and Zayn, so I found most of it entertaining. I spent ?8 on this film, which is why I didn't give it a ten out of ten because it wasn't really worth all the money...I'd pay a fiver. There are some moments in it where I couldn't stop laughing. Louis is particularly funny! Anyway, my two friends also thought it was very 'emotional' and cried in most parts. I didn't cry, but I guess I would if I was a proper PROPER fan! It's got all the songs in it for the music fans, plus all the backstage exclusive videos and rehearsals. Plus, you get to see all their families and what it's like on a tour bus. My only complaint would be that it didn't really make me love them anymore. It only told me what I already knew. Overall though, it's worth a try if you're not a Directioner and a must see if you are!</fullReview>

I think they're funny guys, and as a guy around their age, they seem like down to Earth people who would actually be nice in person. I was honestly surprised at the fact that I wasn't the only guy in the theater, which I liked, because I was honestly, a little embarrassed to buy my own ticket. The 3D is amazing, especially during the part of Teenage Dirtbag where they turned into comic characters. They're voices are also very good live, which I did not know... because most artists don't sound as similar to their radio sound, and they sounded very similar if not the same. So... if you like concert movies, This Is Us is a must.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well-Done Peek Into Their World; 3D Worth Every Cent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, the movie is split between behind the scenes footage, interviews, and footage from their concert in the O2 Arena..The concert footage itself is reason enough to see it in 3D. I expected it to be just another gimmick to attract people, but the 3D truly makes the movie so much more stunning visually. Instead of trying to recreate the feeling of being in the audience, which is pretty much impossible, they took a whole different breathtaking, cinematic approach, with aerial shots and special effects that don't seem cheesy in the slightest. The 3D is used not to jump out at the viewer, but to enhance the depth and detail of the concert and stage. It adds to the quality and makes the concert more exciting and awe-inspiring.If you've been to a concert from their Take Me Home tour, you will especially enjoy these scenes, having "I remember that!" moments throughout their performances..No, the movie never went too in-depth, but for a fan, there are still some moments and things said that you wouldn't know or have thought of. The movie begins with a short overview of 1D's rise to fame, showing X-Factor footage. Nothing new there. However, the boys talk about what was going on in their heads during those certain famous moments in their journey, offering a new perspective to those moments you've memorized.For a non-fan, it's like meeting someone at a party. You learn their names, get a brief background, and then get a sense of who they are as the night goes on. It's a brief overview and introduction of the boys, and each of their individual personalities shines through..The interviews aren't really that exciting; it's the footage that makes your ticket worthwhile. You see the boys visit their families/hometowns for a day, and Harry shows you where he had his first kiss, joking about how "steamy" it was. Louis shows you around the Toys R Us where he worked, eventually noticing a 1D lunchbox on the shelf. It's moments like these where you're quietly shown how fully their lives have changed.Another highlight is the footage of their parents. One mom talks about how her child is showing her the world, when it's usually the other way around. One dad talks about how he missed out on having certain father-son conversations, and another talks about how his son has seen more &amp; experienced more than he has..Yes, there are occasional scenes where I wondered just how much was scripted and how much was genuine. Yet there was enough genuine material, enough silly cheekiness from the boys, and enough stunning concert footage to make it worthwhile. You get the sense that they aren't taking themselves too seriously, but are instead enjoying their glory days as much as they can..In my opinion, $13 well spent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>really enjoyed this movie, it tells the whole story of the boys. you can also see that they are just normal boys with an abnormal job. this review has to have 10 lines so i'm going to type about random stuff. apple, banana, pineapple, eeeejj macarena. this is the 5th line, so here come's a one direction song: maybe it's the way she walked, straight into my heart and stole it. through the doors and past the guard, just like she already owned it. i said can you give it back to me, she said never in your wildest dreams. and we danced all night to the BEST SONG EVER, we knew every line, now i can't remember, how it goes but i know, that i won't forget her. cuz we danced all night to the BEST SONG EVER!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>To the people who don't know 1D at all: It's a great movie which gives you a quick overview of how 1D rose to fame and who they are.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Disclaimer before my review, I like 1D's music, their famous "What's Make You Beautiful" had kind of gotten into me back then. But that was all. I'm not their huge fan, I didn't buy their albums (although I have some of their songs in my iTunes), so when I'm writing this, it is from a rather non-fan perspective. I'm definitely not a fan (in comparison to what their REAL fans did in the movie). So here's some quick heads-up for those who wonder if this movie is worth watching. To the people who don't know 1D at all: It's a great movie which gives you a quick overview of how 1D rose to fame and who they are. I won't be surprised if you start googling about them and listening their songs after the movie. To those who know them: I belong to this category, and I definitely enjoyed their mini concert, with the countless behind-the-scenes and hilarious things they did with one another. To the avid fans: (Meaning you've more or less watched all their Youtube videos etc) I guess regardless of what I write, you guys will still watch it. So, yes, go check out your favourite idols goofing around (half-naked) and their some-what sentimental side. And watch the movie in 3D, it's definitely worth the money! This is one of the films which I could hardly find any behind-the scenes videos, as the whole movie is a MEGA Behind-The-Scene of One Direction themselves! There are loads of footage, genuine and unscripted, showing their personality, how they interact and relax off stage. My favourite part will be all the flash-freezing during their concert performances and they are turned into comic super heroes, original and amazing in 3D. Besides the fun and goofy scenes, the part showing the 1D's parents talking about their sons was almost heart-breaking. The footage showing Liam's dad Geoff saying "But he's the only lad in the family and I'll never get this time back, he's gone. And I can't give him advice because he has seen more of the world than me." and Harry Styles' mum, Anne saying, "There's this feeling that we should be showing him the world, and instead he's showing us. We would never have been able to take him to a place like this. It takes a long time to get used to." brought tears to my eyes...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The story of 1D</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie was great. As well as humorous scenes, there were also emotional ones. Seeing the movie in 3D paid off as I got to see Harry topless. I really only focused on Harry because I love him to bits. The movie will show the band's family's whom share their experiences and what they think of 1D. Coincidently the movie released on Liams birthday. Happy birthday babe. The movie also had their smash hits like thats what makes you beautiful, One Thing and their new song Best Song Ever. When I watched the movie, the amount of fans they have is unbelievable (including me). I am a directioner who like the fans in the movie want to actually speak to the band members. I think Harry,Liam,Louis,Zayn and Niall made the movie very enjoyable. Thanks Guys xx xx</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Loved it!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One Direction: This Is Us (2013) I took my 9 year old daughter to see this for her birthday. I thought that it was going to be awful but it was funny and entertaining. My daughter and some other girls laughed and cried at some parts. Nice to see the Guys were really funny and get along. There were no inappropriate parts in the movie, its good for all ages. The 3D made the movie better, it was like they were standing right in front of you. I would recommend this movie, it was worth the money and great to go see with your daughter,nieces or anyone who like One Direction. I found myself enjoying it and now I have their songs stuck in my head LOL (&#x273f;&#x25e0;&#x203f;&#x25e0;).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lovely film, genuine boys</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Really fantastic film, well done. You get a great insight on the boys personal life's and the impact the fame has had on them and their families. As a fan I obviously was going to love it but its something anyone will enjoy and will change your opinion on the boys. What I also loved most about the movie was its tone - they boys are still very shocked and surprised by their success, but they are equally appreciative and thankful for everything. They are very humble and kind, and that really comes across. They really are just normal boys living an extraordinary life that you can tell they are enjoying every minute of. It suitable for all ages and either gender and I am sure you will love it just as much as I did.</fullReview>
