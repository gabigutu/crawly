		<shortDescription>Too subtle and yet too obvious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is commonly called one of the masterpieces of international film. Indeed, a well-known "intro to film" textbook uses it as a case study in notable film-making. But, as more than one reviewer so far has pointed out, 'Tokyo Story' is slow, obscure, and sometimes seemingly sterile. Understanding how a great classic could be seemingly soulless requires some study - of Japanese culture, as others have pointed out, of film technique, and of ourselves. Fortunately, that understanding more than fully repays itself, as is true of any great piece of art.I should begin by warning the first time viewer that the film is not in any familiar style. Other reviewers have mentioned the camera, the angles, the acting, the elision - I hardly need dwell on these. Those used to Hollywood films of almost any era will find 'Tokyo Story' odd and unsettling, just because the style is so different. And of course the culture is radically different. In this forum one can hardly even begin to discuss the way that Japanese fathers discuss their children amongst themselves, or the marriage culture of 1950s Japan. But I think the film is great even if one has no understanding of continuity editing, or post-war Japan, or a dozen other obscure topics. This is, after all, the central feature of great art: Even those of us who do not fully understand still realize, in some unspeakable way, that we are in the presence of something great.The most common accusations leveled against this film, oddly, assert alternatively that it is a cold, soulless exercise in technique or, on the other hand, that it is a soap opera, with no real substance. I think neither of those is true. There can be no question that it is easily seen as cold. Nothing really happens, by modern standards. It is merely a family that comes and goes and lives and dies. Of course, to those who accuse it of being a soap opera, that death is the foremost evidence of its manipulative guilt. But, for those who have seen it, recall the mother's stroke, or where Keizo is told to look one last time - would a soap opera elide such a supremely emotional scenes?No, 'Tokyo Story' is neither cold nor manipulative. Rather, it slowly brings you into a family that, while perhaps totally unlike your own, is at its base just the same. Then it allows those things to happen that must someday happen to all of us - growing up, moving away, and that unspeakable, inescapable end. It is not easy; it is not obvious; but it is not obscure, either. After it all, I can only tell you this: If you have lived long enough to know how it feels to leave your parents and only realize far too late, as it seems we all do, the value of what you have left behind, then 'Tokyo Story' will reward you perfectly. And these things - we all do these very things, so 'Tokyo Story' is universal, is Art.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ozu's Quietly Brilliant Masterpiece Deserves Your Attention</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think this movie is amazing for reasons I was not expecting. I had heard of Yasujiro Ozu's "Tokyo Story" for several years but never had an opportunity to see it until Criterion resuscitated it as part of their DVD collection. Over fifty years old, this wondrous 1953 film resonates just as deeply today. Those outside Japan rarely get to see a Japanese film classic that doesn't involve samurai warriors in medieval battles. This one, however, is a subtly observed family drama set in post-WWII Japan, and it is the quietude and lack of pretense of Ozu's film-making style that makes this among the most moving of films.The plot centers on Shukishi and Tomi, an elderly couple, who traverse the country from their southern fishing village of Onomichi to visit their adult children, daughter Shige and son Koichi, in Tokyo. Leading their own busy lives, the children realize their obligation to entertain them and pack them off to Atami, a nearby resort targeted to weekend revelers. Returning to Tokyo unexpectedly, Tomi visits their kindly daughter-in-law, Noriko, the widow of second son Shoji, while Shukishi gets drunk with some old companions. The old couple realizes they have become a burden to their children and decide to return to Onomichi. They also have a younger daughter Kyoko, a schoolteacher who lives with them, and younger son Keizo works for the train company in Osaka. By now the children, except for Kyoko and the dutiful Noriko, have given up on their parents, even when Tomi takes ill in Osaka on the way back home. From this seemingly convoluted, trivial-sounding storyline, fraught with soap opera possibilities, Ozu has fashioned a heartfelt and ultimately ironic film that focuses on the details in people's lives rather than a single dramatic situation.What fascinates me about Ozu's idiosyncratic style is how he relies on insinuation to carry his story forward. In fact, some of the more critical events happen off-camera because Ozu's simple, penetrating observations of these characters' lives remain powerfully insightful without being contrived. Ozu scholar David Desser, who provides insightful commentary on the alternate audio track, explains this concept as "narrative ellipses", Ozu's singularly effective means of providing emotional continuity to a story without providing all the predictable detail in between. Ozu also positions his camera low throughout his film to replicate the perspective of someone sitting on a tatami mat. It adds significantly to the humanity he evokes. There are no melodramatic confrontations among the characters, no masochistic showboating, and the dialogue is deceptively casual, as even the most off-hand remark bears weight into the story. The film condemns no one and its sense of inevitability carries with it only certain resigned sadness. What amazes me most is how the ending is so cathartic because the characters feel so real to me, not because there are manipulative plot developments, even death, which force me to feel for them.I just love the performances, as they have a neo-realism that makes them all the more affecting. Chishu Ryu and Chieko Higashiyama are wonderfully authentic as Shukishi and Tomi, perfectly conveying the resignation they feel about their lives and their children without slipping into cheap sentimentality. Higashiyama effortlessly displays the sunny demeanor of a grandmother, so when sadness does take over in her life, it becomes all the more haunting. In particular, she has a beautiful scene where Tomi looks forlornly at her grandchild wondering what he will be when he grows up and whether she will live to see what happens. Even more heartbreaking is the scene where Shukishi and Tomi sit in Ueno Park realizing their children have no time for them and are resigned to the fact that they need to find a place to sleep for the night. The closest the film has to a villain is Shige, portrayed fearlessly by Haruko Sugimura, who is able to show respect, pettiness and conniving in a realistically mercurial fashion. Watch her as she complains about the expensive cakes her husband bought for her parents (as she selfishly eats them herself) or how she finagles Koichi to co-finance the trip to Atami or how she shows her frustration when her parents come home early from the spa. So Yamamura (familiar to later Western audiences as Admiral Yamamoto in "Tora! Tora! Tora!") displays the right amount of indifference as Koichi, and Kyoko Kagawa has a few sharp lines toward the end of the film as the disappointed Kyoko.But the best performance comes from the legendary Setsuko Hara, a luminous actress whose beauty and sensitivity remind me of Olivia de Havilland during the same era. As Noriko, she is breathtaking in showing her character's modesty, her unforced generosity in spite of her downscale status and her constant smile as a mask for her pain. She has a number of deeply affecting moments, for instance, when Noriko explains to Shukishi and Tomi how she misses her husband, even though it is implied he was a brutalizing alcoholic; or the touching goodbye to Kyoko; or her pained embarrassment over the high esteem that Shukishi holds for her kindness. Don't expect fireworks or any shocking moments, just a powerfully emotional film in spite of its seemingly modest approach. The two-disc DVD set has the commentary from Desser on the first disc, as well as the trailer. On the second disc, there are two excellent documentaries. One is a comprehensive 1983, two-hour feature focused on Ozu's life and career, and the second is a 40-minute tribute from several international movie directors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The excuses we make to justify our neglect of others</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An appreciation of this movie may demand some understanding of Japanese culture. The Japanese are rather reserved, and were even more reserved back in the early 1950's, when this film is set. No embracing, even of parents, children, siblings; no dramatic histrionics; even a death scene in this movie is much quieter than a Westerner might expect.Consequently I can't really blame several reviewers here for calling this movie boring and slow-paced. But it is not at all slow-paced from a different cultural perspective. It just depends on what you're used to.If you do take the time to watch and try to understand it, you'll find an engrossing analysis of the dynamic of a middle-class family, the rift that grows up between generations, and of the many excuses we find ourselves making to justify our neglect for others, even those dearest to us. These themes are universal, but are couched in a postwar Japanese idiom, and so probably less accessible to the average Western viewer.I have wondered awhile about a speech at the end by Noriko, the widowed daughter-in-law, in which she denies that she's such a good person (though her actions in the movie indicate otherwise). I'm still not sure I understand her motives in saying this. For the most part, however, this movie will not leave you puzzled, but it may leave you a bit wiser, and a bit more reluctant to make those excuses.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extraordinary Portrayal of Real Life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A fantastic film that belies the simplicity of its plot, Tokyo Story is the tale of a vacation gone sadly awry, with an elderly man and woman visiting from the countryside pushed to the sidelines by their busy children in the city. The younger generation (and by extension the "new" Japan) turns its back on the family from which it arose- because of selfishness, because of necessity, or because it's simply the way of the world. The movie provides no easy answers- its melancholy ambiguity is part of its charm. Whatever the case, Ozu delights in portraying the details of everyday life. The emotional resonances of this movie are extraordinary, and some shots (a child picking flowers, an old couple framed by the sea, a woman sitting forlornly at her work desk) are enough to give a sensitive film-goer the shivers. Despite the testimony of some critics, the film is not totally devoid of melodramatic elements (some stock characters and cloying musical motifs spring readily to mind), but the film is founded upon such an obvious love and respect for the importance of real-world interactions that it's hard not to be anything other than enthralled by it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Isn't Life Depressing?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two women are sitting on tatami mats. They are smiling and talking. One ofthem says, "Isn't life depressing?" Wow... that pretty much says it.Tokyo Story is defenitely one of the finest movies ever made. Easy. I don't care what anyone says: slow or not, this is one of Ozu's finest films. Very few movies have made my cry, but I did indeed weep at this movie. All of the actingperformances are very believeable, especially Hara's. The interesting knee- level tatami cinematography suits the film perfectly. Even the music isimpeccable. What really gets me with Tokyo Story is how stunningly realistic it is. From the dialogue to the story, everything feels like real life. No matter what language you speak, what culture or country you hail from, this element is universal.It's pretty much perfect... every character is fleshed out, there are no plot holes left open... I can't find anything to complain about it! 50 years after its release and it's still very contemporary... damn.I give it **** out of ****.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Universal appeal of Tokyo Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As with every great work, the film has its own unique perfection in style, rhythm, details, and artist's vision - but Tokyo Story is very universal in its appeal - it is for every parent, every son or daughter - for everyone. It was made 50 years ago in Japan, about people who lived far away, but it is also about all of us, our families, our problems, our guilt and our search for love and meaning.Ozu's film does not require one to be a movie buff or to try to solve complex symbolism to appreciate and love it. It brings smiles because it is a comedy (for at least the first 2/3) and sadness with a high drama of the last 1/3 of the film.Yasujiro Ozu's quiet and deceptively simple film tells a story of an elderly couple who travel to Tokyo to see their grown up children and their families - son, daughter and daughter-in-law who is a widow of their middle son that was killed during the World War II. Their children love them, of course but they are too busy with their own lives and jobs to spend much time with them. Their young grandchildren don't know them and not too eager to try to know their grandparents better. Only the widowed daughter-in-law is the one who is really happy with their arrival and tries to make their visit pleasurable. After parents return home, children receive a telegram with the sad news that the mother became critically ill. Now it is their turn to make a journey.Ozu does not judge anybody, but beneath the quiet politeness, smiles, and soft voices there is a sad, inevitable, and powerful alienation of generations in the modern world of big cities. The simple family melodrama has been told with intensity, humanity, and honesty of character.P.S. The first thing I wanted to do after I finished watching this film was to pick up the phone and call my mom. Just to hear her voice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A cinema of tears</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can vividly remember the first time i saw this movie - it was during a festival of Japanese movies in an art house cinema here in Dublin. I must admit to never having heard of Ozu before, i went out of boredom and casual curiosity. I was embarrassed at the end to find myself in tears. I quickly wiped them away in that subtle way guys do when they don't want anyone to know, and got out to leave. What struck me was that even as the credits were finishing, I was one of the first to go. As i walked up the aisle I realized that most of the nearly full cinema was still sitting quietly, without the usual post movie chatter - and more than half of the audience had tears pouring down their faces. I have never, ever witnessed that in a cinema.Since then, i've watched it on DVD, and had to think a lot about why such a simple movie is so powerful, and so many people rate it as one of the greatest ever. And why i find myself agreeing with that rating, i truly think it is in the top 10 ever made - certainly the top 5 of any I've seen. But its hard at first to know why. It doesn't have the greatest script of any movie, there are few things in it that are truly original. The acting is great, but not the greatest ever seen, and the technical qualities are just average. I've come to the conclusion that the reason for its greatness is that it comes closest to pure art in cinema. By pure art, i mean art that in its simplicity but technical genius still reveals deep truths about our lives. When i think about Tokyo Story I don't find myself comparing it to other movies, instead I think of a Rembrandt self portrait, a Vermeer painting, or my favourite short story, 'The Dead' by James Joyce. It is simple, unadorned, and deeply wise. I realise in writing this I'm rapidly approaching pseuds corner, but this is my genuine conclusion (writing as someone who is shamefully uneducated in most of the arts).Of course there have been many great movies about families, about growing old, about the nature of life.... but I think somehow Ozu achieved a sort of perfection with Tokyo Story. Thats why its the only movie I would give a '10' to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>FANTASTIC</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I need to say this: THIS MOVIE IS ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC!!! Sure it starts off slowly, but the fact of the matter is the film is a great story of a family and the alienation associated with aging. This is the kind of movie that will make you reflect upon your own family and how you treat them.I had never seen an Ozu film before, but now I feel as if I must see them all. His use of cinematic space is incredible. He breaks all sorts of conventions with his cinematography such as violating the axis of action. This gives the viewer the sense of a large, open, unrestricted world.Going with this realism, the characters seem real; not for a moment did I see the people on the screen as actors. They were the family, and you as the viewer feels what they feel. Part of this comes from the use of head-on-shots such that the characters are speaking TO you.It is a fantastic, moving piece of work and arguably one of the best films ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Things are the way that they are and it is perfect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ozu's Tokyo Story is a serene and contemplative look at the breakdown in the relationship between grown children and their elderly parents shortly after World War II. The film concerns itself with problems many of us must face: the struggle to maintain a self-fulfilling life independent of parental expectations, the changes in relationships wrought by time, and the inevitability of separation and loss. Ozu does not point the finger at either parents or children but, like many of his films, offers a thoughtful meditation on the transitory nature of life. As the film opens, we see an empty street, empty train tracks and an empty pier, perhaps an early indicator of the sense of loss that pervades the film. An elderly father, Shukishi Hirayama (Chishu Ryu) and his wife Tomi (Chieko Higashiyama) are preparing to travel by train to visit their children in Tokyo. When they arrive, they are met with indifference by daughter Shige (Haruko Sugimura), their grandchildren Minoru (Zen Murase) and Isamu (Mitsuhiro Mori), and son Koichi (So Yamamura), a Tokyo pediatrician. When Koichi is called to visit a patient and Shige cannot leave her beauty salon, the Harayamas postpone a sightseeing trip and start to complain that they expected the children would be living in more comfortable circumstances. Their widowed daughter-in-law Noriko (Setsuko Hara), however, welcomes them warmly and gives them the experience of being appreciated. To give themselves some breathing room, the children pool their resources and send their parents to Atami, a health spa. Their visit, however, is cut short when the noise and crowds make going home seem like a better alternative. When they get back to Tokyo, Shige tells them she has a meeting scheduled at her house and Tomi decides to spend the night with Noriko. Shukishi, in a very humorous scene, goes out drinking with old friends and shows up late at night at Shige's house completely drunk. When the elderly parents return to Onomichi, the mother suddenly becomes very ill and the entire family, including youngest son Keizo from Osaka, must come and visit them. The moment of epiphany comes when the youngest daughter Kyoko (Kyoko Kagawa) asks Noriko whether or not life is disappointing. Her answer mirrors Ozu's concept of mono no aware, that we cannot avoid the sadness of life, but her beaming face tells us that things are just the way that they are and that it is perfect. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was only last week that i saw this film for the first time, and i instantly loved it. It perfectly sums up the feelings from post war Japan, and the loss of values the community had to deal with. Our sympathies are instantly placed with the older generation, who are symbolic of the traditional values, while we see the younger generation as selfish, and too busy to spend time with their parents. We have a backward view of change and progress not necessarilly being soOzu shot the film from a waist height viewpoint, which to the traditional Japanese viewer respresents the view of someone below eye level sitting on a mat. This was the pose of the onlooker, and this constantly reminds us that the film is under the gaze, and we should take note. Like traditional Japanese cinema the camera does not move. Panning is replaced by clever cutting, and the mis-en-scene is very artistic. Using the foreground and background very cleverly to show film as an art in its purest form.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>beautiful meditation on old age and family; simple and moving</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't take my mind off this movie. The story is both universally human (old age, the end of life, parents and children) and specifically Japanese. The movie tells the viewer so much about Japanese middle class life in the 1950s: eating and sleeping; mourning the war dead; clothes and home furnishings; spoiled kids; a doctor's office; a schoolroom; life in Tokyo and small towns; how family members talk to each other; old men's drinking habits; a resort hotel. But while we see all these details of a real time and place, we are constantly drawn into reflection on the meaning of human life and relationships. The reflection emerges effortlessly from the simple narrative and the specifics. The director never annoyingly tells us how to feel, he is not preaching and not drawing attention to himself. (There is none of that "hey, I'm making a moving movie" crud that you get in Hollywood treatment of these topics). He just lets the story unfold in a quiet, natural way. It's not for folks who only like "action" movies. I put "action" in quotes because this movie is about the real action in life--enjoying life, sharing it with others, facing the end of it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tokyo monogatari (or Tokyo Story) is a very human story. It contains a lot of everyday life which at times can make it difficult to follow since it may feel a little bit slow.However who is patient gets rewarded. And Ozus way of telling this story is very quiet but effective. The images he produces and the very minimalist camera work creates a rhythm that sucks the viewer in and slowly opens him/her up for the sad but essential ending of this movie.Ozu never tries to impose his story to the viewer. It looks like he follows his actors very disciplined and calm. This very structured and clear camera-work will alienate many modern moviegoers who are used to much more dynamic images. However lovers of purist cinema and fans of Aki Kaurismaki will probably love it.Impressing also to see how close the everyday life of Japan in the mid 50s is to the western way of life.</fullReview>

The theme of the disintegration of a family as a microcosm of societal changes is one which is universal: this is the theme of Ford's "How Green Was My Valley", of Welles's "The Magnificent Ambersons", of Satyajit Ray's "The Music Room", but Ozu is able to tell his story without the usual paraphernalia of melodrama. The story unfolds in an almost lifelike fashion, and we in the audience feel as if we are eavesdropping on this family. Gradually, small details and little incidents build, until such scenes as the widowed daughter-in-law's confession of loneliness create an overwhelming empathy.</fullReview>

Shukishi and Tomi note that their children do not have time for them and they decide to return to Onomichi. Along their trip, Tomi does not feel well and they stop in Osaka to visit their son Keizo Hirayama (Shirô Osaka). Soon each son and daughter receives a telegram from Onomichi with sad news."Tôkyô monogatari" is a sad story of family indifference, selfishness and farewell directed by Yasujirô Ozu using his traditional style with a steady camera and centralized filming. This movie makes the viewer thinks about parents' seniority and children indifference and selfishness that cannot spend time with them. Makes also think how short life is and how soon the son or daughter will become the old parent that he or she neglected.

		<shortDescription>A meditative masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first watched Tokyo Story in a classroom some time ago and witnessed something curious. I have never seen a group of people so choked up over a film, ever. The most curious thing about it though is that most could not place what exactly made them so emotional. There are moments in Tokyo Story in which you are hit with a wall of emotions, surprised and overwhelmed that this simple little film could evoke such feelings. It's something about the characters, the honesty, the way everything hits home despite the cultural and time-period barriers.Tokyo Story takes a deep look at familial relations in postwar Japan. Simply, it boils down to this: two aging parents (played by Ryu Chishu and Higashiyama Chieko) live far away from their children, who are in a quickly modernizing Tokyo. The children in Tokyo are quite selfish and focused on their own busy lives in the hustle-and-bustle of the city. The key character in this film, though, is Noriko (Hara Setsuko), the widow of one of the parents' sons who died in the war. Noriko turns out to be more active with her husband's parents than their own children are.The parents decide to make their first, and possibly final, trip to Tokyo in order to see their children and view the spectacle of the city. The only person that can make significant time for them, however, is Noriko; the children are busy with work and even send their parents away to a spa! In one heartfelt scene, the mother, Tomi, spends the night at Noriko's in which she begs her to re-marry and apologizes for the burden that her son has caused. During this time, the father, Shukichi, is out drinking with old friends and admits to them that he is disappointed with his children, agreeing with his friends who feel the same way.Ozu Yasujiro is considered to be one of the world's greatest filmmakers and Tokyo Story is considered his masterpiece. There is no reason to deny this. Ozu's camera is often a topic of discussion?it usually sets itself at the level of people sitting on the floor (tatami), which allows the viewer to feel like they are sitting right with the characters. It is usually always a calm camera, and very rarely pans. His films are also often slowly paced and meditative, choosing to avoid showing important events which later are revealed through dialogue. Ozu's direction of children has always been brilliant, they are never a weak point in his films and he often bases his stories on child characters (though not here).Tokyo Story contains all of the elements that make Ozu's films popular with film students and cinephiles today. His calm, observant camera; his real-life, non-embellished characters; his attention to detail and the emotional emphasis on certain objects; his perfectly timed music; among other things, contribute ultimately to the warmth and effectiveness of the film. Ozu's passion for filmmaking knew no bounds.Tokyo Story will not appeal to everybody, especially today. The typical moviegoer will either dismiss the film because it is "old" or "black and white," or find it boring. To the cautious and attentive viewers who allow themselves to connect with the characters and feel the story, Tokyo Story is a rewarding experience. Tokyo Story, along with Ozu's other films, is a good example of film as an art. Aimed at telling a story and depicting true life on camera, it is much less of the "entertainment" experience that people have come to expect from the movies today. There are no explosions, violence, chase scenes, or over- the-top characters here. This is Ozu. This is one of the greatest films ever made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I only got to watch this film for the first time ever about a month ago, as it is being rescreened at the OTHER CINEMA in London. I was told by my ex-Japanese teacher about 5 years ago back in secondary school that it was one of the most beautiful films ever made. I was only just getting into foreign cinema (i.e. anything not from Hollywood really) and wasn't sure what to expect and I wasn't willing to take the risk of being possibly bored to death with "old classics". I read many reviews written by the random public from websites such as IMDB, and I found too many unfavourable comments about it, so I thought I'd give it a miss... how wrong was I to conform to other peoples' opinions!I'm going to contradict myself now immediately after implying that one shouldn't conform to other people, because I am now going to say that it is a wonderful film and you should take my recommendation and watch it whenever you have a chance. Because of people like me, there will always be people that harshly criticise this masterpiece of a film, but because of these harsh words there will always be people like me who will praise it just a bit too much.Although in those last two paragraphs there was virtually nothing with regards to the theme and plot and acting of Tokyo Monogatari, there isn't really a need to express the overall beauty of the film, since it is a near perfect work of art from Yasujiro Ozu. His camera technique is so unique that one can immediately spot an Ozu film from a mile away. Tokyo Monogatari is that deals with family issues (Ozu's theme in all of his films), and how society messes things up so much that there is nothing that can be done to solve the problems. It leaves the viewer with a strange feeling of desperation to do something good for your parents. It may not be the most emotional and dramatic of films, but it certainly provokes a flood of emotions for the viewer to dream about in his/her sleep.I would give this a definite 10/10, and I would rate Ozu as one of the greatest directors of all time. Another two films I recommend by Ozu are FLOATING WEEDS and OHAYO.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Greatest Ozu? Not in a long shot!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An ageing couple travels from a small coastal village to visit their children now living in Tokyo. Their son and daughter are too preoccupied to give them much attention and only Noriko, the widow of their middle son takes time off for them. When they return to their village, one of the parents becomes critically ill. Though highly acclaimed, this has never been my favorite Ozu. On first viewing I found it too moralistic, with the phrase "You can not honor your parents beyond the grave." repeated twice. On repeated viewing I got more in tune with what Ozu really wanted to say. The key scene is perhaps not the one where all the sons and daughters feel remorse for their carelessness but the one where Noriko explains the youngest daughter that this carelessness is inevitable. In life, the initially strong bonds with our parents slowly fade until there's a point at which they become a burden - even if we don't want to admit this to them or ourselves. But that thesis is being contradicted first by the fact that the children really don't have to be as callous as they are (Haruko Sugimura in particular cranks up her usual bitchiness) and secondly by the actions of Noriko herself, who is so annoyingly ideal, such an excruciatingly perfect example of filial piety (even towards her in-laws), that she becomes the living refutation of her own - and the movie's - claims. When she berates herself for being selfish as well, it feels more like modesty than genuine remorse, because we haven't seen this character do anything even remotely selfish. This is a film-a-th?se that suffers from mixed-message-syndrome.Tokyo Story is far from a bad movie, but I just don't think it's the great Ozu-masterpiece it's often considered to be. *** </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Prototypical Ozu</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mathematicians have a saying, "Happiness is proving the same theorem over and over again," by which is meant that proving a significant result early on allows for embellishing, extending, and recasting the result in different contexts for almost a whole career. If Ozu had been a mathematician, I suspect he would have understood this idea. I have seen five Ozu movies and they all seem to be variations on a theme, that theme being an examination of the family dynamics of a particular Japanese family, frequently highlighting the frictions between generations and concerns about parents marrying off their daughters."Tokyo Story" is my favorite of the Ozu movies I have seen and it is prototypical. All the techniques are here: meticulously framing each shot, shooting from a low level, using only direct cuts, minimizing camera movement, jumping ahead in time. The story has an aging Japanese couple traveling from Onomichi to Tokyo to visit their children, after a lapse of eighteen years. When in Tokyo the parents find that their children are busy with their own lives and are not terribly excited about the visit. The only person to receive them with much affection is the widow of a son lost in the war. This movie could easily be updated to the current time.The story is simply told, but it did require my attention. It took me a while to sort out the relationships between the son and daughter in Tokyo and their spouses and the single daughter-in-law. And sometimes the jumps in time were a little disorienting. For example, when the parents arrive in Tokyo a visit to a son in Osaka along the way is referenced, but scenes from that visit were not shown.I would have thought that the movie's having been made only eight years after the war, and only a year or two after the allied occupation of Japan, that there would have been more references to the war, but clearly Ozu was not out to provide much direct post-war analysis in this movie. He did treat the audience to a brief bus trip through Tokyo. The city then seemed already well on its way to becoming the modern city it is today.This movie is so skillfully shot in black and white that I was surprised to see in some of the later Ozu movies that he has an artist's eye for color.Some of the scenes in "Tokyo Story" will stay with me, like the scene of the parents sitting on the sea wall and discussing their decision to go home, basically admitting that the trip had been somewhat of a failure.Know that if you like this movie, there are a lot more Ozus like it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Touching story, but something is missing for me...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Strengths:+ A really heartbreaking story about an elderly couple, and their children &amp; grandchildren who don't really care about them. + The whole film has a powerful bittersweet mood. If you are into that sort of thing, you will love it. + The grandparents are very cute and nice people. You just want them to be your grandparents. + Unique cinematography. The camera is always at a low height, and almost never moves. It feels like you are there with the characters, sitting in the next room on a tatami.Weaknesses:- This is not a great drama...there is not enough conflict, character development, dialogues, and even less turns in the story. - I didn't find the characters layered. What you see from them in the first 20-30 minutes of the movie is pretty much what will get form them later on. It becomes kinda predictable. - The cinematography is unique, and interesting at first (just ask any film snob), but its not enough to carry a movie. This is not 2001: A Space Odyssey.Conclusion: Ask any snob, they will tell you, this is one of the best films ever. Its not only touching, deep and well made, but its also Japanese, more than 50 years old, black-n-white, sloooow, and not popular with the masses, because apparently, these things count as positive. Don't get me wrong, I have no problem with Japanese (Kurosawa), slow (Stalker, 2001) movies, or movies that are confined to a few interior places (12 Angry Men). And I think this is a very good movie. It just doesn't have enough content other than its mood, to hold up as well as some other old classics.Still, I say, give it a watch. But I warn you, this is minimalist cinema.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>On the Way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My wonderful introduction into the work of Ozu tells from an elder couple, Shukishi and Tomi (Chishu Ryu, Chieko Higashiyama) who make a trip to Tokyo to visit their grown-up, busy, egoistic children. Only Noriko (Setsuko Hara), the widow of their dead son, cares about them with an open heart. Soon after the parents returned to their home in a small, rural town, the mother gets sick and is about to die. The family members come together for a last visit."Tokyo Story" deals with the break-up of a family and Ozu treats it in a way which is totally opposed to Hollywood manners. This gets especially obvious with the staging of the mother's death. We see the bed of the dawning woman at which the family members are gathered around. Then, Ozu cuts to a sequence of long shots showing the small provincial place: a deserted street, abandoned wharves, a boat on a river, boats in the harbor, orphaned tracks. When the camera comes back to the deathbed, the mother already has passed away. Here, Ozu does not do anything to force the dramatic art of the scene. On the contrary, he leaves out the moment of death and the instant reactions of the relatives and consequently keeps the film's balance. It is this controlled interaction of distance and balance which continuously shapes the superb production.This is shown equally well in the narrative structure and in the cautious performances of the actors, but most of all in the carefully composed simplicity of the pictures. Apart from a few exceptions, Ozu abstained from camera movements, and only in rare moments the lenses approach to the characters. The camera captures the actions from a low point of view and remains in half long shots most of the time. It is the perspective of an observer, sitting on a Tatami mat himself, like a guest who follows the course of events with contemplative calm and a due humbleness.Ozu intriguingly encounters the social course of time in the life of a family with a certain wistfulness and gentle melancholy. At the same time, he points out the necessity of such changes in the Japanese society as a whole. And perhaps that is why there lies some sort of comfort in the beauty of the pictures, because it divines that the certitude of the persistent process of time can be also a source for inner quietude.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A few observations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(some spoilers)Why would anyone want to write anything about a film released half a century ago? There are two most obvious reasons: (a) the author has only recently seen it and (b) the film is timeless, just as relevant today as when it was first released. In this case, it is both.Over the last half-century, Tokyo Story has found its way into the top ten list of numerous film critics. Much have been said about the reason why. What I'm trying to do here is just to make several observations, about things in this film that particularly strike me.One is on the scene at the Tokyo train terminal, when the old couple returns home after their visit in Tokyo. Most of us in today's world would have plenty of experience is saying farewell. Less of us would have experience in saying farewell to people whom we just may not see again. Still less of us (only those who have been around long enough) would have experience in saying farewell to people who expect that they may not see us again. Those of us in this last category would probably sense what I am referring to about the scene. The old women, in a completely matter-of-course manner, said to her children that now that they have had this reunion, if anything happens afterwards, they need not come (to the small town where the old couple lives). So plainly delivered, this line is one of the things that make Tokyo Story stand above other films with similar situations and similar dialogues.Another is a very haunting static image. Leading towards it is the part when the old couple's son, a very busy medical doctor, scraps the plan of a family outing. While the somewhat rebellious older grandson sulks, the grandmother successfully coaxes the younger son to go outside to play in a somewhat desolate industrial area. The grandmother, somewhat predictably, asks the little guy what he wants to do when he grows up, and equally predictably, the question is beyond his grasp, as he continues to pluck at the tall grasses. Then comes this last shot of the sequence, a distant shot of old on the right side of the screen and the young on the left. Regardless of what message you get out of this shot, the image is haunting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My first Ozu's masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The omission of Ozu's oeuvre is definitely an unerring embarrassment for any movie aficionado, thankfully TOKYO STORY comes to my rescue, presumably Ozu's most renowned work, tellingly it merits all kudos it gets, gracefully scrutinizing the post-WWII mental disposition of Japanese people, and quietly tear-jerking in eliciting recollections and rumination between parents and their children. Parenthood is not for everyone, but we all have parents, we forever hold a sense of regret towards them, especially in the oriental culture, filial piety is the foremost virtue to measure an individual's worth, at least viewed by other family members.Ozu's camera stands or stays in a perpetual static angle, aka. the now famous "tatami-mat" shot, collectedly watches the motions of its objects, the Hirayama family, Shukichi (Ry?) and Tomi (Higashiyama) is an elderly couple living in Onomichi, taken care by their youngest unwed daughter Kyöko (Kagawa), as the film starts, they set about visiting Tokyo for the very first time, to stay with their grown-up children there, it is a big deal for them, nevertheless, when sojourning in with their eldest son Köichi (Yamamura) and eldest daughter Shige (Sugimura), the couple find themselves become a nuisance towards their families and their busy business, only Noriko (Hara), the wife of their deceased second son (who died in the war 8 years ago), treats them sincerely, brings them to sightseeing, hosts them in her small single apartment. After being sent to Atami for a hot spring spa which turns out to be too rowdy for the elderly, they decide to cut their trip short and return home. However Tomi falls ill on the train, so they have a layover in Osaka, where they meet their youngest son Keizö (Ôsaka), when they reach home, Tomi's illness deteriorates, all the children head back and Tomi passes away shortly. The story can be derived from every ordinary family, the common dilemma is when we grow up, parents are slowly slipping from our priority list, for the successful ones, Köichi is a neighborhood doctor, Shige opens a beauty salon, they are both married and the former has two young children, but they could not spare one day to spend with their parents, either swamped by urgent appointments or find it hard to close her business even for one day. It is a quotidian trepidation can happen in the much-urbanized city, but Shukichi and Tomi take it lightly, in their simple-minded, you can sense their disappointment, but all they do is enduring it calmly, claim that it is a natural course when children grow up, parents should not be in the way of their lives, beyond all the offhand pleasantries and formal proprieties, the bond of blood relations is sharply lopsided, one cannot help but interpreting it as a faddish mindset of Japanese at that time, but, over 60 years has passed, the film is still distressing to watch as our world barely changes into a better one. Ozu never married in his entire life, so overtly he had been defying this detrimental malady all his life, in the film, Noriko is a sheer opposite of Hirayama's self-seeking offspring (bar Kyöko), it testifies that blood doesn't mean anything at all, which is a lightning bolt to those who deems bloodline as their purest and ultimate legacy in this world.Performances are uniformly high-end, Ry? radiates with utter aplomb and understanding although it is against his own age to act as a sexagenarian (he was in his early 40s then); Higashiyama calls forth great compassion in audience for her simple and unadorned charisma, Yammer and Sugimura superbly represents two very different kinds of self- obsession, the former is more depicted in a way of thoughtlessness whereas the latter parades her self-pleasing philosophy reeking with a whiff of opportunistic shallowness, but if one observes carefully, the more spiteful one is the former, more than often he awaits the latter to broach on some ill-considered remarks or ideas and then echoes with a genial smile.The most emotive of all comes from Hara, she is the exemplar of a golden-hearted soul, through her Noriko, Ozu consummately sheds light on the true, the good and the beautiful essence of human nature, Hara has a magnetic affinity on screen, which facilitates herself as one of the most indelible and iconic goddess in the Japanese cinema, now at the age of 95 and let us truly hope she will always stay with us with good health and longevity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I need to see it again even after two times; a beautiful mix of simplicity, nuance, style and humility</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was shown Yasujiro Ozu's Tokyo Story- my first Ozu film- in an Art-film class some years ago, and I watched it again a couple of months ago. This has to be a truly indelible Japanese film, even to those who might dismiss it dimly as 'slow' or one where nothing happens. Actually, if you're going by traditional plot, not a lot does happen. But then again, not a lot happens on Seinfeld, either. In fact, maybe on repeat viewings, this could become the serene, Japanese tragic-comic equivalent of Seinfeld. After two viewings I get the 'jist' of the characters, their simple objectives and how they live their lives, but there's still much that can be taken in, it's hard to describe. While I'm not sure I've seen one of the ten best films ever made, as it has been for some critics and audiences, I do think it's a very unique film, one that moves in a way akin to an Italian neo-realist film, but filmed with a very particular eye that sets it apart from them.In terms of how its characters go about in the story, it is really closer to a work of De Sica or other, as it is centrally about the importance of family, and how a family and its members through the petty parts and especially through the tragic times has to stick together. The family unit here involves a couple of grandparents (Chishu Ryu and Chieko Higashiyama, who have those funny, dependent, though truthful ways about them as elders of the common ilk) who come to visit the rest of their family, and aside from (more than any other) daughter-in-law Noriko (played in such a wonderfully every-day, compassionate way by the great Setsuko Hara), they're dealt with the 'it's the old folks again'. This is particular by their own real daughter, who seems most ungrateful for their arrival. They send them to a resort, but then something un-expected happens, which turns the situation around and ground the henpecking to an immediate halt.Some scenes still stick in my head even when I least expect them going about my days, much as the aforementioned Seinfeld episodes seem to do. I loved the gentleness in one scene where Noriko is offered a gift by the grandmother, it rings perfectly true to the everyday, but it's handled in such a way that could not have been done as well in another film. There's also a great deal of humility, with moments of amusement, when two male characters (one of them the grandfather I believe) get drunk. And throughout the film, Ozu creates impressionable compositions, setting him apart with just this film alone for me as a remarkable artist; I still remember certain shots of the houses and scapes (his specific way of shooting characters in the interiors is really neat too). In the class our teacher told us this was part of what were called 'handkerchief films' or something close to that in Japan, where audiences would bring hander-chiefs with them from crying so much during the film. I can see why; probably the best that can be said of Tokyo Story is how he pulls so much out of so little, and the interest that is always constant, even through little domestic squabble scenes, quiet moments with the elders (the old man has a look that's perfect throughout), and the more intense ones later on. In short, it's definitely at least one of the very best Japanese films of the 1950s, in the same rank as Kurosawa's best films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In this film Ozu explores and shows great respect for the small, private suffering in each of our lives. He does this in the most UNsentimental way, but rather, is relentlessly mindful of the details and subtlety in the process of accepting facts beyond our control. Ozu has no resistance to the truth of regret and loss. There is no manic or depressive struggle, but a slow gaze over a beautiful horizon. He takes us to an emotional sanctuary where we can observe without averting our eyes. Ozu does not try to jerk our feelings around or deliberately set out to make us cry. He does not try to dazzle us intellectually or do anything creative or new. Rather he simply shows us an idealized transformation through stages of life where we can arrive at a state of peace through acceptance of "normal" events. There are no bad guys or good guys here, but simple declarations about life in the most monumentally unadorned style possible. A great, great work of art. My all-time favorite.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Honor thy father and thy mother</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Tradition is the illusion of permanence." - Woody AllenYasujiro Ozu's "Tokyo Story" finds an elderly Japanese couple visiting their adult children in Tokyo city. They intend to spend time with their offspring, but the kids are too engulfed in their own lives to make much time for their mother and father.Having seemingly lost the ability to relate to their parents, the self-absorbed kids thus shuttle the couple off to a luxury spa and hotel, all the while resenting their parents for the expense. Even the couple's grandchildren treat them with a great deal of scorn. The eldest grandson grows angry when he learns that he has to share his study with his grandparents and later throws a tantrum when the family cancels plans to visit a restaurant.Ignored by their family, the elderly couple wander about Tokyo city, visiting friends and soaking up the scenery. They receive more affection from strangers, old friends and the wife of one of their dead sons, than they do from blood relatives. The film ends with the family's frail mother predictably dying. Though her children take a few moments to mourn her loss, stating that they regret not treating their mother better whilst she lived, they promptly return to their old selves, their dead mother quickly forgotten.So what we have here is a simple morality tale. Ozu is a traditionalist, and the majority of his films view with bittersweet sadness how the traditional family unit has disintegrated in an increasingly urbanized post-war Japan. And yet, while Ozu waxes nostalgically for some ideal familial bond, his films are also about the "inevitability of change". One need only look at the titles of Ozu's better known films (Early Spring, Late Spring, Early Autumn and Late Autumn) to see that he's attached to a very specific form of Japanese seasonality. In "Tokyo Story" he makes this point quite literally when he has one character state that all families unavoidably drift apart, pulled in their own individual directions. The result is that "Tokyo Story" has an oddly counterproductive tone, Ozu both acknowledging the inevitability of change and mourning the loss of some idealized good old days. Typical of Ozu, the director's camera is always distant, austere and motionless. He doesn't sledge hammer his points and maintains a very remote tone throughout. This has led to critics and fans applying buzzwords like "un-sentimental" and "restrained" to "Tokyo Story". But is the film really "restrained", or is Ozu's emotionally inert quietness fooling us into thinking we're watching something of depth and complexity?Consider, for example, a scene in which the daughter pokes fun at her mother's weight, only for the mother to die at the end of the film. Instead of delving into the couple's relationship, Ozu opts for simple button pushing, forcing us into the easy position of hating the daughter and pitying the mother. Ozu's aloof style therefore disguises the shallowness of his material, whilst also denying us the satisfaction of what is really shameless domestic melodrama.Like Dreyer, Ozu thus has a tendency of packaging very sentimental and simplistic morality lessons in what can at times be a very challenging aesthetic. In other words, "Tokyo Story" is more challenging stylistically, than it is intellectually, morally, or emotionally. It is neither complex nor nuanced, its solemn style completely at odds with what is really a very easy and agreeable lesson.Still, it's not all black and white. If the sons and daughters don't have time for their parents its only because they are genuinely busy. Ozu even makes one son a hectic doctor in an attempt to absolve the boy of all guilt. Afterall, how can we hate a kid for cancelling a diner date with his parents when he's absent only because he's out saving lives?The waters are muddied further when late in the film the father reveals that he is disappointed that his children are not more successful. It gradually becomes clear that he has relied on the success of his children to validate his own life. Throw in the fact that the mother is a bit of an airhead, the father was once a drunk and that both parent's constantly put on a ridiculous facade of kindness, and it's hard not to empathise with their offspring. The kid's may be dismissive of their parents, but the parents, we learn, are equally dismissive of them.7.9/10 ? An influential film, viewed as a masterpiece by many. Still, peel back its uptight stoicism and "Tokyo Story" reveals itself to be a pretty condescending message movie. Much of Ozu's filmography is like this, hiding sentimentality behind an austere aesthetic. Consider all the pavlovian heart attacks and wistfulness in "End of Summer", his sentimentalizing of the unemployed in "Tokyo Chorus", his fondness for abandoned, kindly old parents (Tokyo Story, Late Spring), the way he scorns (and celebrates!) modernisation (Good Morning) and mourns the way time rips all children away from the elderly (Late Autumn). Worth one viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I finally saw this film after Site &amp; Sound Magazine rated it as the third greatest film ever made in their once-a-decade list. Far from being in the pantheon of greatest films, I found it to be a ploddingly dull movie that made some fairly obvious points about the weakening of the parent/child relationship as the parents settle into old age.The movie is definitely not without its fine points. The acting is generally excellent and the last half hour becomes increasingly interesting after the first brutally slow-paced opening hour and forty-five minutes. It's entirely possible that if Site &amp; Sound hadn't placed this film on such a high pedestal, I might have enjoyed it more than I did. But then again, if they hadn't have rated it so highly, I might have never seen it at all.In the final analysis, "Tokyo Story" is worth a look but if you're expecting to see one of the greatest films ever made, be ready to be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the best film I've seen from Ozu, but is pretty good overall</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the last film from Ozu's "Noriko Trilogy", Late Spring and Early Summer. The link these films share is that the main character is called Noriko and played by Setsuko Hara (however, the three characters aren't the same one).I don't find Tokyo Story to be as good as it's regarded to be and it's certainly not that touching as people appear it to be. I'm surprised by the amount of viewers saying they thought that the ending was a tearjerker. It is a downer ending, but for some reason Ozu's films never strike me to be very emotional (even though the theme of problems in the family is prominent in them). Ozu's unusual shooting style is once again interesting to behold, what with the abundance of static tatami-mat shots, only one shot in the film actually requiring the camera to move (although it's so slow I didn't even notice it the first time), or the movie posters on the walls in the background.One thing I remember the most from Tokyo Story is Ozu's unique sense of mise-en-sc?ne, particularly the box-like, narrowed display of the sets and a well-thought out placement of decorations, furniture, etc., which seems mathematical in its "one large foursquare divided into many other foursquares" approach. It adds to the movie's serene and meditative atmosphere. Ozu's films have very simple and minimalistic plots, but they're almost never boring to me; they have a strange hypnotic aura that captivates you. 8,5/10</fullReview>

In "Tokyo Story," we see a couple who love their children and patiently and philosophically forgive them for their rudeness. The circle of life and the real personalities of all the characters make for a poignant story.It moves slowly and may be too long, but the result is an unforgettable glimpse into another time and place.

But there are some things you should do first. Watch some Kurosawa films. Watch some Ghibli films. Read up on the culture of Japan. Learn what a pillow shot is. Then come back and pop in this flick.There are stories that translate across cultures and generations. This is where the Hero's Journey and the Monomyth come from. But there are also stories that are specifically tied to one culture or another, that are engrained in that culture for all they are worth. One can watch them without knowing anything about their culture of origin, but the experience is... lessened.This is one of those stories.The plot is basic. An elderly couple comes to visit their kids in Tokyo, but their kids are too busy, and send their parents to a bathhouse. At its basis, this could be construed as your basic 'take care of your elders' story. But that is not doing the story justice. That is like calling LotR a basic 'kill the evil guys trying to take over the world' story.These characters are so complex, but their complexities do not get in the way of emotional power. At the end of the movie, after a potent climax, the characters gather together, and you feel for every single one of them. That is impressive.And that is just the tip of the iceberg. There are so many little intricacies to be loved about this movie. This is cinematic poetry in every meaning of that term. There are movies- movies I like and respect- where I say to myself, "I could do better than that." I never once thought that when watching this movie. The dichotomy between simplicity and complexity is shown even in the title of the movie. Tokyo Story is about the simplest possible title anyone could think of for this movie. It is like naming a song ___ Song. But it is also deep. Tokyo is one of the most storied cities of all time, and at the time of this movie's release, it was just starting to recover from the massive firebombing campaign the United States waged on it in the closing days of World War II.I think of this title like a fancy door. On the surface, it is simple and functional. And if that is all someone wants to take out of it, so be it. But if one looks deeper, they can see a whole new level of symbolism and detail.Remember when I said to look up what a 'pillow shot' is. There's a reason for that. Ozu uses these to great effect, giving the audience a chance to breath and compose themselves. It is a very Japanese way of doing things. I'd love to see what would happen if pillow shots were included in their next mainstream blockbuster. But I doubt that anyone who is interested in this movie in the first place would be put off by its Japan-ness.Typically, I don't talk about the use of restraint in film- it is important, integral even but no one comes to see a film because of its effective use of restraint- but I must make an exception for this film. This is a film requiring perfect balance in every respect. If one side or viewpoint became too overpowering, the movie would no longer be one of the greatest movies of all time. It would be simply great. Vast oceans of restraint are needed at every turn. Good thing the director is Ozu.But even with all its perfections, I would not love this film nearly as much as I do if not for how much I love who the characters become and what they have to say. They do not just feel alive. They feel importantly alive. The best example of this comes when three aging businessmen sit at a bar and talk about their children. In some movies, this would be a cheap throwaway joke. In others, it would a cheap attempt at melodrama. But in this movie, it results in one of the most profound discussions I've ever heard in a movie. I was awestruck.That is the second-best scene in the movie, at least in my opinion. The best comes at the very end of the movie. I won't spoil it, but no one who watches this movie closely is unaffected by it. It captures the tone of this movie as perfectly as any scene can capture the tone of any movie.Melancholy without being depressing, insightful without being preachy, fascinating without needing to be flashy, this is one of the greatest pieces of mature, adult, thoughtful art that has ever been produced.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best movies ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warning: This review contains several spoilersRightly regarded as one of the finest movies ever made, this 1953 film of Japanese master Yasujiro Ozu is about Shukichi (Chish? Ry?) and his wife, Tomi (Chiyeko Higashiyama), an elderly couple living in a small town in Southern Japan, who we are told are about 70, but to our eyes look more to be closer to 80. They decide to visit their two eldest children, who live in Tokyo: Koichi (Sô Yamamura), whom Shukichi and Tomi believed to be a prominent city doctor, but is actually a harried local practitioner and Shige (Haruko Shugimura), who is a beautician. Neither of them has too much time for their parents. Koichi is too busy with work, and his young, rowdy children openly disdain their grandparents, whom they have never met before. Shige, the eldest daughter, is considerably worse, as she continually voices her disapproval with her parents and scolds her husband for attempting to treat them with nice gestures (Shugimura plays her character's meanness with relish). The elderly couple has also a younger daughter, Kyoko (Kyoko Kagawa) who still lives with them and works as a schoolteacher in their hometown. Kyoko resents their elder siblings' aloofness towards their parents. A fourth son, Keizo, appears only towards the end of the movie, seemingly also indifferent to the fate of his parents.At the end, their children's indifference prompts the elderly couple to return early to their hometown, but in their trip back Tomi gets ill and dies soon after reaching home.Clearly the elder children had some unresolved resentment towards their parents: we don't know exactly the reason for it, though Shukichi's alcoholism when he was younger is mentioned several times in the movie.Only their daughter in law Noriko (the wonderful Setsuko Hara, a regular in many Ozu movies), the widow of their fallen son during World War II, treats them with kindness and attention while they are in Tokyo. In the movie's climatic, tear inducing scene, Noriko initially protests to Shukichi that she is not such a nice person, and that she is really selfish. And we come to understand what she means by this: as sweet and humane as she is, Noriko is also seeking closure to her husband's death in the war, and with her attention and niceties she is desperately looking for her parents in-laws approval: when he is happy to give her that in the final scene, encouraging her to forget his son and find a new husband, she breaks down with tears in one of the most moving scenes in the history of cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Tatami</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is so perfect it makes the hair on the back of my neck bristle thinking the film was nearly lost right after its completion in a fire at the Yokohama lab! (What we have nowadays doesn't come from a master negative but from dupes)If you've seen your share of Ozu, you know the modus operandi: the stories recur from one movie to the other, similar shots, same actors, even the same names for characters. And predominantly, the same radical way of seeing the world: the multi-layered, meditative, agile (despite being stationary!) and deeply dimensional eye that pierces simultaneously through multiple rooms; characters are positioned to the frame just like any other object, conversing with each other and also with the surrounding space. Much of this sense of space comes from Ozu shooting low, close to the tatami, meaning that the ceilings are often visible.The story is never extraneous, nor is it melodramatic. The undertow of loss is ever as poignant here, a complete antipode to the light family banter in its two predecessors in the "Noriko" trilogy. We've waded warm and pleasant waters so far, even when considering there's been departure. The word "you'll get better" will break your heart, as will "I'd have been kinder to her" delivered with apparent fake cheer by the surviving widow. This will make one think of one's own parents, and if you're married, your own wife and children. What a gift we've been given in them!It will always remain a mystery why Hara's character in all the three films is named Noriko ? not the same Noriko, but still obviously a central element and a link between the three. There are other curiosities: the young children in "Bakush?" (1951) are named Minoru and Isamu, just as they are in this film. Minoru is actually played by the same boy, Murase Zen.The music is brilliant, and the main theme is one of the greatest in film history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A ubiquitous story!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie begins with an elderly couple packing their bags to call on their children in Tokyo and also meet their son Keiso at Osaka en route. They call on their son, an established doctor in the neighborhood and then on their daughter, a hairdresser. While the couple are treated well indoors, their children have no free time to spare with their parents-to take them to places of tourist attraction. They are finally taken on a tour of the city by their widowed daughter-in-law, who is the kindest among their hosts in Tokyo. Their daughter and son-in-law send them on a tour to Atima with all expenses paid. They enjoy their tour but after they cut short their tour and are back at their daughter's place do they realize the motive of their daughter in sending them away. The man gets drunk with his old pals while his wife takes shelter at their daughter-in-law's place. They leave Tokyo the next morning. They are forced to get off the train at Osaka with the woman falling ill. They rest there for a day and make it back home. Their children receive telegrams from Onomichi saying the woman is dying. The children take the express train and watch the woman pass away. After the rituals, the children quickly jump into dividing their mother's belongings. The helpless father thanks them for sparing their valuable time to come down to Onomichi. The man later confesses to his daughter-in-law that she was more caring and loving than their blood relatives.While Japanese films are synonymous to Akira Kurosawa, Yasujiro Ozu made a masterpiece that still hasn't received the rave reviews it deserves. The movie portrays the plight of the aging parents who had burnt the candle at both ends to provide their wards with education and a comfortable life, how children get busy with their work schedule and their respective families that they have no time to spare for the ones responsible for the luxuries they now enjoy- parents, who are left alone till their time comes to an end. A film that leaves a deep impact on anyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>About things said and unsaid and everything in between - a story about life itself</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yasujiro Ozu's Tokyo Story is a very simple narration where nothing really spectacular happens that couldn't happen in anyone else's life. What takes place in the film is just life itself. It's about the not uncommon difficulties of generations that have to deal with each other, where natural gaps arise after the children have moved away from their parents and each family member is living a different life now - all things we might have experienced ourselves in a similar fashion from the one or the other side, or even from both. Everybody tries his/her best in their own kind of way when it comes to a visit. One means well, stays polite, but the lives the family members lead are their own now. While the parents don't want to impose on their children, the children are fine when their parents are on their way again so that things take their regular course to which they are used to. But in between many things are left unsaid. "Tokyo Story" shows us in its realistic depiction of a Japanese family that only when something major happens which stirs the daily routines and challenges our outlook we become aware of what's important and where our allegiances really lie.Ozu's unobtrusive direction is what makes this film so touching and powerful. He stays true to life and just shows us what's happening, doesn't judge, and typical of Ozu decides to refrain from camera movements altogether throughout the film which strengthens the impression that this is just how things happen out there. "Tokyo Story" is a quiet and contemplative work and the actors seem to be taken right from reality. That's why this simple story has such an impact and ranks as one of the greatest - it hits close to home, where it resonates deeply.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ozu's best film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of my favorite films from Ozu, and it probably deserves to be on the top of my favorite Japanese film list. This is, in my opinion, one of his most accessible efforts, although you have to be at least used to Japanese or classic cinema in order to fully appreciate it, otherwise it is more likely that you'll find yourself not caring much about what's happening, on account of Ozu's pacing style. Without any doubt, this film has to be one of Ozu's most complete works, it contains every single technique and theme he's widely recognized for. I also find the music sounding throughout some parts of the film really beautiful and catchy, which doesn't mean I'm giving less praise to other tunes in many of his other films (they are individually amazing), but this has just been the one I find more fitting concerning the story, and definitely the one I've most liked as well. The acting is at its finest, everyone fits their roll perfectly (it was hilarious watching Chishu Ryu impersonating a drunk and somewhat disappointed father). To conclude this review, I know I might probably not be adding anything relevant or new to this film (I'm aware there are more extensive and better explained reviews here), but I just wanted to make one for such a riveting and fascinating movie that's deserving of all the praise it gets. My score: 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tokyo Story is one of the classics of world cinema. It also shows a master director at the peak of his talents. It tells the story of a couple who travel to Tokyo to visit their grown children, but find their children are too absorbed in their own lives to spend much time with their parents.The film is a poignant domestic drama that recounts a heart-breaking domestic family rift. Director Yasujiro Ozu may be making a point about a self-regarding younger generation, and about urban life too hectic for old-fashioned family loyalties to survive. This is a quiet, subtle, tenderly observed masterpiece. Tokyo Story has twice appeared in Sight &amp; Sound magazine's 'Top Ten' list of the greatest films ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Life is disappointing, but not this movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film tells the story of aged parents visiting their children in Tokyo and depicts the treatment they receive from them on the visit. The beauty of the movie lies in its simplicity, be it the story itself or the storytelling style of the legendary Ozu, or the acting by the cast members who all draws a very thin line between acting/ reality and most of the time their performance are on the side of reality. It is very easy here to see the treatment of the children as they grow old towards their aging parents, yet barring few scenes we don't see children as villains but rather persons with their own family, work, and life in big city and very less time to take care of their parents. Few scenes towards the end actually clears all the air of confusion in our mind in taking children as villain and we all get to know their traits and there's nothing but hate left in us for them. Throughout the movie we also see the fine daughter-in law of these old couple and what a Good Samaritan she is treating her in laws as her own parents even after the death of her husband. Direction by Ozu is brilliant and I instantly became fan and just waiting for the opportunity to explore some other movies of this master of cinema. Overall, I would say this is one of the simplest yet powerful and best pictures of all time. The movie though more than half century old still owns significance in present time. A must see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tokyo Story The only other Ozu movie I have seen is The Story of Floating Weeds (the silent era one), and I didn't like it very much. I ended up blind-buying the Criterion Tokyo Story from my work because it had just been sold back used and with my employee discount it came to $15 (Le Cercle Rouge was also sold back, also $15). I didn't know if I'd like it but if I didn't I knew a LOT of people who would be willing to pay me the fifteen dollars I spent to get their hands on it, so it was all good.However, that will be unnecessary. I ended up loving just about every minute of it. I don't know quite what was different about Ozu's style this time around as opposed to Story of Floating Weeds, but I think it has something to do with it being sound-era and not having all those intertitles disrupting everything. Story of Floating Weeds was rather dialog-heavy for a silent era film, and it seems that Ozu's particular style is pretty much dialog heavy anyway, so he just works better in the sound era. That said, half the time I forgot the dialog seconds after reading it but never felt like I needed it. Even though this movie is basically people sitting around talking for two hours and fifteen minutes (with a death put in for good effect), it was a very pleasant visual experience.The whole low-angle static camera approach worked better than I ever thought possible, being a Western film student and all. I was sitting on the floor eating while I was watching it, and the angle with the television was spot on with the angles in the film, so I felt like I was either sitting around watching all of this unfold or was a little kid again watching it unfold. The best part was that I've already read all that stuff about Ozu and family, and he gets it spot on. I felt like I was at another one of my family's reunions, where everyone's happy to see each other and all but different levels of business and energy just eventually tire everyone out.Also, Ozu's quiet, methodical approach to building a quiet, almost listless world is very peaceful and alluring. With only two shots in the entire film with a moving camera, everything felt wonderfully zen (though I wouldn't label Ozu a Buddhist. His importance of family motif is a bit too worldly for Buddhists). A definite "beingness" pronounced the film and helped it be more than just a slide show of a family reunion.--PolarisDiB</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tokyo Story contains more passion, frustration, and anger than the vast majority of the mainstream films that are described as masterpieces of recent times.( you only have to look at recent Oscar lists to know what films i'm talking about) Its portrayal of a post war Japan is not only one of the most powerful and true descriptions of the family struggle and conflicting emotions brought on by a changing social pattern, but Ozu's profound use of camera and his ability to create so much with so little showcase some of the films best attributes. I recommend this film to any one with a passion for film and who wishes to experience one of japans greatest directors.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought TOKYO STORY was OK but nothing to write home about. It was not that great. Besides lacking character development, I just felt this film needed a plot! It just didn't seem to go anywhere until the parents left Tokyo. And even then it didn't seem like much of a climax.I really don't understand what is so great about TOKYO STORY. IMO Ozu made much better films. My personal favorite is THE ONLY SON with THERE WAS A FATHER a close second. Those films had two-dimensional characters. Those films had a plot. Those films had a theme. I mean, that scene in THE ONLY SON where the mother told her son that she had to sell her house to pay for his education was incredible. That whole scene was incredible with the son explaining to his mother how hard it was to find a decent job in Tokyo. So, yes, Ozu made some great films but IMO TOKYO STORY is not one of them. IMO the greatest Japanese films are THE ONLY SON, IKIRU, RAN, TAMPOPO, THE EEL, THE TWILIGHT SAMURAI, STILL WALKING, NOBODY KNOWS.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Somehow Not The Best Film Of All-Time One Is Often Led To Believe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Labelling something 'the best ever' or even a more moderated 'one of the best...' is surely asking for trouble? But in the case of TOKYO STORY it would be difficult to imagine the film causing any kind of trouble at all as this very measured, courteous movie is such an inoffensive and charming offering. However it's not, in my view, anything remotely like 'the best ever'. It's a nice little film, in it's way, but I do wonder why on earth it has developed such a huge reputation? It's sad, it's endearing, it's sometimes rather beautiful and it's melancholic almost throughout, but it's also very predictable;nothing remotely unexpected happens, one can see things being flagged up well in advance. It's very slow and made in a very tightly confined way which hasn't really influenced subsequent movies half as much as some people would like to think.So what makes it considered "one of the best"? It's not the story which is spare and not very entertaining in itself,although the character development is good. We do get to know the people involved even if many a motive seems to remain mysterious at the end. It's not the camera work which is rigidly static, creating the impression of interlinked paintings through which the protagonists wander, rather carefully. The familiar Ozu stylisations; the low set camera, the unfamiliar looks almost straight-to-camera when speaking, make it a slightly unsettling film to watch initially, although one soon becomes used to them. Perhaps it's the location work, which is appealing,in a reserved and understated way? Japan in the mid 50s seems far more exotic and unfamiliar than it would today , but that's true of almost any developed country. Twenty first century England no longer resembles the country depicted in Ealing Comedies of the same era. And the acting is a conundrum. Cultural differences in speech patterns and body language make it hard to compare what we see here with what we are familiar with in the western world. Certainly the father-figure seems to move and speak in such a painfully slow and deliberate way (except when drunk!) that one really begins to wonder how naturalistic his acting is. Are we seeing something comparable to Brando's 'method' or to Olivier's Shakespearian style? I think one needs to be very familiar with Japanese language and culture to fully understand and appreciate that aspect. He's a nice old boy but he might well be a terrible actor. It's certainly not the music that makes this film special as it's neither evocative nor memorable, so I'm at a loss. CITIZEN KANE, which often shares this most elevated of critical pedestals with TOKYO STORY, clearly has cast a muchlonger shadow over the development of cinema and while it's chock-full of innovative moments and methods TOKYO STORY seems rather a stylistic cul- de-sac from which one can find very little in subsequent movies. It's not a bad movie, but it is one which I'd fine it hard to sit through a second time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tokyo Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Tokyo Story" is an incredibly poignant film by Yasujiro Ozu about grandparents tonwards the end of their lives that visit their children.The children, however, while trying to be respectful, simply don't have time for them (or don't want to have time for them) and therefore the grandparents seem to be a burden to them. Shige even seems to dislike them, and insults them on certain occasions, but not in an over the top way, but rather a pretend playful way. Many of the shots are in frames within frames and I think this is to emphasize the different worlds that each generation inhabits, and how they are separated by age. It is also composed of mostly low angle shots and seemingly 2 dimensional compositions. There are many poignant moments in the film regarding time and age, all ending with a sadly realistic but silent ending. The first is when the grandmother, Tomi, is with the youngest grandchild outside. The child has his back to the grandmother while she asks him what he wants to be when he grows up. He doesn't respond, but she thinks about it anyway. Then she states that she might be dead when he is grown up, and she follows him as if to try and reach back into her youth.The grandparents are sent to a spa at one point by their children, but the spa ends up being too lively for them. This shows that maybe they are getting too old for the world, and their time has passed. This is the first time they are visiting Tokyo, but at this point they may be too old. When Shukishi, the grandfather, gets back together with his friends that he used to drink with (apparently too much), we get the feeling that it isn't like it used to be. It's a much more depressing time. One of his friends expresses his disappointment towards his sons low position in work, and his regret for raising him the way he did. He also mentions that losing a child is hard, but now living with them can be just as hard. Shukishi feels similarly toward his son who is simply a neighborhood doctor, but he says that times change, and you can't expect too much for your children. His other friend has lost all of his children. He doesn't say a word throughout the whole conversation other than mumbling drunkenly. Tomi stays with Noriko, her daughter in law who was married to the son that died. Tomi isn't related through blood, but does more for them than any of their real children. Tomi is desperate for her to get remarried, since at this point she knows how lonely she will feel without a husband on her older age.When Shukishi and Tomi reunite, Tomi gets sick on the train, and before they know it, she is in critical condition. She dies soon after, but it's important to remember the fact that Ozu never gives in to the usual sentimentality films usually resort to in order to make you feel something. It has an ear for the usual happenings of life and the silence in between the dialogue, as well as the small talk we resort to so we don't have to open up about our doubts and fears and hopes and regrets.They visited one of their grandchildren, Keizo, before she went into critical condition, and it shows him joking that he must be a good grandchild to them because you can't be a good grandchild to them while they are in the grave. But despite him first considering the encounter as a nuisance, once he finds out Tomi is dead, he can't bear the idea that she will just be lost in the sea of graves that he sees before him. He admits he wished he spent more time with her. He simply didn't realize how fragile her life was. Shukishi stays away from his children when he hears about the death of his wife, but doesn't cry. He is simply empty. He gives Noriko his wife's watch as she was their only true child through all of this. She thinks she doesn't deserve it because sometimes she "goes for days on end not thinking about him (her ex wife and their dead son)", but this isn't about him. It's about her, and her kindness. For the first time since her husband she feels loved, and she ends up with the happiest of the endings. Shukishi then goes home and sits. Alone. Probably for the rest of his life. Sadly, it's also implied that they didn't get along for much of their marriage, so it wasn't that loving to begin with. And if we don't end up at that point eventually in our lives, then we will probably be dead. That's the sad truth of life and probably the true ending after Norikos happy ending. Children grow away form their parents, and parents grow old."Isn't life disappointing?" Kyoko asks. "Yes, it is" Noriko responds, smilingly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thoroughly felt moved by Tokyo Story. Ozu's camera felt like I was looking in to a real life family with real life ordeals. The drama centers on the relationships of parents and adult children in a way that is both touching and still relevant. How does one go about aging gracefully? And how do children respond to aging parents? Certainly the way it is handled here is leaning on the malicious and greedy side. There's a sense of yearning for this alien presence (the parents) to be gone and to not be dealt with. It seems like such a burden and a chore to care for elders. And yet there's the silver lining of a widowed daughter-in-law (daughter-in-law!) to save the trip from complete disaster. The ending of a mother passing lingers with you. Even then there's bickering over trifling possessions that the deceased had owned. I felt angry, but also know people in my life who hold no respect for even the dead. The movie ends with Shukishi meditating. I was left to ponder how he must feel knowing that he will be left all alone and also be treated in the same way. I felt sad and bitter, but know also people such as Noriko exist and could bring lightness into the film.</fullReview>

But what I especially love about this film is that it presents this theme in a subtle but not too obvious way and yet the emotions that the film tries to get across is like a ton of bricks coming down on the viewer in the context of making it uncomfortable viewing as you sympathize dearly with the parents. A quote in the movie that emphasizes by point exactly as is where one of the parents states: "Isn't life depressing?", that for me really summed up the film for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When you finish seeing this movie, I would like to have come to meet a family very much. When a child separated from parents, and I would get married and I married into other family, I thought what kind of thing I would consider. It was thought that it was a humane movie. The problem of marriage and death is faced also at what home. It was the feeling which is looking at its future.I thought that the scene by which the old couple came for play to Tokyo wanted to be very impressive, and to become an old couple for whom I also regard a partner as important and support. The scene which the stubborn father opened the heart and carried out the cotton of the clock of a wife's keepsake and Shukichi introduces Kyoko shyly felt for its familiar thing, so entered into the talk all the time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Family Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An elderly Japanese couple who live with their youngest daughter in a small town far from Tokyo decides to travel to the capital to visit their children and grandchildren who live there and they haven't seen for some years. This visit reveals several aspects of human relations within the family from the good sentimental ones to some displays of indifference, selfishness and self-indulgence. Several moving scenes and dialogues ensue in the typical Japanese social atmosphere of delicacy, politeness and courtesy very well depicted. Although there are not particularly dramatic scenes the atmosphere is realistic enough in psychological terms to allow us to be aware of the real feelings of the characters with great depth. And the story has also to do with such deep themes as life and death, young age and old age and the generation disparities It's a very humane, moving and even pathetic movie indeed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I cannot think that this film is about Japanese but foreigners, because all characters are bit different from current people in Japan although this film was made in the old days. For example, such a big family is decreasing in a big city and family relationship changed significantly from those years. However, the theme which is treated in this film is not out of the date. I think that it is a universal theme for every person. In spite of this film doesn't have any action scene, but tranquil scenes and quiet conversations attracted me. Its atmosphere makes me feel good, because it reminds me nostalgic things although I didn't experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best Japanese Films Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An old couple visit their children and grandchildren in the city; but the children have little time for them.Like all of Ozu's sound films, "Tokyo Story" has a pacing that is slow, yet has a rhythm which made Ozu's film a popular entertainment in Japan. Important events are often not shown on screen, only being revealed later through dialogue. For example, the train journeys to and from Tokyo are not depicted. A distinctive camera style is used, in which the camera height is low and almost never moves; film critic Roger Ebert notes that the camera moves once in the film, which is "more than usual" for an Ozu film.This is a very beautiful film, and the title is perfect, as it captures the city of Tokyo in all its 1950s beauty. From the point of view of Americans, this is especially fascinating, as it is less than a decade after Japan was our primary target. Look at all the beauty we could have destroyed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ozu's poetic masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Tokyo Story" is one of Ozu's poetic masterpieces. It is the story of a journey - of an older couple visiting their relatives in the bustling metropolis of Tokyo in the 1950s, the journey of the coming of age, and finally, the journey of life itself. With his touching images, Ozu manages to capture the spirit of a simple Japanese family's household but also the unsaid conflict and tension that can never really evacuate because of a cultural taboo. "Tokyo Story" is a wonderful narrative which contrasts tradition and modernity and the abrupt changes life brings. The perspective of the film shots is remarkable, as we can see the actors sitting or lying on the floor most of the time - this approach allows the viewer greater access to the more intimate spheres of a Japanese house while the dialogs reveal strong emotions. The film, despite its very modest storyline, will not leave anybody untouched because the impressions in it are very intense and unique.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An expertly crafted, passionate and melancholic meditation on the culture and life, in and around the great city of Tokyo. Some may call Tokyo Story mundane and tedious in its reality, but the truth is that Yasujirô Ozu's direction and screenplay are works of silent genius - evoking a strong sense of reality, and a strange reminiscence for a life other than your own. The cinematography is bound deeply by its immersion, and ability to create an environment and atmosphere. The score is correctly sparse, when used adding a powerful emotional urgency to the film, when not used, the sound design is penetrates the mind, and makes the film feel alive and beating.Overall, you should see this film because it transcends the subtitles and speaks to us directly, the subjects of life, about life itself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Isn't life disappointing?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Tokyo Story" tells a tale as simple and universal as life itself. It is about a few ordinary days in the lives of some ordinary people, and then about the unanticipated death of one of them. What it tells us about the nature of life or death is not new or original ? what could be? ? but it is true.It doesn't want to force our emotions, but to share its understanding. It does this so well that I am near tears in the last 30 minutes. It ennobles the cinema. It says, yes, a movie can help us make small steps against our imperfections.It was made 60 years ago in Japan, and it is about our families, our natures, our flaws and our clumsy search for love and meaning. It isn't that our lives keep us too busy for our families. It's that we have arranged them to protect us from having to deal with big questions of love, work and death. We escape into truisms, small talk and distractions. Given the opportunity at a family gathering to share our hopes and disappointments, we talk about the weather and watch TV.The film's director Ozu is not only a great director but a great teacher, and after you know his films, a friend. With no other director do I feel affection for every single shot. Every single shot is intended to have a perfect composition of its own, even if that means there are continuity errors. All the shots are framed in some way. In the foreground of the interior shots, perhaps tucked in a corner.If there is movement in an Ozu film, it comes from nature or people, not from the camera. He often shows a room before people enter, and lingers a second after they leave. If characters go upstairs, they are absent precisely long enough to actually do that. If a character is speaking, he shows the entire speech. No cutaways, no listening shots, no overlapping dialogue. He is comfortable with silences.There are scenes that will be hard to forget: The mother and father separately thanking the daughter-in-law for her kindness; the father's laborious drunken odyssey through a night of barroom nostalgia; and his reaction when he learns that his wife will probably die."Tokyo Story" moves quite slowly by our Western standards, and requires more patience at first than some moviegoers may be willing to supply. Its effect is cumulative, however; the pace comes to seem perfectly suited to the material.</fullReview>

The theme is very interesting, very different from what we've seen in western theaters : in the US and Europe, the movie shows a personal and individualist point of view(that's my opinion) whereas here, even though you empathize with the old couple, you never feel that "Tokyo Story" tells their story, but actually one facing every human being(and this would be about loneliness).The actors are great, every word coming out of their mouth is like a treasure(as it is showing a lot of an era, of a country, of a language, of cultural codes - count of many times Miss Hirayima says to her husband : So desu ka and So desu ne), and the range of emotions they make you feel is quite wide.

Music makes its entrance at key moments, adding more emotional punch and the performances by the entire cast is very honest &amp; carried out with much politeness.On an overall scale, Tokyo Story is mainly about the growing distance between parents &amp; children that subtly portrays the indifference, selfishness &amp; ingratitude of the younger generation who consider the very people who sacrificed so much to nourish them into responsible human beings as a burden, and over the years with every passing generation, its universal theme keeps getting more n more resonant &amp; will continue to do so for a very long time.</fullReview>

It does this so well that I was near tears in the last 30 minutes. There is two journey on "Tokyo"; one which parents come to their children and another where their children come to them. The similarity between these two journey is hopefulness, which by doing so, turns into chilling. The old couple hope to being greeted, but except by Noriko they get evaded. in second journey the children -although superficially- hope that their mother being OK, however all of them -again except Noriko- think about and get ready for her death. I vividly feel the loneliness of Shukichi and Noriko on that great scene where Noriko insists on her selfishness; an innocent confession mixing up with a painful grief.

		<shortDescription>How do you find each other after the night?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The usual write-ups about Ozu focus on aesthetics and thematizing, let's try here to find the transcendent flow where these things, themes and aesthetics, are unified in the transitory experience of watching.Ozu sets an unmoving eye, this has been a frequent trope since his time, elaborated in many directions. With Ozu however the idea is simple in its original Buddhist context, capture life without passions, not letting us stray in whirls but creating instead, in the canvas, duration and time. He had already mastered this, more so in other films than here. The mastery is not that the camera occupies a certain position or frames a certain geometry, it is not an aesthetic quality. The most evocative Ozu shots for me are shots of a bar sign against the sky or blinds against a window, the shots are kept just long enough for the blinds to flutter once or the trees in the back of the sign to ripple by a wind. It's a transcendent quality that aims to introduce a span of time. Hollywood was the opposite of this, crisp shots that only allow time and room for narrative motion, never stillness.So he unspools time as a way of creating a canvas for the larger project to play out. In previous films of his mature period this was threaded around marriage, but made to register in a more cosmic way, a farewell from one existence to the next, the larger project being transitions in life. Here he pursues the natural conclusion, mortality.The story is about aging parents who visit their grown kids and grandkids in Tokyo, only to find no one really has time to spare, they're all busy in their narratives, one a neighborhood doctor, the daughter a hairdresser. Ozu tries to maintain an ambivalent stance: the kids are not unhappy to see them, nor very excited at the prospect of having to change their schedules, there is a weariness that hovers around that is not strictly unkindness. The film is set-up so that we live through the transition, so that we're going to finally travel from Tokyo to the village home of childhood for the last night together. Time is unspooled as a tool for realization. This is a simple one, loved ones should not be taken for granted, which has led some people to dismiss the film as empty. Not so. The parents' narrative is one between soulmates who have chiseled out all the emotional excess, the whys and why nots, assured in mutual presence, and there's no better happiness to ask for, no deeper art to cultivate than a shared life.The issue for me is that we're called to live through a transition means we have to shed story as we travel, it's an early appearance of the Cassavetes effect. It's so the aimlessness will be understood in retrospect as pregnant meaning. (this is were themes and aesthetics disappear into one fabric again that is our own transitory watching, if either sticks out you don't inhabit a life)Ozu's idea for shedding story is unconnected asides, here for instance the father's drinking spree with old buddies. It must have been tremendously inspiring at the time, I can't imagine Cassavetes conceiving his cinema without studying this, but I do miss here his visual concentration, his lack of pointing out the understanding. Ozu is once again held back by the need to clarify, to separate the ambiguities.So, quaint now, but you should have this in your life at some point, not because it's on a list of greats or for any moral. It's all in the worldview that is not above suffering nor bogged down by it, melancholy that is not without joy, time without the burden, bonding without attachment.When necessity parts them for one night in Tokyo, there's only the anxiety of not being able to find each other again. Lovely.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why did it take so long for me to see this film? I don't know why that is, other than being behind with my movie watching due to studying, and I am still kicking myself because Tokyo Story was one of the best films I've seen in quite some time. I haven't seen enough of Yasujiro Ozu's work to judge him as an overall director, but seeing Tokyo Story it is very easy to see why anybody would consider it one of his finest achievements or him as a master film-maker. Tokyo Story is beautifully shot, everything looks homely and evocative and the shots, frame and cinematography are done to perfection. And Ozu directs very sensitively and assuredly, it is said that he specialised in middle-class family melodramas and I have no trouble believing that. The story is quiet and meditatively paced but never bored me, because every bit of writing, family scene and character was dealt with in such a poignant and intelligent manner. Tokyo Story is also helped by some truly wonderful acting. Setsuko Hara just epitomises gentle kindness, making us warm to Noriko easily, while Chishu Ryu and Chieko Higashiyama play their roles with nuanced and affecting dignity. In conclusion, a beautiful and deeply moving film in all respects. 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die is the book I found out about this Japanese film that was obviously acclaimed by critics and so forth, so naturally I was very interested to see it as soon as possible, from director Yasujirô Ozu (An Autumn Afternoon). Basically in the small coastal village of Onomichi, Japan, live elderly couple Shukishi (An Autumn Afternoon's Chish? Ry?) and Tomi Hirayama (Chieko Higashiyama) with their young schoolteacher daughter Kyôko (Kyôko Kagawa), their other grown up children are in various places in Tokyo or Osaka. The couple make the decision to travel to Tokyo for an extended visit to see these other adult children and their families: eldest son and paediatrician Koichi Hirayama (Sô Yamamura) and his two sons, eldest daughter and beautician Shige Kaneko (Haruko Sugimura) who runs a hairdressing salon, and they see their other son Keizo Hirayama (Shirô Osaka) with an unexpected stop in Osaka. As each of their children have Shukishi and Tomi hang around they try to adjust and cope with their visits, they are treating them with hardly any care, respect or want for them to be seeing them. They even try to stop spending time with them by trying to send them the inexpensive Atami Hot Springs resort, only daughter-in-law Noriko Hirayama (Setsuko Hara), who was made a widow when her husband Shoji killed eight years ago in the war, is making any effort and treating them nicely during their trip. As Shukishi and Tomi realise that their grown up children are not very fond of having them around, each of their offspring are realising the effects of their actions, and it may be too late to make up for their general behaviour both from the past and during the trip time, especially when Tomi dies, and Shukishi has to try to connect with them after the loss. Also starring Kuniko Miyake as Fumiko Hirayama ? Koichi's wife. The performances are all fine, especially by the older two leading stars and by the actress playing the sweet daughter-in-law, it is a simple story about family who do not connect as well as they should, I will confess it was a little hard to follow what was going while having the read the subtitles as well, but what I gathered made a watchable drama. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly Timeless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Considered a cinematic masterpiece, late director Yasujiro Ozu's "Tokyo Story" is a deeply affecting tale of an aging couple's visit to see their four children.In black and white and with a usually motionless camera, Ozu followed an unforgettable holiday of father and mother Shukishi and (Chishu Ryu) and Tomi Hirayama (Chieko Higashiyama) from the seaside to the city."It's like a dream being in Tokyo," says Tomi, having arrived by train; one which quickly becomes a nightmare.The partners' children become frustrated with having to entertain. Their eldest daughter Shige is particularly disdainful (Haruko Sugimura) ? a testament to the actress' portrayal of the character ? and tries shipping them off to a resort, encourages her brother to buy them cheaper food and uses her widowed sister-in-law Noriko (Setsuko Hara) as a local tour guide.The dignified, timid and unassuming Hirayama seniors never vocalize their pain, but events often result in their heads simultaneously pointing south as they realize their children have become utterly egocentric. It takes 122 minutes until a family member uses the word 'selfish'.Noriko, however, is a doting daughter-in-law; they share a gentle bond over their lost husband and son. Contrast, instead of overpowering dialogue and drama, is the main storytelling tool.Themes of regret, bereavement, friendship and family are explored slowly, but never painfully so, in this gripping journey. Sixty years have passed since this film was made. Its meaning is timeless.Find all of our film and festival coverage, as well as our events and education at www.DohaFilmInstitute.com.

		<fullReview>Just watched Tokyo Story. This was my first film by Yazujiro Ozu. I got captured like after the first 20 minutes. I've been putting it off because of the length and the plot, but I really loved it. It's not visually beautiful, because there are almost no camera moves, but it did fit in the simpleness of the film, but damn, story-wise, it was incredible! It looks like some people were bothered by the acting, but I thought it was fantastic and also natural IMO. The characters were amazing, and I just wanted to knock some sense into the adult children (whose names I've forgotten), because here we have a couple who're going to visit their children who they haven't seen for a long time, but the children don't have much time for them, so their daughter in-law has to be the kind one. One of the themes in the film, that I really loved were selfishness and also ingratitude. There was one scene that made me realize how very thankful I am to have fantastic parents and made me love them even more, and I hope I won't make the same mistake as the children, because we don't have our parents forever.There are many forms for art. What I love about art is that it's subjective and can touch people in many different ways. Tokyo Story, is what I call simple but beautiful art.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An elderly couple visit their children and grandchildren in Tokyo and find that they are not as welcome as they hoped.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are different reasons films become classics. Some because their imagery is burned into the memory's eye indelibly, others because the characters are unforgettable, still others because they blazed a new trail in the art form. Tokyo Story claims its distinction among lovers of world cinema largely due to its quietly revolutionary social material, as well as some indelible images: the view of the hill with the little figures of the grandmother and her grandson playing for example, like an animated version of one of those classic tiny bamboo sculptures encased in glass. To name only one beautifully framed shot. At the time it was made, 1953, to depict wilful and disrespectful behaviour by the grandchildren as shown here would have been shocking to traditional viewers. Likewise, the indifference bordering on disrespect shown by the old couple's children. Ever so gradually the carefully cultivated mask of social ritual is stripped away to reveal that even the dutiful daughter-in-law admits to being more selfish than she appears. The intense difficulty of family members having any real connection at all with each other is deeply driven home. And the irony that a non-blood relative is actually the one who cares most for the old folks. This, combined with the choice of a storyline that deliberately avoided heroic or mythic overtones as might have been expected in Japanese cinema at the time, accounts for the social impact this film would have made in 1953. (Keep in mind that Kirosawa's early masterpiece The Seven Samurai was released just the next year, sustaining the mythic-heroic tradition of Japanese literature on film.) The breakneck speed at which films are now made provides a glaring contrast to this nearly 60-year-old film, whose rhythm is placidly riverine. Yet even to someone like myself with an appreciation for foreign films, the pace occasionally drags. If anything, Tokyo Story is an anti- heroic film. Still, it's a reminder that current film entertainment?with the exception of films like Terence Malick's Tree of Life?allows the viewer no time whatsoever to meditate on deeper themes. Tokyo Story reminds us that films can be long prayers rather than a constant concussion of thunderclaps. It confronts the most basic issues that confront us all: family and mortality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>On soul bonds</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This sublime beautiful movie is about feelings and emotions, not about story or action. Its emotional palette is sad and tender. Old parents from a distant province go for the first time to visit their grown-up children in Tokyo and Osaka, hoping to see them in "full glory" of adulthood achievements. They get disappointed by the "modest", busy lives of their off springs with little time and patience for old folks. Children are already fully separated from their parents emotionally and handle the visit like inescapable and rather annoying obligation to do something "nice". The only person who is really glad to see them is their daughter-in-law, caught in her own internal torturing fantasy of "staying faithful" to the long-dead husband. No bond is forever, neither parents/children nor husband/wife? Any bond eventually gets torn down, it should be torn ? this is the wisdom of life? But who of us never kept holding to the relation, existing only in our heart? The karmic attachment to the past makes the parents and the young widow extremely vulnerable and causes them lots of emotional pain, which they endure quietly with great dignity, supporting each other with soul-felt love, care and understanding. This movie is made of the very fabric of human life. Absence of any judgment and genuine kindness give it an uplifting rather than depressing mood. We watch, resonate, accept and thank Ozu and his wonderful cast for the truly compassionate and delicate insight into the sorrows of a human soul.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have only seen 3 movies by Yasujirô Ozu yet, but he is already one of my favorite directors. His films are as anti-Hollywood as you can go.Instead of telling "Greatest Story Ever Told", Ozu tells the "Simplest Story Ever Told". Background score is scarcely used and the camera is barely moved but the resultant product is still beyond comparison.Ozu's movies revolve around families, their interactions, their habits, their manners and their quirks. This movie centers around an old couple who in their twilight decide to visit their brood. Though their grown up children who are themselves very busy are not able to give them much attention, the parent don't make any dramatic statements. They just praise the daughter-in-law who did spend some time with them and is most affectionate. Part of the reason is that they are too polite ,another part it that they are subconsciously convincing themselves that things are not that bad and also they understand that the children have their own busy lives to lead.I know it sounds like more of a soap opera than a movie, but this is more touching and realistic than the best of Hollywood movies and without employing any sappy music or sappy dialog.I really loved all the performances, but Setsuko Hara has done an amazing job. I look forward to watching all her movies with Ozu.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Only a handful of other movies over a century of movie-making have achieved anything like the perfection of Ozu's "Tokyo Story." The parents are products of a time and place and culture so different from mine, yet I instantly felt a kinship, instantly saw myself and my wife after our many years of marriage, the children grown, not everything in life turning out the way we had hoped, yet the persistence of bonds that are more than just the habits of years.Life is ultimately disappointing, as the two women agree toward the close of the film. People grow old, people get sick, children drift away, times change and eventually we no longer keep up, war and other calamities upend our lives and bring heartbreak and loss. Disappointing? Of course.But then there is Noriko, the daughter in law--sweet and lovely and kind. There is the great heart and gentle nature of the mother. There is the ultimately strong feeling of the father for his wife (conveyed in a beautifully restrained performance). There are children--some of them downright unlikeable--who populate the background of this film and serve as a reminder of life continuing. They too will have their disappointment, but still.... Hope simply won't go away.Ozu shows it all without moralizing, without flourishes or crescendos, without attempting to make some "point" that helps us to make sense of it all. He presents his characters non-judgmentally, with real characteristics that make them understandable.It is Ozu's rich humanism that makes the film so sad. It is a story that for all of its quietness, has the power of great tragedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Genius in its simplicity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tokyo Story is not Tokyo's story. It is the story of ageing, old age and letting go. The director's genius is in how he uses the media of film to narrate life, without diluting or manipulating it. Life is depicted as is. The movie has a slow start and the first half an hour goes by without really making much of an impression. It shows daily life ? chop wood, fetch water ? an old couple visiting their children in big city. Everyone has busy lives, though of course, busy is how one chooses to be. Time goes where one wants it go. At the surface, the grown-up children are concerned, but it remains at the surface. There's contrasting dialog where one person says "you can serve your parents only till the grave" and another says "children have their own needs". There's really no wrong or right. Its what is. For the mother, getting the chance to sleep in the bed of her long assumed-dead son was bigger than being shown around Tokyo city. Priorities are different and keep changing. Life has a unique way of tying different threads together. Sometime, they are left untied. There's comment on how clothes take centerstage instead of the lived/shared experience. Sense of consumption and objectifying life takes away from the deeper connection and being with the experience of living life. The daughter-in-law inherits the goodwill, while the daughter takes the goods. The movie reflects on the isolation and increasing loneliness of ageing. It ends with a sense of loss, stillness and depth ? all signifying old age.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Alienation and the Family</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SYNOPSIS: An aging husband and wife visit their children in 1950s Tokyo. While all are well meaning and polite, the years and the miles between them have taken them all on different paths and they struggle to come to terms with their memories and their expectations.CONCEPT IN RELATION TO THE VIEWER: Intimacy and how things change. A character study of the the differences between generations, their expectations (both young and old) and how the modern world has fractured the extended family.PROS AND CONS: This is a slice of life / contemplation film as opposed to the fantasy / escapism film genre that is marketed to the youth of today. While many newer films have choreographed violence and action as the mainstay of their cinema experience, this film is the opposite. While film is a 'visual' medium, it can be a subtle medium as well, without all the 'eye-candy' and special effects that are so prominent today.This film is long, over 2 hours, and it took me a while to get all the way through it. By the end of the film, I felt as though I was a part of this family and could sense their pain and grief . This film may not appeal to younger generations, but as we age, this type of cinema becomes more and more endearing to those of us that have experienced more than we allow ourselves to remember.There are some interesting oddities in the film that stem from the culture in which it was made. All the camera angles are very low, usually less than 3 feet from the floor. Since there were few chairs in 1950s Japan, most of the characters sit on the floor. This is their living space, hence the lower camera angle. Almost everyone in the film has a hand fan, which they are constantly fanning themselves with. In a time before air-conditioning, this was the only way to keep cool in the summer. There is almost no panning on scanning with the camera. Most of the scenes are done with a static camera location with minimal scene editing. Finally, there are a lot of 'lingering' scenes, in which actors leave the frame or exit a room, but the camera keeps rolling for up to 10 seconds before fading to the next scene or editing to a different location. This appears intentional, as though the director wants to let us linger on what has just transpired.In the end this is a film that makes you think. I love films that do that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Subtle Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At first, the premise and the beginning of this film seem to prepare you for a sad melodrama. This movie, in superbly subtle ways, takes you far from that. The story of the parents coming to visit their children in Tokyo and finding their children too busy and too put out to want to entertain them must have been a revelation for Japan moviegoers at the time. Nowadays, this movie cannot even be made, it would just garner shrugs. So, you have to watch this film knowing it takes place in the early 1950's, not yesterday. Although it has probably been commented on already, Setsuko Hara's portrayal of Noriko is amazing. She plays the daughter in law role perfectly. She has the perfect mixture of sweetness and awkwardness. You want to see her be happy, as she seems to be the only person who has time for the parents. You should buy the Criterion Collection version of this DVD, as it includes a documentary of the director. It is a purposely slow moving film. It is rightly considered a masterpiece, especially by film critics at the time. They should have the same opinion now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Death humbles us all...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From irony to despair, TOKYO STORY moves with a carefully measured pace. It takes place, for the most part, in "real time," moving (as does Life itself, from moment to moment) with a gradual inexorability toward The End. Death humbles us all. We're left only with reflections and regrets. Ozu's unflinching manner of movie-making can cause us to squirm uncomfortably in our seats. The old man, left alone in the end, gazing out at the world as it continues on despite his most profound loss, sums it up best when a neighbor stops to look in at him: "Living alone, a day lasts too long." The neighbor moves on, but the look on the old man's face, the trembling of his Adam's apple as he fights back the tears, speaks volumes. Slow fade to black.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still (moving)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An excellent movie about Generations (Old vs Young). Of course it's not simple as that, that is just the main theme of the movie. And you have a great movie about this generation gap and the conflicts lying within. And it all moves on quietly - even the camera is still most of the time, not moving but capturing everything that is happening from one angle, often even without cut-aways to close-ups or anything else.The acting is phenomenal, sublime and subtle as the overall tone of the movie. Of course if you're more into Bruckheimer movies and/or anything fast paced, then you'll probably be whining about the seemingly slow pace of this movie. But if you let yourself into the movie and it's pacing and the characters, you will love it. Or maybe even hate some of the characters for being who they are. But it's in the looks and between the lines, where most of this movie is happening. A true masterpiece!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What can film do for you?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some people say some films change the way they think about life. That has never happened to me. This film, however, did incite me to think about my life. It made me think about the relationship I have with my parents. It made me think about the relationship I have with my kids. It made me think about where those relationships will be in 20 years. One of the reasons this film is so great is that, like all great films, it touches on aspects of humanity we encounter everyday. And this film does it as well as any other. Ozu's direction is nearly perfect. Every aspect of the film is profoundly effective. I thought the cinematography was simple, yet intricate. The acting was superb. Every actor hit every note dead on. I especially found the parent's to be very compelling. The dialog was direct and very honest. So many times, we say one thing in order to not say the main thing. This film affected me more than most others I have seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An elderly couple from a small town visits its children in Tokyo but the children are too busy with their own lives to attend to their parents. A simple but moving drama about generation gaps and the rat race we are all caught in as we try to get ahead in the world. Although made more than 50 year ago in Japan, the themes explored are universal and timeless. There are fine performances from Riyu and Higashiyama as the elderly couple and Hara as their widowed daughter-in-law. Ozu's visual style is simple but elegant. His camera is usually static but he masterfully uses framing and editing for dramatic impact. The score is lovely.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Universal (old) human values</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many have been said by other writers here, so I just want to add some personal thought and experience. I think that there are always some aspects of recognition within our own personal circumstances "in" TM. Mine is the fact that my parental family lives separated life's in different countries. When I come "home" with my own family to visit my parents (it happens every 3 years or so) I recognize the situations in TM. ?We are just as close as family, but in some cases as far as acquaintances, too? Other universal things like egocentricity, discussions about money, how to organize things without hurting someone's feeling, match our own needs with customs, etc.. are the tools Ozu used to reach us, so simple but so effective.I don't agree with the notion that Ozu had not made a moralized, stereotypical message with TM: it is obvious that Ozu let us seen what he considered the greatest value in human quality, namely the will and the skill to take care of others, much more than ourself. Watch Kyoko and Noriko, the 2 Cinderella's, do their little "things" almost invisible in order to keep the family happening going smoothly. Although Ozu didn't "speak" directly for himself, I can feel his strong hidden message through the words of Tomi and Shukishi Hirayama. This is what I call the art of passing a value through a story.The most melodramatic and meditative moment come in at the end of the film when Noriko and Kyoko communicated the characteristics of life at such deep, simple and short manner (typical Japanese way). There is a kind of psychological climax despite of the most hearing comment about Ozu's "monochrome" way of telling stories by avoiding dramatic high and low ends, that is: trying to leave the audience creates their own drama's by providing the chances to do so.The film ended with a hopeful open end: Noriko and Kyoko will meet again in Tokyo (soon). Life goes on ? like the train which brings Noriko back to her own life in Tokyo, leaving Noriko spotting the train from her classroom window. The beautiful smile in Noriko's face is overwhelming and paradoxical at the same time, especially when she profoundly mentioned that life is full of disappointments.The only thing I still want to ask Ozu: why using a Western-looked actress to portray Noriko, which I consider to be the leading role ? Having said so, I realize that TM has no one leading role.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was only last week that i saw this film for the first time, and i instantly loved it. It perfectly sums up the feelings from post war Japan, and the loss of values the community had to deal with. Our sympathies are instantly placed with the older generation, who are symbolic of the traditional values, while we see the younger generation as selfish, and too busy to spend time with their parents. We have a backward view of change and progress not necessarilly being soOzu shot the film from a waist height viewpoint, which to the traditional Japanese viewer respresents the view of someone below eye level sitting on a mat. This was the pose of the onlooker, and this constantly reminds us that the film is under the gaze, and we should take note. Like traditional Japanese cinema the camera does not move. Panning is replaced by clever cutting, and the mis-en-scene is very artistic. Using the foreground and background very cleverly to show film as an art in its purest form.</fullReview>

Ozu's camera is set at the level of someone sitting on a tatami and remains stationary within each scene.

		<fullReview>Tokyo Story consistently ranks so high on lists of the all-time great films that anyone approaching it for the first time might expect something stiff, inaccessible or dull.But no: Tokyo is quite simply one of the most beautiful films ever to grace the screen. Full of stunning performances (particularly by Chishu Ryu as a man who must come to terms with a new life) and subtly moving but seemingly static shots, the film takes its time and ends up reducing its viewers to tears.The story is simple: an elderly couple journey to Tokyo for a few days and are treated with disregard by their children. This may seem to be the body of the film, but in fact, it's merely exposition for the stunning final half hour.Tokyo Story is about life itself and it comments on the human condition with an eloquence that will keep any willing viewer enthralled. Ozu may not share Kurosawa's flowing mise-en-scene or Mizoguchi's objective portrayal of human suffering, but he is, to my mind, the greatest of Japanese directors. And Tokyo Story is his masterpiece.</fullReview>

Parents and grandparents are always treat the grandson very well, and most of the time they become spoiled children.

The old couple encounter only coldness and inhospitality from their own 2 children, whereas the widow of their son, who was killed in the war, is the only one who shows them any kindness. After the visit, they return to the countryside whereupon the ageing mother dies, basically from a broken heart. Ozu's well-publicised feelings regarding the responsibilities and duties of the family unit are never more elegantly or graphically portrayed than in this, one of the true masterpieces of post-war cinema. In parts, the poignancy is simply overwhelming. It would take a heart of stone not to be moved by this picture. If ever there was a "must see", then this is it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Be kind to your parents while they are alive. Filial piety cannot reach beyond the grave." The story of this film is simple, much like the other Ozu film I've seen Good Morning, an old couple come to the city to visit their children and grandchildren. Their children are busy, and the old people upset their routines. As the old man remarks near the end of the film, the person who treats them best, their widowed daughter-in-law (portrayed by the mesmerizing Setsuko Hara in surely one of the greatest performances of all time) isn't even related to them by blood. Their grandchildren barely pay them any attention. There's a beautiful scene when the Grandmother and her youngest Grandchild, whom she has never met go for a walk. The child ignores his Grandmother's questions and runs around. In a quiet way, without anyone admitting it, the visit goes badly. There isn't much else to say, but the film is like an emotional atom bomb. The scene at the end where the old couple release all they have kept under the surface throughout the whole journey is magnificent. They express their disappointment in their children. They think their daughter isn't nice and are also surprised by their son's lowly job. In the end, they agree that their children are simply "better than average". The heartbreaking thing about this film is how well it expresses the disappointment of life and how life goes on, illustrated by the final shot of the rooftops of the town and a boat passing by on the water. Just brilliant, brilliant stuff.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An examination of family in a rapidly changing world</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tokyo Story is a film that is at once simple and complex. It's an intimate family drama, but it also has an epic quality. It appears larger than it is, and its story takes on a wider scope than is literally presented on screen. It's a film about family in the context of a rapidly changing society, the relationship between generations, and the bonds forged over lifetimes that hold people together. The story takes place in post-war Japan as an aging married couple decide to leave their small town to visit their adult children in Tokyo. Once they get there, their kids barely have time for them and struggle to keep them occupied as they juggle their professional lives, daily routines, and their own children. It's a film about the cycle of life and changing perspectives. It's about the future and the past, hope and regret. And it's ultimately a film about our mortality as human beings and the importance of the time we have. Tokyo Story is a beautiful film, shot using Ozu's signature low, motionless camera angles that lull the audience into the slow rhythm of the film. This is the definition of a timeless classic, as the themes presented in this masterpiece will remain relevant generation after generation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are many roads to greatness. This is a notion that I have always held to be true. No greater example of this could be given than by comparing the films of two of the greatest filmmakers from Japan. Of course, most people have heard of Akira Kurosawa and his classics like Seven Samurai, Rashomon, and Ikiru. But there is also Yasujiro Ozu (1903-1963), whose canon of films is set in modern times far more often than Kurosawa's. Where Kurosawa was grand, Ozu is small. Where Kurosawa was kinetic, Ozu was static. Where Kurosawa celebrated the epic, Ozu celebrated the ordinary. Yet, despite their differences, their greatest films are indisputable masterpieces of cinema, even if they achieve their ends in seemingly contradictory ways.Perhaps the greatest of all Ozu films is his 1953 black and white classic Tokyo Story (Tokyo monogatari), which follows a simple story outline, unfolds very slowly ? the film is two hours and fifteen minutes long, builds its power through the slow accumulation of facts, and the deft, but subtle revelation of character. In short, it's everything that Hollywood films are not, and it would never have been produced there, then or now. It has been derided as being stale, dull, and plodding, even as it has alternately been chided as melodramatic and a third rate soap opera. Such definitions only go to show how little the claimants know of the words they wield.It is true, that nothing much of 'excitement' happens in the film- no murders, car chases, explosions, steamy sex scenes. It follows an old couple, from the small town of Onomichi, on a long train trip to Tokyo to visit their grown children. Some have seen the film as a remake of Leo McCarey's 1937 Hollywood sudser, Make Way For Tomorrow, but Tokyo Story is to that film what Long Day's Journey Into Night is to The Bold &amp; The Beautiful. There, the old couple see the town, are shunted aside, then return home. The mother dies, the children come to visit, and there are some revelations, but most of the living family members just return to their own patterns of life. Yet, having watched soap operas for many years, I can tell you this film soars well beyond soap operas, which rely on archetypes and stereotypes, and the most silly plot contrivances. Everything in this film happens as it would in reality. Plus, Ozu does not milk scenes for their overwrought emotions. In fact, he wields his edits like a rapier, and excises scenes that soap operas and more standard films would include. Tokyo Story is no shameless tearjerker.Ozu is the master of narrative ellipses. As example, we do not see an early emotional farewell scene between the parents and their youngest daughter Kyoko. We do not see the parents' first stay with their youngest son Keizo (Shiro Osaka), in Osaka, as they head toward Tokyo. Another technique he mastered is that of developing subplots, such as that of the widowed daughter-in-law, Noriko, who treats the old couple far better than all but one of their children. Yet, she is not hagiographized at the expense of the other children, even as they are not demonized for their lack of care for their parents. They are simply caring and selfish, as most people are to a certain degree.Tokyo Story is a great film, all the way around, but it was ignored for many years until it was re-released in New York in 1972, with the publication of Paul Schrader's Transcendental Style In Film. Twenty years later, in the 1992 Sight And Sound film critics poll, Tokyo Story was ranked as one of the ten greatest films ever made. In 2002 it repeated that feat. It is not a film that provides easy answers, and it lacks all the phony sentimentality and contrivances Hollywood films wallow in. It is not melodramatic in the least. When Shige, as example, bursts out in tears, when Koichi says their mother has not long to live, it is not Ozu's melodrama, but the character's own, and there is a huge difference in recognizing that. That the film so perfectly captured all the Japanese conventions of the era, yet still resonates with worldwide audiences, is the mark of a great work of art, and a testament to the great circularly narrative screenplay by Ozu and Kôgo Noda, which deftly interweaves symbolism, such as train tracks and laundry, while capturing the way real people talk and react. Never is there a forced moment nor false reaction. The character building is superb, and the very relaxed and slow pace of the film shows what such a style can do. The film's score, by Kojun Saito is a tad over the top, at times, but understated far more often than not.If only Criterion had done their usual good job with this film the experience would have been perfect. But, don't let that deter any lover of great cinema from basking in one of the great films of all time. Tokyo Story makes its own leisurely way, but where it heads to is where all art desires to be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almost Unbearably Sad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was my introduction to Ozu, and I have to say that I thought it was at times unbearably sad, and all the more so because of its misleading simplicity.In "Tokyo Story," a mother and father make a trip to Tokyo to visit their three children and their children's families. Time, distance, and the children's busy lives have caused them to drift away from their parents; the mother and father learn that their children have become different people from those they used to know, and must face the uneasy conclusion that they may not like the people they have become.Ozu has created a prototype for cinematic minimalism. The camera hardly ever moves; static shots are edited together to give the movie whatever momentum it has. This style can become admittedly frustrating; I found myself fidgeting more than once. However, it also helps give images a more profound impact than they might otherwise have, because there are few distractions. As a result, a simple shot from behind of two old people sitting on the edge of a wall watching the sea in silence becomes achingly beautiful. Ozu is able to communicate their feelings of loneliness, regret and obsoleteness without a word or strain of music. He takes the exact opposite approach from that of a filmmaker like Steven Spielberg, and it works beautifully.And the movie is not as simple as it appears. For underneath the story about this one family and its dynamics, there is a larger story about the changes taking place in a post-war Tokyo, and the increasing divide between generations. Shot after shot of factory chimneys, power lines, and construction sites serve to both highlight the progress of a city about to take off and the inevitability of certain traditions being left behind.You will have to have patience with this movie, I won't lie to you about that. But I found that its subtle and haunting effects stayed with me for days after I had seen it.Grade: A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More of a film to analyse than enjoy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of course that is just my opinion. Tokyo Monogatari is a marvel of the dailiness of life and the disappointment parents face. It raises relevant issues on children growing apart from their parents and a departure of values to modern times. The film is featured in many a top 10 list, its the number one film on the latest Halliwells top 1000 list. Its hard to fault.The story is about two parents who go to visit their children in Tokyo. Though things aren't as sweet as they had imagined and the trip basically ends up being a big disappointment. The story is told in an interesting manner, often eclipsing certain events and moving on. To keep the story moving I suppose. An example of this being that the old couple are meeting their son, Keizo, before they go to see their daughter. The film goes straight to arriving at the daughters house. We do not see their visiting of their son Keizo, only hear the characters talking about it and know that it has happened.One of the daughters, Shige is quite cold towards her parents. She doesn't pay much attention to them and is frequently cruel. Small things like her not giving them nice cake and saying the crackers are good enough for them. The parents slowly realise that their children aren't as successful as they had thought. Just another subtle way of indicating that they have not seen their children for some time. Also their daughters children not being familiar with their grandparents, another indicator.Eventually the old folks are shipped out to a health spa. At first they feel guilty that they are inconveniencing their children further, they don't realise that they aren't very wanted. The person most kind to the couple is Noriko, the wife of one of their sons who died in the war. It is ironic how she is the kindest, yet is no blood relation.The characters in Tokyo story are very well developed. Different assumptions can be made towards the children's indifference. Maybe times have simply changed. This is displayed well in the film through shots of modernity, trains and boats. Mod cons if you will. The camera movement in this film is also intriguing. Ozu often explores the space within a room. Maybe by following somebody around. The compositions are interesting. A lot of the camera decisions have meaning. Such as a couple sitting side by side so as not to appear confrontational. Pattern is also kept up well, people are fanning themselves in linked shots, constantly reminding the viewer that it is a hot day (common for an Ozu film) Another interesting point about the camera movement is that Ozu breaks the continuity by changing the side from which scenes are shot. A unique thing.Overall I definitely recommend you see Tokyo story, it is a very impressive, at times heartrending piece of cinema. It shows the coldness that comes with modern times and how life may not have place for elderly people. Technically, it is at a high level. The story is told in a neat way and the whole experience is generally engaging. My only complaint is that the film at time becomes a little slow and may not always be enjoyable. But overall, its an important one. Do see it if you have a big interest in film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Disclaimer: my ratings are purely personal and is only indicative on my subjective enjoyment of the film. (Even then, or perhaps even more so, I know I'm gonna be bashed for this.) Even if this 1953 greatly-hailed-classic was not black &amp; white, I would have found it too slow to be enjoyable.The story is simple. An aged couple visits their children in Tokyo, and then heads home. Through the narrative, the film contrasts the filial impiety of the couple's biological children with the compassion of the couple's non-blood-related, widowed daughter-in-law.Critics rave about the cinematography. I know nuts about these things so I shall reveal my ignorance no more.What was perhaps a bit more accessible was the layered richness of the film's portrayal of Japanese culture, which is often non-verbal, indirect and subtle. (The emphasis here is a bit; I would have been lost without the readings to analyze the film's non-explicit elements because of the high-context nature of the Japanese society.) Suffice to say that the film was only bearable because of the readings, which I did concurrently while watching the film; they explained the film's richness that gave it its 99/100 IMDb critic review.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ozu's greatest soap opera.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yasujiro Ozu has been called "the most Japanese of Japanese directors". That's doubtless correct, insofar as the director is insistent upon an adherence to a rigid form in his directing style. One doesn't have to be a cultural anthropologist to glean the Japanese concern with traditional motifs and the patient perfecting of a given aesthetic.But I'm guessing that this is not so true of today's Japan, and I'm also guessing that, deep-down, many critics and audiences over there right now probably find Ozu insufferably old-fashioned. One wonders if the exulting of Ozu is a dig from cultural snobs toward Akira Kurosawa, who dared to base his movies on pulpy American detective novels and John Ford Westerns. In any case, it's important to point out that Ozu's directing style is rather his own style, not some sort of "traditional" Japanese style. This is what should be celebrated about Ozu. He's an original artist, over and above being a "Japanese artist". And his greatest film, *Tokyo Story*, is only "Japanese" in its particulars. After all, elderly parents being ignored by their busy grown-up children are not exclusive to Japan.That famous style consists of no panning with the camera, and keeping the camera at just above floor level. The static mise-en-scene is broken up with cuts of close-ups in which the actors speak directly to the camera, as if the camera has taken the POV of the listener. Occasionally, in the case of *Tokyo Story*, there are exterior shots of Tokyo itself, jackhammering busily away under the Marshall Plan. (The movie is set several years after World War II.) Ozu's martinet control of both composition and the actors -- all of whom are tightly reined in by stylized performances -- is actually a benefit to the story, which is really nothing more than a weepy soap opera, let's face it. The manner in which the carefully written dialogue and the overall formal restraint of the piece overcomes the melodramatic tendencies of the script is really quite astonishing -- it's art of the most difficult kind. Put it this way: imagining this movie redone in America will give one a sense of deep appreciation for both Ozu's microscopic control and for the foreign setting itself.The movie is generous to its characters, despite all the outward restraints. We're not meant to hate the adult children, who are only too willing to shuttle off their aging parents to a "spa" that turns out to be little better than a bordello for decadent young hipsters. Ozu ruefully shows us how the War had turned a whole generation of young Japanese into calloused survivors so consumed with rebuilding and then maintaining a semblance of normal life that there's no time or room for traditional family values anymore -- indeed, no time or room for extended family, period. We're meant to sympathize with these characters, as they struggle under the new realities of post-War Japan. And even deeper than this, Ozu has something to say about the heartlessness of Time: Life Goes On, and whole generations come and go and are promptly forgotten. "Life is disappointing," one character exclaims.It can be argued that if you've seen one Ozu film, then you've seen them all. (Well, I can argue that, at least. Sorry, but I prefer the variety of Kurosawa.) In that case, *Tokyo Story* is the Ozu film you must see. I grant that the director's platitudinizing may make you feel that you should give your mother a call . . . but is that such a bad thing?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Be Prepared To Be Seriously Underwhelmed.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Viewed on DVD. This is a plain (shomin-geki) film ostensibly about plain (and not especially attractive) folks using a plain (impoverished) script with: plain (for the most part) acting; plain (often obscured or obscuring) sets; a plain (and often "wandering-about") film score; and plain (and very simple) camera work. To call this static, soporific, house-bound film a "movie" would be a stretch. Nothing much seems to move, and the attributes that render the motion picture a unique art form are pretty much ignored. A "filmed pseudo stage play" might be a more apt description. That said, the director seems to effectively reflect aspects of the contemporary trauma faced by a country whose long-standing (ancient) traditions are in the midst of serious migration in the aftermath of losing a disastrous war. Issues explored include: the ramifications of children no longer traditionally carrying for their aging parents (or wanting to); dealing with the loss of loved ones in the military service; facing rebellious (rather than obedient) children/grandchildren; living in cramped city apartments with dirty hallway; and the emergence of home-based businesses to just get by financially. The character actors who play the aging grandparents are principal weak spots. The actress playing the grandmother over wears a stoic mask; her face rarely reflects the different emotional lines she delivers. The actor who plays the grandfather is seriously miscast. He usually exhibits a goofy expression; lines reduced to continuously repeating "pause words" (like "aahh") and variations of SO DESU KA ("really?", "is that so?", etc.) don't help matters (due to an impoverished script) . Often characters are seen looking out at things which are never shown to the audience (like in a stage play). The director seems to have a fetish for clothes (including under garments) drying on laundry lines. Some scenes show only laundry drying and many scenes have laundry lines in the foreground or the background (surprisingly, there are no scenes of clothes being washed!). Subtitles and video/audio restorations are fine. Bottom line: Unless you are interested in 20th Century Japanese cultural chaos, best to skip this one. WILLIAM FLANIGAN, PhD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Beautiful Movie in Its Simplicity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know this movie has quite high rating on IMDb and that is why I want to give it a chance. I am usually reluctant to watch B&amp;W Japanese movies but "Twenty Four Eyes" and "Sansho The Bailiff" have impressed me a lot.Yes, this movie impresses me a lot. The story is simple but there are accuracies in its simplicity. What happens in this movie may happen to everyone. This movie is beautiful yet powerful in delivering its message. The pace is rather slow but it is understandable because the director wants to grow each important character in this movie. If you are looking for a well-developed drama, this is it.In a nutshell, time may change everything. Love from our beloved ones may change. Over time, parents-children relationship may change and it becomes routine activities with less passion. Surprisingly the one, who we think may care less about us, gives the most attention we need during the hard times. Life is ironic. Life is funny yet beautiful. Watch this movie and interpret the meaning of "parents-children relationship" by yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A true masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is all about psychology, and the subtle layers that make up family dynamics in early contemporary Japanese society. It is very touching if you're someone who is into empathy. It's about acting. Nothing moves, yet there is some surprising insight and candor and great quality with the dialogue. You're expecting to simply be a foreign witness to something exotic from a time past you cannot really understand (unless I guess you're a Japanese national from that era) but the parents provide surprising feedback and emotion, and this is beautiful nuanced top notch acting. Going into this a long time ago I though this was a feudal era piece so I was expecting the traditional clothing etc loll. It's all old but modern and those people got style. Sometimes you have to go very very far away (in my case) in order to find something very close. A movie which discusses age and family and makes you think about the quality of our interactions with people from different generations. It is a universal masterpiece because I'm not Japanese and none of the setting applies to what I am or what I live, but I can connect with the humanity that drives this amazing production. A really satisfying and elevating cinema experience that you keep for repeat watching and insight.Not spoiling by saying that if you require an action movie or swords, look elsewhere.</fullReview>

Of course, I think I will be one of them. It is often forgot that parents are always worried about children, and we also have to consider our children. This movie reminds us important things which we tend to forgot. This movie draws a family from the point of view of parents, so we are made notice that we have to be dutiful to our parents.

		<shortDescription>The Significance of Family</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tokyo Story is a beautiful, emotionally devastating film that really shows a side of society that immensely disappoints me. I guess you can say that I developed an instant personal connection to this film, since I've witnessed similar situations. Having to go through the immense lost of my grandfather (who was not only my grandfather, but someone who I can call my dad and my best friend) and knowing for a fact I will be missing him for the rest of my life until I die, I felt greatly disgusted by how a lot of the children in the film treated their parents. I come from a culture where we would NEVER put our parents or grandparents in an old person's home, and we would be more than willing to take care of the people who raised us just the same way they took care of us. If I have to make sacrifices in my job and my me time, then I would make no hesitation, because I LOVE, as well as RESPECT my grandparents/parents. Whatever differences we may have wouldn't even matter and in the end it never did. Not to trying to tell anyone how to live, but I think that showing some compassion and respect towards the people who did a lot for you shows a lot of character. My grandfather may not be with me now, but to know that I did the best that I could to make him happy and not feel alone gives me a sense of comfort in knowing that he was happy.We unfortunately live in a society where we all are too busy and have places to be, and it sometimes cannot be avoided, but once we deliberately start to distance ourselves from people, then it becomes a problem, especially for the people we should give more time and attention to. This is the me generation, and we are flooded by technology and corporations trying to exploit many aspects of our lives, which dilutes so many of the basic, yet most important aspects of our humanity. A film like this just goes to show that our so called leaders in society don't put much of an effort in influencing us to stay connected or in at least trying to create outlets that will bring us closer as humans. Instead we live in a system that brings out selfishness. While life can be at times unrestrained in its cruelty, at least we have movies like 'Tokyo Story' that shows a sense of humanity in its most raw and purest form. I like to watch films to escape, but especially ones that show an utmost honesty about our society and what 'Tokyo Story' says to me from watching it is that while life is beautiful and still worth living, it can still be immensely disappointing. What makes Tokyo Story such a strong film is that it brings out the harsh reality that exists in our society, in that many people don't put in any effort to maintain the strength of a bond towards their family. What's the point of being part of a family if that person doesn't even have the heart to set things aside to spend time with their parents? The fact that this film can tug at many people's heart strings goes to show just how much this film is an emotional punch to the gut, in that it shows aspects of human nature that is far reaching and universal. While Japan is one of the many diverse cultures in our world, we still share many of the same issues that can exist in any family relationship. Any film that make me feel this much empathy for its characters is something special and 'Tokyo Story' is that special film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had heard a lot about this film and it did is one of the best films in displaying the realities. When I had finished watching, I was thinking as to why I liked the film. For the two hours show, you will not feel bad at all. This is a film you can watch without thinking too much of your time.PROS: Yes, it is slow paced. But this is one of those few films (along with The English patient), to be good and charming despite their slow music and character analysis. Another good thing in the film was that there was not too much of crying or unnecessary display of tears or emotions. What makes the scenes beautiful is that the emotions were displayed through the conditions that the couple had to face. The script seems to be a normal one but the way, the major characters were analyzed is amazing. All credit goes to direction. I can't say much about acting because Japanese acting and voices were new to me and couldn't understand their colloquial styles which were somehow important to display the right amount of emotions.Message: "Anything can change overtime." Verdict: "A must watch for film buffs."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tokyo Story is one of the most emotionally draining movies I have ever see. It is right up there with Berman's Cries and Whispers as a movie that literally wrenches your heart out.The movie is about an aging couple who visit their children and realise how everyone has drifted apart. Ozu's ability to capture the mundane as well as the profound aspects of daily life is uncanny. Especially the scene where the boy moans about not being able to study and his mother points out he never studies anyway.The imagery and cinematography are beautiful One of my favourite scenes is the boy and the grandmother at the start of the movie. That scene is cinema at it's most beautiful at its most poignant moment.The movie is filled with moments of such beauty. And there is also an underlying warmth and humanity to it that it endears itself to every viewer. You could fault the movie on being a bit slow but if you stay you are rewarded.

		<fullReview>Perhaps the finest film ever made. Technically it is a breathtaking piece, showing Ozu's static, tatami-hight camera work and exploiting his unique 360? space. By this I mean that instead of the usual Hollywood/Western 180? Ozu utilizes a spherical space. When the old mother tells her widowed daughter-in-law how much she enjoys her visit the daughter-in-law is initially screen right. Noriko massages Tomi's shoulders and then she stands to cross the room. In a typical Western film this would be a cut on action, the action 'disguising' the cut. Ozu cuts on her motion too but at the same time shifts the camera across the 180? line. Thus, when the cut on Noriko's motion is completed she is now screen left.Penelope Gilliatt has written that Ozu is obsessed with film's possibility of "reporting the poetic truth of the actual" and I cannot think of a better way to express his desire and success to extract beauty from the mundane, the very day, the quotidian, with love and humanity..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Elegy for a halcyon, pre-war Japan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A simple and deeply affecting film, Tokyo Story concerns an elderly couple who travel to Tokyo to visit their children. The sojourn is a fractured, unsatisfactory affair as their modern, grown-up children have little time to spare them. The grandparents, though uncomplaining, seem to regard this visit as their last, and so it turns out.This is a wistful but not uneventful tale of the arrival of modernity in Japan. With the exception of the daughter Shige, an acrid, self- interested figure, the family is largely made up of good people who have simply moved on in the cultural aftermath of the War. The only mourning, metaphorical and literal, is done by the ravishing Noriko (Setsuko Hara). The grandparents urge her to stop mourning their son, lost in the War and move on with marriage and life.On the face of it this is a perfectly well-acted, carefully but not over-artfully shot film. It's difficult to gauge the extent of irony or pathos especially from the three most sympathetic characters - Noriko and the grandparents, Shukishi and Tomi - as their default face is one of almost Elysian joy. Yet this makes the sadness of a lost son and a dying epoch all the more poignant. A good, often Westernised score (Kojun Saitô) too. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The daughter says "Sho-ga-nai wane" when she is making the bed for her drunk ota-san. I don't think anyone says the more formal and more despairing "Shikata-ganai". That says a lot, and it means that the reviews that take Tokyo Story as damnation of the ungrateful devils in the younger generation or as damnation of a "western society" (as one reviewer fantasizes) are off base. "Sho-ga-nai wane" simply means "that's the way it is". My wife says it fairly often. "Shikata-ganai" seem to be more like "life sux and then you die". My wife doesn't say that and nobody says that in Tokyo Story. This movie is a dilemma, sort of like the dilemma discussed while they're drinking ... how it is tough to live with your kid but tough for them to be gone. This movie? As oka-san says about her kids "certainly better than average". And in Lake IMDBgone, average is about a 6.5, so I give this an 8. The problem? Tokyo Story is both literally and figuratively BLACK &amp; WHITE. It is a simple movie. Even the dialogue is simple. How simple? I speak Japanese worse than kindergarten level, but I could understand most of what the older generation said. They talked slowly. They used simple grammar, polite forms, and simple words. So, I empathize with the commentator who panned it. Yeah, I also knew everything that would happen after 20 minutes of viewing. If I hadn't spent a lot of time in Japan and have Japanese in-laws, i.e. if I had little to no interest in Japan, I might feel similar and not even have watched the whole thing. (In this way, it is almost like Lost in Translation.) I mean, if you have little to no interest in Japan, it is neither very entertaining nor very revealing. Come on, you have to be pretty baka to not understand generational gaps and the damage done to family life by modern society. Well, duh! Having said all that, the message is well-done, it is universal, and who knows, maybe seeing it in a different time and place will add something for you even if all you know about Japan is Sony and Toyota. If it weren't set in Japan, I'd probably give it a 6.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Style in TOKYO STORY</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yasujiro Ozu's TOKYO STORY, while unappreciated by Western viewers during the time of its birth, is today viewed as an influential masterpiece. Taking from the gendai-geki, or "modern story" tradition in Japanese film, Ozu aims to emphasize the mini-actions of daily life, absent from drama, emotional complexity, and spectacle, conventions most intrinsic to Hollywood. With deceiving simplicity and genius technicality, TOKYO STORY is a timelessly important film, especially within the realm of cinematic style.Most interesting is Ozu's treatment of narrative time in TOKYO STORY. The display of several dramatic events are withheld from the viewer and replaced with mundane, everyday activity. David Desser refers to this elision in "The Space of Ambivalence"* as a sort of "dailiness" that serves as the preeminent force in moving the film. Desser notes that Ozu systematically elides everything except dailiness, forcing the viewer to fill in the gaps, or the drama, taking place between what is seen, a process calling for an active part on the audience versus the spoon-fed phenomenon seen all to often in classic Hollywood cinema. Ozu's simple approach to cinematic storytelling has cut deeply, clearing the way for the implementation of new possibilities on the global film scene. Today, many filmmakers use dailiness to emphasize importance, bridge moments in the narrative, or, simply, to give a sense of authenticity.Ozu couples his elision of dramatic narrative action with his usage of 360-degree space by ignoring the looming 180-degree rule that forces the camera to remain on one hemisphere of an imaginary circle dictated by the placement of the actors -- if the camera ventured to the other hemisphere the characters would appear to "flip" (and, to the horror of Hollywood, confuse the audience!). By ignoring this rule, Ozu continues in his rejection of traditional cinematic practices. He strives to move away from the Hollywood aesthetic and give viewers something fresh and interesting to look at. Desser, regarding Ozu's 360-degree space in TOKYO STORY, writes: "Space, then, is not reducible to narrative needs, but exists as a playful and attention-grabbing component." Ozu wants these flips to stand out and does so with seamless blatancy unencumbered by a need for spatial continuity.TOKYO STORY is an important addition to the kaleidoscopic understanding cinematic style. Ozu's far-reaching resonance has touched the creativity of many contemporary filmmakers and is a fundamental piece of film history.*Desser, David. "The Space of Ambivalence."

		<shortDescription>Ozu is Great!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Minimalism is a prominent technique employed by director Yasujiro Ozu throughout his 1953 film: Tokyo Story. By not using optical devices such as swipes, fades, or dissolves Ozu created a very passionate and believable film by following a strict and effective realist formula. Tokyo Story deals with the feelings of family estrangement while Shukichi and Tomi struggle to adapt the change of culture and the disaffection of their children they were so eager to see. The characters feelings reflected in the film are so convincing it's obvious that Ozu had a clear understanding of human behavior and the tribulations that occur inside family life.One of the most important aspects of Tokyo Story is Ozu's camera work. Nearly all indoor shots were taken from the same angle. Since the camera would be placed three to four feet off of the ground the film had a very realistic feel, because of this the audience in a way was on the same level as the characters in frame. The low angles also accentuate the feeling of being in an enclosed house, so when the outdoor shots make their appearances (the long shots of the city and landscapes) they seemed so much more vast and beautiful in contrast to the low angle filming of the previous scenes.The placement of the camera during the characters conversations is simplistic and yet at the same time different from most other jump-cut filming techniques employed by other directors. It gives the viewer an outside feeling, the audience in a way become observers of the characters dialogue and feelings. In a lot of scenes the people in frame also talk directly into the camera, this is normally not a prominent technique in films but in Tokyo Story it gives the scene a more noticeable and expansive feel. Had the scenes been filmed in a more conventional style (both characters conversing in the same frame) the dialogue and emotions would be less noticeable to the viewer. Tokyo Story is a very subtle and bittersweet film, it was important for Ozu to employ interesting camera techniques because the exchanges and expressions amongst the characters are a key element to the plot development.Ozu's minimalist techniques make Tokyo Story a very realistic and sometimes emotionally profound film. While not using any moving camera Ozu captures some very attention getting images, one in particular is when Mrs. Hirayama is watching her estranged grandson pick blades of grass outside of her son's house. This scene has a very somber aura surrounding it and it is conveyed in a very subtle way. Another memorable part is when Mr. Hirayama is sitting on the ledge in front of the ocean after a restless night in the noisy spa his kids thoughtlessly send them too. The feelings of abandonment are clearly expressed without any real expletives incorporated in the scene. This approach works perfectly well when telling the story of an elderly couple's sense of detachment from their children. The feelings of sadness and abandon are prominent throughout the film but they are never imposed on the viewer, the encompassing ambiance of emotion is a quiet and affectionate way to tell a story. All the emotions are underlying within the characters as well. When Koichi has to go on call to visit a patient before they go out for the day its not as if his father stands up and says, "I am upset that we cant go out", he quietly accepts the situation. Unlike the intrusive style of modern films Yasujiro gives credit to the audience to reach their own conclusions about the films elements. Instead of having one dimensional characters who pout and fuss at every altercation Ozu inserted believable people who react realistically to a problem. Had this film been made to meet the standards of the dumbed down culture of modern day there would probably be a mindless scene were Mr. and Mrs. Hirayama sit down in a room and discuss how they feel as if they've grown apart from their kids, (as if the series of events in the film weren't clear enough already). There is a genuine awareness of audience credibility Yasujiro Ozu had while making Tokyo Story.The social statement is not only told in the film but it is also evident in the style of it as well. A big part of Tokyo Story's message is that life is not supposed to be some on going hustle. The two most admirable characters are clearly Mr. and Mrs. Hirayama and they were the only ones who seemed to understand that. They just could not adapt to the "quick fix" lifestyle that their children ended up living in. Their fast paced career is, in a way what ended up being the break down of their family unit. Even when Shukichi and Tomi tried to embrace city life it brought out their less desirable qualities. For example the father goes out and gets drunk with some of his old friends.This message is also evident in the film itself by it's slowed down pace, granted one has to be patient at first to get used to Ozu's style but in order to appreciate certain things one shouldn't always be in a hurry to get to the end of something. When someone falls into the standards of modern society they overlook what is important in life, and that is to take some time aside and appreciate what's around you. When Shukichi dies it's as if everyone masks their self resentment by scuttling back to their busy lives in Tokyo. The only character who seems to be content is Tomi. That is because he had led a fulfilled life with his spouse and seemed to have little to no regret.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>expectations are a bitch. this film shows up on all sorts of top ten lists so once i saw that it had gotten the criterion treatment, i had to check it out. ozu uses space well...he films interiors in a style that is pretty original, especially for the time. he uses the low level "tatami mat" camera position along with a lack of camera movement, fades, dissolves or wipes to keep a very even narrative style that emphasizes observation of, rather than interaction with, the characters and action. he also has a very slow pacing and emphasis on the mundane which apparently influenced jim jarmusch. jarmusch's films often emphasize negative space...he films that which is usually skipped over. ozu does the same thing and also does not film that which is usually filmed (like the kids picking up their parents at the train station). he also will allow exact relationships between characters go undefined for several minutes. this, according to the commentary, is to increase the audience's investment in the film. but to me it's just obnoxious. the star of the film is setsuko hara, whose character is beautiful, humane, and yet still realistic. chishu ryu, also, has a good performance as the male half of the elderly couple. ultimately this is a film that relies heavily on its style...i didn't think all that much of the style since it wasn't engaging or particularly beautiful. it's a style that is its own, but it's not one that i enjoyed. i recognize that the film is well done, though some of the editing (particularly when first exploring the interior of koichi's house) is illogical, but that isn't enough for me. i did have a certain connection with a few of the characters, but not to the same degree that ozu seemed to desire. i wish i liked this movie more because there are things to like. the performances are good, the direction is solid and the style is unique. kurosawa's "ikiru," which is not unlike this film, was far more successful in capturing my heart, and without my heart this film, though respected, cannot be loved.

		<shortDescription>From the If-It's-Boring-It-Must-Be-A-Masterpiece school of filmmaking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERSUnfortunately, I'm from the If-It-Doesn't-Move,-Poke-It-With-A-Stick school of film criticism. No, I'm just kidding. I like a lot of slow-moving movies. No, Tokyo Story has problems up the wazoo. It's not that it's a bad movie, either. I actually liked it, marginally. 7/10, for sure. I do feel that it's vastly overrated - about as overrated as movies come. It's very often considered one of the ten best films ever made. Personally, I don't think Yasujiro Ozu gives human existence enough credit. Life is never this uninteresting, nor are people. I have lost family recently, and I could relate stories about funerals that have such enormous depth that they would blow this thing away.I've heard so much about the amazing restraint of Ozu's style that I really just have to question it. I have seen one other Ozu film - Bakushu is its Japanese name; I can't remember whether it's Late or Early Spring. It was boring, too, but interesting culturally. It really was stale, with almost no movement whatsoever. Tokyo Story is clearly Ozu's most famous film, and, I have to say, the style here is not restrained at all. There are only two tracking shots in the whole film - that's what people usually point to when they're looking for stylistic techniques to point out. One person I've talked to said: "In Tokyo Story, there's only one tracking shot [sic], and it cuts like a knife." I'd say that the one he's talking about does add to the poignancy a little, and so does the one he forgot. It didn't, however, affect me greatly. In fact, only a couple of individual shots touched me at all. As for the rest of Ozu, he does position his camera lower to the ground than probably any other director - a technique that isn't really very noticeable. Otherwise, it's not too much different from Hollywood. In fact, most Hollywood films of the era have limited or no tracking shots just based on their budgets. The editing patterns are almost identical to anything you'd find anywhere else, except for this odd and annoying type of cross-cutting that pops up whenever two people converse. I don't get that; it's really choppy, rather jarring for a movie that seems to want to be so realistic.And that's where I think this film's critical prominence lies, in its realism. I don't understand it, but whenever any film tries to be realistic or naturalistic, critics and most film buffs develop a raging erection. I know what real life is like, and I'd much rather see it exaggerated. To tell you the truth, as I said above, I don't think Ozu is presenting real life in Tokyo Story (or Bakushu). Real life has much more drama than this film. This is doing the opposite of hyperbolizing; it's minimizing real life. In real life, when a family meets around the dinner table, as the family does at the end of this film, there're a million circumstances effecting the outcome of that meal. Not so in this film. Ozu reduces them to types: the nice old couple, the too-busy adults, the selfish wife, the compassionate widow, etc. They do have character. I wouldn't want to undermine that too much. But in real life, they'd be so much more complex and interesting. I suggest that you attend a relative stranger's Christmas dinner, as a ghost, if necessary. It would be infinitely more complex.I do have to give the film credit for the complex issues that it raises. Its main themes have to deal with the callousness of the adult generation, and the disappointment in the elderly generation. It deals with these themes well whenever it gets around to dealing with them. A more brilliant writer would have had more with the grandchildren, but Ozu is content to have just a bit of it at the beginning. But, really, what does he bring out in the film that you didn't know already? I have a feeling that the same people who love this movie are right at the moment as I write this (12/19/2001) apprehensive about their parents or in-laws showing up for Christmas, and will breathe a sigh of relief when they leave. And I bet those same people will watch this movie when they're older and say, "Hey, my kids are just like those a**holes!"There are better movies about aging out there. Check out the Icelandic film Children of Nature, about an old man whose family is so annoyed at his presence in their home that they quickly move him to a nursing home, where he meets his high school sweetheart. They had been forced out of their homes in a more inhospitable part of the island years before, and together they conspire to go back there and die. Tokyo Story fans will certainly hate it, for the mere fact that it is, well, entertaining and fantastical. Another one I like a lot is by the Ozu-enthusiast's greatest enemy - the dreaded Akira Kurosawa, who often delivered amusing quips against Ozu when he was interviewed by the press; he thought Ozu was a bore, too. The film is Rhapsody in August, and I can hear the laughter already from the Ozu sector. I promise you all that that film will become more beloved and important as the years go on. Right now, it is in critical limbo for the silliest reason: Richard Gere is in the movie for about 15 minute. And it's actually one of his best performances, if you'd just give him a chance. That film is much better in dealing with the paradoxes of the three generations's relationships.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I give this film a 9 rating only due to its vintage and somewhat imperfect fit with todays fast paced life and diluted family values. This film is a really good example of how one can take a simple concept from our day to day lives and turn it into such a thought provoking film. To really appreciate this movie one must put into perspective the value of family, especially one's elders, in eastern cultures. Even today it is so different from our Western views and approaches in dealing with our elders.The basic principle there is respect for elders, or even reverence for one's parents as they get on with age. Many families continue to live with their parents and care for them through their old age. These are the choices they make in their life and value. And, not to forget, many of these people are professionals and skilled laborers who continue to work full-time and still care for their extended families. Rarely will you find a retirement village ;) there.Remember these simple concepts next time you watch this movie and you might get a poignant view of the pain that is conveyed in this fantastic film.Enjoy.....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A Japanese couple visit Tokyo, where their children and grandchildren live. While they are in Tokyo, their children treat them and they enjoy a lot. However, the day after they leave Tokyo, something sad suddenly happen to them. I think the most precious thing in the world is family. This couple look so happy when they meet their children and grandchildren. By watching this movie, we can feel how wonderful family is! And also, we can learn that the time with our family is limited. Human life dose not last forever so we should cherish our time and our family. Furthermore, this movie is very old, so we can study old days in Japan. I am very interested in it! If you have interest in old days in Japan, you should try!</fullReview>

Iam a Catholic, not a Buddhist, so I disagree with the films implied metaphysic. Having said that, I will go on and say that this is still one of the most moving films ever made. I once wrote, in a review of another film about the aged, Make Way For Tomorrow, that it could make a stone cry..the same is true of this movie. Chiso Ryu delivers one of the greatest screen performances.In fact, everyone in this film is pitch perfect...According to Scorsese, John Ford once said that the most remarkable thing you can photograph is a human face..this film is rich in human faces .

		<fullReview>Well, lets see, I am not a great fan of artsy films: I am more of an average film goer who loves science fiction and fantasy films.True, this film feels very lifelike, but there are better films about daily life than this one, such as Isao Takahata's, Only Yesterday (a film for which I gave 10/10). This one is flawed: it is too slow going, and so fails to grab my attention as a result I almost feel into sleep during this film. Film critics, with their trained attention spans, are able to appreciate more these slow going films.Anyway, I still considered this film to be an excellent one, but flawed. But like Citizen Kane, it is rather primitive film and suffers because of it. Yes, modern films are better than these very old ones for the same reason that Van Goth painting is better than the Cave Paintings: a more advanced civilization is able to support more sophisticated forms of art.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Quite unlike any other film...with a camera so passive it almost feels like we are eavesdropping into the lives of this family. As in McCarey's similar MAKE WAY FOR TOMORROW, there are no obvious villains here...though the adult children may be selfish, many viewers will be able to sympathize with them. While parents fear dying alone, children fear having the burden of aging parents. TOKYO STORY never lets you forget this.Ozu's style is interesting, avoiding scenes that an American director would have milked for maximum dramatic effect, and preferring to focus on the aftermath instead. The tone is so even, and the film so long, many are likely to find it a tad exasperating. Patient viewers will be rewarded, as the layers of this family are uncovered (the reunited fathers, all in a saki buzz, revealing their disappointments with their children, remains my personal favorite scene). Most memorable: the almost total lack of physical affection displayed, which may come as a shock to Western viewers. See this movie alone, just you and the screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is Japanese Cinema.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>even seven samurai is getting too commercial, because it is so western. while i love the seven samurai, there is another aspect to Japanese cinema besides kurosawa. that other half includes yasujiro ozu, who is probably one of the most unconventional filmmakers on this side of the Atlantic. there is no side swipes nor fast paced editing. instead, ozu pulls the camera back, has very little movement, and we just observe what is going on. the dialogue in tokyo monogatari may seem a little pretentious with a stationery camera, but this, in a sense, is sort of capturing life as it is. i'd say in the final scenes of the film where the dialogue is its best, for it is here where we see the power of this simple story. what was very interesting for this new comer to ozu is how he actually kills off one of the main characters throughout the plot, and i think it is his usage of dialogue and editing that has this death of this main character impact me more than the death of - oh, let's say obi wan kenobi in star wars. that is because he comes back in spirit. star wars is fantasy, while tokyo monogatari is not. i want to show this film to my parents, as a message for them to respect their elders that they take care of and complain about. but, they'll probably tell me i'm either ungrateful or that the movie was boring. but, viewers such as the ones that share the same feelings about tokyo monogatari as i know better. this is an excellent film, and i am grateful to have seen it.</fullReview>

The story begins with an older Japanese couple (grandma and grandpa) packing to go to Tokyo to see their grown son, daughter and daughter-in-law (whose husband, their 2nd son, was killed in the war). However, despite their letting everyone know they were coming, they are treated as inconveniences. The only one who showed them any consideration was the daughter-in-law. Particularly disgusting was their daughter, who ALWAYS told her husband to spend LESS on her parents, as they wouldn't know any better. Lovely kids, huh?! Anyways, after spending their time in Tokyo, they return to their hometown and grandma becomes deathly ill. You can probably guess where this is going. Despite all this, the grandparents continually say they've got good kids, even though they seem like selfish jerks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reading too much into Tokyo Story?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie for the first time this week and was amazed at how much one can love a film that moves so slowly, has no tracking shots, and no powerful protagonist. One can easily understand why it is considered a masterpiece and after viewing it, you are still somewhat haunted by this tale. But I still have questions I wish I could ask the director. For instance, while the elderly parents were treated rather shabbily by their children in Tokyo, how can we find them (the children) at fault when the parents were so dull and malleable? Am I supposed to feel sympathy for them or merely observe? Even when they went away to the spa, they seemed like strangers to each other. Not knowing Japanese customs it was, of course, odd to see so little affection between family members. Also, is there a gay theme here? Was the widowed daughter-in-law still unremarried because she didn't want a man. The closest thing to affection was when the kindly daughter-in-law left the old man's home and bid goodbye to the young female schoolteacher, his caretaker. Before the movie ends the teacher wanders to her classroom window to watch the girl's train pass by. There seems to be a romantic melancholy in this scene out of keeping with any other segment of this wonderful film. Am I seeing something that was never there?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Sine Qua Non from a Japanese Master</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw "Tokyo Story" for the first time back in the 1970's. I recently saw the film again and became interested in the life of its director Yasujiro Ozu. According to my brief research, Ozu is considered to be one of the greatest Japanese filmmaker of the 20th century. During the 1930's, he fought as a front-line soldier of the Japanese Imperial Army in China. After a discharge from the Army, he was re-conscripted in the 1940's by the Japanese Army to make propaganda films. He was a life-long bachelor who was apparently a hard-drinking but functioning alcoholic. Toward the end of his life, he had to drink several pints of sake just to start the day. Even though he was a hard working filmmaker, he was also a life-long party animal who partied really, really hard. He could be rather bad-tempered. When he was young, he got into trouble after punching a waiter at his studio's commissary. In spite of his drinking and bad-temper, Ozu was worshipped by many Japanese actors and actresses. He made many masterpieces, including "Tokyo Story," `Equinox Flower,' and "Floating Weeds," before his untimely death from cancer in 1963. Even though Ozu admired the works of his more internationally known younger colleague Akira Kurosawa, in terms of filmmaking Ozu and Kurosawa were diametric opposites. While Kurosawa's style was considered to be very different from a typical Japanese filmmaking style, Ozu was considered to be the most Japanese of all Japanese movie directors. In spite his very Japanese filmmaking style, Ozu in many ways was similar to the Swedish genius Ingmar Bergman. Just like Bergman, Ozu rarely relied on overt violence in his movies and cherished scripts with greater delicacy and subtlety than Kurosawa. While Kurosawa made different kinds of movies (i.e. samurai movies, detective stories, war movies, social statement movies), Ozu was very limited in the kind of movies he made. Towards the end of his life, Ozu only made movies about the everyday lives of typical Japanese middle-class families. This is due to the difference in the way the two masters tried to depict humankind. While Kurosawa tried to study humankind by portraying different kinds of human being (i.e. samurais, criminals, police detectives, soldiers, paupers, corrupted politicians, semi-senile old men), Ozu in his artistic maturity confined himself to making films about average middle-class Japanese. In doing so, Ozu tried to find something universal to all human beings of different races and cultures in the lives of typical middle-class Japanese families. "Tokyo Story" is a prime example of Ozu's mature style. To be honest, I was worried before I checked the comments about "Tokyo Story" on the IMDb site. I thought the modern movie audience, who grew up with Arnold Schwarznegger, Bruce Willis and Chuck Norris shoot-them-up movies, cannot appreciate or even comprehend this subtle work of art. To my pleasant surprise, numerous people saw this movie, and many of them had positive opinions about this sine qua non by the Japanese master Ozu. SLIGHT SPOILER HERE. IF YOU DON'T WANT TO READ, JUMP TO ***. In this movie, Ozu portrayed the life of a typical middle-class Japanese family consisting of aging parents and their adult children. The adult children act selfishly and callously toward their own parents while the daughter-in-law shows heart-warming tenderness. The complexity of parents-children relationship, a theme applicable to all races and cultures, is depicted with great mastery and subtlety. *** As one IMDb commentator stated, this movie might be too quiet and slow for the MTV generation; however, this movie has a deep insight and masterful depiction of human nature which are often lacking in modern American movies. As a front line soldier during the Sino-Japanese conflict of the 1930's, Ozu must have seen first hand numerous carnage far worse than anything depicted in modern American action films. However, Ozu did not need Chuck Norris' Uzi or Schwarznegger's grenades to express what he wanted to say. With his famed minimalist camera technique, which is reminiscent of Japanese haiku poems, he fully stated what he wanted to say quietly and masterfully. `Tokyo Story' is indeed a timeless masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched Tokyo story early this morning and I was, I think, receptive and sat in front of the screen with an open mind, not knowing what to expect from the(so I've been told)the great Japanese director.The film's print is not the best, and on reading the trivia for the movie, I understood why. There are older films with better visual quality(technically speaking), but the shots are imbued with imagination and restraint.I found my concentration wavering during the first half hour. Nothing seemed to be happening, and I was mentally scribbling a '5' for Tokyo story. But then my curiosity was piqued. I wanted to know what was going to happen to the main two characters. By the time the plot became evident I was hooked. The minutes passed quickly by, and at the end I was surprised that the film exceeded two hours.I was very satisfied with the way this film reveals itself without being too blatant. There is a certain honest subtlety about Tokyo Story that compels me to show respect for Ozu's effort. I am now eager to try more of his filmography. Not equal to Kurosawa's best but still a very good movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This likable film has a simple story of a nice elderly couple who go to visit their daughter and son-in-law in Tokyo, but are made to feel somewhat unwelcome.This cold-shouldering is somewhat laid on with a trowel throughout, as for example when the daughter tells an enquirer that her parents are just some visiting 'friends from the country'. It was also left strangely unclear (to me at least) just why the daughter was so unwelcoming to her parents - strange since this appeared to be the central theme of the film.Nonetheless this was generally a pretty good film, and well-acted, particularly by the charming grandparents.I am however baffled as to why this has gained the reputation of being one of the greatest films ever made, frequently appearing in critics' top 10 favourite movies. After much thought, though, I have a tentative explanation:Firstly, it's a foreign language film, hence clearly an example of High Art.Secondly, it's black-and-white and somewhat flickery - this means it must be vintage, a veritable Classic in fact.And lastly, unlike most flickery black-and-white films, it's reasonably watchable. Hence this must be something quite out of the ordinary - not merely a High Art Classic, but surely a genuine Masterpiece. One of the Greatest Films Ever Made, no less. Yup, that sounds about right.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The difference, of course, is that while both are about nothing, Seinfeld episodes are funny. Somebody did find the scene of the three old men getting drunk to be humorous, but I'm confounded if I see it that part as anything but maudlin and pathetic.My family and I lived for four years in Japan, and learned to speak some and read enough to follow street signs, at least. Some of the most striking things about this movie for me were the views of Tokyo and the infrastructure. How did they manage to rebuild their factories to rebuild their train system, only eight years after the end of the war?I gather that the Japanese of the 1950's were not a great deal like the Japanese I knew in the 80's, although the connections across three decades were visible. The Japanese women of my neighborhood were a lot more like Noriko than Shige. The older men I knew reminded me of the father -- self absorbed and uninterested in the women around them. Did you notice the way the father behaves at Atami? When he and the mother sit on the causeway and decide to go back home to Onomichi, she stands up but feels dizzy. He basically tells her to shake it off and walks on, not even looking back to see how she is. Again, after the funeral, a neighbor asks how he's doing and he talks a bit about his days will seem long without the mother's company. It's all about him, right?Reviewers notice how Noriko, the widow of a son killed in the war, is the only one who shows any compassion and interest in the parents, her in-laws. This is matched by the fact that none of the rest of the family, all of whom seem relatively successful, have any real interest in her. They have reasonably decent houses while she lives in a crappy apartment building with shared kitchen and bath facilities.Overall, I found the Japanese I knew in the 1980's to be easy to like, hard to love. With that I experience, I watched Tokyo Story and found it hard to like, hard to maintain any interest, and hard to care about. All the commentaries above that go on about how universal this film is are deluding themselves. Likewise, all the commentary about how this is one of the greatest films of all time are not comparing it to Kurosawa's best work, which totally blow this boring soap opera away.Anyway, I rate it a three -- not totally awful -- but would never spend another 2 hours and 15 minutes of my life watching it again.</fullReview>

Also: no American director would get away with filming only an elderly couple journey to Tokyo and their contexts. It's no surprise that vacuous 'thrill' artists like John Sturges and George Lucas used O's films as 'inspiration' for their empty Hollywood confections. There' just nothing else there. Would it surprise you to know that his films were despised and UNPOPULAR in JAPAN (!!). Patently overrated. That's how Ozu's unfathomable influence started, with a bunch of pseudo-art conscious Americans in the fifties confusing 'exoticism' with blatant and planned pandering to American tastes.Watch Kurosawa's "Ran" out on Criterion (at least we won't have too much moaning about THAT transfer, he?).

		<fullReview>The Tokyo Story was certainly an interesting movie about the invasion of Western culture into Japan's most solemnly kept family traditions. However, there were many problems. The characters were essentially one dimensional and were obviously employed by the director as a means to establish his political and social views, rather than for the purpose of development. The movie was essentially anti-American propaganda depicting the woes of Western civilization. Furthermore, this movie was about an hour too long. It had an overwhelming number of screen-shots of either smokestacks or nature scenes (west vs. east), and the smokestacks seemed inherently evil and very ominousing. The screenwriter director this movie which means that he probably just didn't want to cut anything. I saw a distinct and very characteristic arrogance in the director which was very distasteful. I enjoyed this movie somewhat, but by the end I just couldn't wait for it to be over. Interesting, but time-consuming.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My wife and I were able to see this film at a cold and draughty venue such as is only proper for a local Film Club. My wife dozed fitfully throughout but I was cursed with a bout of insomnia. This is a very dull film by any standards and the static cinematography does not do justice to what could well be ravishingly beautiful shots of post-war Japan. The acting is extremely mannered. The dialogue (though this could be the fault of the translation) is some of the most clichéd I have ever seen in a movie. Worst of all though, I believe Tokyo Story suffers from a problem that many modern American blockbusters exhibit. As a viewer I got the message loud and clear by the time the old couple leave Tokyo and everything after that was superfluous. I couldn't believe how many extra scenes followed. Apart from the daughter-in-law, all the children are ungrateful brats. Yes, thank you. It's obvious how badly they are all going to act when the mother dies and showing it is just an insult to our intelligence. "Stop the film" I wanted to cry out time and time again. A good example of the redundancy is right at the end: shot of old man looking lonely; shot of river; shot of old man; shot or river; closer shot of river. I can only think that you need a much closer affinity with Japanese culture to understand the subtleties. Either that or be a pretentious film critic. I would also add that I do not consider myself to a philistine or addicted to modern action films. I am in my fifties and have a very wide taste in film. Kurusawa's film Ikuru is one of my all time favourites and it has a lot in common with Tokyo Story but IMHO it is superior in every aspect to this over-rated and stupendously dull movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When i heard that this film had been critically acclaimed many times over and has been in the critics top ten films for many years i was expecting a classic. All the film was is a bunch of people who dnt seem to show emotion no matter what is happening, for example when the fathers wife dies he doesn't look bothered. Also, can somebody tell me what actually happens to make this film good. Compared to Kurosowa's films of the time like Seven Samuri and Rashomon which were fantastic this must have been the worst Japanese film I've seen to date. Half way through it i was beginning to believe that we were watchin a pair of old buskers going from house to house talking about how much sleep they had. Very disappointing picture.</fullReview>
