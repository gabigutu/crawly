		<fullReview>There's something enormously touching about this film and the way it deals with losses -- Pullman's wife and Casper's mother, in particular. And what's so clever about it is how it uses them as a tool of audience manipulation AND has the evil ghosts use Pullman in exactly the same way that we're being used. This is a smartly written screenplay. The story itself is pretty conventional and predictable: the loner girl gets teased by a popular girl (that nobody really likes) who's out to destroy her; the popular girl has a cute boyfriend that the loner girl has the hots for, etc. etc., story will resolve itself with everyone falling in love with loner girl.I can't quite understand why this movie has such a low rating. The only explanation I can think of is that people prefer emotionally "safe" movies like "Toy Story" (of the same year) that are equally brilliant technically (and have as many references), but don't sacrifice coolness by showing sentimental, sad emotion. It's possible that the movie got marketed incorrectly. The film isn't about spooks; like one of those early, wonderful Tim Burton fantasies (this film also shares with them an outstanding score), the film deals -- quite movingly, I think -- with regaining that lost sense of childhood: that moment where Casper tries to remember being alive is just wrenching. And the scene relates just as profoundly to us: just as he can't remember being alive, we can't, really, remember being kids. I was ten when I first saw this, and it had an effect on me then (Ricci's description of sunny side-up eggs making her gag subconsciously made me avoid anything less than hard boiled for ten years); this is something that I really cherish as being part of my young emotional and visual education, and it stands up today. I haven't seen the director's other films, so I have no idea whether this whole thing was a fluke or whether everything just settled in to my particular sensibility, but even outside of the emotion I think the technical aspects, the giant basement set, are enough to keep interest. And even outside of that, the acting is terrific. Cathy Moriarty is an absolute riot. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An all-time family favorite that's very touching!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ever since i was six years of age, I've enjoyed this movie. It makes me laugh, cry, and excited! i am disappointed that so many people don't like this movie. it is an all-time favorite of mine. It is sad yes, but it has comic relief from the three uncles that try to be humanlike, Casper, the friendly ghost that knows what it is like to be lonely, for instance me, and same with Kat. I am very touched with this film, for it makes me think about me, lonely and depressed, but it has a positive ending which I really adored! i also liked the amazing effects, that were famous at its, time. Of course now, effects from movies are like The Matrix films and LOTR, but i mainly like this film, because it tocuhes my heart in a both sad and sometimes happy, knowing, someone else is out there for you, even if you are a bit...dead. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Who says there are no such things as ghosts? Not if there is the ghostly inhabitants of Whipstaff Manor in Friendship, Maine! This desolate mansion is then, in the words of one of the members of the Ghostly Trio of Whipstaff, 'intruded' by Kat Harvey (Christina Ricci) and her eccentric father Dr. James Harvey (Bill Pullman), a ghost therapist. Carrigan Crittenden (Cathy Moriarty) had hired Dr. Harvey to exorcise the ghosts, including Casper the friendly ghost and his three obnoxious uncles, Stretch, Fatso and Stinkie, aspiring to gain Whipstaff's 'buried gold'.Intertwining humour, all-time fun and a modern Cinderella story, 'Casper' promises to please as a movie which is compelling, hilarious, captivating, heart-warming, witty and above all, truly 'fleshtastic'.'Casper' is recommended for any audience, regardless of age. At the time I am submitting this review I am currently 17, turning 18, but 'Casper' still manages to appear endearing and ultimately special. The magic of Bill Pullman, Christina Ricci as well as that of director Brad Silberling, executive producer Steven Spielberg, and other producers weaves between each and every scene to eventually lift us off our feet. Above all, I LOVE THIS MOVIE! Casper is my all time favourite character. Truly fantastic. You won't BOOlieve it until you see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie With Various Perspectives</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After reading the comments, I see most people enjoy this movie with a few picking it over nothing (e.g. not an accurate portrait of ghost?). I first saw the movie in my preteen. It was a fun &amp; 'cute' movie, highly entertaining with the trio &amp; treasure hunting &amp; stuff.As I grew older &amp; revisit this movie, I see more 'layers' of the movie other than a 'kiddie ghost story'. Dr. Harvey (Bill Pullman, excellent as usual) is having a hard time dealing with the death of his wife, &amp; Kat (Ricci, a great break from the cool-headed Wednesday Adams) is having a hard time adjusting her father's constant move as well as grieving her mother on her own. Then, there is Casper grieving his own death as well as his father's death. And then there is Carrigan's mourning her father... not leaving her all the riches. Then there is Casper's heroic act (go see the movie, it's one of the most touching moment), Dr. Harvey's reunion, etc. etc.From a child's point of view, it's pure entertainment. From an art lover's point of view, you have to awe at the special effect &amp; sets. From an audience seeking emotional outlet, well, bring in an extra box of kleenex. It's a very touching, warm-hearted, humorous, sweet little movie about a friendly ghost named Casper.Just a side note, it is quite interesting to watch Addams' Family &amp; Casper &amp; Sleepy Hollow &amp; see Christina Ricci grow from the eccentric Wednesday Addams to a regular teenager Kat Harvey to a beautiful young lady Katrina Van Tessel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't view films as if I'm watching them as the intended audience; I watch them for myself. And that's why I found it odd at how engrossed I was when I watched this film for the first time at the age of eighteen. Aside from the great gothic flair of the mansion, two superbly placed cameos, and nice laughable black humour from the "trio," the film took off because of its emotional core. It's something that a youngster can really get into, but also anyone who finds it sad that a child can die. When Casper plays with his toys, I just wanted to start crying. This eternal child--lost and stuck in an age of mystery and wonder. And yet, he's smitten with a girl--he's starting to go through puberty. And it's just so sad . . . and beautiful. And then there's the father, and his sway into the afterlife, his daughter's plight, her struggle with her wish to help Casper. It's all so simple and written for kids, but I was so engrossed by the romanticism of it all. The villains mostly butt into the greatness of all of it, but you just have to grant that in a kid's picture. And now comes my but . . . in the end, when the mother does appear, she's supposed to be this amazing, angelic, deux es machinal, she floats through the stain glass window, her long hair flows around her, her gown flows all around her but--what the hell! why is her dress such a deep red!? she looks like satan! Oh well. Bad costume choice made a really bad moment. But mostly, I loved this film for it's good parts, despite the childishness of much of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful and emotional tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember seeing this movie as a kid, and I loved it even then. I was a fan to the Casper cartoons, and to me, this was a great movie. As a kid, it was just entertaining. Looking at it again as I am older, I now love this movie more than just because it's about my favorite friendly ghost. This movie does a good job clenching the issue of death and either letting it go and hang onto it as a ghost with unfinished business. The atmosphere, although often times comical (which is how it is with the cartoons too XD), has a really deep and emotional air to it, as we look at Dr. Harvey and Kat's loss at the wife/mother's death, as well as Casper's mourning for his life and loneliness as a ghost. The music itself is very beautiful, and the set gives a perfect background for both spooky and sentimental moments. If you're one who is looking for a good emotional ghost story, this is a great example, even though it was based on a cartoon. If you're looking for something comical, well, the three ghosts Stretch, Fatso, and Stinky are there to provide laughs, as they really do seem to be having a ball being floating ethereal beings capable of shifting themselves into horrific (and hilarious) shapes.I don't remember much from the Casper cartoons, but it's not like you can totally base an entire movie on just those. The plots for the cartoons vary, and this movie could be counted as some sort of canon, I suppose. Either way, it does a good job capturing the lonely, friendly ghost that is Casper on the big screen (and TV set).Go ahead and rent the movie; I'm looking forward to searching for a DVD for it so I can watch it again and again. I love it. I totally recommend this for everyone, kids and grownups alike.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've owned this movie for 7 years now, but I was having a "kid" moment last night and after I watched SNL I put this on. Wow, it all came back to me how much I loved this movie.Casper himself is played as a lot little boy, very real and unsure of himself at the age of 12. He falls in love with Kat in such an innocent way that it's touching. And when he says as she falls asleep, "Can I keep you?" I start to cry. His speech about his death would make a great short acting monolouge.Kat is a smartass and highly intelligent, showing Christina Ricci as the funny, witty, and all-around cool actress she is. Her portrayal of Kat is reminisent of a similar movie that came earlier...Winona Rider as Lydia in "Beetlejuice" without the fascination with death.Of course, Bill Pullman is great in whatever he does, but here you just wanna wrap the poor guy up in a hug. And his dynamic with the FANTASTIC Ghostly Trio pretty much makes most of the movie sparkle.What could've been a sappy ending is done with such magic. A 17-year-old Devon Sawa in one of his first roles walks down the stairs and extends his hand to Kat with such perfect love and tenderness. And I cheer when the FINALLY kiss. He looks like such an angel.All around, a great movie. Funny, romantic, the perfect blend of sappyness and sentimentality that MAKES for a tear-jerker ending. Great job!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No such thing as ghosts?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember that when I watched 'Casper'in the movie theater I liked the story very much. Now,10 years later, I still enjoy this movie very much.Carrigan is an ambitious and evil woman, and when her father dies, all she wants is her father's money,but the only thing she inherits is a big and old mansion. Angry, she throws her father's will in the fire, until she realizes that the will has tips to go into a hidden treasure. The problem is that the mansion is damned and full of ghosts. She contacts Dr.James Harvey,(Bill Pullman) a paranormal expert and a type of a''ghosts' Shrink'' to take the ghosts away from her mansion. James and his daughter Kat(Christina Ricci) stay living in the mansion, while Dr. James tries to have success in his work. Strech,Fatso and Stinkie are Casper's uncles and they are not friendly at all; they love to scare people and to treat Casper very badly. Kat an Casper becomes friends, since friendship is what they were searching the most . Casper tells Kat about how he died and she tells him about her mother, that also died and is one of the reasons why her father become a ghost's shrink. We also see that Kat hates to travel all the country because of her father's job and how she is far away from being one of the ''popular girls''.One of the sweetest and cutest moments of this movie, is when Casper becomes a human and dances with Kat. It's sad and also very romantic. Sadly, Devon Sawa, the actor who played the human Casper doesn't look like that anymore.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After you get through the stresses of your day... your job, the hassles of daily life, all the stressers that are out there daily, it seems great to sit back and enjoy something that will take you out of that for a little while. If you watch the news and read the papers every day like I do, it gets to you after a while...the young soldiers being killed in Iraq, all the election BS that we are being bombarded with right now...all or most of the news is downright depressing. That creates an important place for a movie like this...one that can make your life a little less serious for a while. I've always been a Christina Ricci fan, going back to the Addams Family when she was only 11 years old. She was a great actress even at that young age. You could tell that she would go far as an actress. The personality was there...it set her apart from her peers. At the age of 15, she continues to do a great job in Casper...she is very believable. Sometimes, in this troubled world where violence and negative things seem to be the norm, a nice little movie like this can go a long way toward making your day a little brighter. Some of my other "feel good" movies are Patch Adams, all the Superman movies, the Robocop series, and good old Babe. Thanks for reading this. Feel free to reply with an email.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More Heartfelt than one might expect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently re-watched this and despite the fact that its been 20 years since I originally watched this a young kid, I still loved it immensely.The story is fairly simple: a rich, hateful woman inherits a house and hopes to find treasure hidden to get rich quick. She is scared away by Casper the friendly ghost and his three uncles, who are not so friendly.So she hires a psychiatrist, Dr. James Harvey, to exorcise the ghosts. He moves in with his young daughter Kat, who still misses her mother greatly. She is scared at first, but quickly befriends Casper.Watching this movie with a friend was emotional due to the fact that he had lost his wife about 2 years prior to this film being released, so the scenes toward the end with the spirit of Dr. Harvey's wife and Casper, and then her spirit and Dr. Harvey were bittersweet and a little close to home.This was a very good, enjoyable film, and this is coming from someone who also loved the cartoon as a kid. My grade: B.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found Casper to be quite entertaining. It's a great film for the entire family and a good one to watch around Halloween. The story is quite sad yet very funny and the special effects are superb. To summon up this film, I would say "young love at it's finest".This movie brings to my mind thoughts of "if I could talk to a loved one who is dead" and/or "if I could meet someone that is dead". The curiosity of meeting someone from another time period even if they are dead (a ghost) came to my mind while watching this film. Thoughts of talking to dead family members also weighed on my mind as the film progressed.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vastly underrated, highly enjoyable family film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a lot to like in "Casper." Though the plot centered around early teenager Kat Harvey is fairly conventional and formulaic, the film makes up for it with fairly meaty side plots, solid dialogue and acting and special effects that are unpretentious yet perfectly executed and more than adequate for suspension of disbelief.A lot of people disliked this film or thought it unsuitable for children. I guess nowadays people tend to view death as not a "kid" subject, a curious point of view considering its ubiquity. "Casper" works as a fantasy-spook comedy because it does not pretend to some sort of "realistic" conception of life after death: it plays off folkish notions inherited from religion, myth and popular legend and offers its own spin that can be viewed as deeply or as lightly as one wishes. Along the way the film hints at potential resolutions for so many of the philosophical and existential conflicts that have puzzled great thinkers for ages: free will vs. destiny, suffering for good vs. reward for evil, temporal vs. eternal, the pain of loss and the need to live.To wit, it's fun and largely free of the worst sorts of vulgarities that plague so many movies of this sort. I would say it's more appropriate as a "family" centerpiece than as sleepover fare, but hardly inadequate for children whose parents have strong convictions and can answer the tough questions that may follow.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Casper is a 1995 film that stars Bill Pullman from While You Were Sleeping,Christina Ricci from Penellope and Brad Garrett who voices Fatso in this movie. The movie tells the story of Casper a friendly boy who happens to be a ghost. Kat Harvey(Ricci)and her dad Dr James Harvey(Pullman) (who is a ghost hunter btw)move to another city and land in a house that was once owned by a young boy who use to live there.But what Kat and her dad don't know is that Casper and his uncles Stretch,Fatso and Stinkie are still living in the house. Of course the reason why Dr Harvey moves is because these people(who were going to live in this house that they moved in,is haunted so he stays there with his daughter).Also Dr James Harvey lost his wife so he raises Kat by himself.So when Kat one day is packing her bags in her room,Casper shows up and she freaks out that she can see him. Kat of course has to start school and she gets bullied by this girl who wants to have a Halloween party. But when Kat mentions that she lives in a haunted house,the kids want Kat to have her party in her place. But the girl who bullies her sets up some guy to go with her as a date where she has her party. Of course Casper later falls for Kat and his afraid to admit it since Casper is dead and can't come back to life. So he tells Kat later on in the film that there is a machine that his deceased dad worked on that can bring people back to life again. So will Casper become a human and be with Kat?Well overall I liked this film as a kid and I found it to be a truly heartwarming story. The charcthers are cute and I like the chemistry between Ricci and the guy that voices Casper. Also I like how Casper wishes to be human for one night and Ricci's charcthers mom shows up and makes his wish come true. So he becomes a human for the night to be Kat's date. I found it cute.Overall like I said I liked this movie as a kid and I still do.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfect family entertainment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll admit right from the off I'd never heard of 'Casper The Friendly Ghost' until 1993 when I went to my local multiplex to see the Kevin Costner and Clint Eastwood movie 'A Perfect World' in which a child steals a Halloween costume. So I didn't know much going into this movie. I believe this is the first feature film with a computer-animated title character, and for me the effects are outstanding. Eric Idle and Cathy Moriarity are splendidly devious, if under used, whilst fresh from pairing with Sandra bullock in 'While You Were Sleeping' Bill Pullman is a lot of fun as the Dad.As for Christina Ricci, following on from her awesome performances in the Addams Family movies, it was around this time I thought, she had the potential to be a good Demi Moore type actress, once she grew up. Things haven't quite panned out that way, but she is still a working actress. Coincidently she would costar with Moore in 'Now &amp; Then' the same year, but she was not playing a younger Moore, as I expected, but a younger version of Rosie O Donnell. Poor casting in my eyes.There are some nice cameos from Clint Eastwood, Mel Gibson Rodney Dangerfield, but it's the appearance of Dan Aykroyd as Dr. Raymond Stantz (from Ghostbusters (1984)) who runs out of the house frantically and says, "Who you gonna call? Someone else!" That brought the biggest smile to my face.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have loved Casper since I was of five years of age it's a film that makes you feel so many emotions you laugh and you cry. Every person has a place in their heart for Casper the little friendly ghost who just who just wants a friend. Kat and her farther Dr. James Harvey are living the life of a paranormal therapist, in which they are never in one place too long until they move into the Whipstaff Manor. There they become friendly with Casper and his three unfriendly obnoxious uncles Fatso, Stretch &amp; Stinkie. The story unravels and you begin to like Casper more and more. Kat becomes very close with Casper and discovers a newspaper article that describes how Casper's heartbroken father created a machine called the Lazarus designed to resurrect his dead son. You learn more &amp; more and your emotions run wild with the film the end scene is so touching when Kats mothers ghost makes an appearance to her lonely father James absolutely touching. All ages will love it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I recall this film popping out of nowhere really, saw a trailer for it out of the blue, liked the look of it and went to see it. The creepy Addams Family visuals along with some really sweet looking effects hooked me and overall I really enjoyed this little kiddie flick.The plot is a simple Scooby Doo type affair really. There's a big old spooky mansion where Casper and his three uncle ghosts reside. An evil tyrannical female inherits the mansion and wants to find the treasure hidden within its bowels (then tear it down), problem is the ghosts. So she hires Bill Pullman (a paranormal therapist) and his daughter Ricci to get rid of the spooks.This being a kids flick its very predictable so I needn't tell you how things unfold. What I will say is the film is a highly enjoyable ghostie adventure with some really nice looking cobweb ridden sets, charming locations, quirky humour, acceptable performances and great CGI amazingly. The ghost effects on Casper are really nice and hold up well today. He's easily the best of the bunch visually, he looks quite realistic actually. The three naughty uncles are slightly more cartoonish looking and act so. The jokes and slapstick from them is very childish, you can see the one liners and sight gags coming a mile off but that's expected. Other ghosts that materialise during the film also look more like cartoons and not as effective as Casper, not too sure why Pullman's wife appears as a proper human though when all the others are CGI, emotional moment I guess.The other thing that impresses is how well the actors interact with the CGI spooks, believe it or not but they do look in all the right places and at the right times. You'd half expect this film to have hokey effects and badly directed live action but its really good all the way through. There are some unnecessary quickfire cameos that's for sure, the only clever one was seeing Dan Aykroyd turn up as 'Ray Stantz', I liked that.Hot on the heels of a certain Charles Addams creation Ricci follows on with her adopted kooky persona with this halloween caper, and its suits her perfectly. Pullman is a blundering but lovable father to Ricci's character whilst Casper is voiced nicely and acted well by a young Devon Sawa in human form. The only let down is the rather lame villainess and her henchman played by Eric Idle who didn't really need to be here.At times this film is actually very sweet and can bring a lump to your throat, it has that sickly sentimental touch, especially during the finale. But overall this is a great fun film if you enjoy light-hearted supernatural silliness. To sum up it isn't too far from a kids version of 'Beetlejuice' or 'High Spirits' and much better than the Eddie Murphy vehicle 'The Haunted Mansion'. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Has the magic of classic family films, but extremely flawed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Childhood memories. As of recently I have been re-watching some movies I watched and liked as a kid. From what I remembered this was one of the better ones so I decided to sit down and take a look at it.The plot, it's very disjointed but I'll say it in the best way possible. A woman inherits one of her father's condemned mansions. Once she finds out it holds a treasure somewhere they look inside it only for it to be haunted by three mischievous ghosts and one friendly one. Ghost hunter after ghost hunter fails so they get a psychologist who specialises in getting ghost's unfinished business done. After that it shifts to the psychologist and his daughter talking to the ghosts, the daughter going to school, her and Casper developing a friendship.Onto the complaints as I said the plot is disjointed, some of the dialogue does get extremely weak around the middle and that it does seem a little bit more reliant on special effects than anything else. Although unlike other movies where this happens (if you want an example look at the movies playing in your theater, that's full of them) this one actually has heart (it maybe to a small extent but it does have heart).Now, if you're looking for a mindless watch that is humorous and entertaining then this could be for you - you could do with a lot worse. The three uncles are worth watching for their humour along with Eric Idle and Cathy Moriarty as the villain.I also enjoyed the soundtrack for this movie. It is very fitting and although most of the time it is the same melody it doesn't get irritating.So if you want an hour and a half of mindless entertainment of family fun then this might be the one for you. Don't expect much but it is worth watching if you have kids and they want to see something new that you might also enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>And to think that Casper from the Nostalgia Critic episode was freaking annoying</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, he still is. When I watched the Nostalgia Critic episode reviewing this movie, I can't believe how ungodly annoying he is. I feel like I just want to punch that flying, balding little yobbo square in the face. I mean he's so annoying he makes Spongebob Squarepants look like a normal person. But, never mind that episode, let's take a good long look at this movie. 1) The pointless cameos. Okay, don't get me wrong but Clint Eastwood, Dan Akroyd, and Ben Stein are way too talented to make cameo appearances in this moronic piece of monkey diarrhea. 2) Overuse of puns. "California Roll", "Smell-o-gram", "Closet Case", and a dozen others make no sense and aren't funny even if you TRY(emphasis on the word try) to put effort in them. 3) Casper. When I was a kid, Casper was a kind of friendly ghost you'd know(Just like in the cartoon's theme song), but adults and animals would turn literally white and run away if they come across him and that's for laughs. Well, in this movie, maybe Casper got a little TOO friendly. Just don't expect this ghost to come back and haunt you anytime soon, that's all I could say.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nice "family" film about ghosts (real quality family entertainment) who live in an old mansion. One of them, Casper, is not a bad ghost, and he embraces Kat (Christina Ricci) and her father (Bill Pullman) when they move into the house. Good special effects, interesting adaptation of the Harvey comic, and good cast (including a cameo from a Ghostbuster himself), but this film really just remains OK because it fails to come above the material. Followed by very unnecessary sequels.3/5 stars -John Ulmer</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A surprisingly good live-action take on one of the most-beloved characters in cartoon history. Pullman and Ricci are topnotch, and the effects are spectacular without being obtrusive. The end, with Casper taking human form in order to dance with Ricci, is perfect. Strongly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Forget the story. Forget the characters; forget even the kids and rent this just to be able to see Whipstaff Manor.For me a film can be rewarding if just one element (in practical terms, it has to be an element I can recognize) is best in class. Here, it is the absolutely engaging set.At the end of the 19th century, a style of art, essentially a fad, swept over Europe: Art Nouveau. This focused on natural forms and continuous lines. Done well in drawing and sculpture, its quite charming. At the same time, there was a crisis in architecture as the first real architects sought solutions to how internal space affects the psyche. For only a decade or so, architects tried to employ art nouveau in their work.The problem is that the two just don't naturally mix: it's as if someone tried to do a swimmingpool production of Hamlet. But two geniuses partly succeeded in a few experiments: Horta in Brussels and Gaudi in Barcelona. In their lives their experiments were rejected by the public and critics. Today, they are among only a few valued gems of modern architectural history we have.So much for background. What we have in Whipstaff Manor is a reworking of Gaudi, with some elements of Horta in entry and staircase. This is notable for a couple reasons:---The primary mission of a film is to convey a tone, ideally an unfamiliar one. Sometimes cinematography is the tool of reliance, sometimes costumes, sometimes surreal plot twists, rarely acting posture. Rarely, rarely is the set the star. The goal of Gaudi was to (in a very literal sense) raise spirits by the form of the space. See how you feel in the bedroom/corridor and `livingroom' spaces. The attic was done by a lesser talent and the cellar isn't part of this discussion. But the main house draws on some deeply spooky center of the mind. ---The second notable comment is the sheer difficulty of what the set designers have done. Gaudi, an absolute master, had difficulty pulling off what he did. Here, the Casperites had an even greater challenge: when I go in a space, the relationship between me and the space is intimate; just a simple dialog. But when the space is presented through a medium, the designers have to dramatically exaggerate elements so the combined effect appears `normal.' Its the same as with what actors must do as compared to ordinary people you encounter; but an environment is more complex, more multidimensional, less semiotically loaded than a person. Mastering this greater palette of form is remarkable, and that's before you even accommodate the physical needs of production (camera placement, sound wiring...)Check this out; it's interesting. Just based on the set, I place this in my best films list.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A paranormal expert and his daughter bunk in an abandoned house populated by 3 mischievous ghosts and one friendly one. Based upon the animated Casper Series starring Bill Pullman and Christina Ricci and it was released in 1995 now is Casper a bad movie? Absolutely no it's funny but it's mostly a movie about adventure and friendship between this girl Kat played by Ricci and Casper the friendly ghost now i remember watching the TV series that was based upon the film when i was younger and i always liked Casper not a crazy big fun but a pretty good character. What i loved the most about the film tho is the uncredited cameos by Mel Gibson, Clint Eastwood and of course Dan Aykroyd who returns as Dr. Raymond Stantz in a small cameo. The film also had Steven Spielberg as an executive producer and late James Horner on the Soundtrack. Casper is an underrated film that is fun for both kids and their parents.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Carrigan Crittenden (Cathy Moriarty) is angry that her father left her only a rundown mansion. Her sniveling lawyer Paul Plutzker (Eric Idle) finds out that it has buried pirate gold. The house is haunted by Casper the friendly ghost and his not-so-friendly uncles; Stretch, Fatso and Stinkie. Dr. James Harvey (Bill Pullman) became a therapist to the dead after the heartbreaking death of his wife and brings his daughter Kat (Christina Ricci) to every job. Carrigan hires Harvey to get the pesky ghosts out of the way.This is mostly a harmless kids movie. Ricci is adorable and sharp. She's the star of the movie. Bill Pullman is OK as the father. He could be more of a bumbling nerd. Moriarty is always good as a broad villain. Casper is not that bad and retains his cartoon nature. He has a great childlike persona. Although I would like the ghosts to be less transparent. The story is fine until the father dies. That's where the movie loses me a little. It's a bit too dark and serious dealing with life and death.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's Casper, The Friendly Ghost!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Casper is such a lovely tale. I'm so thankful that in 1995 this sweet story made its way onto the big screen. It's so kind-spirited and so good! As a kid I watched Casper and was fond of it, and now some 20 years since that time, I've really come to realize and appreciate Casper for the genuinely sweet and quite precious film that it is, and you should too! It's a perfect film for kids! Casper the Ghost is so lovable! Casper the Ghost is an original and well-illustrated character to begin with, but the creative way that Casper and his ghostly friends are brought to life in this wonderfully magnificent family film is truly very special. Casper's sets and special effects are so impressive. Christina Ricci does such an incredible job as Kat. I adore her having only good things to say for the so very cute Christina. (She's so refined with her acting at a young age. She should of won the academy award!) Bill Pullman's excellent as Kat's dad, Dr. James Harvey, as he brings his real heart to the show. Casper has a beautiful, kind score. I rate Casper a 6 in critical regard but oh, big whoop! Who cares, really? What does that even matter? Casper is an all out 10 in all of the good ways that count, and that's what matters! An unforgettable, all-time 10, I love! Casper is sooo sweeeet!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A delight for children and adults who can find the inner-child in them.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Taking the classic comic book and cartoon onto the big screen, this version of the story of the friendly ghost gives the viewer an inside look as to who Casper really was and his life before and after becoming the sweet spirit. Fresh from her star-making role of Wednesday Addams, Christina Ricci is perfect to play the poor child who is initially scared of him but soon wants to help the spirit of the child find out the truths. Her father Bill Pullman also gets involved as do the sinister Eric Idle and Cathy Moriarty as the agent and owner of the house who hire Pullman to get rid of the spooks which includes more than just Casper. Moriarty is particularly entertaining as one of the most outrageous of greedy characters, and her shrieking (which made her the scene stealer of "Soap Dish") takes over here as well to make her unforgettably funny.There are some delightful surprises in this mostly sweet-natured tale of the tying together of two different generations of children, one live, the other dead, the greed of adults, and the Peter Pan like belief in a world beyond our grasp. Try not to feel tears of joy and nostalgia when Casper takes Ricci on the train ride to his long hidden bedroom and is later allowed to face the truth of why he is who he is. Ricci and Pullman too also face the loss of their mother and wife, although one of Casper's prankster uncle ghosts also gets in the way comically. This is a family film that proves to be innocent yet never juvenile and cloying.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So-so</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In its spookiest and most poignant moments (such as Bill Pullman being reunited with his dead wife), 'Casper' hints that it suffers from a bad case of unfulfilled potential. It's enjoyable enough, and the cartoony CG effects are pretty good despite being used to realise characters as irritating as Casper's obnoxious uncles. The problem is the lightweight treatment of what could have been a darker and more memorable kids' film: Brad Silberling's direction fails to conjure up any magic, the humour isn't that funny, and the numerous cameos are pointless (although Dan Aykroyd gets a laugh). It's all frustratingly uneven and underdeveloped, but as it's so forgettable the frustration doesn't last long.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A nice, likable movie for all</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Casper is a movie that I enjoy watching over again even after 17 years this 1995 movie is very impressive, the acting and performance that both Pullman and Ricci pulled off is one that I sure admire, as both actors had to act without anything being there, as the ghosts were CGI effects added after filming, so when this two act scared and are talking, there were doing it talking to just air.The movie is interesting and likable, the plot holes are very obvious, with the whole crossing over thing, but the movie production is good enough to make you ignore the plot holes.The movie is based on a Children's book titled: The Friendly Ghost released in 1939 and an animated series done in 1945. It is directed by Brad Siberling who did a moderately good job here and who went ahead to direct City of Angels (1998) which was also not well received and Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events (2004).The movie plot starts with the antagonist Carrigan discovering that her late father willed to her an abandoned house. This made her furious cause all she wanted were his money. While disposing of the papers to the house she discovered a paper saying that there is a treasure hidden in the house.She, now ready to get the treasure goes to the house only to discover that it is being haunted by 4 ghosts, so she hired Dr. James Harvey (Bill Pullman) to help exorcise the ghost. James moved into the house, with her daughter Kat (Christina Ricci) although James has experience dealing with ghost he has not actually seen one, so both he and his daughter were scared to bits when they moved in.They soon discovered to among the 4 ghost that there is a friendly one named Casper. With Carrigan deadline approaching James is stuck with the task of getting rid of the Ghost who seemed to be rather enjoying their haunted house.Casper was a huge commercial success bringing in way over 280 million from its 55 million production cost, but the movie didn't receive good reviews, holding a 44% approval rating from critics in rotten tomatoes. The movie's down side is the role of the antagonist Carrigan (played by Cathy Moriarty), she seemed viciously stupid, the writers made her money hungry which in turn made her throw it all away just to get a treasure box, a treasure box that she did not know what it contained.Putting it all together, this is a nice DVD to own. Casper had two sequels (that I know off) Casper: A Spirited Beginning (1997) and Casper meets Wendy (1998). The sequels featured new people, but the ghosts Casper, Stretch, Stinkie and Fatso all were present in the sequels Cathy Moriarty who played Carrigan in this movie was also in Casper meets Wendy in the movie she plays the head witch. None of the sequels are anywhere as good as this original, so don't even bother.www.lagsreviews.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a child there were few movies that I enjoyed watching over and over again, but once in a while there was that one movie that just impacted me. Casper is one of those movies...the acting may not be the best and many may have taken the movie too seriously upon seeing the reviews. But the overall message and story of Casper is wonderful, and I want my children to be able to watch this someday and enjoy it as much as I certainly have. Thank you Bill Pullman for once again putting your style into such a unique and fun movie. Plus I get a kick out of the one guy with the monotone voice who was in the eye-drop commercials every time, forgive me I am too lazy to look up his name.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Family Targeted Movie But Really For Adults.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just about every single cartoon has been turned into a feature length film. So in 1995 Universal decided to do a film of Casper. So to ask the same question as I did in my Josie And The Pussycats Review, Does it work? The film is about Dr. James Harvey played by Bill Pullman and his daughter Kat played by Christina Ricci who move into a new house in Friendship, Maine. Little do they Know that the house they moved into has a friendly ghost named Casper. The house is also being over run by SNOOTY rich girl Carrigan Crittendon played by Cathy Moriarty and her assistant Dibs played By Eric Idle who want the fortune in the house.This movie works in so many ways because I think it appeals more to adults than to kids. This is a really vulgar film filled with a ton of curse words and sexual innuendos. The film is very funny (Especially The cameo made by Dan Akroyd playing Ray From Ghostbusters)and I would pop this movie in anytime of the day. Definitely check this out.Rated PG For Mild Language And Thematic Elements.1hr 41min/101min.****/****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some may think I'm silly for rating this movie so highly, but I'm not. You're all silly for rating this movie as something made for adults, which is the only explanation for why this is sitting on a rating of 5.7/10I suppose technically this is a "Family" movie, but I think we can all agree that it's a movie made primarily for children to enjoy, so it should be rated as such. For a movie made for children to enjoy, this has got to be one of the best. It's an interesting story, with some fantastic actors, especially Bill Pullman. The love and friendship between Casper and Cat is heart warming and beautiful, and the 3 ghosts that like to cause trouble for the sake of fun are just that! FUN! There is plenty of imagination in this movie which still excites me to this day.Are there flaws? Yes, there's plenty of them, like there is in nearly ALL family films. Youngsters don't notice or even care about them, and speaking as a 19, going on 20 year old who adored this movie during my childhood, and who loves smartly written movies that make you think, I can still appreciate this movie as much as I did when I was a young boy.If this was a movie made for adults, then I agree, 5.7/10 would be a fair rating. But it isn't, it's a film made for kids to enjoy, and as such, I rate it 8/10 since I personally enjoyed it much more than most other kids movies.Also, Casper is the worlds first CGI lead character in a movie. That's pretty darn cool from a technical standpoint.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Casper is one of those films that was clearly made with the children in mind. The plot holes are huge, the idea is ridiculous, and the movie is pretty sloppily arranged. That said, kids do not focus on those things. They will be fascinated with the idea of the friendly ghost and his interactions with the family living in their house. The Ghostly Trio are an extremely annoying collection of characters but the rest of the cast does quite well. Bill Pullman is fun enough to watch as the paranormal psychiatrist and Christina Ricci as his daughter is great.This is a good movie to watch around Halloween time with the kids. It is tame enough that they won't be frightened but at the same time it has a very gloomy/autumn feel to help add to the Halloween season. Grab your candy corn and watch this one with your kid. But make sure they brush their teeth, dental bills add up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cute if disjointed film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This live action take on the beloved cartoon ghost first introduced back in 1945 marks his big screen debut and although the end result isn't perfect, it makes for an entertaining film.This story concerns two baddies who find out about a long lost treasure hidden in a Gothic mansion in Maine. The only thing standing in their way is the ghosts that haunt the place. Enter Dr. James Harvey (Bill Pullman) and his daughter Kat (Christina Ricci) to exterminate the spooks.The movie isn't perfect. The story lacks direction, the serious questions about death often undermine the charm and the final scene drags on but the film certainly has it's moments. The cast performs admirably with a nice series of cameos from the likes of Dan Aykroyd, Rodney Dangerfield and even Clint Eastwood. The best performance goes to Eric Idle as the weaselly henchman, Dibbs who quite literally goes out with a bang. In all, an enjoyable if somewhat empty film.If nothing else, "Casper" has the distinction of being the only film ever to feature both Mr. Rogers and The Cryptkeeper.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>BOOOOOOOOO!!! This movie sucks!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While, I was never a huge fan of the 1950's Famous Studios theatrical animated cartoon series of the same name. I have to say, at least that had some heart. This movie directed by Brad Silberling is nearly soulless. It's child-unfriendly humor and an overly-dark tone, with completely pointless backstory is something, this beloved cartoon didn't need. It was too grim. I don't know why, I gave this movie, a try, when it first came out. Maybe, it's because it had Christina Ricci as the main lead, Kathleen "Kat" Harvey searching why the ghosts, haunt their house, while also looking for buried treasure. She was one of my celebrity crush, when I was growing up in the 1990s. However, I wasn't as obsess with her, like Casper (Voiced by Malachi Pearson) was here. He was borderline creepy in this film. The way, he says 'Can I keep you?' is chilling, not in a good way. Also, the way, he find her, attractive in his dead mother's dress is kinda gross. I thought, he was supposed to be a friendly ghost, not an obsessive serial stalker. I really don't like, the necrophilia type relationship between the two. Another thing, I hate about the film is how annoying and mean-spirited Casper's uncles, are. Are we sure, this movie is based on the Harvey Comics by Seymour Reit and Joe Oriolo of the same name? I don't really, remember, the ghost that Casper hang out with, being so ugly-headed and obnoxious. I would rather have the original, Fatso, Lazo, and Fusso than these new Ghostly Trio, Stretch (Voiced by Joe Nipote), Stinkie (Voiced by Joe Alaskey) and Fatso (Voiced by Brad Garrett). They are the worst thing about this movie. Their use of vulgar language and toilet humor was indeed too jarring for me. Not only that, but they try to kill the main characters of the film, throughout the film. How are we supposed to cheer for these folks!? Not only that, but this movie's illogical use of pointless celebrity cameos, and several weak plots is another trouble with this film. As much as I love seeing, cameos by Don Novello as the exorcist, Father Guido Sarducci, and Dan Aykroyd as Ghostbusters' Dr. Ray Stantz as good in-jokes. I really don't get, the film's logic, here. The particularly scene where the Ghostly Trio goes inside Dr. Harvey (Bill Pullman) and changes him into Clint Eastwood, Rodney Dangerfield, Mel Gibson, and the Crypt Keeper was odd. It is never mentioned again throughout the rest of the film, nor do the trio ever use their apparent morphing-abilities again. Honestly, what is the rules of this film afterlife!? Supposedly, in this movie; ghosts are the spirits of people who had some important business left unfinished due to their death. So, what the hell is Casper's unfinished business? He says in the film that he became a ghost so that his parents wouldn't be alone since he died, but this makes no sense given the plot, since his parents died afterwards. So, if his original unfinished business was just that. Why is he still, on earth!? I get that, maybe, Casper's unfinished business was his entire life. Dying at such a young age, he never had the chance to live, and thus he remains earthbound until he experiences enough to allow him to pass on. Still, it doesn't explain, what happen to Casper's dead parents!? Did they go to heaven without him!? It's not like them, to abandon Casper! After all, when his father was alive, he built a resurrection machine just to be with his son, again. The worst possibility is that, the parents did become a ghosts, but forgot who they were and ended up leaving the manor without their son, or God punish his parents for 'playing God' and sent them to hell. Even that, doesn't make sense, since the villain of this film, was sent to heaven. The film is full of inconsistent. Way too much of it, like why does the ghosts in the film able to walk through walls, but not through something simple like vacuum bags!? How are they able to pick up some items, yet not others? Why are they able to leave, their place of haunting? Also, isn't it a bit odd, that some of the ghosts look ghostly, cartoonish of their self, while Casper looks nothing like himself, when was alive? I get that, he might be dead for a long time, and forgot what his features looks like, but this forgetting plot doesn't quite work out, since other recent ghost appears to have lost all their memories and still looks like their former selves. It get more confusing, when, Dr. Harvey's dead wife comes into the picture. She looks pretty normal, despite being dead. Also, if a ghost did use the machine, where does the body, come from, and what happen to old body? Also, why didn't Casper's parents used it? Despite all those jarring questions, the CGI work is still very convincing for 1995. Most of the acting was alright. The music by James Horner was ghoulish fun, haunting and emotional touching as well. There's also a musical number by the Ghostly Trio called 'Lucky Enough to Be a Ghost', which was cut because the special effects needed to create it, was too expensive. The rough drafts can still be found on the DVD. In my opinion, the film would work more, if they cut out, other scenes like the whole bullies trying to ruin the Halloween party, sub-plot. Movie has way too much filler as well. Overall: Despite all that, it nevertheless gained a bit of a cult following and was a success at the box office. It gained a few DTV sequels. However, I agree with Russell Harvey, heir to the Harvey Comics legacy, who hated this film. This film is unfunny and very unpleasant to watch, because of that. I can't recommended watching this 1990s kid movie at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really liked this movie, I seriously don't get the low rating. It is a most enjoyable family film, that is really sweet. My only complaints are one or two dull spots in the script and plot(primarily in the middle) and I didn't feel as though the direction was as good as it could have been. The special effects however are simply wonderful, and the sets are suitably dark and Gothic. But what made this movie for me was Casper, forgive me but he is so cute. The whole movie is well worth seeing just for him, but there are many other good things about this film too. The dance sequence especially is delightful.The music by the ever reliable James Horner is lovely, and the performances are very good. Christina Ricci matches Casper beautifully in a delightfully sweet central performance, and while Bill Pullman has been better he gives an appealing performance. Eric Idle is hilarious when he is given good material, and on the whole that's what he had. Although his dialogue wasn't always as funny as it could have been, he was still entertaining. But it is Stretch, Stinkie and Fatso who provide the most laughs. It is Cathy Moriaty though who comes close to stealing the show, with a brilliantly wacky portrayal as the villain of the piece. The script is funny and touching on the most part despite the one or two dull spots in the middling half.Overall, a winning family film. Not perfect by all means, but underrated you bet it is. At the end of the day, it's Casper's picture. 8/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

Christina Ricci's performance was amazing, as is Pullman, the voice actors of Casper and the Ghostly Trio.Shame the sequels couldn't learn from this movie over time, because it seems like they've been trying to ruin the spirit (no pun intended) of this film.

Bill Pullman is great as the psychic psychiatrist, and Christina Ricci is on the mark as his daughter. Eric Idle and Cathy Moriarty are a hoot as the villains. The supporting actors were great as well. One of the really touching moments for me was the Holloween Party sequence with Devon Sawa. If one of the theme parks has not created a thrill ride out of this film then they are missing the boat. Especially good scenes are the ones where Cathy Moriarty's character is trying to get the ghosts out of the house.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We picked this movie out to show to our kindergarten and 1st-graders at the after school care program I work at. Neither my coworker nor I had seen the movie for a long time, but remembered it being quite innocuous, and entertaining for kids. We started the movie and immediately saw why it was so entertaining. There are a great number of pop-culture references (Father Guido Sarducci makes an appearance as an exorcist, and subsequently comes out of the house with pea soup on his robe and his head turned all the way around, a reference to The Exorcist) and very witty dialogue. My coworker and I were in stitches with things that just completely went over the kids' heads. It is a very, very well-done movie, even more than I had remembered as I child.Now, for the other part. We made a big mistake showing this to our kindergarteners and 1st-graders. There is quite a bit of swearing in this movie (not BAD bad words, but they use "damn" quite a lot, they used the word "bitch" twice, "piss", "crap" etc.), and my coworker and I were worried that the kids were hearing this stuff at their age, we were scared that they were going to go home and repeat these words at the dinner table! I think this movie is great for older kids, as it is witty, funny, sweet and charming, just like a kids' movie should be, but if you have a 5-year-old, I would advise waiting on this one if you don't want him learning swear words so young :)</fullReview>

I watched it as a young adult, and the film was enjoyable and innocent. It's not a frightening film, but it's a film about friendship and understanding. It also had the humor element common in films for young adults. The other ghost characters provide this humor.This film is done well, and it is packed with action but also leaves room for the morales and patience in making friendships and learning how to understand different people or points of view.Young adults (aged 8-15) would probably enjoy this film more than any other audience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A highly memorable film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember when this movie came out in the summer of 1995. I recall, being 10 at the time, pressing my Mum and Dad to take me to the movies the very day it came out-- it was late July-- , and we had to wait in a long queue (short in comparison with the recent Star Wars films) that lasted an hour. Although my Dad didn't like it, I was fascinated by it, since I loved the old cartoon series of the 60s and 70s. I also remember being emotional-- I literally jumped up when the 3 Ghosts and Casper made their debut on the screen. I also cried when they talked about loss, such as the death of Jamers Harvey's wife, and so forth. Enough with the details, I can say that the movie was very good, not because that is based on a cartoon that I love, but because it has a good combination of an effective story, great special effects (a jump up from Rogger Rabbit's combination of animation and live-action) as well as great performances from the leading cast. Christina Ricci shines as the stressed and lonely teen Kat Harvey looking for a friend, and so does Bill Pullman, who plays Dr. James Harvey, an unconventional Psychologist looking for "spirits with unfinished business", and believes that his late wife Emilia is one. Cathy Moriarty, who plays Carrigan, a strong-willed woman who tries to snatch a treasure in the abandoned Whipstaff manor in Maine-- and the home of the 4 Ghosts and the previous two humans-- is a riot. Eric Idle, her easy-going partner-in-slime also shines with a role he undoubtedly played before in the many sketches of Monty Python. The music score, in particular the Casper theme song "One Last Wish", is the one chord that struck me really hard , it makes me cry every time I hear it and gives me a strong sense of affection every time I see this movie.But there are still a few flaws: First, the movie's pace is uneven, starting off with a perfect grabber, only to slow down to a crawl near halfway and then getting some momentum in the second half. Second, there are some scenes (such as Fatso kissing Bill Pullman as a Fake Emilia) that come and go without any meaning, so they have no reason for being there in the first place. Third, most of the supporting characters--including the jealous two "friends"-- are basically decoration sets, with also little relevance to the plot.But nevertheless, Casper's strengths manages to overpower its weaknesses, and in the end, it leaves both something for people to talk about and be entertained at the same time. Highly recommended for kids and adults alike.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic fairy tale that cannot be overcome by a remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remember the 90's? Saturday Night Live films spawning out of Lorne Michaels arse, Titanic dominated the box office, and a scareless ghost came to comfort little kids. 'Ghost therapist' Dr. James Harvey (Bill Pullman) and his daughter Kat (Christina Ricci) arrive at drafty, old Whipstaff Manor. Its greedy owner, Carrigan Crittendon (Cathy Moriarty), has hired Dr. Harvey to exorcise the house's apparitions: a friendly but lonely young ghost named Casper, who's just looking for a friend, and his outrageous uncles Stretch, Stinkie and Fatso (The Ghostly Trio). If the plan works, she and Dibs (Eric Idle), her partner-in-slime, can get their hands on the manor's fabled treasure. Meanwhile, Casper has found a kindred spirit in Kat, but The Ghostly Trio will not tolerate 'fleshies' in their house. Casper 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hadn't watched this movie since i was much younger and watching it again makes me remember why i loved it,even tho i'm 12 years older now. I really cannot understand why this movie has such a low rating. I could even go as far as to suggest that Casper is better than Toy Story. Its remarkable how a story like this one can be moving and funny at the same time. Although i read many users suggesting this is just a kid story,i really cannot agree.It can certainly appeal to grown ups as well(Who doesn't reminisce what being a kid means?,or, Who hasn't felt as lonely as Casper did at at least one point of his life?)Amazing work overall in casting,visuals and screenplay,will definitely make a lasting impression on you,no matter how old you are.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie with the possibility to be emotionally touching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched the movie when it first came out originally, back in '95. I honestly don't recall my impression of it, but I'm sure I liked it since my family bought it. I recently watched it again, and was impressed by it. I first thought it would be just a silly dumb movie, but it actually contained deeper emotional layers than I originally assumed it would have. Moments where Casper is trying to remember his life, but can't are touching. But I found the relationship between Casper and Kat the most endearing. The parallel when Casper whispers to Kat..."can I keep you" when he's a ghost and (spoiler here, just so you know) and again when he's a human and they are dancing and floating I thought was very touching. I thought it was beautiful...then he turned into a ghost again. And all the kids stared at him and he said "boo" and they ran away. Honestly I thought that kind of ruined the effect of it. It had the potential to be a very wholly depressing yet life-affirming movie....but moments like that (and a few others) ruined that possibility. But with that aside...it was still a great movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Since when did Casper become romantic?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Casper, the friendly ghost, is now in computer form! :D I have to admit, when I became a teenager, I doubted this movie just to be kinda cool and not enjoy a kid's movie. But I babysit often, and my cousins wanted to watch this again, so I slipped it in. You know what? I enjoyed it and I think I'm willing to admit that I liked it.I love this family movie because it has not only kid humor, but adult humor as well. Christina Ricci and Bill Pullman were great and it was fun to watch their first time reactions moving into the house with the evil uncles that are "disgusting and obnoxious creeps". I love their response to that "Thank you!". Casper is just a polite ghost who wants to have friends and be human again. When he discovers that his father invented a machine to make ghosts humans again, he and Christina find the only potion left that's enough for him to become human. Of course, we have our villains who want a "hidden treasure" in the mansion and set up Bill Pullman and Christina Ricci in the house to get to it. They figure the best way is to have one of them die and be able to just go through the safe. Of course, they must come back human and the only way is the potion that's enough for one person. We have another problem of the uncle's taking Bill on a drinking trip to make him one of their own to "see" his deceased wife.There is a very touching ending and I would always recommend this for a family watch. It's a cute movie with some fun jokes and cool effects. So, I am actually going to admit that I had fun and am going to give a good rating.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film that makes you happy to be alive</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a movie for people who love really happy movies, and also love happy endings. If you are in the mood for something that will almost bring tears to your eyes with joys. This is it. If you want a dark, ugly, and scary film, this is not for you. I can appreciate both, although for either I have to be in the mood. It is rather precious seeing Christina Ricci as a young teenager wearing hiking boots throughout the whole film, as opposed to the way she looks in "Sleepy Hollow." Although I can certainly appreciate the eye-candy she was in Sleepy Hollow. I guess its just neat to see her as a teenager about to bloom in someone extrodinarily beautiful. In Casper she was sweet and quite loveable. The whole film was sweet and lovable. If you didn't like this film, I will bet you really hated "The Sound of Music."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At first this movie seemed boring until Stretch, Fatso, and Stinkie appeared in the movie. They were the reason why I liked the movie. Even though they did give the Harveys and some other people a scare they were the ones that made it possible for Dr. James Harvey to visit with his wife Amelia(she was an angel). I like these three ghosts because they were funny (they definitely added a lot of comedy to the movie). All I can say about the movie Casper is "check it out."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I hate to be a spoilsport, but what message is this movie sending out?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whew...this movie had me almost to the end. It's pretty beautiful as a live-action adaptation of a pretty silly comic, but then it kind of shoots itself in the foot with a moral. I'm not one that believes that every movie must have a good message, but I would be wary to show this movie to my children. I love a good ghost story, but I'm not sure about a movie that questions the finality of death. One of the latter plot points of this movie is the death of the little girl's father, which in itself is fine plot material since many children deal with the death of a parent. At the end of the movie (and I don't consider this a spoiler because the main plot is what happens between Casper and Christina Ricci's character) they find a way to bring him back to life. I'm not sure what this is saying to kids about life and death. I don't think I'm over-analyzing the film because children are impressionable. I'm not sure if the film's themes are really appropriate for children's cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Didn't work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cathy Moriarty is the best thing in this movie, let's just make that real clear right now. Her acting was actually good, and I liked her in her villain character. As for Bill Pullman, not so much, I really felt like he was miscast in the father role. But then again, he didn't have very good material to work with here. The script is muddled and unfunny, and the movie as a whole just didn't really work, in my opinion that is. This is supposed to be a funny, cute, family movie about Casper the friendly ghost, but we didn't. I think the biggest reason this movie just doesn't make you laugh, it attempts, but it does not succeed, at least not with me it didn't. The actors seem kinda uncomfortable and unsure as to what the heck is going on, except for Cathy Moriarty, like I said before, she's good. I love her big line in this movie: "the b**ch is back!" Even though I was surprised to hear that line in a family movie, but I liked it, I thought it brought power, that was about the only line I thought was good lol. Christina Ricci was so so, she annoyed me at times, but she wasn't bad in this, she was just alright, nothing to point at and brag about, but nothing to be ashamed of either. Overall, this just did not work for me. 3/10, it only got that high really because of Moriarty.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best films ever! If you LOVE films, see this!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a perfect motion picture. It is fun, funny, and will bring tears to your eyes as it overflows with innocent romance and love. It amazes me how so much garbage that comes out of Hollywood, unwatchable garbage like "Avatar" and all those super hero movies, yet this masterpiece of writing,acting and special effects is shunned. There are many good reviews so I shall keep it short. A teen girl moves with her "ghost Psychologist" father to a haunted house to clear it out for a price. Casper lives there and is a sweet ghost and former 12 year old boy, now turned ghost. His fun and crazy three ghost "uncles" live there too and havoc ensues. The evil owner and her hilarious personal secretary (Eric Idle of Monty Python) are the real trouble makers. The friendship and romance between Ricci and "Casper" is perfect. The line that breaks my heart is when Kat (Ricci) is falling asleep and Casper cuddles up and says "Can I keep you"? It is a perfect motion picture and I watch it 5-6 times a year. Originally, the haunted house was going to be my favorite empty mansion in my home town (yes, I recommended it). Yale Univ. messed that up and the fake house they used is perfect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The saddest movie ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember watching this when I was about their age. It was one of my favorite childhood movies that I lost for many years.Casper is basically a really really sad romantic comedy for kids. Sounds like it'd be cheesy, but the comedy is distinct from the emotional bits so it's not a jumbled mess. The actors are good enough to make you give it a chance, and it just takes you from there.Casper might just be the most relatable character in film. How can't you like him? The voice actor does a fantastic job, and makes him sound like a introverted country kid without any friends.I cannot recommend it enough. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sweet family Halloween movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've watched Casper several times over the years and enjoy it each time. It is one of those films that holds up to repeated viewings quite well. A good Halloween themed family comedy, this film has a somewhat Gothic setting, some jump scares and some elements that are commonly found in the horror genre-ghosts, a haunted house, the mad scientist's laboratory, and the quest to use science to overcome the natural boundaries of mortal existence.A paranormal investigator (Bill Pullman) and his daughter (Christina Ricci) move into an old haunted house inhabited by four ghosts in the attempt to exorcise them. But Kat (Ricci) makes friends with Casper, the friendly ghost, and also arranges to have her class' Halloween party in the haunted house. Little known to any of them, the villains (Eric Idle and Cathy Moriarty) are searching the house for Casper's lost treasure. A few tragedies ensue before the film comes to its resolution.This is an entertaining film with good performances by Bill Pullman, Christina Ricci, Eric Idle and others. The script is full of humor and the special effects are fun to watch. Not a scary movie by any means, but it is a very suitable family movie for the Halloween season and can be enjoyed by the whole family.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good for children's fare, but still marred by it's sticky sweetness.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Casper is one of the most entertaining children's films I've seen. The special effects are good and cool looking, though back in 1995 they had a bigger impact than they would to someone now. The problem with this movie is it's many corny, clichd scenes and lines that induce cringing and rolling of the eyes. Other than that, and some weird plot devices, this is a nice family movie, that actually can be enjoyed by the entire family.Carrigan (Cathy Moriarty) cares about nothing but money, and all her deceased father left her was Flagstaff Manor. Supposedly there is a hidden treasure in this mansion. Unfortunately, it's also haunted. Carrigan and her bumbling idiot sidekick Dibbs (Eric Idle) try to get rid of the ghosts through various ways, but in the end they turn to Dr. James Harvey (Bill Pullman), a psychiatrist to the dead, to help their dilemma. Harvey and his daughter Kat (Christina Ricci) end up meeting the ghosts of the house. Casper is the nice one who just wants a friend, and Casper's horrible uncles Stinky, Stretch and Fatso who only want to scare people. Chaos ensues, Casper and Kat bond, Dr. Harvey tries to help the uncles and learn what has become of his deceased wife, and Carrigan tries to get the houses treasure through any means.The direction here is stellar. This is an atmospheric movie with some lovely shots, and with the material they had to work with (Which isn't bad material) the direction and style was good. The acting depends on the scene. Bill Pullman always acted the same and his character worked well, but Christina Ricci would sometimes overact a bit. Nonetheless, there was nothing unforgivable acting wise. At times, this can be a touching movie. Casper has been developed beyond his former traditionally animated self, and not only continues to have a heart, but has a moving background. You actually feel sad for this computer animated puff of air. Kat also has a sad background, though I didn't find myself caring as much that she lost her mother. A lonely 12 year old ghost who just wants a friend is just a tragic character, but of course, in a family movie this isn't going to be a tragedy.Along with the good, there was bad. Too many scenes featured cringe worthy lines such as Casper's question to Kat, "Can I keep you?" It was supposed to be sweet, and it was...just a little too sweet. The plot was sidetracked too much by subplots, which would be fine if there was any real coherent plot. From what I can tell, the main plot is that Casper wants to become alive again with the help of his father's invention. The climax is also short and rushed. These are little things though, one's that I didn't notice until after the movie was over.Casper is a sweet movie, that sometimes gives into being too sweet, but mostly it has a great mixture of emotion, comedy and special effects that make this a winner family flick.My rating: *** out of ****. 101 mins. PG for thematic elements, violence and language.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sometimes entertaining, sometimes dull</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was introduced to Casper at a very early age, and I remember often watching "Casper the Friendly Ghost", the 1945 animated short that first introduced the character to the world over forty years before I was born. I would have been around nine years old when this live action movie, featuring the cartoon character in CGI animated form, first came out. I remember seeing it twice during the '90s, though I don't think I saw the whole thing both times. If I never saw it in my childhood, I may have ended up never seeing it at all, but I just rented it yesterday, for what I believe was my first viewing of it in ten years, and it left me with mixed feelings.Carrigan Crittenden inherits Whipstaff Manor, a beat up mansion, which she is not happy with, but she and Paul "Dibbs" Plutzker find a map leading to a treasure in the mansion, and go there to find it. However, upon entering, they soon discover that the place is haunted by ghosts! Carrigan certainly won't give up here, so she hires Dr. James Harvey, a widowed psychic, to try and exorcise the building. James and his teenage daughter, Kathleen (or "Kat") move into this mansion. One of the ghosts who lives here is Casper, a lonely ghost who doesn't mean any harm, and just wants a friend, but since he a ghost, he still always scares people. Kat is scared of him at first, but he soon convinces her not to be. Unfortunately, however, Casper's three uncles, Fatso, Stinkie, and Stretch, are nasty ghosts, the kind who LIKE to scare people, and they will make Dr. Harvey's job at Whipstaff Manor more difficult! I had fairly low expectations before the last time I saw this movie. I think I liked it all those years ago, but it doesn't seem to be a very popular family movie. So, unsurprisingly, I saw a lot of mediocrity during the film. It's a comedy, and I wasn't laughing much. For example, while Kat is at school, and nobody else in the classroom knows Casper is there, he sneaks around and ties all the students' shoes together, so when the bell rings and they get up to leave, they all trip and fall. Pretty lame attempt at physical comedy if you ask me. However, there are some mildly amusing moments, like some of the ghost scare scenes. Fatso, Stinkie, and Stretch are supposed to be comic characters, and as such, they may usually not do so well, but I think they occasionally provide some amusement. Eric Idle, of Monty Python fame, plays Dibbs, and he's certainly been funnier, but his character has some good lines, such as some of the ones he says after Carrigan falls off a cliff. Also, the movie may get a bit better towards the end, with some decent excitement, as well as some rather touching moments.Overall, I think I enjoyed this movie a bit more ten years ago, so I guess it's one of those films that's more appealing to kids, despite some occasional mild language, which must be mostly what earned it its PG rating. However, it COULD appeal to some adults as well, so I won't say it's strictly for kids, though it could be fairly close. Personally, I have to give "Casper" an above average rating for the amount of entertainment value I found in it, even though that amount wasn't enough to make it a film I would want to watch multiple times, and quite a lot of it seemed to bore me. So, for many kids who like ghost stories, this particular ghost movie is probably enjoyable. For adults who want a family film with good special effects, this MIGHT be worth checking out, but I wouldn't watch it with expectations any higher than moderate</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Acceptable kids flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Friendly Ghost" has arrived on the big screen! But why? Well I guess the answer to that question is an easy one to find. Basically "Casper" has just joined the mass procession of cartoon characters who have found their way to the silver screen. None of our beloved heroes of TV. and comic strips seem safe from what now appears to be an obligatory transformation. After "Superman" made a killing at the box office in 1978, it's been an ever increasing trend that has reached a peak in recent years with movie producers scrambling to secure the film rights to the few remaining animated stars.Of course for those that have made the transition, such as "Batman", "The Flinstones" and "The Jetsons", it has not only been financially rewarding, but has also benefited several directors, actors and even a few audiences. This particular movie is another one of those feebly plotted vehicles that attempts to just dazzle us visually, and this it achieves very successfully.Special effects are a sensationally flashy display from Industrial Light and Magic, creating the spooks, and the havoc they cause, with startling effect. As in "Roger Rabbit", this flick has interaction between animated creations and real people taking place, and most convincingly too! While the cartoonists have a ball, actors Bill Pullman, Christina Ricci, Cathy Moriarty and Eric Idle (as well as support) very commendably play out their parts. Pullman has fun with his unusually comic, slapstick role, as Dr James Harvey, spiritual psychologist. As his daughter Kat, Ricci easily adopts the role of the lonely teen moppet who yearns for a place to call home and some companionship (which our friendly ghost would be more than happy to give her). Cathy Moriarty makes a fine villainess as Carrigan Crittenden, and Eric Idle is her bumbling sidekick, Dibs.Director Brad Silberling brings all the action and mayhem together quite deftly, only being at fault perhaps for trying to inject an emotional element into "Casper" (all he produces is sappiness). Fortunately it is comedy that this picture stands upon, and at times it is indeed hilarious. Look out for some special cameos from some of our very favourite film stars. "Casper" is quite acceptable as a kids flick also, never being gross or excessive, and perhaps only the mild expletives may be found offensive.Final word goes to the art direction and set decoration teams, led by production designer Leslie Dilley, who have fashioned some brilliant scenery for us to feast our eyes upon. The outrageous Whipstaff Manor is certainly a sight to behold. James Horner has provided the score.Friday, August 4, 1995 - Waverley Pinewood Cinema</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Friendliest Ghost You Know, Plus Christina Ricci</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A greedy woman inherits a mansion ("Whipstaff") from her uncle, only to find it haunted with obnoxious ghosts. She, along with her attorney (Eric Idle), hire Father Guido Sarducci and the Ghostbusters to solve the problem. No dice. Next, they turn to Dr. Harvey (Bill Pullman), a psychiatrist for the "living impaired" who moves into Whipstaff with his daughter Kat (Christina Ricci). As Harvey confronts the ghosts, Kat forms a friendship with the one friendly spirit in the house: Casper.This film is great for a number of reasons. First, the computer effects. While I am no fan of CGI, this film really pushes the boundaries for 1995 (actually looking better than many films ten years later). Next, the cast. Many notable names here and a horde of cameos (Rodney Dangerfield, Clint Eastwood and more). All of which are wonderful actors (although Cathy Moriarty, who plays the greedy woman, has been called a "poor woman's Cruella deVille" and I think this is fair -- she is the weak point of the cast). And the pop culture jokes seal the deal, with even "Apocalypse Now" getting lampooned.I am left to wonder if this film was not inspired, at least in part, by William Castle's 1960 film "13 Ghosts". There, too, we have an eccentric uncle who has invented ghost-related inventions leaving his property to his sibling's child. Both films have a hidden treasure in the mansion, sought after by a greedy attorney. And both have the family encountering obnoxious but relatively harmless ghosts. Although, it could simply be that many films have such ideas (haunted mansions with hidden treasure) and I am just making loose connections in my mind.My friend Chelsea, who adores this film and whom I watched it with, has an infatuation with the James Horner soundtrack. It does not stand out for me and I do not think it is Horner's best work. But it is not bad, either... blending neatly into the background (which, it may be said, might make it even better... not overpowering the movie).This film is fun for all ages. It is a kids film, but has some adult content, too. And it is one of two of the notable Christina Ricci roles as a child (the other bring Wednesday Addams), so if you share a love of Ricci with me you will need to see this film. But all in all, the reason to see this is because it is cute and endearing... brilliant in its innocence, even when it touches those adult themes (such as the death of a child). If Amblin Entertainment brought us one good film since "E.T.", this is it.</fullReview>

In fact reviewers' good part has put a high vote to the previous episodes. Because this contrast? I know the reason. Since assumptive reviewers' good part favorably sees the past and as the past is "better" than the present they have given several credit to the preceding episodes being still the last episode more explosive and spectacular. At this point should reject also the old episodes but there are here two weights and two measure.In fact also cinema masterpieces have been criticized and denigrated. Good part some reviewers of this site belong to the very bad reviewers. Better think separately with its head. I was sure that the god fun old episode did not like it.

I didn't see any profanity in this wonderful, moving film. My absolutely favorite part is at the end when Kat and Casper are dancing and right before Casper turns back into a ghost he and Kat kiss. That was sooo sweet!!!!! This is a great film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not So Friendly Ghost.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Casper (1995): Dir: Brad Silberling / Cast: Christina Ricci, Bill Pullman, Cathy Moriarty, Eric Idle, Amy Brenneman: Mindless geek show unsuitable for children due to its excessive occult references. Lame plot introduces Bill Pullman plays a ghost therapist who communicates with spirits. Cathy Moriarty and Eric Idle play standard villains who hire him to rid ghost activity from a house so that they may gain a supposed treasure. Christina Ricci plays Pullman's daughter who befriends Casper who lives with three mischievous uncles. Director Brad Silberling does his best to create Casper's world with fantastic visual elements but that is about as far as the compliments go. Ricci is a decent young actress but this is pure cardboard. Pullman has no believable reactions to the ghosts, and his decision to get drunk and fall to his death is absolutely beyond moronic. Perhaps he was just reacting to the fact that he got casted in this sh*t to begin with. The whole scheme to bring him back to life is just about as stupid as this gets. Moriarty and Idle overact shamelessly as the idiotic villains. Their greed hits such a high pitch that they attempt to kill each other so that their spirit can get inside a safe to get the treasure. And this junk is suppose to be appealing to children. This all comes down to distasteful marketing that leaves Casper as not such a friendly ghost after all. Score: 3 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This 1995 family film tries to put a fun spin on the story of a paranormals and widower (Bill Pullman) who moves into a new house with his daughter (Christina Ricci) and meets up with the ghost of a dead little boy. Based on the comic book about Casper the friendly ghost, the film is a dreary series of awkward interactions between live actors and computer effects, and you can almost see Pullman and Ricci reconsidering the project while on camera. A few cameo appearances from uncredited stars help things a bit. But there's no way, based on this film, that one could have guessed that its director, Brad Silberling, would go on to make the exceptional drama City of Angels.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Maybe there will always be the issue of life and death.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On one level, maybe "Casper" is just a kids' movie. But it does bring up the question of how we deal with our own mortality. The plot involves unctuous Carrigan Crittenden (Cathy Moriarty) and her crony Dibbs (Eric Idle) inheriting an abandoned mansion in Maine, only to find out that it's inhabited by people-hating ghosts. After a few failed attempts to get rid of these spirits, they hire Dr. James Harvey (Bill Pullman), who claims that he can communicate with the dead. When he and his daughter Kat (Christina Ricci) move in, they have a few unpleasant encounters with the ghosts, but settle down. Thus arises the issue of how to cohabit with specters and also please Crittenden.Overall, maybe there's nothing totally special about this movie; at face value, it seems to be all about quantity and not quality. But it does have some neat lines, and prompts us to consider what will become of ourselves post mortem.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Casper" creates a world where ghosts can indeed live alongside mortals...even if not altogether peacefully.When Dr. Harvey (Pullman) and his daughter Kat (Ricci) are brought in to exorcise a crumbling manor of its ghosts, they not only discover the Casper of the title but also his raucous uncles, who disrupt their lives on a daily basis.The innocence of the old Harvey Comics is long gone, to be sure, but the movie does manage to capture some of the excitement and awe of the kids-and-ghosts combination, along with the Catskills-style humor of the uncles (they possess the good doctor in a series of surprising guises).But there's also the literal assignations of death, remembrances of Casper's lost childhood and the scene where the ghosts try to kill the doctor to "make the Ghostly Trio a quartet" that kind of put a pall on the proceedings. Also, some language make this a questionable rental for the kiddies.However, if you're of the right age and understand about FX and things like that and can appreciate an exorcism by Father Guido Sarducci, this is the movie for you.Seven stars for "Casper". Perfect for a quiet rental fright. ...er, I meant "night". Sorry.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw "Casper" and liked it. I thought it was a cute movie with that most beloved cartoon character. I also thought it was great fun to watch, even if it is a kids movie. However, there is something wrong with this picture. If this is a kids movie, then howcome there was so much swearing. My God, I can't remember a kids movie that had this much profanity in it. Someone on the IMDB was wondering why people were complaining about the profanity when there was none. What are you blind? This movie was loaded with swearing, and too much for a kids movie, and why? I wonder if any parents were thrilled at what their kids were hearing. The only word that was left out was the F-word. Otherwise, every other word found it's way into the picture. It's a shame, because this is such an adorable movie. Not a great movie, but a good one, filled with laughs and fun. I thoroughly enjoyed this film, even if it was aimed at kids, but I am strongly opposed towards the swearing. It ruined the film!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An unfortunate waste of a potentially good opportunity: a live-action adaptation of the Harvey Comics staple about a friendly ghost looking for friends, and the loner teen and her father who take up residence in the mansion haunted by Casper and other apparitions of the boo-and-cackle variety. As Roger Ebert pointed out at the time, it was completely wrongheaded of the screenwriters to delve into the history of Casper (revealed to be the ghost of a dead child!), which renders some of the wild, gross-out slapstick completely inappropriate. Sloppily-directed in the "Beetlejuice" vein by Brad Silberling, who is no Tim Burton. The production is slick and expensive, but the hammy material is broad and derivative, defeating leads Bill Pullman and Christina Ricci as well as cameo-players Dan Aykroyd and Rodney Dangerfield, among others. Under 10-year-olds probably won't notice. *1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most well-directed kids movies I've ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a gem. I remember watching it almost on the loop as a kid, but I caught it on TV a week ago. The film is astounding. As a comedy, it works in deft subtle ways with a deftly written script, working with both witty dialog and fantastic cartoony sequences. As an adaptation of a comic book, it gets the spirit of the characters just right. As a family movie, it entertains people of all ages and respects them all, and addresses important issues about families that experience loss. From a technological standpoint, it created brand new technology, ran far with it, and still looks impressive and subtle. And as a drama, it works especially well with believable performances and haunting undertones about death that the entire cast and crew clearly took seriously. The movie works well on every level, and is even more satisfying than when I was a kid. The director knew exactly what he was doing, the acting is incredible, it's a great comedy, drama, and adventure. I'm sure your family will love it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is about the unexpected friendship between a teenage girl and a young ghost who lives in a haunted house."Casper" is a great family film. It really has something for everyone. Lots of love and support is shown throughout the film. Despite the central theme being ghosts, there is nothing remotely scary about them at all. In fact, the ghosts are cute and lovable! Their pranks are fun and innocent, and made me laugh. The ending is really touching. It teaches people to do right things and help the needy, without being preachy. It also tells that people who help others will have a good reward. I think "Casper" paves the way for a family film to have elements for kids and adults. It is a very good film!</fullReview>

This film is an excellent film for children, I like and I am in VHS cassette.

		<fullReview>Casper, this is such a great movie, heaps funny and the only thing wrong with it really is that it was beginning to for a sequel... UNfortunately, Christina Ricci, the chick that plays Kat, lived a different acting life and it seems that as soon as it became legal, she started heading for the 'adult' sextion movies. It just makes you wonder where some people go in life. The movie is really great though, the machine that grooms the people at the start of the day is great and the potion to turn somebody from a ghost to a human was also pretty neat. I like the part in the beginning the most where the whole gang is around the breakfast table and they are all getting to know each other better... the ghosts don't even seem to have a real problem with the fact that other people are living in their house... if I could, I would live in that house with those 3 wacky ghosts for a week, but it seems the only thing I would be around would be dust and an old rusty mansion. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Casper</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the director of Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events, this is quite a good live action romp with a cartoon character I used to watch sometimes. Basically the nasty Carrigan Crittenden (Cathy Moriarty) inherits a gloomy-looking mansion, but then she and sidekick Paul 'Dibbs' Plutzker (Eric Idle) discover a treasure map to a hidden treasure in the house. What they don't know is that Casper the Friendly Ghost (played by Malachi Pearson) is living there. He is the lonely ghost who only wants a friend, but scares anyone and everyone who catches one glimpse of him, this also goes for his mean uncles, Stretch (Joe Nipote), Stinkie (Joe Alaskey) and Fatso (Brad Garrett). So Dr. James Harvey (Bill Pullman) is hired to exorcise the house, with daughter Kathleen 'Kat' Harvey (Christina Ricci), but they end up become quite comfortable with having ghosts. Also starring Ben Stein as Mr. Rugg, Rodney Dangerfield, Dan Aykroyd as Dr. Raymond Stantz (the Ghostbuster) and cameos by Clint Eastwood and Mel Gibson. A good family film thats on almost every Christmas. Good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>NOT appropriate for small children</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm really surprised by the positive reviews for Casper, because my reaction to it was really negative, especially as a film for family viewing. I'm not against dark movies for children, especially if they help to frame difficult things in simple terms - I think films like The Iron Giant or a Nightmare Before Christmas are healthy viewing for even younger children (say 4 &amp; up. Casper, however, really struck me a being wide of the mark for a family audience, as it doesn't appear that children were really taken into account much when the film was made.This movie may be fine for older children and adults, but please heed the PG rating - there is a great deal of smoking in the movie, and quite a bit of language and humor that is far too adult for small children. It resembled to me more of a poor remake of Ghostbusters, rather than an honest-to-goodness family film. The special effects skew toward the disturbing side, the humor is mostly violent slapstick, the subtext is desperately creepy, and the casual attitude towards suicide, murder and death is really, really inappropriate. Definitely a movie I wish my child had never seen.</fullReview>
