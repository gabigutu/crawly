		<shortDescription>Superb cast and taut drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While chiefly remembered as a Bogart/Bacall vehicle, this story of expatriate gangsters commandeering a sleepy tropical hotel is, in actuality, a tightly directed ensemble piece with acting chops to burn.There's Edward G. Robinson as Johnny Rocco--the brash, boisterous, sleazy gangster whose frailties (cowardice and a yearning for better times) gradually unfold before us. There's Lionel Barrymore as James Temple, the delightfully feisty and crusty hotel owner overcome with revulsion at Rocco's presence. There's Thomas Gomez, Harry Lewis, Dan Seymour and William Haade as Curly, Toots, Angel and Ralphie--Rocco's colorful but hard-edged thugs who are presences unto themselves. There's Claire Trevor as Gaye, Rocco's declining, alcoholic moll who symbolizes more than anything how far Rocco has fallen.That's an awful lot. Too much scenery-chewing from Bogart or Bacall would push it over the top--and director/screenwriter/demigod John Huston knows it. He coaxes remarkably restrained and subtle performances out of his star couple. The romantic tension between them is suggested but never shoved in the audience's face. Bogart's wandering war vet Frank McCloud keeps his lips tight and plays his cards close to the chest--a streetwise outsider through and through. Bacall's Nora Temple lets her anger and distaste pour out through her smoldering eyes more often than her mouth.Ultimately, the subtlety is so well-hidden between the gigantic performances of Robinson and Barrymore that you might miss just how sophisticated Frank's story is. Disillusioned and drifting since the war, he stops in to visit the wife (Nora) and father (James) of a fallen comrade whose bravery he admired. Implicit in his visit is an unspoken apology that it is he, and not their loved one, who is returning home. The fallen soldier is a constant unseen presence in the film--his bravery and honor mocking what Frank sees as his own cowardice and inability to stand up to Rocco (Bogart's fast-talking explanation of why he didn't shoot Rocco when he had the chance is classic and rare--a protagonist lying to his friends and his audience--"One Rocco more or less isn't worth dying for!"). Frank's eventual decision to take on Rocco and his hoods is a victory against the fear that plagues and shames him.In a larger sense, this is a true period movie about a generation of men returning home from the greatest conflict the world has ever known. Most of our national memories of World War II are proud and triumphant, but, as with any war, it left countless people scarred physically and mentally. Though Frank is a decorated soldier, he feels somehow that what he did wasn't enough (because he lived and his friend did not?), and he returns back to a country in which he has no place with no real pride or satisfaction. The confrontation with Rocco affords him a chance (perhaps only possible in Hollywood or on the stage, where the story of "Key Largo" was first performed) to make things right with his world.While it has not aged as well as the better-known films of Bogart's and Huston's careers, "Key Largo" is a film that, for a little investment of attention and thought, will pay big dividends to anyone that really and truly loves movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>shock value</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My favorite Bogart movie is also Key Largo. Even before Edward G. Robinson and his hoods take everyone hostage in Lionel Barrymore's hotel there is a tension that does not let up for one second. Movie goers had to be on the edge of their seats in 1948.There is one scene however that I don't think viewers today can fully appreciate. Lionel Barrymore had been acting from a wheelchair for 10 years and movie audiences were used to that. When Robinson and his goons goad him to a futile gesture of bravado, Barrymore rises from that chair and moves slowly towards the snickering Robinson. He swings and misses and falls down and Bogey and Bacall pick up Barrymore and bring him back to his wheelchair. The shock value of that scene for 1948 audiences would have a dimension that can't be appreciated now.Robinson's Johnny Rocco is based on Lucky Luciano who had been deported a few years back. He's evil incarnate and Humphrey Bogart as Frank McCloud is the jaded, cynical former idealist who redeems himself and becomes the countervailing force for good. They play well against each other in a reverse from the 1930s Warner gangster flicks where Robinson was usually the good guy.Who could have known this would be the fourth, last, and best of the Bogey and Bacall teamings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Edward G. Robinson at this best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Key Largo is just one of John Huston's many memorable films that somehow always seem to transcend the intention--the Hollywood intention being to make a few bucks--and to this day still plays very well and indeed appears as something close to a work of art. It features what I think is one of Edward G. Robinson's finest performances as Johnny Rocco, a sociopathic gangster holding the off-season personnel of a seaside hotel hostage as he concludes a counterfeit money deal.The story begins as Major Frank McCloud (Humphrey Bogart) pays a visit to the family of one of his G.I. buddies who was killed in Italy during WWII. He finds the welcome from the hotel's only "guests" chilly except for Gaye Dawn (a funny and perhaps prescient Hollywood stage name) played by Claire Trevor who is drunk and befriends him. After a bit McCloud discovers that the hotel's owner Nora Temple (Lauren Bacall) and her invalid father-in-law James Temple (Lionel Barrymore) have been tricked into allowing Rocco's gang to stay and now, as a tropical storm begins to blow, are being held at gunpoint. McCloud's delicate task is to keep the megalomaniac and murderous personality of Rocco under some control so that he doesn't murder everyone.Note that this is a splendid cast, and they all do a good job. Note too that Huston adapted this from a play by the versatile American playwright Maxwell Anderson. So the ingredients for a good film are clearly in place; and aside from some self-conscious mishmash with the Seminoles of Florida, this is a success. Anderson's desire to explore the psychopathic personality (some years later he adapted William March's novel The Bad Seed into a stage play) finds realization in Huston's direction and especially in Robinson's indelible performance. The utter disregard for the lives of others and the obsessive love of self that characterize the sociopath reek from the snares and callous laughter of the very sick Johnny Rocco. I especially liked the crazed and thrilled grin on his face when he emerges from the hold of the boat in the climactic scene, gun in hand, imagining that he has once again fooled his adversaries and is about to delightfully shoot Humphrey Bogart to death. What I loved about this scene was that Huston did not think it necessary to contrive a fight in which the good guy (Bogart) beats the bad guy by fighting fair. What happens is exactly what should happen, and without regard for the fine points of Marquis of Queensberry-type rules. Also good is Rocco beginning to sweat in fear of his life as the storm moves in while Bogey gives us his famous laugh and grin as he assesses the essential cowardice of the petty gangster.Lauren Bacall, in one of her more modest roles, does a lot without saying much, and Lionel Barrymore is very good as the cantankerous old guy in a wheelchair. Claire Trevor actually won an Academy Award as Best Supporting Actress for her work, and she was good as the alcoholic moll with a heart of gold. Robinson won nothing, but he really dominated the picture and demonstrated why he was one of Hollywood's greatest stars.Bottom line: watch this to see the gangster yarn meld into film noir with overtones of the psychoanalytical drama that characterized many of the black and white Hollywood films of the forties and early fifties.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book "Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"

		<shortDescription>One of Bogart's, Bacall's &amp; Robinson's best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Basically this film is almost like a play. The whole story is more or less (apart from the ending) shot in a rustic Florida hotel. A great location and setting, a real credit to John Huston.In short, Frank McCloud (Bogart) an ex war hero and living at no-fixed-address, visits (by request) his dead war buddy's father (barrymore) &amp; widow (Bacall). As he arrives, it doesn't take long for Frank to work out the Hotel is temporarily hostage to a big mob gangster - Rocco (robinson) and his cronies.The film instantly grabs you, it looks beautiful, there is a lot of substance and well thought out scripts, nothing glamorous or smart, just very good story telling. A good side line to the story, are the Native American clan, who due to an approaching hurricane need to find shelter, their plight is placed nicely into the story. There is a scene in which Bacall introduces Bogart to the oldest member of the clan, a 100 and something year old Native woman which is just so genuine, I still don't believe this woman was an actress, Huston must have improvised this into the script.Not only is Bogart superb in this, but also the whole cast. It goes without saying Edward G Robinson's performance was second to none as to was - his right hand man (Harry Lewis I think), Bacall &amp; Rocco's girlfriend - Ziggy..pretty much the entire cast.The whole thing ties up well, without Spoilers it does have a great ending. This is a must not just for Bogie fans but for anyone who can appreciate an intelligent film.-Paul Browne.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enduring Warner Gangster Melodrama.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the finest of the great gangster melodramas KEY LARGO is still a firm favourite with fans and cultists alike. Produced by Jerry Wald in 1948 for Warner Bros. it was based on the stage play by Maxwell Anderson and was beautifully written for the screen by Richard Brooks and John Huston. Stunningly photographed in low key black &amp; white by Karl Freund it was expertly directed with his customary flair by Huston. The cast assembled couldn't be better with Humphrey Bogart delivering one of his very best subdued performances and arguably being almost eclipsed by a riveting Ed. G. Robinson. The rest of the small cast is fleshed out with Lauren Bacall, Lionel Barrymore, Claire Trevor and Thomas Gomez. And complimenting the on screen proceedings is the splendid music by the tireless Max Steiner who provided one of his best forties scores. It is 1946, the war in Europe is over and a returning GI (Humphrey Bogart) arrives at The Largo Hotel in Key Largo. Asked who he is Bogart coolly replies "McCloud, Frank by John out of Helen". He is here to meet with the hotel owner John Temple (Lionel Barrymore) to talk about the death of his son George Temple and how he lost his life in combat in Italy saving his unit. But McCloud notices that also staying in the hotel are a undesirable crowd of sinister looking characters. It's not long before he learns that they are a gang of mobsters led by an abrasive deported racketeer - the infamous Johnny Rocco (Robinson). When McCloud reveals who Rocco is and lists his many illegal and crooked enterprises the aging wheelchair bound John Temple gloweringly chides him "You Filth" which elicits little more than a snigger from Rocco. Then the gang declare themselves and display their violent ways (they murder the deputy sheriff) and make known their intention to force McCloud to sail them to Cuba. However after Rocco's moll (Claire Trevor) slips McCloud a gun he takes them on in a surprise move out at sea which makes for an intense and exciting sequence. The picture ends with McCloud's dispatch of the baddies and turning the boat around he heads back to Key Largo and The Largo Hotel where a new life awaits him.With some remarkable ensemble playing performances are top notch. Bogart gives one of his best portrayals in a likable reserved manner. Here proving yet again that he remains one of the most enduring icons of the silver screen. But there's little doubt KEY LARGO is Robinson's picture! His snarling and totally mean spirited Rocco is the best thing he has ever done. Good too are those in support especially Lionel Barrymore as the irascible aging hotelier, Lauren Bacall as Nora his daughter in-law and Claire Trevor giving a great turn as Rocco's moll in her Acadamy Award winning best supporting actress performance.And holding the whole thing together is Max Steiner's great score. His main theme is a lovely gentle anthem-like cue which points up the sadness of George Temple's death in the war and the loneliness now felt without him by his father and widow Nora. Also heard are some great action cues and an appropriate swirling piece for the Hurricane sequence. 1948 was a bumper year for the busy composer. In twelve months the man scored an unprecedented eleven films which included such amazing classics as "Treasure Of The Sierra Madre", "Johnny Belinda", "Silver River" the exceptional "The Adventures Of Don Juan" and of course KEY LARGO.KEY LARGO remains a memorable and enduring classic from Hollywood's Golden Age. In the tradition of the great noirs it exudes an engaging dramatic thrust throughout and an all encompassing intensity rarely felt in movies today. John Huston demonstrated yet again his prowess as one of film's outstanding directors and with his inspired casting in KEY LARGO the movie will forever maintain its appeal as long as there are movies and a place to screen them..Footnote: It is interesting to note that the boat used in the final sequence was Bogart's own boat "The Santana".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The film may lack substance and coherence but it is first-rate drama and entertainment?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is difficult to resist the temptation to compare William Wyler's "The Desperate Hours" with John Huston's "Key Largo." Here again the drama arose when a gangster and his thugs sought a temporary hideout by moving in on an innocent family, and were unable to get away until a raging hurricane had blown itself out?The family were Lionel Barrymore, complete with wheelchair, and Lauren Bacall, apparently without make-up?stunningly attractive? Their home was a small hotel in Florida, and "just passing through" was a tough and somewhat mixed-up good guy Humphrey Bogart? The gangster was Edward G. Robinson?For Bogart "Key Largo" was another "The Petrified Forest," but this time he was the disenchanted idealist and Edward G. Robinson the vicious, antiquated symbol of raw brute force? Paul Muni had appeared in the original Maxwell Anderson play in 1939, and director John Huston and Richard Brooks updated the piece to make it more contemporary? As a film, it was treated in a slightly heavy-handed, overly talky manner, displacing action in favor of strong character studies of a group of disparate individuals trapped by a kingpin gangster? Claire Trevor won an Academy Award as Gaye Dawn, Rocco's boozy mistress who was willing to lower herself to any depths for the mere expedient of getting a drink? She is finally pushed too far by Rocco, has accepted too many insults and been rejected once too often, so she decides to help the besieged prisoners?Lauren Bacall was Nora Temple, an antiseptic dreamer who persisted in believing that evil should always be opposed by a valiant Sir Galahad and temporarily has her illusions shattered when Bogart apparently doesn't agree to fit into her mold? As Bacall's grandfather, Lionel Barrymore was another heroic figure who, could afford to be a verbal hero, knowing that a retreat to the safety of his confining wheelchair could protect him?Edward G. Robinson as Rocco was a mass of contradictions? Brutal with a gun safely in his hand, dreaming of the glories he once knew in the good old days when he was a big shot, all he has left are the memories? He was a man whose criminal wisdom permits no ethics and few feelings? He offers Bogart an empty gun to shoot it out with him... He is also a man afraid, who sweats when the hurricane approaches and poses a threat to his safety... He detests Bogart because of his wartime heroism, mocking and taunting him because his courage is something differing in Rocco's own unheroic life? As war hero Frank McCloud, Bogart was the most complex character of all? Disillusioned, tired of his war-induced killings, unwilling to risk himself in any new test of courage ("One Rocco more or less isn't worth dying for"), he is now a complacent shadow of his former noble self? He, like Barrymore, seeks an idyllic world where "there's no place for Johnny Rocco." However, his pattern has been too well established? He, like Claire Trevor, can be pushed only so far and then reason and restraint seem no longer acceptable as an alternative to action? With such a cast "Key Largo" could not fall to hold the attention? Yet, for all its workmanlike craft, it did not reach the level of Wyler's "The Desperate Hours." Bogart, as a disillusioned war veteran who could not rouse himself to action until the last few minutes, left one frustrated: looking for the vicious power that he was to show as the gangster in the later film?Edward G. Robinson, commanding, convincing, was still not so coldly frightening a villain as Humphrey Bogart? And, one can imagine how the idea of the storming hurricane appealed at the time? The violence and the drama outside, as the wind tore at the palm trees and the waves threatened to swallow the little wooden hotel, would surely underscore and heighten the tensions within... Not so! And not only because the studio storm was not always up to nature's level... What William Wyler realized was that the suspense of innocence trapped as hostages by wickedness was vastly heightened by the contrast with a quiet, undramatic, everyday setting? No hurricane was needed to put the desperation in "The Desperate Hours."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Here's looking at you, Bogie (and Eddie)...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I think of the colorized version that, regrettably, is the only copy of this excellent film noir in my video store, I can't help but think of a comment Orson Welles made to a friend a few days before his death in regards to Turner's plans to colorize "Citizen Kane"(thankfully defeated, because of the fact that it came under Welles' original contract with RKO, which specified that only Welles would make changes): "Keep Turner and his g**d*** Crayolas away from my movie." Watching this version of "Key Largo" more than proves Welles' point; the lighting becomes terrible in several key scenes, particularly the closing ones on the boat, to whereas before, you could see what was going on, now you can just barely tell a thing. That said, it can't destroy the fine work that this film truly is.I was led to this film by my mother, who called it one of her favorites from Bogie (another being "The African Queen") and now I can see why. Leave it to John Huston, the man who was bold enough to make a true adaptation of Dashiell Hammet's "The Maltese Falcon", to give us a tightly woven drama that never feels forced. Bogie's Frank McCloud is probably the most silent of all the strong-silent types he ever played, barely saying more than is necessary for the scene he's in. Such reticience leaves some large blanks for the audience to fill; though he says that he doesn't care one way or another, I really don't believe him. The feeling I get the entire time he's in the clutches of Johnny Rocco's gang is that he's just waiting for his moment. After all, you don't survive WWII's Italian campaign and not know when it's best to stay still and when it's best to make your play. That's why he threw away the gun offered to him by Rocco; no way was Rocco's gang just going to let their boss be gunned down even if the deck was stacked in Rocco's favor. The murders of the deputy and the Indians on the lam just adds to the need to take care of business.I was a little disappointed to see Bacall in such a minor role (it still had to be better than what she was given, sans Bogie, after this film, from reports I've heard), but her spitting in Rocco's face is an undeniably powerful moment. As for Edward G. Robinson, one of Hollywood's original tough guys imported from Bucharest, Romania, he literally runs away with the part of Johnny Rocco, the former big-shot with delusions of grandeur. He's a casually vicious, ruthless fount of hate, bitter over his fallen status and hungering for a comeback. But he still fails to draw an important lesson from his soused ex-galpal: times change and not necessarily for the better. He may have defied a ton of police in his day or gun down a deputy in this one, but it still doesn't change the fact that the outside world (nicely symbolized by the hurricane) can and will eat him alive without the slightest trace of indigestion. All Rocco is is a dinosaur: proud, strong, but too stupid to realize that his kind have become extinct.In fact, that may very well be why McCloud was such a natural match for Rocco as an opponent. McCloud had changed his spots many times in his life to fit the job situation he was in, while Rocco has never been anything else but what he is now. Small wonder that one can see the confrontation between them coming to full steam. This core element, and all the others mentioned and not mentioned here, help make "Key Largo" one of the great unsung classics of Humphrey Bogart AND Edward G. Robinson. Here's looking at you, tough guys.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Obviously someone below couldn't tell a well directed, highly regarded classic film the likes of Key Largo from a Turkey Sandwich - but thanks for the remedial effort nonetheless.This movie doesn't get the attention of a Casablanca or a Maltese Falcon, but it's definitely one to see - and not just for the giants on the screen. The build up of tension between the main characters is set well against the backdrop of the impending storm seemingly threatening to cave their hotel in literally and figuratively. Frank's character arc from jaded passiveness to the restrained heroism he is inescapably drawn towards has been seen in other Bogie characters, but usually those guys were either willing participants on the trigger end of their guns, or they were fulfilling their own agendas as well. However Frank McCloud has no ulterior motives. Here, there is a refreshing change from the usual Bogie-isms; Frank doesnt engage in any verbal bravado with Rocco, there are no confident smirks on his face, or promises to 'get even' later. As for Barrymore, he was just simply an acting genius. Look no further than the scene with him getting out of his wheelchair in a futile attempt to fight Rocco as proof. Fantastic. E.G. Robinson delivers his vitriol so well on-screen, you cant help but hate his guts and wait for his come-uppance. Both Barrymore and EGR were great at delivering speeches - extended lines of dialogue while 'flying solo' - you can almost here the room go quiet as they worked the script. Lauren Bacall's chemistry with her Husband was so natural and unforced, even the scenes with no dialogue show how much they were in love - albeit true she doesnt exactly carry the workload in this one. Some of the scenes with the Indians seem a little odd, but it still works in the context of the entire movie. Don't overlook this great film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Florida Storm Takes Place of Neon Lights in Huston's Noir Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Humphrey Bogart and John Huston must be considered the artistic equivalent of De Niro-Scorsese. Huston and Bogie made several films together, this being one of their best. But there is another combo that comes to an end in cinema's history: Bogie and Bacall appear on screen for the final time together. It is their finest collaboration. Edward G. Robinson, "Little Caesar" himself, returns to gangster form after years of playing the good guy (Wilder's DOUBLE INDEMNITY, Welles' THE STRANGER) and has one of the more memorable entrances in film villain history. We see him in a tub, smoking, a fan in front of him. He seems to be decaying in a way, but "Johnny Rocco" is still to be reckoned with. This is the Robinson we all love, demented and wise, sinister yet humorous. The Largo Hotel is the setting and a hurricane of drama, heroism, and rain is coming.Huston stages the film much like the play it is based on, yet we never feel confined. There is enough colorful dialogue to go around. Surprisingly, much of it is not by Bogart, who plays probably his most quiet role, promoting his character through facial gestures more than words. He plays off Robinson and his posse of mobsters perfectly in this way, allowing Edward G. to dominate the majority of the film, which is the point. Lionel Barrymore plays the chair-ridden owner of the Largo and his daughter Bacall is falling in love with Bogart, naturally. They are at the mercy of Rocco and his boys, all of whom have some itchy trigger fingers. Bogart is just buying his time to make his move. The finale is extremely well done and foresees suspense endings to come.Lauren Bacall is one of the most beautiful actresses to grace the screen, especially in black and white. Her perfect features look sculpted in this light and her sensual stare is enough to make you melt. Her smoky voice and attitude is an excellent match for Bogie's simple, heroic character. Film Noir becomes Florida Noir here, as the lightening outside the windows of the hotel play games with the shadows and atmosphere of events inside. Robinson murders an innocent man with the look of a terrifying ghost, lightening flashing on him and all. The thunder substitutes for the sound of cars and street-life normally heard in classic noir pictures. KEY LARGO is a very good film, dark and suspenseful, in the most pleasant of locales.RATING: 8 of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Bogart/Huston Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Key Largo" was the second collaboration between Humphrey Bogart and John Houston during 1948 (the other being "The Treasure of the Sierra Madre). Both films represent both artists at the peak of their respective careers."Key Largo" is about a group of gangsters who have taken over a hotel located on Key Largo. Along comes Bogey, who has come to visit the father of a war time pal who was killed, and of course, gets drawn into the drama.Huston's cast is flawless. Bogart as Frank McCloud is suitably laid back and brave as he confronts the gangsters headed by Edward G. Robinson as Johnny Rocco. Lauren Bacall plays the widow of Bogey's war time friend and the venerable Lionel Barrymore is outstanding as Temple, the hotel proprietor. Claire Trevor plays Rocco's moll Gaye Dawn, an alcoholic former singer for which she deservedly won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. Appearing as as Rocco's henchmen are veterans Thomas Gomez and Dan Seymour and Harry Lewis as Toots a "Wilmer" type character (from "The Maltese Falcon"). Monte Blue and John Rodney represent the law.Bogart and Robinson appeared together many times during the 30s with Robinson usually playing the hero and Bogey the heavy. This time their roles are reversed. This film was unfortunately, the last time Bogart and Robinson appeared together. It's a pity because they always played against each other so well. I always liked Robinson better on the wrong side of the law. His Rocco is a slimy brutal villain. He even gets to slap Bogey around in this one.It is interesting to note the name of the boat that the gang make their getaway on is called "Santana". Santana was the name of Bogey's own personal boat and the name of his production company.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The genius of John Huston on display!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Huston was a remarkable man who was an excellent director, as well as a superb adapter of other people's materials, as he clearly shows in "Key Largo". This movie, based on Maxwell Anderson's play, is a triumph for Mr. Huston, who co-wrote the adaptation with Richard Brooks, another man who would go on to direct his own movies.Mr. Huston had an uncanny way to get the best people in the business in his projects. Karl Freund's black and white cinematography is wonderful, as is the haunting music provided by Max Steiner, a man who was a genius in his own right for always giving that special touch to the scores he was hired to do."Key Largo" has been compared with "The Desperate Hours", in which Humphrey Bogart also appeared. In fact, both were theatrical plays, and perhaps that's the basis of the comparison. As much as Mr. Huston tried to open "Key Largo", it still has a certain feeling of the drama one would get in a stage production.This is a film that has Humphrey Bogart playing a good guy, Frank McCloud, not his usual bad guy from other movies. Also, we see a rather quiet Lauren Bacall as Nora Temple; in her other films with Mr. Bogart she played more sultrier roles. Edgar G. Robinson is perfect as the crooked Johnny Rocco, the gangster that has decided to take over the Largo Hotel to do his business. In a great performance, Mr. Robinson shows an ugly side. Claire Trevor plays a gangster moll Gaye Dawn and has a great opportunity. Also Lionel Barrymore, Thomas Gomez and Harry Lewis are seen in supporting roles."Key Largo" will not disappoint because it shows a tense situation in which at the beginning seems a hopeless cause, but the hurricane will change things around and justice and sanity will prevail.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Phoenix: The Hero Reborn From His Ashes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead:The film is about Frank. He returns from the war disillusioned and depressed both from the horrors he has endured and the lies he was told. Remember why he is here, he has come to tell his best friends' relatives how he died. If you do not understand Frank, his actions will seem bizarre and inexplicable. Once Rocco's gang takes over, and everyone realizes they are prisoners there, Nora looks to Frank to save them. Frank gives a little speech, the point of which is, he went through hell trying to rid the world of Johnny Rocco's and here is another one right in front of him. James tries to tell Nora that no man who went through what Frank did could possibly be a coward. Nora snaps, and unleashes a tirade on him about what a pathetic coward he is. Rocco will tolerate no challenges not even verbal. His reaction is to try and bait him into letting Rocco shoot him. Nora tries to convince herself Frank knew the gun was empty. When she discovers he didn't that is when she goes postal on him. The movie follows Frank learning to care again. As Rocco, becomes more and more cruel to everyone around him. Frank begins to hate him and the old Frank is on his way back.The scene where Rocco makes Gaye sing for her drink is one of the saddest scenes on film. This is the fate of the moll who has outlived her usefulness, now she is discarded like garbage. When Johnny says,"You stink," Faye answers,"Johnny you're as mean as can be." It won Trevor the Oscar; she earned it what a powerful scene. There is a parallel here to Treasure of Sierra Madre, watch as the storm grows, like the fire in Madre, how Rocco gets more and more frightened. Mr. Temple starts praying for divine retribution and almost gets shot by Rocco. Gradually, the film builds to the decision point. They all urge Frank to run; it is a death sentence for sure. Frank hesitates, you can see the anguish on his face, he is through running. He climbs aboard with the gun Gaye gave him secreted away. He is not the same docile, nihilistic Frank who gave that speech at the beginning. He has decided no more Johnny Roccos. The cruelty and evil of the man brought Frank back to his senses.Huston pulls no punches, Frank is almost killed several times, and gets a serious wound for his trouble. Rocco is portrayed as a mendacious, cowardly, cruel monster. This was before villains were heroes like in today's movies. See how strong the normative structure of the country was back there. When Frank returns, with the fog dissipating and the sun rising behind him, both beautiful existential metaphors, the message is unmistakable; the hero has returned. What gives the movie its power is the struggle within Frank to find the hero buried under all that suffering and disillusionment. As the music ascends, and Nora rushes to meet him, his nobility reminds all of us that it is within each of us. It just has to be brought up and out with courage. A GREAT MOVIE</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>under-appreciated classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Key Largo is an absolutely brilliant film. Cast and screenplay are both superb. Bogart and Bacall have an intense personal chemistry that sparks on screen, and the supporting cast of Barrymore and E. G. Robinson give their best performances ever. Robinson, in particular, as the slimy gangster johnny rocco is great - his portrayal of the 'banality of evil' is the best I've ever seen.The screenplay is magnificent. Not just the dialog, but also the balance of characters is perfect. For each good character there is a bad one of equal weight, forming a perfectly complementary totality, a yin/yang balance that teeters between triumph and disaster according to the finest shades of personal choice. It's an examination of freedom, of corruption, of courage and betrayal - a perfect encapsulation of the world, focused upon a hotel on a tiny island in the middle of a hurricane.This movie deserves more recognition than it gets. The action is understated but intense, densely-packed with meaning and significance, at both the individual and cultural level. Watch this movie with new eyes!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Repeat viewings of "Key Largo" will only enrich your appreciation of it. The superb cast and directing by John Huston make this a must see film for fans of the 1940 classics, particularly fans of stars Humphrey Bogart, Edward G. Robinson, and Lauren Bacall.Bogey and Bacall made four films in a space of four years, this being their final appearance together. Bogey's character, retired Army Major Frank McCloud seeks out the family of a war buddy killed in action. He finds Nora Temple (Bacall) and her father James Temple (Lionel Barrymore) as the owners of a seasonal hotel in Key Largo, and comes to realize that all is not quite right in the serene setting. Bogey's response to an inquisitive Nora Temple is about to be tested - "Life on land has become too complicated for my taste". Edward G. Robinson's appearance as mobster Johnny Rocco is suitably delayed in the film to build suspense, and he breaks on screen with all of his classic nuance - the sneer, the braggadocio, the "What's with you wise guy?" sarcasm. Rocco suffers from a fall from past glory, a time when he was regarded as "the one and only", a virtual emperor of the crime world. Now he's a two bit hoodlum, holed up in a Key Largo hotel, hoping to cash in on a counterfeit money scam. With him are a coterie of henchmen, and an alcoholic moll superbly portrayed by Claire Trevor, earning a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her performance. Johnny Rocco is desperate to make a mob connection to unload his counterfeit money stash, and refuses to submit to the might of an impending hurricane. Fueling Rocco's desperation is a stoic Bogart - "You don't like it Rocco - the storm; show it your gun why don't ya, if it doesn't stop, shoot it!". Helpless in the face of the coming storm, Rocco's anxiety mounts, and in a tense scene he confronts war hero McCloud by throwing him a gun to force a showdown. But Bogey's not buying it - "One Rocco more or less isn't worth dying for". In a damned if you do, damned if you don't situation, McCloud must decide to man a boat to Cuba for Rocco's gang to make a getaway. In the one improbable scene of the film, Trevor's Gaye Dawn character secretly maneuvers Rocco's gun away from him and slips it into Bogey's hand, while surrounded by all of the bad guys. How Rocco would not have missed his weapon (until later on the boat) is an element that is not suitably dealt with in the film.McCloud's resourcefulness while skippering the getaway boat is sheer cunning, taking out one mobster after another with surgical precision. The desperate Johnny Rocco even shoots one of his own men rather than have his authority challenged. McCloud remains silent to Rocco's taunts, causing the gangster to force his own hand and become a target for the heroic McCloud.As Bogey heads back to port and the hurricane fades, the film ends on a feel good note as Nora Temple opens the shutters of the hotel and the sunlight streams in - all is well in the world again; the symbolism is extraordinary.Bogey and Robinson appear in four other movies together (Kid Galahad, Brother Orchid, The Amazing Dr. Clitterhouse, and Bullets or Ballots), but this is the only one in which they share equal footing, Robinson cast in the lead role in the other films over Bogart. For Robinson fans, the Clitterhouse film is a blast and is recommended to see him in an offbeat role.Another point of interest for film buffs, Jay Silverheels appears in an uncredited role as Tom Osceola, one of the Seminole Indian brothers on the lam from the law in the movie's back story. For an actor as typecast as Silverheels (Tonto in the Lone Ranger), it's always a pleasant surprise and treat to see in an entirely different setting."Key Largo" ranks right up there with "Treasure of the Sierra Madre" and "The Maltese Falcon", and perhaps just a notch below "Casablanca" among Bogart's finest films, and a true classic worthy of the name.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Take me back to 1948 with Bogart and Baby (Bacall) and let me soak in this classic romance meets gangster drama.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1948 news items: Harry Truman was re-elected president. -Price were lower = Gas was between $.16 to $.26 per gallon, a new car was around $1,250 and bread $.14 a loaf, Stamps $.03, but the Minimum wage was only $.40 per hour and the average annual salary was between $2,900 and $3,600 per year. -Scientists at Bell Labs invent the transistor, which lead to transistor radios, better TV's and eventually computers. -Soviets blockade West Berlin: Western allies respond with massive airlift. -Israel achieves statehood. -NASCAR holds its first race ever for modified stock cars at Daytona Beach. -Mahatma Gandhi Assassinated -Olympic Games were held in London in 1948, first time since before WWII. -Columbia Records unveiled its new long-playing phonograph record, the 33 1/3, LP. -The effects of WWII were still being felt in Europe, 10,000 people lived in shanty towns on the outskirts of Rome in 1948 made from packing cases, Old Sewage Pipes and bombed out cars. -Oscar winner for Best Film ? HAMLET, Best Director ? John Huston for TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE.KEY LARGO is loosely based on Maxwell Anderson's Broadway play which featured Paul Muni. In the play, the gangsters are Mexican bandits, the war in question is the Spanish Civil War, and Frank is a disgraced deserter who dies at the end to protect the family.For proper atmosphere Director John Huston and screenwriter Richard Brooks hammered out their story while actually staying at a Key Largo hotel off season. There they heard from witnesses about the Florida Keys Labor Day Hurricane of 1935 which caused over 400 deaths.Huston personalized the script by making Bogie's character a World War II veteran who had served in the Italian campaign at Battle of San Pietro where Huston himself had served.Edward G. Robinson became a major star playing a gangster in Little Caesar back in 1930. His character Rocco was modeled on real life gangsters Al Capone and Charles "Lucky" Luciano. At the start of his career he was the lead and Bogart would get killed off before the end. Bogart and Robinson appeared in four films together before this one, Bullets or Ballots (1936), Kid Galahad (1937), The Amazing Dr. Clitterhouse (1938) and my favorite Brother Orchid (1940).Director Huston wanted take away the glamour of the gangster and show him for the thug he was.Bogart's character was tired of war and killing and wanted nothing to do with fighting.In her autobiography, By Myself, Lauren Bacall recalls Key Largo as "one of the happiest movie experiences. I thought how marvelous a medium the movies were, to enable one to meet, befriend, and work with such people." Bogart never gave Bacall direction in front of anyone but choose to coach her away from the set telling her don't over act? if someone points a gun at you the audience knows your scared, you don't have to show it. Robinson later commented on his marquee status in his autobiography (All My Yesterdays): "The journey down. No suspense to this. I didn't even argue. Why not second billing? At fifty-three I was lucky to get any billing at all."Claire Trevor plays Rocco's alcoholic companion, a character based on Lucky Luciano's mistress, Gay Orlova. Trevor kept asking Huston when could they rehearse her singing, he always answered they had plenty of time. Then one day after lunch he told her to get into costume they were filming the scene. With no practice or warning a piano hit one note and he made her sing it cold ? at the end of the song one of the crew said to another ? "She's going to win an Oscar for that" ? and she did. This was Lauren Bacall's 5th film, she was 24 years old. Today she is 84 (the sexiest over 80 actress I might add) and since turning 70 she has made 24 films!Jay Silverheels plays one of the Osceola Indians, he was so good the next year he was cast in the LONE RANGER TV show and would appear in 220 episodes of that show. Harry Lewis plays the young gangster in the white suit, Edward 'Toots' Bass. Unfortunately his acting career never took off. Poor Harry Lewis and his wife wanted to stay in Hollywood while he looked for more acting work so they opened a restaurant and called it Hamburger Hamlet. He worked occasionally and the restaurant did well so he opened more locations, in 1987 he sold all his restaurants and the name for 33 Million dollars. Cinematography: Karl Freund (Metropolis, All Quiet on the Western Front, Dir. The Mummy? and was the chief cameraman on I LOVE LUCY) 15) Music: Max Steiner (Citizen Kane, King Kong, Top Hat, Gone With The Wind)Did I mention the song? The 1981 song "Key Largo", by singer-songwriter Bertie Higgins, draws heavily on influences from the film. This song hit the Top 10 on the pop chart in the United States and went to #1 on the adult contemporary chart.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outstanding film noir!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Key Largo is undoubtedly one of the best film noirs and indeed films of any genre. Memorable characters abound in this classic. Bogart, as had become his screen persona, IS the reluctant hero. Edward G. Robinson is unforgettable as arguably the ultimate gangster (though Bogart himself and James Cagney would undoubtedly contest him for the title). Lauren Bacall's role isn't as prominent as in some of the other films she costarred with Bogart but nevertheless she is more than competent. I think Claire Trevor won a best supporting actress for her role as the lush dame in this film. The rest of the supporting cast is also top notch and is unusually memorable for secondary characters. That's a credit to both the screenwriters and the actors. One of my top twenty films of all time, 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There may be other Bogart/Huston collaborations that are better known and it may not be the first movie people think of when Bogart/Bacall are mentioned, but Key Largo is a fine movie in its own right. Bogart is an Army Captain visiting the wife and father of one of the dead soldiers who served under him. The wife and father run a little hotel on Key Largo. Bogart's not the only guest at the hotel, though. A group of gangsters has decided to hold up there for a while. But the gangsters aren't the only threat to Bogart and the others. A hurricane is blowing on shore that threatens everyone - even the guys with the guns.Bogart and Bacall are good as ever. Lionel Barrymore is a pleasure to watch. And Claire Trevor's Academy Award was deserving. But I want to spend the rest of this review discussing Edward G. Robinson's performance. Robinson has never been a particular favorite of mine. But, it's difficult not to enjoy him in Key Largo. To be a man of such slight stature, on screen he comes across like a giant. His character, Johnny Rocco, dominates almost every scene - even scenes he's not in. Before we meet Rocco, he's already on of the biggest characters in the movie. All his hired stooges have to do is point to the bedroom door and say something like "He's in there, taking a nap" and Rocco immediately becomes the most important person in the movie. Robinson is amazing to watch as he demonstrates his dominance by threatening everyone (even his own men). But Robinson saves the best for last. As the hurricane hits, he changes and becomes like a frightened child. That Robinson was capable of playing the heavy so convincingly in one scene and the weakling so perfectly in the next is evidence of his wonderful abilities. It's really a joy to behold.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Favorite Bogart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have 4 Humphrey Bogart movies in list of favorites: The Maltese Falcon, Casablanca, The African Queen and Key Largo. I know that compared to the other three, it is considered a "lesser" work, but it is my favorite Bogart. I am not going to write about the brilliance of all the performances in Key Large: Lionel Barrymore, Lauren Bacall, Edward G. Robinson, and Claire Trevor. Enough has been said about them all. I wish to concentrate on Bogart and the loneliness of his character in the movie.Bogart often played damaged characters; i.e., men who had been hurt, badly hurt, at some time in the past. Frank McCloud in Key Largo is one of those characters. He is not a tough guy like Sam Spade or a "sharp" character like Rick. He is a nice man and a very lonely one. Frank has no family, he was an orphan. He was an officer in the war, but the war is over. He has no job, no family and no prospects. He is tired; tired of being alone and tired of the violence of the war.But Frank has one dream, a borrowed dream. During the war, one of his men often told him stories of his own life with his father and wife and their small hotel in the Florida Keys. It is a tale of family closeness and love, of clean salt air and colorful characters. It is everything Frank has never had in his life. After the war and the death of his friend, Frank has nowhere to go and nothing to look forward to. So he finally drifts to Florida, to this family, to tell them how much he respected and liked his friend.They, Nora and Father Temple, are very glad to meet Frank. Just as Frank had been told about them, they had been told about Frank in letters sent home from the war. Into this comes Johnny Rocco and his goons and his moll. Frank is a decorated soldier and a brave man, there are too many innocent lives at stake, Nora and Mr. Temple and even Gaye Dawn, the alcoholic moll. Frank cares about these people, even Gaye, and he does not want them to be hurt and perhaps more than anyone else there, he knows the terrible devastation bullets can wreak on the human body. This sets up the conditions for all the talk while they are trapped by the hurricane. I will not say any more about twists of the plot because I do not want to include spoilers.Let me just say that in the end, Nora and Father Temple realize that they need Frank as much as Frank needs them. And so Frank is finally able to come home. He finally "has it all ... in Key Largo."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tension in a Tight Place</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No need to recap the plot.Maxwell Anderson's stage play shows up pretty well on the big screen, thanks to a powerhouse cast that keeps things moving. Otherwise the action's pretty much confined to a small hotel lobby with a few forays out to the foggy dock. Without the expert histrionics, things in a tight space might get boring. But then, who's got a bigger personality than Robinson when he's playing the gangster kingpin as he is here. He snarls, threatens, cajoles, and pretty well dominates the screen, while Bogie low-keys it as the reluctant idealist, a signature role he perfected in Casablanca (1942). But you've got to feel a little sorry for Bacall who mostly stands silently around like a loose appendage. Her role looks like an add-on, maybe to please husband Bogart. Of course, it's Trevor who gets the plum distaff role, and she looks the shopworn part to the proverbial 'T'. When she warbles her little ditty, however, her face lights up like girlish innocence restored. And, oh yes, mustn't forget Barrymore who, for once, avoids hamming it up, in a well played part as the hotel owner.I'm not sure how much of that showdown aboard the boat I buy, but I guess they had to find some resolution. Anyway, the movie manages to generate a lot of claustrophobic suspense, with a crowd of characters coming and going. So bring your scorecard to keep track. In most ways, it's worth it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stage-to-screen adaptations are always going to pose problems. Actors have to play it differently, and the strongly visual nature of film has to compensate for theatre's emphasis on dialogue. Counterintuitive as it may seem ? since both stage plays and screenplays are essentially just a story told in lines of dialogue and actions ? many adaptations from one to the other are not so much a tweaking as a complete overhaul. However, writer and director John Huston's reworking of the Maxwell Anderson play Key Largo apparently had more to do with changing the political slant. It still contains the small number of locations and lengthy dialogue scenes of a typical stage production. Instead, it is the way Huston stages the action, and the solid performances of the cast that make this workable for the screen.Huston had an expert handling of foreground and background, and he often used it to preserve the length of the shot. For example, in the scene where we first meet Lauren Bacall, rather than change angle to a mid-shot of her, she appears in the background, and then walks towards the camera without a cut. Shots like these keep the action flowing smoothly, especially in these more relaxed early scenes. Despite the sometimes highly elaborate long takes, Huston rarely moves the camera, and those moves that are made neatly follow the action and are never obtrusive. What is obtrusive is the positioning of actors within the shot ? sometimes almost bizarre arrangements of people, with close-ups overhanging the edges of the frame. This puts the focus on the actors in a way that is very intense and exaggerated ? like our experience of a stage play can be.The cast of Key Largo is predictable but worthy. Humphrey Bogart plays the same taciturn, grudgingly-moral lead man that had been his type since the Maltese Falcon. The twist here is that for most of the picture he is an inactive hero, a mere observer, yet one who is constantly thinking and emoting. As such it's one of his more satisfying performances. Lauren Bacall is plainer here than in her previous pairings with Bogie, although I guess to have made her the sultry seductress would have seemed a touch indelicate, given that she is playing his buddy's widow. Edward G. Robinson plays a mob boss yet again, and I'm sorry to say this is him at his most average.As to the supporting players, we see Lionel Barrymore at his most restrained and subtle, although perhaps he was by now too frail to be so vigorously hammy. Claire Trevor was the picture's only Oscar nominee (and indeed winner), for a performance that is notable but overacted. For the record, my vote for Best Supporting Actress that year would have gone to Ellen Corby in I Remember Mama. Finally, an honourable mention goes to silent screen veteran Monte Blue, who is quite impressive in his brief role as the sheriff.While the unevenness of the cast can be overlooked, the one thing I feel really threatens to spoil Key Largo is the score by Max Steiner. He horrendously overworks the dramatic moments with blaring melodramatic arrangements, inappropriate for both the scope and tone of the picture. And the stereotypical "Red Indian" theme he gives to the scene where we meet the natives is just an embarrassment. Steiner's failure to "get" Key Largo is sadly indicative of a recurring problem in post-war Hollywood. As the studio system began to crumble and the smart producers of the previous decades began to die out, there were no guarantees on having a tight consistent team.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sailing Away To Key Largo</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What would 1940's American cinema be without Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall? It's a rhetorical question of course. But in this 1940's Bogie and Bacall classic, their presence is almost overshadowed by the combined talents of Claire Trevor, Lionel Barrymore, and the inimitable Edward G. Robinson. What a cast!Their story, about being stranded in a quaint, isolated, Florida hotel with high ceilings and ceiling fans during a hurricane is well known. Most film buffs regard "Key Largo" highly, partly because of its star power, partly because of the ingenious story, but also because of the excellent high contrast B&amp;W lighting that gives the visuals an Expressionistic cinematic style. When the electricity goes out, and the only source of lighting in the Largo Hotel is the oil lamps, the film oozes a wonderfully noir atmosphere. The howling wind outside, combined with the threatening presence of gangsters inside adds a strange mix of tension and danger.Bogie plays Frank McCloud, a WWII military man who seems to have lost his courage; he's now branded a coward. It's a tough position to be in when you're in the presence of a gangster like Johnny Rocco. When Rocco demands that McCloud helm the boat, to take the gangsters to Cuba, McCloud's courage is tested again.The film's acting is terrific. Claire Trevor deservedly won an Oscar for her performance as Gaye Dawn, the has-been nightclub singer and companion of Johnny Rocco. Thomas Gomez is great as Rocco's sidekick, Curly. But my personal favorite performance is Lionel Barrymore, as wheelchair-bound James Temple, the crusty and amiable owner of the Largo Hotel. That he is confined to a wheelchair adds immensely to the depth of his character.The only weakness in the story is the subplot about the Seminole Indians. That element seems awkward and out of place. Also, the film's nondescript background music is too loud and intrusive. And it tends to be manipulative, not unlike other noir films of that era.Those issues aside, "Key Largo" is the perfect movie to watch late at night during a thunderstorm. The film has a ton of cinematic atmosphere. It proceeds at a pleasantly slow, lazy pace. And it's got some of the greatest actors of that era, including Bogie and Bacall.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Key Largo is a remote island off the coast of Florida. It's connected to the mainland by a concrete causeway. Frank McCloud (Humphrey Bogart) goes there to visit the father of a dead army buddy. He meets him (Lionel Barrymore) and his buddies widow (Lauren Bacall). He also discovers criminal Johnny Rocco (Edward G. Robinson) is holed up there with his gang and alcoholic girlfriend (Claire Trevor). A hurricane hits and they're all stranded on the island together...and Johnny and his gang have guns and nasty tempers...Bogart and Bacall's last movie together and a good one too. This was based on a play and it sometimes shows. Characters tend to give long speeches explaining who they are and their motivations. Still it's well-written and acted and beautifully directed by John Huston. When the hurricane hits the special effects are actually pretty good with cool sound effects too.The acting is (with one exception) good. Bogart seemed incapable of giving a bad performance and he's just great here. Robinson doesn't show up until nearly 30 minutes in--but you always know he's there. He's OK but I think he played the gangster role once too often. Barrymore is given little to do but he is good. Trevor is superb in her small role--she understandably won a Best Supporting Actress award for this. Surprisingly Bacall is terrible! She's stone faced throughout and gives a bad performance. Maybe she didn't click with the director (Huston was not known for his tact and tended to be a screamer).Still it's a good solid drama--worth catching. I give it an 8.</fullReview>

The hotel is owned by Barrymore and his daughter Bacall. Bogart is there to give Barrymore some possessions of his son who was killed in the war.Bogart plays a returning WWII veteran and Bacall is the daughter of the hotel owner Barrymore. The film isn't a love story but you can still tell that Bacall adores Bogie and their chemistry is obvious.

		<fullReview>Key Largo's approximately may favorite movie, give or take an Apocalypse Now here or a Casablanca there. Bogart is a WWII vet paying a visit to the widow (Bacall) &amp; father (Barrymore) of a dead soldier, late under Bogie's command.Crooks have taken over the hotel for a week during this tourist off-season, evidently awaiting a fellow mug who'll relieve the gang of its stash, counterfeit money. Edw. G. Robinson is Johnny Rocco, gang executive, who's now back in the USA illegally, years after he was deported.Movie is a great study in the breakdown of group relations: gang members @each other's throats; aimless Bogie's ambiguous relations with Bacall &amp; Barrymore characters. All while anticipating the hurricane.Along the way, Bacall realizes that Bogie character was the real hero of the battle, not her late husband. &amp; They realize that Rocco was deported years ago. Review the scene where hoods tease Pop Temple ("Stand your ground!"): Barrymore had been disabled with arthritis for years when the scene calls for him to get up, take a swing @Rocco, &amp; fall down. Also note simmering disdain betw. Ziggy &amp; Rocco ("No more blasting away at each other!"). It's pretty intense cinema. Anybody notice that the shootout on the boat is more or less a recreation of the battle on that hill in Italy?: Bogie alone, against the forces of evil. The last scene, with Bacall throwing open the curtains, is still a tearjerker for me.Stellar cast includes Thomas Gomez as Curly ("Hotel Central. We're all together."), Harry Lewis as Toots ("It's guaranteed for life."), the incredible Claire Trevor as gang moll Gay Dawn ("How 'bout a drink? It'll help chase the blues away."), Monte "Ming the Merciless" Blue as Sheriff Wade, &amp; Dan Seymour as Angel: he was also the doorkeeper @Rick's in Casablanca. Jay Silverheels (Tonto in the TV series The Lone Ranger) is Tom Osceola.</fullReview>

Stealing every scene he's in, he has a grand time playing the crazed gangster. The first time we see him he's soaking in a tub, cooled by a fan, gnawing on a cigar. It's a comical scene--and the last time his character will provide any laughs for the viewer....Not only does Rocco delight in terrorizing Temple and Nora, but he taunts McCloud, and viciously humiliates his ex-mistress, a former nightclub singer turned alcoholic, Gaye Dawn(Claire Trevor)....Robinson's finest moment comes during the storm scene, when he expresses what's happening inside his character with broad, physical acting. As the storm rages, Rocco begins coming apart: his fear-filled eyes dart in different directions, and he paces the floor, sweating profusely. He has used his gun to kill many people, but now he knows it's useless against the storm....Theater-trained, the underrated Robinson was a versatile actor. Consider the range of his characterizations in such films as Double Indemnity, The Stranger, Scarlet Street, All My Sons, and of course Key Largo.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absorbing and worthy Film Noir with over-the-top acting , evocative settings , unsettling score and atmospheric photography</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stunning entertainment with twisted intrigue , thrills , realist frames and dramatic happenings . The big main star , Bogart , Bacall , Robinson , is backed by a host of fine support cast . It begins when a man visits his old friend's hotel and finds a a mob of gangsters running things . As a hurricane approaches, the two end up confronting each other . As a storm of fear and fury in the sizzling Florida Keys and the events go wrong . It is starred by Frank McCloud (Humphrey Bogart) who travels to a run-down hotel on Key Largo to honor the memory of a friend . The dead soldier's father, James Temple (Lionel Barrymore was severely disabled by arthritis and was confined to a wheelchair) runs a hotel in Key Largo with the help of his now widowed daughter-in-law Nora (Lauren Bacall) . But the motel is taken over by a bunch of mobsters led by Johnny Rocco (Edward G Robinson, his role was modeled on Al Capone, who retired to South Florida shortly after the St. Valentine's Day Massacre and died there of complications due to advanced syphilis) and his hoodlums (Thomas Gomez , Harry Lewis , Marc Lawrence) . Rocco is accompanied by his drunk moll (Claire Trevor , her role was based on real-life moll Gay Orlova , gangster Lucky Luciano's girlfriend). Exciting and thrilling picture with a complex intrigue , nice character studio , suspense , a lot of killings and interesting deeds . One of the most grueling of even Bogart's mobster movies all done in gripping realism and well shot by the great John Huston . Interesting and moving screenplay by Richard Brooks , John Huston and based on the play by Maxwell Anderson . However , the film version of "Key Largo" has very little to do with Maxwell Anderson's original play , all the characters in the play had their names changed in the film version. This was very unusual for a play written by Anderson, who was then one of the most highly regarded American playwrights, and whose best-known plays had, on the whole, been filmed faithfully . The picture has a Noir treatment though excessively stagy , but stars can quite compensate for some claustrophobic moments . This first-rate but slow-paced picture draws its riveting tale and power from the interaction of finely drawn roles as well as drama and emotion . Twisted film Noir about gangsters , robbing , forgery , treason , troubled relationships and dark secrets . It is a tough and tortuous thriller that has a good realization , an original script , haunting atmosphere , intriguing events ; for that reason madness and murder prevail . Exciting as well as rare film , possessing a mysterious and fascinating blend of gripping thriller , serenity , baroque suspense in which especially stands out the portentous performances , attractive cinematography in black and white by Karl Freund and magnificent musical score by the classic Max Steiner . This is pure cinema from the first to the last shot, where there's nothing left and each image has its sense and meaning . Stirring ending , in fact the final confrontation on a boat is actually the ending to the book "To Have and Have Not" which wasn't used in the film version . The ramshackle hotel where most of the drama unfolds was constructed on the Warner Bros lot along with the beach area. Exterior shots of the hurricane were actually taken from stock footage used in Night unto night (1949).Here Bogart is extraordinary and as cool as ever , his scenes with Lauren Bacall are awesome though underplayed compared to those they shared in The Big sleep , Dark passage and To have and to have not . This was fourth and final film pairing of Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall , a fifth film was planned several years later, but Bogart died before it could be made . Additionaly , the subjective camera record Humphrey's impressions giving a top-drawer acting . It's splendidly played by Humphrey Bogart ; he was in his best period of the late 40s and early 50s when he starred classic movies such as The Caine Mutiny, Sabrina, Beat the devil, The African Queen, Sirocco, In a lonely place, Chain lightning, Knock on any door and The enforcer. Supporting cast is frankly well , such as Lionel Barrymore , Claire Trevor , Thomas Gomez , Harry Lewis , Marc Lawrence , Monte Blue and uncredited Jay Silverheels , famous Indian Tonto of Lone Ranger . The motion picture produced in enough budget by Jack L. Warner and Jerry Wald was well directed by John Huston , though being extremely theatrical. The main character, Frank McCloud/Bogart describes having served in the WWII battle at San Pietro, Italy similarly to director/co-screenwriter John Huston had been involved in that battle as the creator of the documentary film San Pietro (1945) while he was in the U.S. Army's motion picture unit . Nice work by John Huston in demonstrating his skill at all areas : as technical , using all kind of resources for illustrating the interesting as well as dramatic story with an engaging screenplay , adding great actors , adequate filmmaking and enjoyable narration . The movie was filmed in only 78 days, virtually all on the Warner Bros. lot, except for a few shots in Florida used for the opening scenes . This film Key Largo" or "Huracn de Pasiones" or Cayo largo is absolutely recommended . Rating : Above average , it is a nice tale with enough drama , thrills and turns to keep you guessing .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strong Characters, Great Performances And Themes Of Entrapment &amp; Loss</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Key Largo" is a tense drama which takes place in a stiflingly hot, hurricane prone island off Florida and most of the action takes place in one room of a rundown hotel. The atmosphere this creates is predictably claustrophobic and oppressive and also has the effect of heightening the intensity of everything that happens in its confined environment. The screenplay was based on Maxwell Anderson's 1939 play of the same name but the changes made by John Huston and Richard Brooks also made the story much more topical for the audiences who saw the movie soon after its release in 1948.Shortly after the Second World War, ex-army major Frank McCloud (Humphrey Bogart) travels to the island of Key Largo to visit the family of George Temple who had served under his command in Italy and been killed in action. At the hotel run by George's father, James (Lionel Barrymore) and his widow, Nora (Lauren Bacall), Frank describes the circumstances which surrounded George's demise and the grateful family invite him to stay for the night.The hotel is officially closed for the off-season but is temporarily occupied by a small group of people who turn out to be the infamous gangster Johnny Rocco (Edward G Robinson), his henchmen and his mistress, Gaye Dawn (Claire Trevor). The only other person in the building is Clyde Sawyer (John Rodney) who's a Deputy Sheriff who'd been caught and beaten up by the gang whilst hunting for two Amreican Indians (the Osceola brothers) who'd recently escaped from prison.Rocco is awaiting the visit of another gangster and is due to complete a deal involving counterfeit money before returning to Cuba. His plans are disrupted when a hurricane warning is received and his contact's arrival is delayed by the weather.As the storm grows outside, Frank and the Temples are held at gunpoint by Rocco who amuses himself by trying to needle him into using it to shoot the gangster who also has a gun pointed at Frank. When Frank tosses the gun away, he's seen as a coward by Nora but when Sawyer picks up the gun and tries to escape, he's unable to defend himself because the gun has no bullets in it and the gangster kills him.Similar brutish behaviour follows as Rocco makes a pass at Nora (and she spits in his face) and he also humiliates the alcoholic Gaye by making her sing for a drink and then refuses to give her one. When the storm builds up, Rocco's normal threatening and cruel behaviour changes and he becomes fearful and very agitated.After the storm passes, Sheriff Ben Wade (Monte Blue) calls by and finds Sawyer's body outside the hotel. Rocco tells him that the Deputy was killed by the Osceola brothers who are nearby and when the Sheriff pursues them, they try to escape and he kills them both. Rocco and his men discover that their boat has disappeared and in order to enable them to escape, force Frank to pilot the Temples' boat to Cuba and this leads to the story's dramatic ending.A powerful theme of entrapment runs through the action as the Temples and Frank are held hostage by Rocco's gang and everyone in the hotel is trapped by the storm. James Temple is confined to a wheelchair and Gaye Dawn is trapped by her dependency on Rocco and alcohol. Sawyer was held captive by the gang and Frank is a prisoner of the psychological effects he's suffering as a result of his experiences in the war.The quality of the main characters' lives has also deteriorated. Rocco's status as a criminal has diminished because of the ending of prohibition and his exile from the United States, Gaye's alcoholism has taken its toll on her singing talent and her looks, James Temple has become disabled, Nora has been widowed and Frank is struggling to come to terms with the profound feelings of disillusionment and cynicism which are the legacy of his time in the Army. All of this is reflected by the appearance of the hotel which has also obviously seen better days.The characters in "Key Largo" are particularly memorable and the acting is consistently top class. Robinson is immense as the menacing mobster who is also a coward. Bogart is brilliant as the war veteran who finds it difficult to settle back down into civilian life and Claire Trevor is impressive in her Oscar winning role as the alcoholic gangster's moll whose addiction has transformed her into a pathetic shadow of her former self. Bacall portrays Nora's range of moods convincingly and Barrymore gives a strong performance exuding a mixture of sadness and pride on hearing about his son's exploits abroad and then almost bursting with anger and frustration during the siege."Key Largo" features the final Bogart and Bacall on-screen collaboration and the famous chemistry between them is evident throughout. In deference to the circumstances of their characters, however, their feelings for each other are seen to develop in a way which is very subtle and steady.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A decent thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Chiefly notable as a Bogie/Bacall vehicle, "Key Largo" focuses on a group of people trapped in a hotel at the mercy of a dangerous gangster. To make matters worse, a hurricane is approaching, increasing the tensions of all.The cast is a good one. Bogie &amp; Bacall are the headliners but in my opinion they're outshone by Edward G. Robinson &amp; Claire Trevor (who won an Oscar for her performance). I don't think that there's much of a spark between Bogie &amp; Bacall here but others seem to disagree. I also didn't find their characters very compelling, either.John Huston was in the director's chair and he did a fine job. The film looks polished, if not particularly remarkable. The Max Steiner score is also above average though it sometimes strikes a maudlin tone.In the end, I found the story to be rather inconsequential and somewhat lacking in thrills. I also didn't think that Bogart &amp; Bacall contributed as much as they could have. That being said, it's still a decent thriller, which, admittedly, is not a genre that I'm terribly fond of.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bogart and Edward G . face off in a Florida hotel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Humphrey Bogart is a man disillusioned by war who comes up against a gangster and his mob in "Key Largo," a 1948 film directed by John Huston and also, starring Lauren Bacall, Clare Trevor, Edward G. Robinson, and Lionel Barrymore.James Temple (Barrymore) runs the Largo Hotel on Key Largo with his daughter-in-law, Nora (Bacall). Frank McCloud (Bogart), is paying Temple a visit to tell of his son's bravery and death in his regiment during the war. Though the hotel is closed for the season, there are people there who seem anxious that McCloud leave immediately. Since a hurricane is brewing, Temple agreed to shelter them, not knowing who they are - a gang of thieves, led by the notorious Johnny Rocco (Robinson) who are awaiting a shipment of some kind. Soon Temple, Nora, and Frank are held hostage until the storm passes and the men can get their shipment and leave. Ultimately they expect Frank to sail them to Cuba.A storm rages outside and inside in this film, with Robinson playing an abusive tough guy who is terrified of the weather. Besides his lackeys (Thomas Gomez, Harry Lewis and Marc Lawrence), his drunken girlfriend, Gaye Dawn (Trevor) accompanies him and is at his beck and call though he's horrible to her. Like Rick in "Casablanca," Frank doesn't want to stick his neck out for anyone, which disappoints Nora who believes in fighting for what's right. Frank holds onto his resolve as long as he can, but like Rick, while his mouth says one thing, his genetic makeup causes him to do something else. Bogart, of course, could have played Johnny Rocco as well as he does Frank McCloud and been equally convincing, just as Robinson could be evil incarnate and turn around and play Dr. Ehrlich. Both are magnificent actors of the golden era, though their techniques are quite different. Where Robinson would grow a beard, assume an accent and a gentler tone playing "good" people, Bogart plays Frank just as he would have played Johnny or a lawyer for the poor in "Knock on Any Door" - yet the results would be vastly different. With Bogart, internalization of a role gives him uncanny timing; you don't know how he's different - he just is with a mere tweak of his screen persona. The most telling thing he does as Frank is, when Barrymore thanks him for telling him about his son, he extends his hand - instead of shaking hands, Bogart sandwiches Barrymore's hand in both of his - a tender gesture from a supposed tough guy.Lauren Bacall has a role that could have been played by any ingnue in Hollywood, taking part in the film because of both Huston and her husband. She's neither sexy nor glamorous in this. In fact, she looks like she's not wearing any makeup. She comes off as very feminine, vulnerable, and beautiful. She doesn't hold back her anger - when she spits at Johnny, you want to cheer but are afraid for her as well. Barrymore is excellent as a man humiliated by the realization that he's helpless against these goons.Acting kudos, however, go to the showiest role, that of Gaye Dawn, for which Claire Trevor won an Oscar. Gaye is a former singer successful in clubs - when Johnny makes her sing for a drink, she describes with pride and wistfulness her gowns, her lighting, and her act - it's one of the most pathetic scenes ever, this broken-down lush singing flat with the remnants of a great sound. It's a terrific performance, full of anger, desperation, and finally bravery."Key Largo" isn't the most exciting film ever made, but it's a rich character study which will keep the viewer absorbed. And years later, it even inspired a song: "We had it all Just like Bogie and Bacall Starring in our old late, late show Sailing away to Key Largo." For film aficionados, Bogie is indeed the stuff that dreams are made of.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The best of Bogart and Bacall. The speech Bogart makes in his bedroom is one of the best film speeches of all time. Almost like a JFK speech, or the MLK Dream speech.The rest of the film is well played, but slow by 21st century standards. The slow pace of the film is intentional, and it builds up the tension so that the viewer feels it as well. Good use of silence.The films treatment of the native Americans is realistic for the time, but the roles may be reversed from what you were likely to see. In Florida at that time, few locals had much respect for them, they were seen as lazy, because they did not buy in to the American social ideals.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Key Largo is a film of which enough good can not be said. The camera movement, directed by Huston, is breathtaking. Bogart and Bacall have never been better. The plot is entertaining. And finally, in a manner in which only the greatest directors of this era in American movies were capable, Huston -with the assistance of a great script- weaves a profound moral of mans responsibility for man. All told, this is one of a very rare breed: a timeless and flawless film, to be admired without reservation. So, if youre looking for a film to challenge, entertain, and charm you -watch Key Largo.

		<shortDescription>A great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>KEY LARGO is a very good movie with a fantastic story, excellent character development, good direction and a great cast. The pace was rather slow, but I was rarely bored.That acting in this movie is superb. Humphrey Bogart plays the same "tough guy" character he is known for, and he does it well. I truly believe that Humphrey Bogart is the "coolest" man who has ever lived. Edward G. Robinson stole the show as far as I'm concerned, playing perfectly the washed-out Prohibition-period gangster who is trying to get back into the game. Lionel Barrymore and Claire Trevor also deliver solid performances in their supporting roles (although I'm no sure I'd go as far to say that Claire Trevor deserved an Oscar).I loved the story in this movie. I love Al Capone-like gangster/noir stories, and the whole hostage situation was very fun and well done. It really allowed the characters to develop, especially of Humphrey Bogart's character, who at first is indifferent and tries to stay out of the gangster's way, but because he is a good man he eventually comes to the conclusion that the man must be stopped. We also see Edward G. Robinson's gangster character try to keep control and remain a "tough guy", but eventually start to panic and lose control of everything.There is also some good action and some memorable scenes, specifically the final showdown at sea, and another scene in which Robinson hands Bogart a gun and almost dares him to fire. The performances by Humphrey Bogart and Edward G. Robinson alone is enough to make this a great movie, let alone the excellent story, direction and supporting cast. A must see, especially for Bogie fans!8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Hurricane's On Its Way"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some innocent people are held prisoner by hoodlums in a ramshackle hotel on the Florida Keys. A tropical storm is brewing. Whether the bad guys will succeed, or get what they deserve, will depend on the courage and resourcefulness of one man ... "Key Largo" was the second Bogart-Bacall project, and to watch the film is to be left in no doubt that these two are a couple. Their silently-exchanged look of love, sitting on the lobby carpet, is a piece of cinema magic. Earlier, when tying-up the boat, they function naturally as a team. Watch how Bogey draws closer to Bacall by hauling on her rope. Bogart plays Major Frank McCloud, the war hero who has turned into a drifter. He has made his way down to Key Largo to pay his respects Nora, the widow of one of his men, killed in action at Monte Cassino. Also staying in the family-run hotel is a bunch of Illinois hoods involved in a money-counterfeiting scam. Their leader is Johnny Rocco (Edward G Robinson), deported from America some years earlier as an undesireable alien, and now making a surreptitious comeback via Cuba. The mobsters look and feel grotesquely out of place on the Key, urban gutter-rats polluting a natural paradise. Old man temple refers to them contemptuously as "You city filth!" The strong northern accents and inappropriate clothing of the mobsters emphasise the sense of their 'wrongness'. Johnny Rocco's respiratory problems in the Southern humidity are symbolically important. In every sense, he doesn't belong here. The villains have captured and tortured young Sawyer, a decent local cop. They will have to make their getaway before the search for Sawyer brings the authorities to the hotel. A hurricane is sweeping in from the Gulf. The storm stands as an image of the gangsters and their sudden, violent invasion. In a scene of sombre foreboding, Frank goes around the hotel closing all the shutters, narrowing down the world inhabited by the occupants. An extended family of Seminole indians has come in from the mangroves to shelter in the hotel. Old man Temple has always made them welcome during hurricanes, but now Rocco ruthlessly excludes them, abandoning them to fare as best they can in the storm. The no-good alien, constantly bleating about America's inhospitality towards him, shuns the true Americans mercilessly. Gaye Dawn (played by Claire Trevor, who died recently) was a beautiful woman a few short years ago. Now she is a broken-down alcoholic, a gangster's moll with no dignity and no prospects. Johnny humiliates her for amusement, forcing her to sing in return for a drink. She knows that her association with Rocco has ruined her. She sings, "What Have I Gone And Done?" Rocco keeps his malevolent underlings in place by constantly confronting each one, and extracting professions of loyalty. Each of the mobsters in turn has to undergo the ritual degradation. Rocco seems all-powerful in this little universe of the battened-down hotel, but Nora understands Frank, and knows that he will not accept vasseldom. "The cause isn't lost as long as someone is willing to go on fighting." The screen images are assembled in tight compositions of almost painterly sensibility (watch for the grouping of figures as Toots reads the newspaper jokes). An excellent long tracking shot sweeps down the staircase as Frank, silent and tight-lipped, endures the garbage spouted by the fat man. Extreme close-ups help establish a mood of great tension as the inmates wait for the storm to hit. Clever back-lighting picks out the craggy features of Bogart in the murk of the beleaguered hotel. Rocco is shot in silhouette as he whispers smut to Nora, the very incarnation of an evil angel. The hurricane passes, and hope returns. Nora throws open the shutter, allowing daylight to stream into her life once more. The nightmare has passed. "There'll be little to remind you of what happened tonight."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Didn't fill my high expectations, but still better then most of its period.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was overwhelmed when I read the cast and crew for this movie. Another Bogart/Bacall-Bogart/Huston collaboration is alright, but featuring Edward G. Robinson, Lionel Barrymore and Claire Trevor also? My expectations were sky-high. And that's the main reason I was a little upset with this picture. My problem was with the story. Although the movie has a good plot, it isn't well-told, and some of things felt out of place. Richard Brooks did a much better job adapting the script of "In Cold Blood" and "Elmer Gantry". I think that's mainly because those are based on novels, and this one is based on a play.The story is about a WWII veteran (Humphrey Bogart) that goes to the island of Key Largo in Florida to talk with the wife (Lauren Bacall) and father (Lionel Barrymore) of his old-friend from the war. That's when a gangster (Edward G. Robinson) takes control of the place and turns everyone into his hostages. At first, I didn't really get what was that gangster doing in that place, but it's latter explained that he's waiting for a hurricane and needs protection. But why that tiny island? I still don't get this, but alright. This flaw is compensated by one of the best climax I've ever seen in a movie. I'm not gonna spoil it here, but it's great.About the acting, Bogart did much better jobs in other pictures. This is the final movie with him and Lauren Bacall together, but I prefer their first collaboration in "To Have and Have Not". Edward G. Robinson also gives a great performance, but again, he was better in other movies like "Little Ceaser". In my opinion, the members of the cast that gives the best performances are Lionel Barrymore and Oscar- winning interpretation by Claire Trevor. They are both excellent.John Huston, as always, does a nice direction, but I prefer much better his masterpiece of the same year "The Treasure of Sierra Madre". That's where Huston proves the great director he is, and Bogart gives an outstanding performance.Overral, this movie has a fine acting, along with John Huston's direction and an excellent climax, but the bad-told screenplay takes away the good things about it.7 out of ten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb Acting And Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Set in the Key Largo Island, Key Largo places itself above its contemporaries as one of the definitive crime/gangster movies of the 1940's due to a superb cast, an excellent story, an unnerving setting and tense camera-work. John Huston holds the film together, allowing the characters, settings, and atmosphere to thrive on the screen.Johnny Rocco, played by Edward G. Robinson, remains one the most memorable gangsters to grace the screen, threatening but mortal. He knows there is such a thing as a fatal mistake, as he panics when a hurricane hits the resort, nearly ruining his deal with American associates. Yet even when the hurricane is hitting the resort, Rocco remains domineering and frightening, forcing his hostages to keep quiet when a sheriff visits with the threat of death, and even kills one that tries to escape. On the other side of the coin, Humphrey Bogart plays Frank McCloud, a World War II veteran and one of the hostages captured by Rocco. Unlike most heroic hostages in other movies, McCloud not only knows he's at a serious disadvantage, he subjects himself to that disadvantage and doesn't fight back, but waits. And waits. And waits until the end. In one of the movies tensest scenes, Rocco offers McCloud the chance to kill him. McCloud declines the chance, knowing he would be shot by Rocco's henchmen soon after. One of the other hostages takes the chance, and is promptly shot by Rocco. Rocco quickly reveals the gun he offered McCloud had no bullets, thus being a complete waste and instant death. McCloud proves himself as the standout hostage because of his common sense and his stoicism, barely flinching when Rocco threatens him.Other notable mentions in the cast include Lionel Barrymore as James Temple, the hotel owner who despises Rocco; Lauren Bacall as Nora Temple, the widow of a veteran whom McCloud knew; and Claire Trevor ended up winning the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her portrayal as Gaye Dawn, a drunken singer and the moll of Rocco.The ending to Key Largo seals the movie's reputation, finally allowing McCloud to take his revenge on Rocco and his henchmen, thus giving him his freedom. The ending shootout remains one of film's more memorable, handled with care yet as tense and surprising as the scenes inside the hotel. With its superb cast and tense atmosphere, Key Largo remains one of the definitive gangster films of the 1940's.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ravaged post-war psyches versus ruthless gangsters .....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dear John Huston, Key Largo was a terrific thriller which revealed the ravaged psyche of citizens and general sense of doom in post-world war 2 America. A somber ex-soldier (Bogart) visits a hotel run by his dead fellow soldier's wife (Bacall) and father. He gets entangled in their predicament as a bunch of gangsters have taken over the hotel and are waiting for a hurricane to pass so that they could take a boat to Cuba.Edward.G.Robinson steals the show as Johnny Rocco - the leader of the gang. He is helped by the fact that both Bogie and Bacall are playing extremely submissive roles. His use of face expressions and posture helps distract attention from his short and portly demeanor. Even the cinematographer and the writer seemed to be in love with the character. He gets many close ups and obviously the best lines.The film foregrounded the sweeping power of evil as it renders everyone helpless and impotent. The film might as well be an allegory for the plight of the common man during the great war. The ending establishes the self-destructive nature of evil.A fine rollicking score by Max Steiner sets the mood for a tense night in a hotel during a hurricane attack.Brian De Palma was obviously inspired by the shaving scene in Key Largo for the opening scene in The Untouchables. A group of people forced to spend time together in a confined space due to the forces of nature ..... The Hateful Eight? The fact that the film completely ignores the outdoors of Key Largo is a drawback. There are shots of a few monstrous waves. That's it.Best Regards, Pimpin.(7.5/10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What's so great about Film-noir's is that they thrust the audience into uncomfortable and alienating situations. While Key Largo is in most ways a lighter noir, it still creates a great amount dread and ominous situations, all a tribute to John Huston's wonderful direction here. Key Largo re-teamed Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall for the 4th and final time and it is yet another gem in their resumes. Lionel Barrymore, Edward G. Robinson, and Claire Trevor round out a tremendously talented cast. It helps that Key Largo is based on a play which gives the actors plenty of room to thrive in this crime drama film noir. Trevor won the Oscar for supporting actress and she's incredible, but Barrymore never fails to amaze me in a wheelchair. Between this, You Can't Take it With You, and It's a Wonderful Life, he has gave me some of the most enjoyable movie experiences, so thank you Mr. Barrymore.The film delves into a man's (Bogart) post World War II trip to his friends hotel when they are stranded with a bunch of gangsters during a hurricane. The premise itself thrives as a stage production by it also manages to give us an engaging and thrilling cinematic experience as well. I love how there is never any real assurance from the writing or direction that this film will be a happy ending, which makes it such a great noir. A hurricane and a bunch of gangsters? The only actor qualified for such circumstances has to be the one and only Humphrey Bogart.In all seriousness, Key Largo is a really good film. With a setting that sticks to the confinement of the hotel for 90% of the film, I can't speak highly enough of the directing and acting. It's difficult to make an action film with plenty of vivacious settings to be engaging for 90 minutes but Key Largo manages to it with one hotel, that's impressive. The character arcs of both Robinson's Johnny Rocco and Bogart's Frank Mcloud are interestingly paralleled. Both have nowhere to go or fit in and they both plenty of desires and hopes. To me, the scenes between both of them were the most fascinating. So overall, Key Largo is a classic. It gives you everything you want from a noir standpoint, while also creating a solid crime thriller in the process.+Direction+Barrymore always steals the show+Noir elements8.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stagy? Thank God!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>People often criticize this movie for really not being much more than a filmed play. Yeah! So what's wrong with that when the characters are three dimensional and the actors are brilliant. This movie gets dull only when it moves out of the hotel (the stage) and becomes a traditional action movie. The black and white photography is brilliant (I once saw it colorized and it was dreadful). The production design is perfectly honest. The direction is so clear and unpretentious; when you have faces as brilliant as these, you gotta take advantage of closeups. There is not one less than outstanding performance. Bacall's role doesn't call for her to do a lot of "acting" and as a result, she is very moving. Trevor had tough competition for her Oscar that year and she won because she understood that too much restraint would have been wrong yet she never goes too far. Bsrrymore is unusually tough and commanding, almost heroic against the thugs. Bogart is quiet and direct and when he gives Trevor her drink has the most powerful moment in the movie. Robinson? It is a real showy role, and Edward knew what not to do. He is savage. And he almost is sexy when he gets Claire to sing her song but he can revert to a monster within seconds and give the audience chills. It really is his movie. Gomez and his fellow stupid thugs are funny at times but the script is unusually honest and barbaric. Take away their guns and these guys are wimps. But why didn't they just stay in the hotel? The shootout at the end could have been done that way. The escape to Cuba isn't believable or compelling. Those who call this movie slow, just don't get it. They don't understand that artists use pacing for effect. Today's generation loving special effects and action and over-the-top acting will hate this movie. Their loss. And the loss for the future of film and theatre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>That rumble you hear over the Florida Keys isn't just thunder from an oncoming hurricane, it's two giants of Warner Bros.' classic gangster movies having one final on-screen brawl. And one of them brought his dame with him.For the purposes of the film, that would be Edward G. Robinson's Johnny Rocco character, a semi-retired mobster who moves into a hotel in Key Largo off-season to make a big score, taking with him a few of his boys and an old flame, Gaye Dawn (Claire Trevor).Humphrey Bogart's Frank McCloud is a former Army major who fought in Italy, and comes to pay his respects to the father (Lionel Barrymore) and widow (Lauren Bacall) of a fallen comrade, who run the same hotel. He's not a gangster this time, but he's still a tough guy, as Rocco and his bulls find out when they try and take McCloud for a ride."Key Largo" is a brilliantly acted, moody and suspenseful film worthy of the talents of all concerned, including director/co- screenwriter John Huston. It's got a distinct Hemingway vibe about it, kind of "Soldier's Home" meets "The Killers" with McCloud a sort of Nick Adams figure. He hardly says very much, but he makes you pay attention when he does speak. (Bogart and Bacall earlier made a movie based on a Hemingway novel that didn't seem much like Papa at all!)Trevor won the film's lone Oscar, and deserved it, but Robinson steals the picture. As mark.waltz points out in his July 2012 review here, the name seems a callback to the crime-boss character Rico that Robinson played in "Little Caesar," and he's still the same trigger-happy dumbbell here that he was then. He exudes menace and cruelty, and also a sense of bewildered helplessness at his present condition that's rather affecting:"After living in the USA for more than 30 years, they called me an undesirable alien. Me, Johnny Rocco. Like I was a dirty Red or sumthin!"The gang around him is great, too, hard-boiled stereotypes but quite well acted. I particularly enjoyed Thomas Gomez as Curly, Rocco's number-two. He chews a mean wad of gum and has a hilarious monologue while trying to distract an angry Rocco about people bringing back Prohibition so the gangsters can have the old days back.What I don't like so much about the film is the odd subtext, which plays up McCloud's current disillusionment on account of Rocco being present. Did he really think World War II was the war to end gangsterism?There's also a subplot about some local Seminoles who huddle around the hotel when the hurricane strikes. You kind of need them late in the film for the tragedy that triggers McCloud's late burst of action, but it doesn't make any sense on its own. It feels tacked on and a bit stagey, like much else in this film.And what's with the anger directed at McCloud for not plugging Rocco? Did that scene ever make sense as a display of apparent cowardice on McCloud's part? What was he supposed to do?Max Steiner's overbearing score is another letdown. I didn't even think much of the final confrontation between McCloud and Rocco's gang. It's a bit too easy and low-key.But what's good about "Key Largo" outweighs what's not. Bacall does fine work playing a part rather than burnishing her star power, and Bogart shows how to let another screen legend (Robinson) rant on and on without losing his own magnetism. And did anyone make a shave seem as hilarious and terrifying as Edward G.?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty tense and exciting, generally satisfying</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I often feel like I don't fully understand these kinds of movies. Old ones basically, where there's lots of talking. Ways of life have changed so much. I don't get all of the social cues that are going on. I have no idea what the subtext of all the dialogue is. And yet, I've gotten used to certain patterns over time. I can tell when something's about to go down or if a character's lying or pushing buttons. Still, words aren't needed for certain facial expressions, you can immediately tell what someone is feeling or thinking.Most of this movie takes place in a hotel. Something comes up and some gangsters are forced to reveal themselves and take the guests and owners as hostages. They don't want any trouble. But then a hurricane comes and things get more complicated. Nobody can leave, at least for a while. Maybe someone will try to be a hero or talk smart. The tension builds.Johnny Rocco is a famous gangster (based on Al Capone and Lucky Luciano) who all the regular people despise. So much so that some of them can't keep it to themselves in spite of the harm it might bring to them. Edward G. Robinson really gets into the role alternating between brutal coldness and smarmy talking. He's confident but Frank McCloud (Humphrey Bogart) begins to see weaknesses, giving him some leverage. Frank talks logic, he thinks ahead and explains things.Key Largo seems to have a bit of a theme about war veterans in contrast with gangsters, these two extremes of Americans. The really noble, brave kind Vs. the heartless, selfish, evil kind. Frank (like every Bogart character) announces that he only cares about his own business and it seems true. But even he has to morally conclude that stopping someone like Rocco by any means could only be a good thing. This means he's willing to take some risks to harm Rocco which puts himself and the others in danger. I think there's a bit more emotion here from Bogart than usual. He even smiles a couple of times.The finale was pretty riveting and satisfying. It's always good when you're actually rooting for the good guys and you want the bad guys dead (because they're that bad). And you're on the edge of your seat because you hope things turn out well but know that anything could happen. It shows that you believe in and care about the characters. Well, what a turbulent experience for all of them!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Edgy, suspenseful, dramatic. For what more could you ask? This has to be one of Bogey's best performances, but how can you tell? All his performances were darned good, but this time he seems almost relaxed even as his character goes through some major changes. His apparent relaxed state does not in any way translate to a dialed-in performance or a seeming calm where he should be anything but, but comes off more as a comfort within his own skin; a confidence and self assured quality he seemed just shy of, in past performances.Although I'm no fan of war movies, I've never seen a Bogey performance I didn't like. But Key Largo carries with it a large amount of suspense that starts from the early scenes, and survives all the way through to the very end, with no release or break. This must have had theater patrons literally on the edge of their seats way back when. We were more innocent as a nation then...as a society.All in all? I cannot recommend this for younger viewers, as there is a base roughness in it most modern movies, even with all the cursing and gore, never seem to achieve. I suppose that, in our innocence, it wasn't just our naivet as a society that was heightened, but our darkness, as well.This is very well written with believable dialog and tremendously enigmatic characters. I love it.It rates a solid 8/10 on the B&amp;W scale from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>While a hurricane rages outside an old hotel, in Key Largo, nothing can match the fury of human emotions inside the building.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Key Largo" was filmed in 1948 and served to give more notice to the attraction of film-noir movies, and the acting talents of Humphrey Bogart, Edward G. Robinson, Lauren Bacall, and Lionel Barrymore. Those talents, alone, would make "Key Largo" a very watchable film, but throw in the elements of a storm that is raging around them, and an Oscar-winning role for Claire Trevor, and the viewer has a superb film in front of him/her.Bogart plays an ex-army major who comes to the area of Key Largo to visit the family of a deceased soldier who was in his unit during the war. Barrymore plays the father of said GI, and Bacall his widow. They are glad to see Bogart and make no bones about having him stay over. However, in the hotel run by Barrymore, there are some gangsters posing as guests who are basically holding everybody as prisoner until they make a criminal deal, and leave the area. Heading the gang is Edward G. Robinson, who as Johnny Rocco, was a big-time hood once, and who aspires to climb that pinnacle of success again. The storm rages outside, and the criminals hold everybody captive inside. Compounding the problems to be endured is the fact that the local sheriff and his deputy are looking for two escaped Indians whom they suspect have come to the hotel, because Barrymore has always been a friend and benevolent benefactor to them. All the emotions that can be brought up come to a head in a small boat at sea after the storm comes to an end.Directed by John Huston, who always seemed to be a good director for Bogart, this film rates very high on Film-noir lists. Sit back while the hurricane rages.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Key Largo is a very good movie for there are no flaws in the directing, the story...Yet, among modern movies that one might look too fiercely based on the themes of courage/cowardice, pride/self-esteem, sacrifice/altruism. There the usual Bogey disillusioned character might sound rehashed as it is not the same big role as in Casablanca, the Maltese Falcon or the Big Sleep. Furthermore the villain character played by Edward G. Robinson is unsubtle whereas Hitchcock movies had this strength of making the bad guy look friendly at times. Opposite are Lauren Bacall, beautiful and with a more subtle character, and Lionel Barrymore, great as always. That's enough to enjoy Key Largo without any further questions.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Arriving at Key Largo, Florida, ex-Major Frank McCloud (Humphrey Bogart) meets up with Hotel Largo proprietor James Temple (Lionel Barrymore) and his former daughter-in-law Nora (Lauren Bacall), widow of one of Frank's unit from the war. The hotel is near deserted, with only a small handful of unruly looking characters staying there. It turns out that they have rented the hotel for a fishing holiday, but after an alcoholic woman they are with, Gaye Dawn (Claire Trevor), is manhandled by one of the group, Frank starts to suspect that there is more going on than it first seemed. With a hurricane approaching, Temple closes the hotel to wait out the storm, but the arrival of notorious gangster Johnny Rocco (Edward G. Robinson) and his injured police officer prisoner, confirms Frank's fears.John Huston made many films in his long Hollywood career, and this was the last of four films that Bogart and Bacall made together, but Key Largo is far from the most fondly remembered of all their films. Yet although it doesn't achieve true greatness, especially when you compare it to the likes of Huston's masterpieces The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948) and The African Queen (1951), the talent on display allows it to be a tense, visually striking and occasionally riveting little film noir. The theatrical roots (it was adapted from Maxwell Anderson's 1938 play) of the film means the scale is minimal, but if nothing adds to the sweaty, closed-in atmosphere, all rendered beautifully by Karl Freund's cinematography, and Huston and Richard Brooks' script gives plenty for the cast to chew on, especially the colossal Robinson and the Academy Award-winning Trevor.Although he comes second in the credits, Robinson dominates the film when he enters about twenty minutes in. He lies sprawled in the bath chomping a huge cigar, like a revolting beached animal, and emerges to truly push Bogart out of the limelight. Even the opening title sequence reflects this, with Robinson's name higher than Bogart's. It's an alarmingly restrained performance from Bogart, who we are all used to as either the bad guy, or the tough anti-hero, and Bacall is disappointingly mute, her character being no more than the put-upon love interest when will always be remembered for playing the sultry femme fatale.Robinson dominates, but Trevor steals the show as Rocco's boozy, gambling ex-star girlfriend, who is the figure of desperation when Rocco masochistically makes her sing for everybody for a drink. She sings a story of a woman abused by her partner, and breaks down during the climax. Rocco, affected by the similarity, refuses her a drink anyway, only to have Frank pour her a hard drink and hand it to her, enraging Rocco. It's a great scene, and most likely the scene than won Trevor the Oscar. It is the quality of the acting, and some fine technical work that really bring the B-movie plot to life, as well as Huston's ability to craft an exciting, yet dark thriller.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just caught this on PBS for the first time. Just surfing by and started to watch it and couldn't stop. Loved the setting, for many reasons, one, I love storms, not sure why, just do. The cast was superb, Lauren Bacall was so elegantly beautiful, I found her quite stunning in this, couldn't take my eyes off her. Humphrey Bogart, Edward G. Robinson and Lionel Barrymore all gave outstanding performances. I always get a kick out of seeing Barrymore in movies other than It's A Wonderfully Life. He is so recognized for that movie it's nice to see other acting sides to him. I find myself gravitating to older movies from forties and fifties as they have something that most modern movies don't, stories. Good stories and characters we care about. You really cared about what happens to Frank and the rest of the hostages and you so badly want to see the mean and nasty Rocco get his, which of course he does. The scene at the end when Frank walks out of the hotel with the mobsters and Nora looks fearful at his retreating form with her face half hidden by the shadows. Signifying, doubt, regret the unknowing what will happen to this new man who she has fallen in love with, is beyond superlative directing and acting. I was transfixed by Bacall's performance, not just because she's stunning. But I've never seen an actor portray so much with so little dialogue. This movie had subtlety and nuance that is so sadly lacking in modern films!!!! The more you see Bogart and Robinson, you realize how truly great they were!!!I obviously loved the movie and everyone in it!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie got based on a stage-play by Maxwell Anderson. The movie its story and setting really all have the typical stage-play ingredients but thank goodness the movie does not feel like a stage-play. Yet the movie knows to maintain all of the elements that make a stage-play powerful. The movie has some great written dialog and constructed story and one great cast that knows how to handle it all.What an incredible dream cast this movie has. It's the fourth (and last) collaboration of Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall and it even isn't their best but that says something more about their other movies than this one really. It's above all a perfectly cast movie, in which all of the actors suit their roles. Edward G. Robinson is of course great as the big, mean, tough gangster boss. The movie also features other acclaimed actors such as Lionel Barrymore, Claire Trevor and Marc Lawrence.It's a movie that is mostly set at one location (a small hotel), which allowed the writers to use their creativity to make the movie interesting and intriguing to watch and gave the actors as well the opportunity to let their talent shine. The end result is also an extremely well constructed and intriguing movie to watch, from start till finish. Never a slow or dull moment here! It's of course also thanks to John Huston's professional directing that the movie and its 'simple' concept works out so well.In my opinion this is not really a film-noir, even though it uses some of its elements. It's more a 'modern' crime thriller, that lays its emphasis mostly on the dialog and characters, that get deepened out a lot.A fantastic John Huston classic.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

I hear this line all the time like a commerical on the 60's/70's radio stations ... there have been alot of "remakes" of movies ... John Houston (director of this movie) was asked once what his opinion was of remaking movies .. he said he had no problem of remaking the bad ones but leave the good ones alone ... I personally would love to see this movie remade principally due to the technicalogical advances since this movie was made in October 1948 ... but then again ... trying to replace Bogart/Robinson/McCall/or the Wizard of Oz guy (Barrymore) would bring back the words of John Houston ... "leave the good ones alone".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being a frequent visitor to the Keys myself (I have family there), I wanted to see if this movie could capture the natural beauty of the place and put it on screen. A place where people own as many boats as they do cars, there's only one main road, and it's never more than a five minute walk from the Atlantic Ocean to the Gulf of Mexico, the Keys have a unique low-key atmosphere with a serene sense of quietness. The black-and-white photography did indeed live up to my expectations, bringing the Keys of fifty years ago to life. Going slightly out of order, I'll now give the basics of the story, which starts out with one of the most original first twenty minutes I've ever seen. Essentially, nothing really happens here, except we're just getting to know the characters who are conversing in a hotel lobby without the presence of conflict. You might call it an overly long exposition, but I enjoyed the pace of the film, because like the photography, the dialogue between the characters is very lifelike. After a sluggish pace, things pick up rather abruptly, as the bad guys starts shaking things up. As it turns out, several of the hotel guests are part of a vicious gang led by a the notorious mobster Rockom played by Edward G Robinson. I really enjoyed the fact that to compensate for Robinson being a little too small to be taken seriously on stage presence alone, there's a lot of hype about him before he actually appears on screen. Essentially, things turn into a hostage situation with Humphrey Bogart's army officer Frank McCloud as the group's best hope of saving the day. Reminiscent of 12 Angry Men or Hitchkock's Lifeboat, Key Largo is able to create tension and excitement within a very small space. The battle of wits between two highly-revered men, McCloud and Robinson, and the degree to which the film blows them both up, really adds a lot. There are also a number of scenes, which standing apart from the film, are very well-executed. For example, the arrival of a sheriff whose uninformed of the danger, really keeps us guessing, because we're not sure if anyone will confide anything to him, or even if they should. A lot of this is driven by Humphrey Bogart, whose natural ease translates into a guy who knows what he's doing. Bogart's character was literally never wrong in any move he made over the course of the movie. Looking back and pondering why this film didn't get more critical acclaim or make the AFI top 100 list, my guess is that there were just too many established Humphrey Bogart films on that list such as `Africa Queen', `Maltese Falcon', or `Casablanca.' Nevertheless, that's no excuse to overlook a movie like this one.</fullReview>

His portrayal of the small-minded, greedy crook with a panache for cruelty towards friends and former lovers is formidable, and comical for all the wrong reasons. His is a character who lives in the shadow of his own former greatness as a gangster kingpin, surrounded by a posse of yes-men and psychopaths, and, suffice it to say, adversity and "wise guys" are dealt with with no small amount of cowardice and brutality. This is one of Robinsons finest moments, compatible with such classics as Little Caesar, The Stranger, and Double Indemnity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another Huston-Bogart triumph, 'Key Largo' is an exceptionally good film-noir from the forties. Bogart provides a terrific psychological study of a post WW2-veteran struggling to adapt to society once more. It's one of his best performances, and provides him with a chance to show his impressive range. Bogart didn't just play himself over and over again. Every cynical outsider he plays is different, with Bogart bringing more to the role than just his incredible presence.Edward G. Robinson is terrific also as the gangster who holes Bogart, Bacall, Robinson and Trevor up in the motel Key Largo on one eventful night. He is repulsive, and representative of the old-style greed and power-hungry figure that Americans grew to detest after the War. He battles Bogart in this film, and there's no doubt as to who our hero is.The great Lionel Barrymore is, well, great as the wheelchair-bound owner of the motel Robinson holds up. One can only imagine the reaction of an American audience, accustomed to watching Barrymore act in a wheelchair for many years, to Barrymore's wobbly rise to his legs. Trevor's performance was Oscar-winning, and she certainly is scene-stealing as the drunken floozy who Robinson relentlessly bullies. Bacall is is fine form as Nora Templeton, war widow and daughter-in-law of Barrymore.The Bogart-Bacall teaming is used to marvelous effect again in their last screen outing together. It's a tender, tentative love we are watching evolve (Bogart and Bacall don't actually lock lips in this film), based on mutual need and growing affection. Nora is weary like Frank McCloud, and their lies the equality essential to every Bacall-Bogart film.Great camera-work, and fine sense of atmosphere from Huston. Filmed basically in one building, 'Key Largo' certainly conveys film noir's central thematic elements of pessimism, disillusionment, mistrust and danger.Definitely a classic.9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the kind of "old-school" thriller that could thrill today's moviegoers just as much as back then</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With an all-star cast from the period- Bogie, Bacall, EG Robinson, Lionel Barrymore- and one of the most successful studio auteur's ever, John Huston, it's not too much to wonder that there is a bit of a high expectation before watching a film like Key Largo. I watched it very late one night, and did not feel tired for a moment. This is the kind of thriller that takes its time in the storytelling with enough attitude and specific scenes with pathos that add to its appeal. Bogie's character comes down to Florida to see an old friend, an old man in Lionel Barrymore. It's at a hotel that also features Barrymore's daughter, played by Bacall, and Claire Trevor as well. But then gangsters, led by Rocco (Rosbinson), break in holding everyone hostage, even as a hurricane rages on outside.I would be inclined to note, as some other reviewers have, that the tendency for Robinson &amp;/or Bogart to go with scenery chewing is almost a given of the dish that's served. But for fans of the two iconic masculine Hollywood figures, Key Largo is an essential viewing. Robinson especially has one of his very best turns as Rocco, a gangster without much remorse or sympathy, though some of his weaker side starts to show as the hurricane outside impedes further on their plans. A lot of the film, in actuality, is talk, and the film was even once a play. What Huston as a director is able to get right are the subtleties of certain scenes (even Bogart's presence as a star is subdued at times with its supporting players, especially Barrymore). One that stands out for me is when Robisnon forces Trevor to sing, which she does with more emotion and fear than talent. I also loved the way the people outside of the hotel were left to fend against the storm and Rocco's insistence to keep them out- rather tragic in the midst of the rest of the story, really.But, when the film does pick up the pace with the action or thrills, the audience is not left unsatisfied after many scenes of back and forth dialog that rings as very 'movie-like' ("You don't like it, do you Rocco, the storm? Show it your gun, why don't you? If it doesn't stop, shoot it.) The scenes towards the end on the boat are some of the better scenes Huston's done with the tension and excitement that he can stir up in his thrillers. Key Largo in the end turns up to be one of those full-on classics of the Hollywood Golden age that may not be seen as much as some of the other Bogart films or even his work with Bacall (I would bet more have seen The Big Sleep than Key Largo). But I would definitely say for future filmmakers who want to get into the action genre or the blockbuster to take a look at this picture, that starts off with solid characterization- that we truly care about the good guys and despise the bad guys- and concludes with a good bang. And some hefty atmosphere on part of the hurricane doesn't hurt either. Grade: A</fullReview>

It brings together the talents of a great cast, most notably Trevor, in an Oscar winning role, as a brassy, boozy girl of the moment for Edward G. Robinson, who's perfect, as he always was. Bogart was beginning to show his age, but he's still perfect in the film, as is Bacall and Barrymore.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes. I'm fully aware that Key Largo is considered by many to be an all-time classic from Hollywood's heyday, but, the truth is, I found this decidedly stagy, gangster film (that required a full-blown hurricane to liven its story up) certainly left a whole lot to be desired.It sure seems to me that this 1948 film has not aged well over the past 70 years. At times I found its dead-serious dramatics to be almost comical in nature.There were a number of scenes when someone was being threatened with a nasty remark and a loaded gun and I found myself actually chuckling away at the unintentional humor that prevailed.I also thought that Humphrey Bogart (50 at the time) looked very tired and haggard and about 10 years beyond his actual age. As well - The role of Frank McCloud that Bogart played was, pretty much, a real nothing part where the character only seemed to come to life in the story's final showdown, and that was it.All-in-all - Key Largo turned out to be nothing more than a so-so Crime/Drama. I think that a lot of this film's inferiority rests on the shoulders of its eccentric and temperamental director, John Huston.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ex-Army Major Frank McCloud travels down to Key Largo, in order to pay his respects to the family of one of his fallen comrades. When he gets there, the hotel they run is being inhabited by city men of the shady kind. He gets a drink from a woman at the bar, and then goes out to meet the family. At the same time, the hotel receives a storm warning, a hurricane is on the way. They shut up the hotel, and then it is revealed that the shady men are working for Johnny Rocco.Rocco was a Prohibition era gangster, and he is in Key Largo to collect a payment. As the hurricane comes and the characters are all trapped under the same roof, danger ensues.If Hollywood was good for one thing in the 1940s, it was making films like this. This kind of adventure film speaks to the masses, while still managing to entertain. This was the kind of action film you got back then, except less action and more buildup and talking. This is the kind of film they don't make anymore, and the kind I wish they did. A film like this doesn't need a good director, or a good plot, just good actors and great dialog. This film has all of the above.The acting is consistently excellent. Humphrey Bogart plays his typical stoic hero, but that's okay because the part never gets old. Lauren Bacall does good work as the widow of Bogart's old army buddy, but her part is the most clichd and uninteresting. Still, she holds her own against the rest of the cast. Lionel Barrymore is also quite good, a contrast to his despicable character in It's A Wonderful Life the year before.However the two standouts among the cast are Edward G. Robinson and Claire Trevor. Robinson gives a performance that acts like a swansong to the gangster characters he cut his teeth on in the 1930s. He is crass, rude and evil, yet he has a bit of heart. You don't cheer for him, but you do feel sorry for him. However the pity you feel towards Robinson is nothing compared to that of which you feel towards Claire Trevor.While Trevor mainly stays in the background for the film, she does come out in one terrific scene that definitely justifies her Oscar win. In the scene, she sings one of her old songs so that Robinson will give her a drink. Trevor makes the best of the scene and her rendition is pitiful. Robinson won't give her the drink, but Bogart gives it to her anyways. It's one of the film's best scenes.While the performances are quite good, they wouldn't work if it were not for the great dialog by Huston and Richard Brooks. While not endlessly quotable like Casablanca, their writing does give the story it's edge, and it works perfectly, although there is one line that comes out of nowhere that doesn't quite fit. The last scene, borrowed from To Have and Have Not, is a thrilling end to the story, and although it may be called cheesy by some, I believe that it was the perfect way to end such a film.The cinematography is rather simple, but for a stage bound film like this, it is perfectly adequate. The score is unmemorable, or maybe there was no score. If there was it was too boring to remember. The hurricane scenes are surprisingly well done, and the sets are well built and convinces. For a studio production, it sure tries hard to make it look realistic.Now to Huston's direction. While this story really carries no directorial trademark, it is still very well done and thrilling. Huston keeps an iron grip over the story, and though his direction is lax, it still accomplishes what it needs to.Overall, I found this film to be a nifty little thriller. It is very entertaining and still contains enough to think about afterwords. Definitely one I'd watch again.Key Largo, 1948, Starring: Humphrey Bogart, Edward G. Robinson and Lauren Bacall, Directed by John Huston, 8.5/10 (A)(This is part of an ongoing project to watch and review every John Huston movie.

		<shortDescription>Potboiling Crime Drama down Florida Way...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can watch Key Largo til the cows come home and have seen it at least half a dozen times. It's got some of the best elements from all the great film noir's, plus an amazing cast and an added "exotic" location.Like the claustrophobic and sweaty Deep South melodramas from Tennessee Williams and such, Key Largo has lashings of ripe and heated verbal conflict, kidnapping and colourful characters, complete with an impending hurricane, just to spice things up further.Whilst it might not have the iconic visuals, or classic lines of that other Bogart/John Huston classic 'The Maltese Falcon', Key Largo is actually easier to watch and easier to follow. And as with any film pairing the Hollywood Golden couple of Bogart &amp; Bacall, it remains essential viewing for any self-respecting film lover.A run-down Florida hotel is taken over by a gang of thugs and their mobster boss, (an excellent, sociopathic Edward G Robinson, who reprises his mega sinister 'Little Caesar' role) and his pathetic alcoholic floozy, an Oscar-winning Claire Trevor. Wheelchair-bound James Temple, the Hotel owner, played by the reassuring Lionel Barrymore and his daughter, Nora, played by Lauren Bacall try to handle this assault on their personal freedom but it soon gets out of hand. She's the widow of a WW2 buddy of Humphrey Bogart's character, who died in action and who Bogart visits out of respect.Notorious 'public enemy', nasty criminal, Johnny Rocco, presumed dead by some and his cronies is making his escape with loads of loot in the Keys when the winds whip up and so they take refuge in the resort. There's a battle of wits, followed by a battle of guns, bombardment by crashing palm trees and ferocious storms and then a finally a mad rush to escape (again) with the concluding final battle of everything between Robinson and Bogart.It's all entertaining nonsense, really but with more than a dash of bravado and plenty of action toward the end. I think it's an overlooked, under-appreciated gem, far from perfect but one that still glints and continues to catch my eye.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the ultimate Edward G. Robinson flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Someone listening to the misleadingly-worded 80's pop song 'Key Largo' by Bertie Higgins might be led to believe that the 1948 film of the same name tells of another classic Bogart/Bacall romance along the lines of 'To Have And Have Not.' Such is not the case. 'Key Largo,' the movie, is instead a taut, mean gangster flick set in the Florida Keys with a hurricane as backdrop. There's really no romance at all between Bogart and Bacall; she plays the widow of a man who served with Bogie's character in WW2. Both are more featured players than anything in an acting ensemble, and the film itself looks and feels like a brutal cousin of 'Petrified Forest,' released eleven years prior. No, the star here clearly is Edward G. Robinson, giving a defining blockbuster performance as Johnny Rocco, one-time top of the heap gang boss who is determined to claw his way back. As with Bogart's Duke Mantee in the earlier film, Rocco and his gang are holed up temporarily, in this case in a hotel waiting to sell a batch of counterfeit money then high-tail to Cuba in a rented boat. The owner and his daughter (Lionel Barrymore and Lauren Bacall) are held hostage, and when Frank McCloud (Bogart) stops by briefly to tell them about the soldier/husband's death, he becomes one as well. Even though Bogart's character is very different than the one in 'Petrified Forest,' it is similar in presentation; McCloud, like Mantee, is largely a brooding presence in the background, only occasionally coming forward to offer a wry comment or challenge. Nora, Bacall's character, is similarly used in key moments but is also seen more than heard. Rocco's gang is a bunch of unredeemable louts. By comparison, Rocco himself almost seems like a reasonable person. Almost. In actuality, Rocco struts around, giving orders, bullying, taunting, teasing... his girlfriend Gaye is a hopeless lush and he berates her endlessly. For the most part, McCloud must stand by and watch, despite wanting to lash out. He is biding his time until he can make his move without risking the others being killed. This is Robinson's show though, and you can't take your eyes off him. Everything people remember about this great actor is right here. There is one long close-up of him getting a shave and he talks non-stop through it, punctuating the lines with his trademark, "yeah... yeah!" every few seconds. Rocco isn't one-dimensional. He is alternately worried and yet oblivious to certain dangers. The hurricane, for instance. At first, the blustery gangster doesn't see what the big deal is. To him, it's just a rain storm. Later, when the hotel is literally shaking on its foundations from the wind gusts, Rocco becomes frightened and paces back and forth. Even later, he is back to being cool and in control, completely unflappable. The alcoholic girlfriend, Gaye, is played by Claire Trevor and she won an Academy Award for her performance in 'Key Largo.' She's good, but Robinson is better. In the end, McCloud agrees to take Rocco and his gang to Cuba and manages to kill them all on the way. He calls the hotel afterward and tells Nora he's coming back. Sorry, Bertie Higgins, but that's the extent of the big romance in 'Key Largo.' And Bogart never says, "Here's looking at you, kid," either. Then again, I guess it's hard to write a romantic love song based on Edward G. Robinson.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The gathering storm..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A fine solid psychological gangster movie, post-scripting the careers in this genre of two of the greats, Bogart and Robinson. Although the film ends with bullets and deaths a-plenty as Bogart finds the inner fibre he was lacking earlier under provocation, to take out Robinson and four of his gun-totin' goons (no mean feat), it's more about the clash of wills between Bogart and Robinson not to mention the changing emotions and loyalties of fine supporting characters such as Lionel Barrymore and Lauren Bacall as the wheelchair ridden old-timer and his army widow daughter as well of course the Oscar winning performance by Claire Trevor as Robinson's one-time moll, now callously ridiculed and discarded by him after being driven to drink by his treatment of her. Quite what point was of the two Indians who are mistakenly murdered by the cop on the trail of his murdered (at Robinson's hand) colleague, I'm not sure, but the film moves forward all the time, broodingly with the metaphor of the growing storm in the background, until the climax of Bogart's ultimate grace under pressure. The acting by the two leads is first rate, Robinson (whose character name Rocco coincidentally recalls his first major gangster role Rico in "Little Caesar") so completely "The Man", used to ordering his thugs around and treating everyone else as inferiors (especially the chilling scenes where he whispers menacingly but silently in Bacall's ear) and Bogart as another of his archetypal flawed heroes who finally does the right thing, no doubt inspired by the bravery of the Trevor, Barrymore and Bacall characters who in different ways stand up to Robinson. The direction by John Huston is sure and inventive, often using tracking shots to keep the plot moving and often involving dissolves into darkness, one particular scene where Bacall's face in close-up fades to black, being most memorable. However his job must have been made easier with the quality of the ensemble cast at his disposal.I did find Max Steiner's music distracting and detrimental to the narrative but I'm nit-picking now. Just a fine intelligent watchable movie from the old school, with many on board (in front of and behind the camera) on top form dramatising an interesting and suspenseful story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"When your head says one thing and your whole life says another, your head always loses."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Huston was a busy director in 1948. Not only did he release one of the finest adventure films ever made in 'The Treasure of the Sierra Madre,' but he also produced 'Key Largo,' a smaller-scale film perhaps, but a very good crime thriller. Both, of course, starred his long-time collaborator Humphrey Bogart, a man who needs no introduction. The film was based (very loosely, I hear) on Maxwell Anderson's 1939 play of the same name, and concerns a returned war veteran who finds himself a hostage when a hotel on the island of Key Largo, in the Florida Keys, is temporarily taken over by an infamous gangster and his men. In this film, Bogart plays his typical, grizzled hero, albeit a somewhat flawed one. Frank McCloud is no coward, but he doesn't believe in the practicality of a "noble death." First and foremost, he is always looking out for his own wellbeing; McCloud seems to wish for the courage of his deceased war comrade, but perhaps it's already there and he just can't see it.Though Bogart in pretty good in 'Key Largo,' he is definitively overshadowed by the film's prime villain, Johnny Rocco (Edward G. Robinson), the notorious fugitive gangster who's making one final bid to enter the United States and recapture his former glory. Though short and plump in stature, Robinson is wonderfully chilling as the deranged, sadistic and unpredictable Rocco. There is an ever-present anxiety about his character; he is an aging, decaying mob boss clutching so desperately at his final straws of authority that he is liable to do anything. As the powerful tropical storm descends upon the island, we get to watch Rocco's nerve slowly unwinding, his greatest fear stemming from his inability - for the first time in his professional life - to control the forces around him. His predicament is succinctly summarised by Bogart's hateful taunt, "You don't like it, do you Rocco, the storm? Show it your gun, why don't you? If it doesn't stop, shoot it." Rocco is surrounded by an assortment of slippery sidekicks, and my favourite was the guy who started sniggering maniacally at the most inappropriate moments (the actor's name escapes me at this moment, I'm afraid).I didn't really think much of Lauren Bacall. Whilst she certainly wasn't bad, I felt that any average actress from that era could have replaced her without any major consequences. The chemistry between Bacall and Bogart also struck me as being rather weak (imagine my surprise to later discover that, not only did the two enjoy a fruitful cinematic partnership, but they were also married at the time!). Conversely, Claire Trevor won the film's only Oscar as Gaye Dawn, Rocco's washed-up former girlfriend, who, after years of mistreatment, is finally given an opportunity for redemption. There is really something pitiful about her character, and Rocco sadistically toys with her deficiencies, demanding that she sing for a drink, only to reject her tortured and heartless performance. Lionel Barrymore, playing from his wheelchair as was the norm after 1938, also plays his character with strength and passion.John Huston is excellent at creating suspense, and 'Key Largo' is no exception. Much of the film takes place in the one house, with the powerful hurricane battering outside, creating a feeling of isolation and imminent danger. The climax with Bogart and the gangsters on the boat, a thick mist surrounding them on all sides, also proved extremely effective, at least until the obligatory happy ending. I probably would have preferred it if Bogart had lost his life in his successful bid to rid the world of one more Johnny Rocco. Then again, we can't have the audience going home depressed, can we?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Edward G. Robinson, the Gentleman Criminal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Was it the period in American film-making or was it the period in American history? The Edward G. Robinson character wants the soldier visiting this hotel to pilot his boat, and is patient enough to engage in diligent negotiations with him over it. What can he do? He's already told the soldier (Humphrey Bogart) that the alternative is to let his sidekick work him over. Bogart is reticent, but Robinson is willing to variously analyze the situation before undertaking any action. He's very patient, he looks Bogart in the eyes. Who among criminals in contemporary films is sophisticated like that? We--our society--is supposed to progress along with the progress of our technologies, but our films depict criminals like Jack Nicholson in "The Departed". Robinson displays humanity, he displays feelings and depth, and his demise, though desirable, is tragic. Maybe it was the period in American history following that in which many ordinary adolescents drifted into criminality through the opportunities Prohibition provided. Maybe mature, sophisticated persons with the ability to discriminate well the motives and deceptions of the Bogart character did really live, were a real development from the prohibition on the sales and distribution of liquor. Or maybe respect for individual life was more prevalent in the early days of film-making, and Robinson played a likely 1940s criminal. Respect for individual life is more prevalent when people have only each other, mostly only each other, for companionship. There was the hotel proprietor's daughter, like an old-fashioned country girl. . . none of today's sophisticated entertainment technologies. It was possible to just wade out into the harbor, without having to first wade in your home among the myriad options offered by various electronic devices, then.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Claustrophobic; strong performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has all the right ingredients, but falls down if "movie claustrophobia" bothers you. And that's the one real negative here. Almost all of the action takes place in one or two rooms of an old hotel, with occasional brief scenes outside to remind you you're at the Florida Keys and/or that there's a hurricane. Only the first 5 minutes of the film and the last 15 take place outside those couple of rooms at the hotel. As a result, there are times that it seems like an overly-talkative film with less action than you would expect from a team of actors including Humphrey Bogart and Edward G. Robinson. I had the same feeling when watching "The Petrified Forest" -- too much like a stage play.However, once you get past that "movie claustrophobia", there's lots to like here. Overall, the story is a good one. World War II has ended and ex-soldier Humphrey Bogart travels to Key Largo to visit the father (Lionel Barrymore) and wife (Lauren Bacall) of a soldier-friend who was killed in a battle. Barrymore and Bacall own an old hotel on Key Largo, and they unknowingly rented the place to a mobster (Edward G. Robinson) and his thugs who are waiting there for a counterfeit deal to take place. Robinson is an Italian mobster who was thrown out of the country, but hoping to return, and appears to currently be based in Cuba. Robinson is somewhat sadistic, particularly toward Bacall and his alcoholic ex-girlfriend (Claire Trevor). While waiting for the counterfeiters, a hurricane strikes, making things all the more tense. Once the deal goes down, Bogie is forced to sail the thugs back to Cuba. Will they make it, or will Bogie thwart them and return to fall in love with Bacall? This is a strong performance by Humphrey Bogart as a sort of anti-hero who seems to be balancing the need to be wise and not cowardly in dealing with the mobsters. A problem here is that Robinson shots him in the stomach several times in one scene, but the gun misfires or is not loaded. Why? One might say that Edward G. Robinson "eats up the scenery" as mobster Johnny Rocco. Another strong performance...or is it stereotypical of the era? If it is the latter, I'd prefer to blame it on the director, rather than Robinson.Lauren Bacall doesn't sizzle here...that would have been inappropriate. She's rather docile, and as a result less interesting than in her other film encounters with Bogart. But the role didn't call for sizzling; it called for a grieving wife.I'm not sure that Lionel Barrymore's character was appropriate, either. With his mouth, I would have expected him to be the first to be killed by Robinson. But again, Barrymore didn't write the script or direct the film, so I'll not blame him. Barrymore made 6 films after this, and was alive for 6 more years, but he looked very unwell and surprisingly fat in this film.Perhaps the best acting in the picture is by Claire Trevor as the alcoholic Gaye Dawn. The key to her Oscar winning supporting role was that she was careful not to overact her drunkenness, and as a result she gains the sympathy of the viewer here.Of the supporting actors, Thomas Gomez as one of the thugs is outstanding, giving a different characterization than one might expect; he was an accomplished character actor. The brash young punk role was played by Harry Lewis; I guess he was "okay". Marc Lawrence was somewhat interesting as one of the counterfeiters. Monte Blue is somewhat interesting as the overwhelmed local sheriff. You'll also recognize Jay Silverheels as one of the Indians in an uncredited role; Silverheels later became the much-beloved Tonto in "The Lone Ranger".The stage-like nature of this film prevents it from becoming a great film, but it's still quite good and definitely worth a watch.This viewing I watched the new Blu Ray release. While it's a "good" transfer, I'm not sure it was worth the upgrade from DVD. I've seen much better Blu Rays from the same era.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tensions mount as a hurricane bares down on Key Largo</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When WWII veteran Major Frank McCloud goes to a hotel on Key Largo to pay his respects to the father and widow of one of his former comrades, George Temple, who died in Italy he doesn't expect quite such an unfriendly welcome. When he goes in he is told that the hotel is closed for the season by a group who claim to be there to do some fishing. It isn't long before Frank and the Temples learn the truth about the 'guests'. They are gangster Johnny Rocco and his henchman; who are waiting to sell their illicit merchandise. Trapped in the hotel with armed gangsters inside and a hurricane raging outside things are about to get very dangerous!This Humphrey Bogart classic raises the tension nicely from the moment Frank enters the hotel until the final confrontation. Bogart is great as the laconic Frank and Edward G. Robinson is suitably villainous as Rocco; a man who is brave with a gun in his hand but cowardly in the face of real danger. Leading lady Lauren Bacall puts in a decent performance as Nora Temple but it is Claire Trevor who stands out as Rocco's Moll Gaye Dawn; a woman desperate for a drink. Most of the film displays its theatrical roots as it is set almost entirely within two rooms in the hotel; this is no bad thing though as it serves to provide a sense of claustrophobia? these people aren't going anywhere till the storm subsides. For the most part there is little real violence but there is enough to maintain a sense of danger without ever being really disturbing? this was of course made before people suffering from gunshot wounds bled in films!If you are a fan of Bogart this film is obviously a must see but even if you aren't it is well worth watching; it may be sixty five years old but apart from the odd word of slang hardly feels dated at all and the rules of the time mean there is no swearing or bloody violence which means there is nothing to offend anybody. If you thing old movies are boring or black and white can't be exciting give this a go? you might change your mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A world weary war vet remembers why he fought.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is this the end of Rocco? It will be if returning war veteran Humphrey Bogart has his way. He was the war buddy of the late son of Key Largo hotel owner Lionel Barrymore who left behind a beautiful widow (Lauren Bacall). Visiting Barrymore and Bacall to share memories of the deceased man, Bogart finds the hotel taken over by mobster Edward G. Robinson, even though the hotel is closed for the summer. Robinson and his gang are bullies, and Bogart's visit doesn't come at a good time. Eddie G. is waiting for a fellow gangster to deliver counterfeit money he plans on running off to Cuba with, but that might not take place because there's a hurricane a-comin'. At first, Bogart wants no part of Robinson and his gang, having become rather world-weary after finding America greatly changed after returning. But quietly realizing that Robinson is nothing more than a coward surrounded by his protective goons, Bogart must decide whether to suppress Robinson for good or just continue to be a pacifist.This is an analogy of many things of the 1940's, particularly with Edward G. Robinson's character. The gangster is representative of the dictators the Allies fought against in the war, courageous when all seems to be going their way, but total chicken as everything falls apart. Robinson is excellent in showing his character's cowardice, especially in a scene where the hotel starts to shake with the elements pounding the island off of the Florida Keys. To think this great actor never got an Oscar Nomination is a shock, let alone not being nominated for this very dimensional performance which could be a continuation of his "Rico" character from "Little Caesar". Robinson is memorably cruel in a scene concerning his former moll Claire Trevor, an alcoholic nightclub singer whose heart is bigger than the island they are stuck on. Robinson evilly taunts her into singing, then refuses to give in to his promise of allowing her to have a drink if she sang. Trevor, who did win a well-deserved Oscar for this performance, is the heart and soul of the film, a dark lady deserving of love whom we hope will find a new strength and sobriety after facing certain truths. The fact that Bogart, Barrymore and Bacall all sympathize with Trevor without judgment concerning her drinking was very touching.Lionel Barrymore goes from being the evil of "It's a Wonderful Life" to the grandfatherly hotel owner and is delightful. Thomas Gomez is the most memorable of Robinson's henchmen. There are some truly haunting moments, particularly the scene of the Native American grandmother who, supposedly 112 years old, must face the elements along with her family when Robinson's gang refuses to allow them into the hotel room during the hurricane. Bogart and Bacall would work together again on TV but never on film, and if this had to be their swan song in working together, it was a swell one, memorably given a tribute in a pop love song years later. I thought the reference to the gangsters hoping for the return of prohibition was quite ironic and amusing. Fine direction by John Huston (who directed Bogart and Gomez in "Treasure of the Sierra Madre" the same year), outstanding photography and a magnificent screenplay make this one of the year's best films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Frank (Humphrey Bogart) pays a visit to Mr Temple's (Lionel Barrymore) hotel and finds that it has been exclusively hired out for a week. The guests are a group of gangsters headed by Johnny Rocco (Edward G Robinson) and they have some gangster business to do before making their getaway to Cuba. On an overnight stay, a storm hits the hotel and everyone is under the control of megalomaniac Rocco. When the storm passes, Rocco's gang make their move but they need Frank to skipper their getaway boat.The problem with this film is that it is a bit too stagey. The cast are all good, especially Claire Trevor in her role as gangster moll "Gaye". She has some good scenes including the sequence where she has to sing for Johnny Rocco before she can have a drink. Rocco's refusal to give her one and dismissal of her as 'rubbish' is a good climax to the scene. But, annoyingly, the scene then goes on to have Frank defy Rocco and give her a drink himself. It's moments like these where we are so predictably given Bogart as a man acting by himself that it gets annoying. We have to have scenes where Bogart spouts his "I'm a man acting alone" crap. Claire Trevor also has a good scene towards the end when she pleads with Rocco to take her with him, and her final words to Frank of "Yeah, good luck" are delivered in a way that has a resonance that seems completely lacking from anything that Lauren Bacall says.The film has a few daft moments, eg, Rocco's fear of the storm, the story drags in parts and the ending is a bit cheesy but overall it's OK.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gangster Edward G. Robinson and a handful of goons take over a hotel on the Florida keys. The hotel is run by Lionel Barrymore and his widowed daughter-in-law, Lauren Bacall. Humphrey Bogart, the hotel's only guest, is an ex-soldier who was a friend of Bacall's husband during the war. The plot involves chiefly the conflict between Robinson, the boss who knows exactly what he wants, and Bogart, who lost any ideals he might have had during the war in Italy. A secondary story has the minions of the law running in and out searching for a pair of miscreant Seminoles. The drama is heightened by the arrival of a dangerous hurricane at the end of the second act.The movie is resolutely middle brow. Everything you need to know is spelled out for you. What does Robinson really want? "More." And does Bogart know what HE wants? "I used to have dreams but I gave them up." (Something like that.) This isn't high drama. This is vernacular art. Every character we meet is either good or evil. Oh, I suppose Bogart has some doubts about being a hero, but we know what will happen before the end of the movie rolls around.The single exception is Gaye Dawn (nee Maggie Rooney), played by Claire Trevor, whose character is reasonably complex and who shows some development that isn't entirely predictable. She won an Academy Award for her performance, and she deserved it. Not just for the scene in which she, as a pathetic drunk, agrees to sing "Moanin' Low" for a shot of scotch, but for the far more subtle ways in which she signals her character's thoughts and emotions. Her slightest glances are given meaning.The movie is shot by director Huston mostly as a staged play. It's just as well because the special effects, mostly models, seen during the hurricane are pretty sleazy by today's standards. It's far spookier with everyone scattered around the hotel lobby, the bad guys shaking in their boots, listening to the wind ululate, staring at the swinging chandeliers and gaping as the walls practically billow inward, tumbling the liquor glasses off the shelves behind the bar.Is there a moral in tow? Nah. Not really. Bogart learns that the war was worth fighting. Robinson, who is playing Lucky Luciano in the closet, learns that you can't kill Nature with a bullet. Robinson is great, by the way. Huston has him made up to look like a caricature of himself. I swear he's wearing lip rouge. And he's got those lips wrapped around a huge phallic cigar when Huston introduces him. He's given a chance to sneer "Mnyeah" a couple of times too. He resembles the cartoon figure of himself that appeared occasionally in the Bugs Bunny shorts that Warners produced. You have to love it when he whispers inaudible obscenities into the unsullied ears of the rapturously beautiful Bacall.The dialog, which I take it comes mainly from Maxwell Anderson's play, sounds as if it were written by a guy who knows absolutely nothing about real gangsters of the 1920s and 30s, although he may have seen many movies about them. "Say, boss, I wonder if it was such a good idea to leave Dawn behind. She might squeal." And, "I betcha prohibition comes back, only this time the mobs will work together instead of blastin' each other." At the end, when the stage of ejaculatory inevitability is reached and Bogart improbably offs all the bad guys while at sea, he radios "Nan Mike Able" for assistance. That was the U. S. Coast Guard radio station in Miami. Then there is a cut back to the hotel, where Bacall gets a phone call from Bogart telling her he's coming back. Then another cut to Bogart -- smiling but still at sea in the Santana. How do you make a phone call from a fishing vessel? Especially when the phone is dead? (What, then, did the hand of the potter shake?)Immensely enjoyable stuff.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Frank McCloud is in the Florida Keys to visit the widow and father in law of an old war buddy, whilst at the hotel they run, he finds it has been taken over by gangster Johnny Rocco and his thugs.The cast, the performances, the screenplay, tight direction, the photography and on it goes to give us a bona fide entry into 1940s classics. It never ceases to amaze me how well Key Largo stands up on repeat viewings, each viewing bring something new to my ever keen eye. This latest viewing bringing me abundant joy in observing the background acting of the supporting players, not one of them looking on waiting for the director to shout CUT, each adding greatly with intense facial mannerisms, check out some of the background stuff Thomas Gomez does for example. Ah intense, what a truly befitting word to use as regards John Huston's direction here, perfectly capturing the stifling heat of Largo and coupling it with the sweltering tension inside this run down hotel.Key Largo is often thought of as the lesser film from the Bogart/Bacall production line, which in fairness is against some pretty special opposition, maybe we do lose the sexual chemistry of the mighty duo here, but in its place is a mano mano face off teetering on the brink of explosion, Edward G Robinson's weasel Rocco in danger of becoming a loose cannon to McCloud's staid drifter, the atmosphere is palpable as this room full of hate and mistrust starts bubbling to boiling point.Humphrey Bogart, Lauren Bacall, Edward G Robinson, Lionel Barrymore, Claire Trevor {Academy Award Winner Best Supporting Actress}, Thomas Gomez and Harry Lewis are all excellent, all benefiting from master director Huston moulding them together, whilst Karl Freund's deep focus photography perfectly encapsulates the mood of the piece. I just love Key Largo so much, from a heart tugging singing for your drink scene, to a retreating in the shadows shot of Bacall, Key Largo is one of the reasons i became a cinema obsessive. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's All Phony, See? Rocco's A Choir Boy Compared to Andy Jackson, see?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Classic romantic action drama about a mean hood named Johnny Rocco who takes over a remote Florida hotel and tries to use it as backdrop for a big deal -- but then a hurricane comes and shakes up everything! Problems with this movie do not outweigh the sheer fun of watching it. Edward G. Robinson gives his last great performance as an old time mobster who is very much out of his element in the tropical heat. Lauren Bacall is fetching in a very demure early performance as the city girl who has found roots with her late husband's father. Humphrey Bogart is just right as the disillusioned yet courageous veteran.But oh, those Seminole Indians! It is grindingly inappropriate to paint Rocco as the last word in human evil when every five minutes a bunch of Seminole Indians are paraded as moronic, childlike victims, knowingly looked after by the good old white man who owns the hotel. It's no good, get me? It makes everything seem rotten, see? You don't have to read Howard Zinn or be a card-carrying lefty to figure out that the mugs who stole Florida from the Seminoles were a lot dirtier than Rocco. Dirtier, see? Andy Jackson was a hood, mixed up in rackets like slavery. He stole Florida so some tired old geezer could wheel around in his wheelchair making faces at mugs like Johnny Rocco, see? Old man Barrymore plays the geezer in the wheel chair, the Great White Father who loves his Seminole children. Every time he opens his mouth you just want to throw up. The movie seems to know that he is just a big phony baloney, that he has benefited from genocidal crimes far more horrible than Rocco's. But the movie keeps quiet, see? These are good Indians, just like children, get me? The other problem is that the movie makers are secretly in love with Rocco. When Bogey makes his big speech, "the one and only Rocco" you get the impression that EVERYONE, not just Rocco, wishes that Prohibition had never ended. The movie pretends to believe that the new, post-war world will be better, because "there will be no room for the Johnny Roccos." (Or for the Seminoles either, pop? Nyaaah?) But Robinson presents Rocco with such relish, and the movie captures him in such color and power, that it seems clear that everyone, including Bogart's McCloud, is really in love with the past.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Bogie's best, but it's Edward G.'s movie....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Key Largo would be the perfect film for someone who had never seen or heardof either Humphrey Bogart or Edward G. Robinson to get a primer lesson on the charisma and screen presence of both of these great screen legends.The premise of the film is as follows: Bogart's character, Frank McCloud, is an ex-GI returning from World War II . McCloud is anxious to meet the wife andfather of his fallen soldier friend. This leads McCloud to a hotel in the Florida Keys run by the widow, Nora Temple (Lauren Bacall) and her father-in-lawJames Temple (the always excellent Lionel Barrymore, perhaps most familiar to moviegoers as the evil Mr. Potter in Frank Capra's 'It's A Wonderful Life').Things seem slightly off-kilter from the moment McCloud (Bogie) walks into the hotel. An alcoholic woman, loud and obnoxious, crowds the hotel bar and ishandled roughly by a couple of strange men who apparently are guests at thesame hotel. McCloud takes this all in but remains distant from all of thesecharacters. McCloud meets the invalid owner Mr. Temple (Barrymore) and hisdaughter-in-law Nora Temple (Bacall). There is some immediate chemistrybetween McCloud and the widow Temple.Unbeknowst to both the Temples and McCloud two huge problems are loomingin their immediate futures shortly after their initial meeting. First, a hurricane of tremendous force is poised to strike the Keys and their hotel in a matter of hours. Secondly, and what drives the plot of this film, a supposedly deported big-time gangster, Johnny Rocco (Edward G. Robinson) is the guest who makes hisidentity and motives known shortly before the hurricane arrives.The previously mentioned alcoholic woman at the bar is Gaye Dawn (ClaireTrevor), Rocco's girlfriend. An ex-nightclub singer whom time has not been kind to, Miss Dawn sacrifices her dignity at even the slightest opportunity to get a drink.The strange men at the bar turn out to be Rocco's henchmen.McCloud (Bogart) knows who Rocco (Robinson) is, and while he won't directlychallenge the gangster, McCloud takes no small delight in playing mind gameson Rocco. The scenes in the hotel between all of these diverse characters really are the highlight of this film. Even though Rocco and his gang are holding McCloud and the Temples hostage you get the definite impression that McCloud has theupper hand psychologically and that things will eventually go bad for Rocco.Bogart is fantastic. His nuanced portrayal of a basically decent non-committal drifter fits hand in glove with Bogart's reluctant hero screen persona. This is Edward G. Robinson's movie though. His performance as ruthless but paranoidmobster Johnny Rocco is one of, if not his very best screen role. Claire Trevor is great as tragic moll Gaye Dawn. Trevor won an Oscar for Best SupportingActress for her acting in this film. Lauren Bacall is good but really doesn't have to do much heavy lifting, acting wise in this film. Lionel Barrymore is great, a crusty old curmudgeon with a huge heart for those he cares for.This is a great movie and a wonderful opportunity to see some screen legendsat the top of their respective games.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Key Largo" surely has one of the most dynamic group of stars ever assembled by Warner Brothers during the Golden years of Hollywood, The story is very well directed by John Huston, and along with "The Treasure of the Sierra Madre" this has to be his finest. Edward G. Robinson is in his element in this kind of role, and the performance of Claire Trevor was outstanding - certainly good enough to win her the Best Supporting Actress Award. Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall play their roles to perfection, and they are ably supported by Thomas Gomez in a part that suited him brilliantly. I did have a bit of a problem with Lionel Barrymore, as I kept expecting him to shout out for Dr. Kildare. The music is a tribute to Max Steiner - he just never missed. All the Special Effects worked to make this a fairly memorable film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best '40s films Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Houston is a director nonpareil. His use of secondary actors reflects and echoes the use of same as in "The Maltese Falcon": wonderful characters and wonderful portrayals. The interaction between Bogie and Bacall sizzles; it's better in hindsight because we know they were in love. Claire Trevor as the "lush" is incredible. Each character has his/her faults: "Did he, did he, did he really?", is the plaint of an ageing and desperate father (Lionel Barrymore), crippled, in a wheelchair, asking the Major (Humphrey Bogart) about the death of his son in 'the Italian Campaign'. Given the dramatic introduction of Johnny Rocco (Edward G. Robinson), the wannabe Mafioso and stone killer, it can only get better. And it does. Rocco's need to humiliate all before him is, of course, always going to be overpowered by the force of nature-the hurricane. Rocco, the "Emperor-of-Crime" is, eventually, displaced by the notion of the laconic hero. Fortunately, Major Frank is an "Untouchable": waiting for the moment when he can kill ALL the badguys. He's going/riding back to his love. A rider, on a pale horse, perhaps. There is a belief that Mafioso were used and were central to the landings in Italy during the Second World War. Look it up. Each "bad" character also represents the worst in all of us. There is a central meaning to Key Largo.live long and prosper,Paul :)</fullReview>

They DO make them like this, but not nearly this good.The wrong-place-at-the-wrong-time hostage scenario has been done to death in film history, but easily the best of this genre is "Key Largo," for any number of reasons.1) Humphrey Bogart is one of the five best actors of all-time. 2) Lauren Bacall is the rare combination of beauty and acting clout. 3) Edward G. Robinson is so despicable that you can't help but love him. 4) The camera work is brilliant. 5) The story is impeccable.And so on and so forth.Really, there is not much else to say about this film other than: See it.Do whatever it takes. Rent it, buy it, find it at a classic film fest, hope to catch it on TCM or one of those channels, whatever you have to do, see "Key Largo." Then see it again.</fullReview>

Robinson is a traditional gangster trying to bring the "racket" back to the USA after WW2 but in the long run his stereotypical greed works to his own demise.

		<fullReview>Moody, tense, well acted and directed piece of 40's Film Noir. Edward G. owns the picture and looms over the proceedings with sadistic menace. Bogart is the disillusioned ex war hero who sacrificed to destroy evil on European battlefields only to return home and find it still firmly established in American society. He is searching for his place in the sun, and unwittingly enters into it at Key Largo. There he is forced again to survive another dark storm, faced with vanquishing evil again before he can find the peaceful and happy life he yearns for. He completely comes across as a weary warrior who wonders what he fought for, and if it's worth it to stick his neck out anymore instead of just taking care of number one. In their genuine honesty and kindness, Bacall and Barrymore represent the light that he believed in defending during the war, Trevor the mistreated victim of tyranny he no doubt saw time and again. You know Bogie is more than capable of dealing with Johnny Rocco and his goons despite his seemingly less than heroic actions early on and the suspense builds right up to the final shootout on the fishing boat. Bacall, far from being the provocative and world-wise good/bad girl she usually plays, is effective here playing the young widow with a gentle heart. As is Barrymore as the respected hotel owner who carries a deep wound at losing his son in war and attempts in vain to honor his memory by standing up to the villains who hold his hotel hostage. Bogie is the only man who can do this and scene by scene they help to renew his faith in human nature enough for him to fight for what's right. A fascinating piece of ensemble melodrama. Highly recommended. If only they could have hidden the wires on those palm trees...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What makes this movie so great is the underlying factors in the story. For instance the racism involving the Indians(including Jay "Tonto" Silverheels), the lewd whisperings of Johnny Rocco in Lauren Bacall's ear and the murder of a policeman.(it's interesting how everyone got so worked up over Ice-T a few years ago, but Edward G gets glorified over this.The last scene with Rocco, where he is trying to tempt McCloud with money is classic, with Bogart showing the right amount of restraint throughout the movie. Claire Trevor plays a similar role as in Stagecoach, the "tainted" and tragic woman. She does redeem herself by helping McCloud and the police. She did deserve her Oscar. Robinson's acting though is what makes this movie so watchable, his speech about how he made certain politicians is excellent. His portrayal as the charming face of evil is very fun to watch. The only thing that keeps me wondering is what Rocco whispers in Bacall's ear.</fullReview>

Other examples include Rope,12 angry men,Boomerang and Shadow of a doubt. The film centres around the response of an ex army hero(Bogart) to the bullying and intimidating of a gang boss(Robinson). Soldier Bogart has a selfish and cynical attitude to life post war. He sees no sense in dying a hero like one of his men (the husband of Bacall). He has no principles to prompt him to act foolishly and stand up to the gang. However when backed into a corner he attacks and simultaneously reaffirms Bacall's faith in heroism but he knows he had no choice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The fascinating paradox of "Key Largo" : a salvation key for its entrapped souls ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Released in 1948, John Huston's "Key Largo" is a Post-War movie. Obviously. In this suffocating behind-closed-doors thriller, the moral relics of the War sweats out the characters' pores, with the obligatory evil : Johnny Rocco, played by an exquisitely confident Edward G. Robinson, and a self-doubting good side incarnated by a former WW2 veteran: Bogart as Frank McCloud, Lionel Barrymore as the father of his ill-fated Army buddy George, and as Nora, the precocious widow, Lauren Bacall in her fourth and final co-starring with her legendary husband.Swinging between, there's Oscar-winning Clair Trevor as Rocco's moll, Gaye Dawn, desperately seeking for a last drop of alcohol, how much she drinks says a lot about the wounded past she has to conceal, something Frank, the only one to give him a drink, can relate to. A former idealist probably, Frank had to fight with the assurance that his death would have a meaning: clearing the world of its poisoning vileness and barbarity. Yet Rocco stands for everything Frank fought against and is very much alive and cynically proud of his achievement.Men like Rocco highlight the pointlessness of George's death and that's what the Film-Noir genre is about, disillusion, the same after the victory's euphoria was toned down by the uncertainty of the world's fate, at the dawn of the Atomic Age. Who could put his faith in human nature after that? "Key Largo" is one of the most quintessential film-noir. War is the prominent shadow of Frank's past and the light of hope is this visit to Florida, an escape from the pessimism inherited from the past and the certitude that George's death was the ransom for a better world, seeking the real Post-war peace, peace of mind, but the light at the end of the tunnel might be of a passing train, a train named Johnny Rocco who'd confront Frank to the very demons he's escaping from.And in the pivotal moment when Rocco dared Frank to shoot him, Frank chose to drop his gun. There would be plenty of Roccos to take his place anyway, like the War didn't deprive the world from scum or evil. For long as there will be men, there will be wicked ones, so why should the good ones die to leave room for them? That dilemma is perfectly captured by Gaye Dawn's line "Better to live a coward or die a hero", which in Frank's mind resonates as, "calculated weakness can be more resourceful than pointless bravery". There's no point in heroism if it's deemed to fail, it's as meaningless as being called a coward.If not a hero, Frank is an existential character, because his life is worthier than his cause, if only to better serve the cause. It's not the action that counts, it's the one you do according to your personal beliefs. Basically, Frank's self-preservation commanded him not to waste his life for Rocco or for the sake of peer pressure. And who could ever think of him as a coward? Whether for giving a drink, taking a few slaps (and what slaps!) and shielding Nora, Frank never acted brave, he was brave ... something he might've learned from the War, like Patton said "you don't win a war by dying for a country, but by making the other bastard die".George might've been a hero, but it was Frank smelling Florida coolest breezes and toying with Nora's beautiful hair. Life isn't an act, it's reality and reality commands to accept some bits of failure, the quintessential Hustonian theme. All Huston movies are about characters who try to escape from their inner condition but fail because they're essentially tragic. Rocco's success was Frank's failure, the living incarnation of his bitterness and anger toward the world. But being a failure is one thing but no Hustonian character is a loser, the relative quietness of Frank is only the silence before the storm, after the real one would be over.Indeed, Frank knew that he had to fight no matter what, postponing the time of the confrontation wouldn't avoid it and it's only after Rocco kills the innocent Indians (Sawyer took a chance and wasn't a 'civilian') that Frank makes up his mind. He knows killing Rocco won't change anything, but not killing him would leave a much more indelible stain in his soul. He had to act, that was his destiny as a fighter, a soldier, a man of morality who wouldn't let the killing of the two innocents get unpunished. An existential character gives a meaning to his acts, but paradoxically, believes that he's got but one destiny. He chooses what to do but most times, there's only one thing to do.And the climax conveys the fascinating paradox. Frank, now dispassionate, cold and methodical, eliminates the bad guys one by one, killing the last demon who'd ever have to torture his soul. This is the light of excitement that ignite Bogie's eyes while staring at that door from the boat's rooftop before Rocco would show his face for a last time. He knows he's going to accomplish himself once and for all and really escape from his tormented past. Escapism is another symbolic device in Huston's oeuvre, full of people trying to transcend their own condition yet their quest for freedom or success lead them to a physical or moral entrapment.There's something of Fred C. Dobbs in Frank McCloud, something of The "Night of the Iguana" in "Key Largo", people isolated and entrapped to give the word 'escape' its fullest meaning. Frank wouldn't find peace in Florida but also the peace of this soul. A hurricane is ravaging the outside, but the climate is even more dangerous in the inside. It's escapism as the quest for any trapped soul and entrapment for any soul trying to escape its condition, you've got to earn it, whether you lose or fail. "Key Largo" was Frank's key to his own salvation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One must watch this film to get the real grasp of how great this film really is. It features Humphrey Bogart and Edward G. Robinson on screen together for the first time in ten years. Lauren BaCall, Lionel Barrymore, and in supporting role, Clair Trevor.Bogart plays Frank McCall,a vet returning home from war. He returns to help Nora Temple (Bacall) whose husband was killed in combat and her wheelchair ridden father in law deal with the news.Unknown to McCall, a group of Gangsters led by Robinson have devious intentions. They are setting up a counterfeiting scheme, and then plan to high tail it out of the country to Cuba, where there is no extradition.The film plays on a cat and mouse aspect with Johnny Rocco (Robinson) and McCall (Bogart) trying to get a feel for each other, much like to poker players. Robinson presents an evil, yet somewhat cool portrayal of Johnny Rocco, and he nearly steals every scene he's in.The final act plays out between on a boat heading towards Cuba. Bogart has to fight off Robinson's gang in order to save himself. It boils down to an exciting climax shootout between Robinson and Bogart.Thomas Gomez has a very underrated performance as Curly, and there is not a simple weak link in the cast. Key Largo is an excellent film that simply isn't held in the high regard it deserves. This film is more then a must for fans of Barrymore, BaCall, Bogart, or Robinson.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Bogart/Robinson Picture From The '40s.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first came across this movie on a PBS affiliate one night months ago. It looked so great and interesting that I just had to get and own a copy of it, which I did later, afterward, eventually. I believe I've heard of both Humphrey Bogart and Edward G. Robinson, but I've never really seen nor followed a Bogart and/or Robinson flick until viewing this earlier this year. Glad I caught it and saw just what I've been missing all this time, as long as I had been doing so. Lately, I've been getting into watching some movies from the first half of the 20th century, they're all really good. And this one is no different. Clearly I made a great choice, especially considering the many good reviews it's gotten on here. Haven't checked to see if whether or not it's mentioned in the list of genres under which this feature falls, but just in case it isn't, it also has suspense.Frank McCloud (Bogart) heads to the Floridian Keys (particularly Largo) for a getaway and settles in a hotel. There, he visits the Temples, the owner James (Lionel Barrymore) and his daughter Nora (Lauren Bacall). But they are interrupted by the sudden intrusion of Johnny Rocco (Robinson) and his henchmen, all of whom take the guests and staff hostage. Things go from bad to worse when a hurricane approaches and hits Largo. Will the protagonists find a way to work their plan of rebellion and escape against Johnny? I fell in love with this film the moment I first discovered it. The only complaint I have with it is that I wish the DVD had at least a couple of bonus features (audio commentary and a colorized version as an option, which would've been nice also, not just on the DVD menu). Not that I really have anything against black and white movies, by the way, I came to appreciate them too. In fact, this is among the many films I wish I'd check out sooner and others I would've and should've waited to air on t.v., and skip renting/buying certain movies if I had, now that I look back on it. For all those who haven't seen it, try it on for size. I'm glad I came around to seeing it at last. Among the best of what at the time probably was still considered to be Hollywood's golden era.</fullReview>

Frank has travelled to the Florida Keys to visit the widow of a friend from his unit played by Lauren Bacall who runs a small hotel with her wheelchair bound father-in-law played by Lionel Barrymore (Mr. Potter from It's a Wonderful Life). Unfortunately, a notorious gangster Johnny Rocco (Edward G. Robinson), along with his men, and the prototypical gangster moll (Claire Trevor in an Oscar winning performance) have also stopped at the hotel. The final complication is a powerful hurricane which is bearing down on the area.The performances alone from Bogart, Bacall, Robinson, Trevor and Barrymore make this a film worthy of attention. The role's may be typecast with Bogart and Bacall playing recognizable roles that also find them in love, Edward G. Robinson playing a gangster and Lionel Barrymore playing the somewhat cantankerous old man but these performers are wonderful in their roles. But it is Claire Trevor as the alcoholic and abused Gaye Dawn who gives perhaps the most impressive performance in a role that could easily be expected to have been secondary. The film is directed with considerable flair by John Huston.The film is based on a play by noted playwright Maxwell Anderson but takes considerable liberties with its source material, the ending is actually taken from another Bogart and Bacall pairing "To Have and Have Not" which was not used in that film and was provided to Huston by that films director Howard Hawks.This film was the fourth and final pairing of Bogart and Bacall on screen and this is unfortunate because the interaction between the two which is perhaps heightened by their real life love affair is always effective.Typical of the era the film was made entirely on the Warner Brothers back lot but this certainly didn't affect the impact of the film for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Edward G. Robinson Steals the Show</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A simply sensational claustrophobic thriller from director John Huston, and far better than his more acclaimed and remembered film from the same year, "Treasure of the Sierra Madre." Humphrey Bogart plays a war hero who pays a call on the father and widow of a dead buddy at the hotel they own and operate on Key Largo. The absolutely smashing Edward G. Robinson plays Mr. Brown, a mobster who has holed up at the hotel with his gang while he awaits payment from another group of mobsters. A hurricane hits and the group are trapped inside while tensions mount, almost to an unbearable pitch. Huston fills the movie chock-full of memorable moments and frames shots brilliantly to make the audience feel the sweltering humidity and oppression of the tropical locale. Robinson tears up the character of Mr. Brown, playing him as a relic from a past age; it's as if his character from "Little Caesar" found himself transplanted forward fifteen years to a world that has passed him by. But it's his insecurity and eagerness to still prove himself top dog that makes him so dangerous. Lauren Bacall mostly fades into the background as the widow, but Bogart does great work as the steely hero. Lionel Barrymore is also memorable as the benevolent hotel owner who is literally unable to stand up to Mr. Brown (though he does so in his heart), and Claire Trevor won an Oscar for her portrayal of Mr. Brown's drunken floozy of a girlfriend, the kind of whore with a heart of gold character the Academy has always loved to recognize.The brooding atmosphere is topped off by a thrilling Max Steiner score. Good, good stuff.Grade: A+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film has it all. A reluctant war hero, just wanting to get on with his life, an arch mobster planning on making a big comeback, the family of the hero's closest friend during the war, an out of the way hotel, and to top it off a hurricane. What more could you ask for. Edward G. Robinson is at his very best as the villain Johnny Rocco, a cross between real life mobsters Lucky Luciano and Al Capone. Bogart and Bacall again light up the screen under their fourth (and reluctantly final) on screen pairing. If you watch closely, you can be amused at Lionel Barrymore having to quote Frankin Roosevelt in the movie while gnashing his teeth.(Barrymore despised Roosevelt in real life) This blank and white thriller keeps you on the edge of your seat from almost the very beginning to the very end, again brilliantly and ably directed by John Huston.

		<shortDescription>Key Largo Trivia - Name of the Hurricane?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't know if it's a spoiler to mention the hurricane, but just to be safe, I'll claim it as a spoiler. The hurricane in "Key Largo" didn't have a name. "Key Largo" was released in 1948 and Hurricanes weren't named until 1950, when the first Hurricane, named "Easy", hit the coast of Florida. The naming of storms has a unique history. Early on, storms were named for the location they hit or the particular day they made landfall, i.e. the Labor Day Hurricane. In 1953, the Department of Defense started the naming of hurricanes by a numeric naming, i.e. Able, Baker, Charlie, etc. After three years, this was abandoned and alphabetical naming of storms using female names was implemented. There were two accounts of hurricanes hitting Florida in 1948, but neither reportedly struck the Florida keys.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful like a tropical hurricane!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perhaps not as flawless or captivating as some of the other collaborations between Humphrey Bogart and director John Huston (like "The Maltese Falcon", "The African Queen" or "the Treasure of the Sierre Madre"), yet this is another splendid film noir experience with a good pace, fascinating characters and dialogues so beautiful they sound like music to your ears. The screenplay was adapted from a stage play so that means there's only a limited number of settings and the characters, especially the supportive ones, sometimes seem a little basic. Yet this is no restraint for a skilled director like Huston, as he patiently builds up the intrigue and tension towards a terrific anti-climax (the hurricane). Like only he can pull it off, Humphrey Bogart plays an embittered man who, shortly after the war, visits the relatives of a fellow soldier who got killed in action. The Temples own a small hotel on an island off the coast of Florida, where also a lot of Indians live and the menace of tropical hurricanes is constant. Just at the time when Bogie is about to score with beautiful widow Bacall, the hotel is taken over by Italian mafia boss Johnny Rocco and his henchmen, and he's pretty damn angry because the American government wants to deport him. "Key Largo" contains a large amount of dared and effective criticism towards political corruption and the American legal system and it's surprising how the post-WWII heroism of Bogart's character is minimized. This is a very sober film which emotional impact largely only begins to show after the movie is over. The acting is downright terrific with, apart from Bogart and Bacall who always connect greatly, powerful roles for Lionel Barrymore and particularly Edward G. Robinson as the almighty personification of organized crime. Claire Trevor's Oscar-winning performance as the disillusioned gangster puppet is truly memorable as well. Essential viewing!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Atmospheric Drama With Excellent Acting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With a great cast headed by Humphrey Bogart, Lauren Bacall, and Edward G. Robinson, and a story and setting filled with tension, "Key Largo" has much to offer. It provides some fine atmospheric drama and some great acting that make us forget its comparatively minor defects.Director John Huston makes us feel part of the setting, bringing us to the island of Key Largo and to a resort hotel on the island that is in the middle of its slow season. Bogart is an army officer back from World War II, who has come to the hotel to see the family of one of the men who died while serving under him. The hotel is run by the dead soldier's father and widow, but has been largely taken over by a sinister looking group headed by Edward G. Robinson. When a hurricane comes, there is tension of every kind, as Robinson's gang becomes openly threatening. Meanwhile, a group of local Indians is seeking shelter from the hurricane, while the local sheriff is trying to find two of the Indians who have broken out of jail. The damage and fear caused by the hurricane is an effective parallel to the conflicts among the characters.Bogart is in his element as the disillusioned war hero who wants to stay out of trouble, but who finds himself in a situation where only he can help. This is the kind of character Bogart played better than anyone. Bacall's character is not as interesting as the ones she played in her other films with Bogart, but she is good in her role.The acting in "Key Largo" is so good that you don't notice, unless you think about it, that most of the other characters are rather stereotyped. Robinson's fine (as always) acting turns a routine gangster character into a real presence, Claire Trevor is memorable as his drunken, mistreated girl, and Lionel Barrymore gives lots of life to some often lame dialogue in his role as the hotel owner.The fine acting and the tropical, stormy setting make the most out of the drama as it is played out. It all leads up to an ending that is exciting, though perhaps a bit implausible. Despite a few imperfections, it is one of the best films of its kind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>KEY LARGO is a typical gangster movie in which the villain has a rise and fall. Good acting Bogart and Robinson and solid effects are the main expectation of this film. I think the typical gangster movies become boring clueless. This is a slightly different version of the "petrified forest".On the one hand the "war veteran" who influenced developments in the war understands social misconceptions. In translation, it is not interested in anything other than his own life. On the other hand, the famous gangster who himself trying to summon former glory, but in fact difficult to manage. Among them were several secondary characters that their actions affect the decisions of these two.Regardless of the static and limited scenery the development of the story is quite interesting. Pretty good dialogues and intrusive hurricane raised the atmosphere to desiring tension.Edward G. Robinson as Johnny Rocco rightfully got the most space. Gangster in the true sense of the word. Character full of vulgarity, selfishness and deceit. Humphrey Bogart as Maj. Frank McCloud comes from the side angle. Stubborn character who must first clear with yourself and then with others. As expected, the last minutes belonged to him. Claire Trevor as Gaye Down, performed unworthy one Oscar. Honestly, I have not seen her role so. One of the biggest climax of the film is caused her singing. Trevor was not bad. Her character regardless of alcoholism has made some key strings in the story. Certainly we should not forget the shrewd old man Mr. Temple (Lionel Barrymore) and fair and beautiful widow Nora Temple (Lauren Bacall)Perhaps too many words and too little action might be. A lot has been said, but little seen.</fullReview>

His friend's widow Nora Temple (Lauren Bacall) and wheelchair bound father James (Lionel Barrymore) manage the hotel. It's hurricane season and a tropical storm is approaching. The hotel has very few guests left and most of them are hostile to Frank. The police are looking for some escaped Seminole Indian prisoners. The Indians soon show up at the hotel looking to surrender. There is a mysterious guest who brought many sketchy characters along. It turns out to be gangster Johnny Rocco (Edward G. Robinson) as his armed gang takes over the hotel.Director John Huston has gathered a cast of great tough actors. There is a threatening atmosphere throughout this movie and it isn't only due to the weather. It's the ugly characters and their oppressive tone. I do wish that Huston tapped into more noirish tones. It needs a bit more sweat from everybody and darker lighting. Bogie and Bacall are a little too nicely made up. I love EGR who refuses to shut up even as he's getting a shave.

At the family's "Hotel Largo" bar, Mr. Bogart encounters alcohol-drenched Claire Trevor (as Maggie Mooney aka Gaye Dawn) and some men who look suspiciously like gangsters. They try to dissuade Bogart, but he persists in meeting crippled old Lionel Barrymore (as James Temple) and his beautiful daughter Lauren Bacall (as Nora). She immediately sends Bogart "come hither" looks. A mysterious man from upstairs turns out to be notorious gangster Edward G. Robinson (as Johnny Rocco), with a wad of loot. Then, everyone is threatened by an approaching hurricane..."I hear that a hurricane blows off roofs, uproots trees, and puts the snatch on people. And they all fly around in the sky together. Is that right?" Figuratively speaking, at least...Screenplay writer Richard Brooks and director John Huston elevate Maxwell Anderson's original play by tailoring it for Bogart, who is typically iconic. As if that wasn't enough, Mr. Robinson is coaxed out of his bathtub. Give that man a cigar. In these hands, "Key Largo" becomes nothing less than an illustration of good and evil in America, played out in its underbelly. The country which had just played the key role in ridding the world of Adolf Hitler had a hangover. And problems dating back to the Native American Indians, who make a very note-worthy appearance. Singing with the shakes for a drink, Ms. Trevor won an "Oscar". Icons and caricatures act up a storm, then the big guns come out for an exciting conclusion.********* Key Largo (7/16/48) John Huston ~ Humphrey Bogart, Edward G.

While Rocco kills time waiting for the storm to end so that he can escape to Cuba, he amuses himself by pulling the strings on an assortment of oddly matched characters, making them play out the dramatic game that follows: a world weary soldier (Bogart), a boozy ex-singer (Trevor), a wheelchair-bound patriarch (Barrymore) etc. Nothing much happens, but we get to enjoy a triumph of stage direction and ensemble acting as John Huston, clearly at the peak of his game, keeps the dramatic fireworks and some wonderfully crackling dialogue coming in this tightly directed melodrama.

		<shortDescription>Bogey, Bacall, Robinson, Barrymore, and Trevor; Directed by Huston. WOW.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Huston had a special touch with the film noir: his MALTESE FALCON, coincidentally also starring Humphrey Bogart, is one of the best examples of the genre. And the team of Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall is to film noir what Tracy and Hepburn was to other forms ranging from melodrama to comedy. Bogey and Bacall made only four films together, all of them noirs, and all of them unforgettable. My personal favorite is their final on screen pairing, KEY LARGO, loosely based on a play by Maxwell Anderson and set in a part of South Florida that I have always loved.Bogart is Frank McCloud, a World War II veteran who arrives at the title location in search of the family of a friend from his unit who died during the war. James Temple (Lionel Barrymore), the dead man's father, and Nora Temple (Bacall), his widow, together operate the Hotel Largo. When Frank arrives, he finds the hotel closed for the season, but nonetheless occupied by a motley collection of men whose words, looks, and actions are all a trifle suspicious; Frank picks up on the tension immediately, but cannot put a name to it yet.Soon enough the plot unfolds; the hotel and its owners have been taken hostage by a gangster and his henchmen, who are using the hotel as a rendezvous point for a shipment of counterfeit money, destination: Cuba. Complicating matters is the fact that a hurricane is approaching, something the locals know all too well but which takes the intruders by surprise and shakes their confidence.After some preliminary words between Frank and the gangster's men, he finally meets "Dad" Temple, who is confined to a wheelchair, and Nora. Their liking is mutual and immediate. Bogey is really at his best here; he seldom got to show his softer side, but whenever he did, the results were always marvelous.We finally meet the gangster face-to-face: one Johnny Rocco, played by Edward G Robinson in yet another one of his memorable turns on the wrong side of the law. It is a testament to the man's talent that he played gangsters so often yet somehow made each man an individual.Rocco has brought along his erstwhile paramour: a boozy former lounge singer named Gaye Dawn, played to a fare-thee-well by the great Claire Trevor, who won a much deserved Supporting Actress Oscar for her performance as a woman broken by men, alcohol, and life, but who still has a few resources of her own when she can summon them up.With this sensational cast and set-up, Huston adds one more character to the proceedings: the hurricane. It becomes a part of the story and in some places drives the actions of the characters. Most tragic is the fate of some Indians who came to the hotel seeking shelter from the storm, but whom Rocco refuses to allow Temple to let in; they spend the whole storm huddled outside the front door. Two of them are young men who escaped from jail for a minor charge; Dad Temple has persuaded them to turn themselves in, but when they are denied admission to the hotel, they get angry and run, and are tragically killed by the local sheriff.This is in some ways an atypical noir: it has a heart, and characters with real feelings, in a genre that is usually cold and dark. KEY LARGO is dark, but the goodness of the returning veteran and his friend's family is like a lantern illuminating this darkness; the contrast between them and Rocco and his gang is utterly stunning.I've always thought that if they had made more films together, Bogart and Bacall would have equaled, if not surpassed, Tracy and Hepburn; they are sensational here, as always. And the rest of the cast is right up there with them in an exciting film that keeps you on the edge of your seat until the final scene.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film has all the elements of noir and a few twists...It is Bogart and Bacall at their best. Just as in "To Have and Have Not". The sets of Key Largo are believable as they are in the midst of an impending hurricane, an untimely visit by Johnny Rocco (Edward G. Robinson in his mobster persona). Claire Trevor as his boozy mistress, and Lionel Barrymore as hotel owner, who maintains a small inn which normally would see no trouble if not for the visit of Rocco and his sordid group of henchmen.Well done simmering suspense. Barrymore in a wheelchair spits at Johnnny Rocco, a profiteer from prohibition days. Bacall is lovely and understated. Bogie as a man finding himself in a negative situation which could go either way.Overall the suspense really makes the storyline here. As the hurricane strengthens, so do the emotional tensions. Barrymore and his friends the "Osceola Boys" Native Americans who are living on the lam.Interesting cast extras also with Felipa Goimez as "Momma Ochobee" who is over one hundred years old, and rescued from the storm by Bacall and her father.Overall a great film, understated, and anyone who has lived in South Florida will appreciate the sets, the ocean and evocative mood. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everything that can be said about this masterful film has pretty much been covered in these boards. It is a veritable feast of magnificent acting from the complex character played by Bogie to Edward G's nasty, cowardly washed-up gangster, to Lionel Barrymore's feisty hotel owner to Bacall's sweet atypical playing of his dead son's wife. So I would like to concentrate on another of the film's great roles........that of Gay Dawn played by the incomparable Claire Trevor.Trevor was a mainstay in films for a number of years before she got the chance at a role she could sink her teeth into.........as a result she won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress and brother, did she deserve it. Her pathetic has-been alcoholic nightclub singer and paramour of Edward G. in better days is as good as it gets. When Edward G. forces her to sing "Moanin' Low" with the promise of a drink, it is heartbreaking. However, she may have been a bit too good looking for the part since all concerned keep referring to her great looks in earlier times. Trevor was never to top this performance but it is a lasting tribute to her acting abilities.Keep an eye out for Jay Silverheels (of Tonto fame) as one of the Osceola brothers and the beautiful Rodd Redwing as his brother (what a classic face he had).This is a film that deserves it's reputation and is in the "do not miss it" category. It's a 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Bogarts with Robinson, L Barrymoore, Trevor &amp; Huston</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen this film umpteen times, the last time at the Aero in Santa Monica with a little video of Bacall giving comments on this and "Murder on the Orient Express." While both Bacall flicks had all star casts, this is the one where good guy Bogart shoots down bad guy Robinson. Robinson is at his absolute best here as Johnie Rocco, introduced by big cigar while in the bathtub.Bogart as the world weary vet comes to return a medal of a dead war hero while the wind is quickly becoming a storm. He gives the medal to the hero's father Barrymoore and can't help noticing the widow who returns the notice played by Lauren Bacall. The classic story of a stoic dark stranger who comes and rescues the damsel in distress.Among those under Robinson's beck and call is a boozed up Claire Trevor whose pathetic singing of a song for a drink is one of the highlights of this tightly knit drama.Huston shows us the mistreatment of native Americans and whites as an entire community is forced to stay outdoors when the hurricane hits. Jay Silverheels is one of the two who gets shot by the sheriff though he is innocent and it is through Robinson's double dealing which makes the viewer hate him even more.Special mention of Lionel Barrymoore. Most of his career was under MGM and this is his only appearance with Bogart and Robinson. This is a great showcase of this actually very important character actor.I've enjoyed this movie many times.</fullReview>

It turns out that MCloud is in for a rough time with both a major hurricane brewing and about the hit the Keys as well as big time gangster Johnny Rocco, Edward G. Robinson, planning to make his way back to the states, via Cuba. This after eight years in exile in Italy after Rocco was drummed out of the country as an undesirable alien.Besides wanting to go out in the Caribbean to catch fish McCloud is eager to meet the Largo Hotel's owner and his daughter in law James &amp; Norma Temple, Lionel Barrymore &amp; Lauren Bacall,who's son and Nora's husband, George Temple, McCloud was with when he was killed in action at Mount Casino back in 1944. At the hotel there's Rocco's gang waiting for the big man himself to finally make his grand appearance and jump start, after eight of inactivity, his criminal career. Rocco is planning to ship a load of counterfeit money ,"round robin", from Key Largo to Havana and then back to the USA with his gangster friend Ziggy, Marc Lawrence,bank rolling the deal.With everything planned to perfection by Rocco and his hoods things get a bit strained when the hurricane hits the Keys and then blows, or was it that the skipper chickened out and took off, their getaway boat to Cuba out to sea. With just a few hours left to get out of the state, as well as country, before the cops and feds get wind of what's going on at the Largo Hotel Rocco has McCloud take him and his boys on his fishing boat to Cuba planning to knock him off before they makes port. McCloud who's on to Rocco and what he plans for him turns the tables on the arrogant hoodlum by getting his men, lead by Richard Curly Huff (Thomas Gomez), to drop their guard. After offing all three of Rocco's hoods, Curly Angel &amp; Toots, McCloud then has a showdown on the high seas with Rocco who has to do something that he's not at all that used to; whack someone, who's both armed and dangerous, by himself without his hoods there to protect him.Even though he didn't show up on the screen until almost an half hour into the movie Edward G. Robinson is by far more effective as the deported Mafia Chieftain Johnny Rocco then his co-star the, for once in a gangster movie, All-Amerca good guy Humphrey Bogart as "Soldier" McCloud. There's also in "Key Largo" the woozy girlfriend of Johnny Rocco ex-showgirl and singer Gaye Dawn, Claire Trevor, whom he mercilessly and sadistically tortures by keeping her away from the hotel's bar and liquor cabinet. The movie takes place within the space of a 24 hour period with the real star in it the hurricane that hits the Keys and prevents Rocco and his hoods from making good their getaway. The Rocco Mob plans to reestablishing a newer and better, as well as more effective, mob that will uses it's both power and influence to have probation again enacted and put on the books. With probation back in business it will put the mob back in the money by it pushing cheap cut and and water down booze to the, by then , bone dry American public and make millions, like in the 1920's and 1930's, off it. What happened instead is that after the war it was drugs like heroin and cocaine that took the place of bootleg booze which was not only deadlier but far more profitable for the mob. Rocco in a way did get it right with his idea of using Cuba as a hub for his criminal operations in the states. In just four more years, in 1952, Sgt. Batista took over the country as Cuba's dictator and worked together with the Mob, or Mafia, as his partners in establishing Cuba as the only country that let it run it's illegal operations up front and in public with him and his boys getting a piece of the action. It's just too bad that in the end that great seer and visionary Johnny Rocco never lived to see that great event in Mafia history ever happen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bogie &amp; Bacall Classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What an awesome film! I just feel so lucky to have seen this little piece of movie history. Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall were the greatest couple ever, and throughout their career they made 4 movies with each other: To Have And Have not, The Big Sleep, Dark Passage and Key Largo. Personally I have only seen The Big Sleep and Key Largo, and if I have to choose a favorite then it would probably be The Big Sleep, because it has more Noir, which I like, but Key Largo is a great film too! The story is basically that an ex-soldier or something comes to visit the family of a passed away soldier friend in Florida. The widower and the soldier starts having feelings for each other, but then they find out that a gangster sort type boss has taken over the hotel the family owns and that with the help of his "men" they take the family hostage. And all in the middle of this, a horrible storm comes along, causing panic and fear in the sizzling Florida Keys!! The tension and the drama in this film is really something special... It's real! I would recommend this fourtys classic to anyone, knowing that other people will love it as much as I did. So take a little time and go see Key Largo. You won't regret it! I think...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic Ensemble Cast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a cast with so much character. Hard to pick a favorite. Edward G.'s middle age gangster return is right up there with Cagney's in White Heat. Bogart's disillusionment and cynicism creates a complexity that ranks as one of my favorite roles for him. 'Why should I stick my neck out for anybody?'. Read a few negative reviews of Bacall's performance. I thought she was believable as a war widow. Amongst all the character; somebody had to be more understated. Trevor's Oscar; well-deserved; pure character. Barrymore's performance and scene trying to get out of wheelchair and praying for the hurricane to destroy the hotel; great. Dan 'I'm the electrician'is a hoodlum/punk almost as memorable as Elisha Cook's Wilmer in The Maltese Falcon (Huston seemed to have a knack for these characters). But the character that I've been noticing more after a few viewings is Thomas Gomez as the assistant to Johnny Rocco. Gum chewing and eyes relentlessly shifting and surveying the situation. Trying to put off Bogart, Bacall, Barrymore,and all with a pleasant affront with barely concealed badness. He exudes a convincing familiarity with Johnny Rocco; nervously anticipating him and trying to keep him from losing his cool. As great a supporting role as you can get I think. Also noteworthy are Marc Lawrence as Ziggy. The sheriff character is good, too. One of my all-time favorites. The only negative I've read here that I could agree with is it may be too stagy for some. With that I give it 9 out of a 10. Lastly say 'She sells sea shells by the seashore' five times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Adaptation of a Fine Play; Powerful, Interesting Wartine Study of Characters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There were a number of films made during the war years which had the same theme: a disguised form of altruism where the man who stood aloof, thought for himself, refused death, risk, imposed duty or responsibility in any form was shown being convinced by the dire nature of wartime events and brutalities that he needed to risk sacrifice, even die for others. In other words, there was a deliberate or inadvertent confusing of the morality of emergencies with those of normative circumstances, leading to demands being made on any able man to give up his liberty. One of the best of these was "Key Largo", also one of the best plotted and best considered of such film. The storyline in Maxwell Anderson's interesting play is classically simple. Frank comes to keep a promise, visiting James Temple and his daughter-on-law, his friend's widow.. He is unaware that Johnny Rocco and his gang have taken over the place and are holding them. When he sees how Rocco treats his alcoholic girl friend and murders two Indians, he decides he must risk his life to stop Rocco; his chance comes during a ride on a boat by means of which he is taking Rocco to escape authorities in Cuba.he succeeds and decides to stay. The theme of the film is the responsibility each man has to every other. Soi the chosen vehicle is an emergency one but interesting. As Frank, Humphrey Bogart is low-key and charismatic. Lauren Bacall as the daughter-in-law, Lionel Barrymore as Temple and Claire Trevor as Gaye, Rocco's mistress, are all very good, Trevor having the most to do and doing it brilliantly. As Rocco, Edward G. Robinson is strong and at his best whether snarling, pulling a trigger or issuing loud orders. others in the cast include effective Thomas Gomez, Monte Blue, Harry Lewis, Marc Lawrence, John Rodney, Dan Seymour, and William Haade. Credit needs to be given to John Huston and Richard brooks for turning the play into a slightly claustrophobic but well-paced and well acted movie. Perc Westmore did the makeup, Max Steiner the fine music and old pro Karl Freund the cinematography. The dialogue here is expectedly exceptional; the characters are given opportunities to reveal their true natures. And the growing closer together of Bacall and Bogart is handled as Huston usually does, through word, gesture action and reaction. This is a powerful and often moving film that bears repeated viewings well.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Key Largo (1948): Dir: John Huston / Cast: Humphrey Bogart, Lauren Bacall, Edward G. Robinson, Claire Trevor, Lionel Barrymore: John Huston's disaster film is well made yet sometimes corny thriller about destination and the dangers surrounding. Edward G. Robinson heads a gang that takes several hostages within a resort hotel while pulling a heist. A terrible storm throws a damper into his plans and causes havoc. Starts out well with the arrival of Humphrey Bogart and two Indians who escaped jail but gave themselves up. The structure is stagy and the ending is cheesy with Humphrey Bogart sailing back and Lauren Bacall letting in the sunshine. Director Huston receives a credible performance where Bogart uses brains over brawn. Huston previously directed Bogart in The Maltese Falcon. Bacall is limited as a hinted damsel whose gushing scene in the conclusion gives happy endings a bad name. Robinson steal the film as the head villain who survives stagey material with convincing mannerisms that are eventually outdone. Claire Trevor steals moments as his drunken lounge singer whom he mistreats. Lionel Barrymore plays Bacall's father who own the hotel. He didn't plan on a second disaster though. Entertaining and well produced film that further places Huston among the innovators. Strong theme regards nature as an unpredictable force against man. Score: 6 ? / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>at first sigh, not a surprise. the cast, the story, the director are good guarantee for a movie far to disappoint. but that fact makes things rolls. because a film noir becomes for John Huston brilliant opportunity to explore possibilities of each actor in a wise manner. sure, the places are not really different by old characters interpreted by each of them. but essential is the nuance. the shadows, the lights, the secondary actors, the plot and the levels of tension, the balance between dialogs and silence and the profound exploitation of social/cultural questions. it is not exactly a film with Robbinson, Bacall and Bogard but a correct movie , result of clear and precise lines. a film who can not be a surprise. but an admirable work who reminds the force and the rules of a period and who can be modern today for the inspiration to be little more than artistic product.</fullReview>

The cinematography and production values are lovely, and Max Steiner's score is not only memorable but really adds to the atmosphere. The story is tightly constructed with many memorable moments, the script is simply cracking and Key Largo moves along very nicely as well. Once again, John Huston's direction is wonderful, and the ensemble cast is faultless. Both Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall give sterling performances and show great chemistry, while Lionel Barrymore is a pleasure. But it is Edward G.Robinson who steals the show, he is just outstanding here. So all in all, this is a great film, well worth seeing for the cast and Huston's direction, as well as other things. 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Key Largo is a typical Hollywood production of its time. The director is John Huston, who combines with some of his favorite actors; Humphrey Bogart, Lauren Bacall, Lionel Barrymore and Edward G. Robinson, to tell a story about a group of people being held hostage by some mob members trying to make a deal that will return them to the top of the American crime chain. Here, amidst a terrible hurricane ravaging the tiny island of Key Largo, Bogart and the rest of the gang must dig down deep inside and find the courage to stand up for what is right and take down the evil mob boss, Johnny Rocco.I realize that even though this plot is so clich now but it wasn't sixty years ago, it still leaves me unimpressed as to the entertainment value of the movie. Sure, the acting is fine, but Bogart is so cool and under control you sit there waiting for him to blow like he does in his other great roles. Lauren Bacall doesn't do much and neither does Barrymore, who are both terrific character actors. Edward G. Robinson gives the best performance but even he is not truly frightening or intimidating. Nothing really incredible happens here, the story just moves along at a steady pace and we are to enjoy the actors reciting their mediocre dialogue. This isn't to say Key Largo is a bad film; I've seen quite worse. Still, with Huston directing, and Bogart and Bacall starring, I had my hopes considerably higher.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watching Key Largo for the 5th or 6th time, I began to wonder about Bogey's character. In the scene where Rocco gives Bogey the gun and says "here's your chance to rid the world of Johnny Rocco", Bacall has a go at Bogey for being a coward. Her reaction to his statement that he doesn't care whether Rocco lives or dies and the only battles he fights are his own is shock.Is this how Bogey's character really feels or is he playing a game with the gangsters, trying to get them to think he is not a threat.For example when Old Man Temple starts to doubt himself "no, Nora, maybe Frank's right, maybe he's right.", you can see that Bogey is visibly upset by his reaction. As if he doesn't want Old Man Temple and Nora to believe what he is actually seeing.So who is Frank McCloud really, in this film? Is he really a cynic, or are the things he does and says during the hurricane an act for the gangsters?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Contrary to the song, Bogie and Bacall never did it in Key Largo, at least not on screen. The romantic tension between the two is mostly left up the imagination, but since the two were married in real life, there is little for the imagination. Edward G. Robinson is type cast as Johnny Rocco and plays the tough guy to perfection. Although not in the movie but in many Bogart books, the studio photo of Bacall holding Bogie's arm as he faces the criminals gun in hand is one of the most romantic pictures ever taken. This is my favorite Bogart movie and I have almost all of the ones put on VHS. The hurricane is simply an effect that puts it all together. Look close and you will see Jay Silverheels later to play Tonto as Tom Osceola. Want to find me? "Hotel Central, Milwaukee."</fullReview>

Not long after his arrival a forgotten gangster (Robinson) takes the entire family hostage, and Bogart has to keep things calm between the people until the nights through. And, to complicate things, a hurricane decides to trash the Florida Keys.Gangsters, girls, Indians, Bogart and palmtrees; the things good movies are made of!

Both are wonderful films But it's time to let Key Largo enjoy great classic movie status,instead of having that position constantly occupied by only Citizen Kane and Casablanca. enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a terrific film and it's among the best performances by Humphrey Bogart. I think the only reason the film is more widely recognized as a classic is because Bogart had so many terrific performances.The film begins with Bogey arriving at Key Largo (a large island off the SE coast of Florida). He's there to see the widow and father of an army buddy. Before long, however, storm warnings occur--a bad one is headed their way. And, near the same time, a group of gangsters arrive. It seems that the boss (Edward G. Robinson) was deported some time back but is sneaking back into the country. Well, due to the storm and Robinson being recognized, the gang decide to stay--during which time they menace and torment everyone simply because they can. In many ways, the film is similar to Bogart's later film, THE DESPERATE HOURS, though in this case Bogart isn't the gang leader but an innocent man pulled into this situation.What is best about this film is Bogart's character. For a long time, you really aren't sure who he is or what he really stands for--is he a hero or just a jerk trying to save his skin? Sure, Robinson is great to watch, too, but his role is much more typical of Robinson's earlier gangster roles. Exceptional writing, a great sense of suspense and great acting--this film has it all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Key Largo (1948) **** (out of 4) Exciting, fast paced drama from Warner has a gangster (Edward G. Robinson) holding a group of people (Humphrey Bogart, Lionel Barrymore, Lauren Bacall) hostage in a hotel while a hurricane blows over. This might not be as legendary as Casablanca or as mind challenging as The Maltese Falcon but I still think this film holds up very well against those classics and I'd go even further by saying this is one of the most entertaining films ever made. I hear a lot of people say this film is a classic but it's not very deep but I say so what? The film is fast, tense and entertaining from the first scene to the last and I think you could call it a greatest hits type of film as the studio and director certainly wanted and needed a hit with this film so they just threw everything at the viewer and delivered a lot of fun. Robinson gives another terrific performance and seeing him go up against not only Bogart but also Barrymore is priceless. The scenes of Robinson freaking out as the storm nears is perfectly done by the actor. Barrymore is flawless as the cranky old man not wanting to take anything from the gangster. Bogart is also excellent in a film that delivers him one of his strongest roles. Bacall and Claire Trevor are wonderful in their supporting roles. This film is certainly dialogue driven but this is enough to pack all the energy that the film needs as the actors really bring the script to life. Huston's direction keeps everything flowing well but there's no doubt this film belongs to the terrific cast.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If Bogie had had a touch of the philosopher in him - and for all I know he did - he might have pondered on the fact that with Key Largo he was coming full circle; he first attracted attention on Broadway in a play (The Petrified Forest, by Robert E. Sherwood) that featured gangsters whilst preaching peace. Now here he was again filming an adaptation of a play by Maxwell Anderson that features gangsters but preaches peace. Although Huston does take his camera outdoors from time to time the stage origins - a hotel in Florida, one-set, classic - are obvious. Most of the cast turn in sterling work, even Bacall, who has never been accused of being an actress, specifically Barrymore, Bogie and Eddie Robinsion. Despite a minimum of the kind of action one anticipates from a gangster movie the tension is maintained. Still pretty good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great film, idiotic soundtrack</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's not much I could say about this film that hasn't already been said. Another great Bogart-Huston pairing, and fine acting all around. Huston was a fine director, one of the greats, but his only failing was his soundtracks. They never suited the tone or the integrity of his films. The music cues in his films are utter garbage. The 'Indian' scene in this film is typical. Great acting and direction, but the music falls back on clichs of 'Indian' modes and rhythms which, incidentally, sound NOTHING like true Native American musical forms.Max Steiner, who accomplished the impossible with 'Gone With The Wind' in creating a score even more memorable than the film, should have known better. But he can't bear the weight of the blame. The blame falls mostly on Huston himself. While it's clear that he accords some respect to the indigenous people he presents on film -- to his credit, far more than most filmmakers of his time -- it's also clear he views them as something of at best a curiosity, and at worst a kind of cute sideshow attraction. In this film, as in 'The African Queen', he gives no context for their existence or behavior. They are strangers to our Western European tradition, and as such are accorded the same deference we might give to the first deaf or blind person we've ever met. The soundtrack in particular reflects this. Fortunately, it's mostly in the background, and we can ignore it and focus on the performances. All of which are first rate and engaging. Robinson, as usual, is a pitch-perfect son-of-a-bitch, Bogart plays the iconic reluctant hero, and Lionel Barrymore is flat out one of the finest film actors of all time, and once again he proves it without even trying.This film is so worth watching that it would be plain stupid of you to miss it. But try to ignore the soundtrack, it only gets in the way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Improvement Over "To Have and Have Not"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A man visits his old friend's hotel and finds a gangster running things. As a hurricane approaches, the two end up confronting each other.Bacall and Bogart's fourth film together, and their last. As much as Bogart loved Bacall, I just cannot find her attractive, and her husky voice is distracting for me. I would love to grade her on her acting, but the voice is too much. I think I like her more here than "To Have and Have Not", though (the two are so similar, you have to compare them).Edward G. Robinson is added to the mix, which I think is another reason this film stands superior. Robinson has the noir and mobster parts down to a science. His work with Fritz Lang is amazing, but honestly he can hardly ever do anything wrong (nothing bad comes to mind just now).Cinematographer Karl Freund was on this film, and he's a genius. You need to see this film cleaned up to really get the full affect, but with Freund the camera was not just a tool, but an active part of the filming process, a spectator just as much as the audience.I find it interesting that there is a little known fact from behind the scenes: After the film wrapped, director John Huston, writer Richard Brooks, and cameraman Karl Freund all peed on the floor of the set. This ritual was witnessed by editor Rudi Fehr, who was confused and "shocked", having never seen such an act before or since. I love this story, as it puts Huston in such a different light.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A stagey setting for a florid melodrama from John Huston...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While KEY LARGO is certainly no masterpiece, it IS highly entertaining, thanks largely to two larger than life performances from EDWARD G. ROBINSON (at his mightiest) and CLAIRE TREVOR (who manages to steal every scene she is in as a lush past her prime as a torch singer).But it's not quite the sort of thing Bogart and Bacall fans were used to. Lauren is much more demure than usual, very low-key but earnest in her performance and she does well in a part that is not quite as sultry as her other roles of this period. Bogart too is low-key in a rather colorless role (for him anyway), as a soldier who drops in on Bacall and her father (Lionel Barrymore) at a hotel in the Florida keys to give them information about her soldier husband.The oncoming storm is nothing compared to the histrionics of EDWARD G. ROBINSON who chews up all the scenery in sight as a gangster almost as black-hearted as his Wolf Larsen in THE SEA WOLF, even though most of the scenery is confined to a couple of hotel settings. Surprisingly, for a film directed by John Huston, he has allowed the storm aspect to be the least realistic part of the setting. It all seems to take place on a Warner sound stage with banging shutters and loose pictures on the wall, but not much of a storm to be concerned about except when miniatures are shown of a very strong tide and a hotel battered by winds and rain.But these are minor squabbles when all the performances are edgy and wonderful, particularly Thomas Gomez, Dan Seymour and Marc Lawrence. But it's CLAIRE TREVOR and EDW. G. ROBINSON that have the most powerful roles and they play them with every bit of professionalism they can muster--and that's plenty. Trevor has never been more effective and richly deserved her Supporting Role Oscar.Some of the film drags, burdened by too much of Maxwell Anderson's stage dialog which tends to give a static look to some of the scenes, but the last half-hour is full of vigorous movement as the story reaches a satisfying climax.If you're looking for a typical Bogart/Bacall film, this is not it. But it is good, solid entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although the idea of using a hurricane for entertainment value might make us cringe in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, John Huston does a very good job with it in "Key Largo". The movie portrays some gangsters led by Edward G. Robinson taking over a hotel on the title island in the Florida Keys. But things might not go over so easily with Humphrey Bogart in the hotel.Both main cast members do a very good job, as do Lauren Bacall and Claire Trevor (who won Best Supporting Actress). This may be escapism, but very well done, with perfect tension in the air as the hurricane rages outside. Cool.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You see this same formula used back there a lot-gangster holds everyone in some random business(diner, hotel, etc) hostage, everyone gets angry and there's alotta talk talk talk for the majority of the movie. Something happens to upset the balance towards the end, the baddie gets his and every still living lives happier ever after. More or less.Here you have many '40's biggies-Bogie, Bacall, Edward G, Lionel Barrymore, etc running thru their paces under John Huston's sure direction. Notable character players like Jay Silverheels, Monte Blue and Claire Trevor strut their stuff too. She got an Oscar for her role as the boozy ex-singer/moll who Edward G swats around. Sad scene to watch her sing for a drink.Interesting clashes of personalities, philosophies and etc. here. Bogie reps the returning GI, Edward G the mob of the past, Lionel and Bacall average American human dignity, and I guess the Seminoles ditto ditto. The storm comes in and just adds even more menace to the proceedings.It gets too talky and kinda drags at times, but the acting is quite good and you know you are watching pros in action. Worth checking out. And hey, you think Harrison Ford has seen this finale before? Nick Cage too? *** outta ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My brief review of the film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bogie and Robinson face off well together in this popular variation on 'The Petrified Forest' and other like films. The plot is a bit muddled though, it is awfully slow and sluggish to begin with and too talky for its own good. Still, with good weather effects helping out, the film maintains much dramatic tension, even though the utterly melodramatic nature of the events tends to undermine the film's credibility. Claire Trevor is arguably the best aspect of the film in her Oscar winning role. The music by Max Steiner is great too, yet it does not often fit the material and it is played too often to have much effect. Overall, it is a good film, with some memorable lines and scenes in the mix. It is not perfect, but it does a reasonable job.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I happened to see this film last night for the first time (TCM), and, I'll have to do some research when it comes to native (Seminole) residents living on Key Largo (I'm not sure if that's entirely true), however, even in the late 1940's, it was common to still see small communities of Miccosukee (Seminole) living in various rural parts of South Florida.Even though it's 2006, fortunately some things do not change - similar to the old Seminole woman in the film, last Sunday, an old Seminole woman (by her garb) and a fairly young woman (perhaps her granddaughter), sat next to me in church (the Hollywood Reservation being only 2 or 3 miles away), and, in seeing the similarity with the old woman in the movie last night, I couldn't help but smile.The one thing I couldn't understand was the constant reference to the hot weather - any local resident knows that daytime temps are always cooler in the Keys, because the ocean is about 20 degrees cooler than the land temp on any typical summer afternoon...That's Hollywood for you...Frank</fullReview>

		<fullReview>. . . are "tomahawk-chopped" here, but who cares? Hollywood's credo always has been, "the only good Indian is a dead Indian." Though most of the deaths in KEY LARGO take place off-screen, if you combine the exceptions with the rule, my count comes out to 6 dead European "invader" people, and 802 dead Native people. Obviously, the Warner Brothers weren't counting on selling very many tickets for KEY LARGO to America's indigenous peoples. Naturally, they figured White folks would consider KEY LARGO to be a "feel good" flick, since the fact that NONE of the 802 dead Indians did anything worse than to get drunk in public on the White Man's alcohol would be no skin off their noses. Why NOT let half the psycho-killer White mobsters survive, and balance off this police leniency in respect to the thug Ziggy's crew by rubbing out 802 Natives overlooked by Chris Columbus and Buffalo Bill?? Oh, sure, Hollywood DID let TWO Indians survive in the movies: Dustin Hoffman in LITTLE BIG MAN and Kevin Costner in DANCES WITH WOLVES. But wait! Silly me! Now that I think about it, Hoffman and Costner's characters WERE BOTH WHITE MEN PRETENDING TO BE INDIANS!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like ever Huston wants to give us more that you just what you think you are seeing. It seems to be a thriller, but you will understand quickly that the gangsters are just the directors excuse. What happens with gangsters business haven't any importance. The director show us a group of people that are looking inside themselves. People who had came back from different places trying to come back to their great lives: a gangster who wants to be fearsome, a alcoholic singer that can't be famous again, a soldier who is not sure about the thing that he do at the war was good. There are a dozen of reasons at least that makes characters and film interesting, but the thriller is not one of them. The problem is that a hour and a half is not enough for a film which wants to tell more than anyone could see at first view.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For some reason the villain and his cronies see most of the development and meaty moments in this film, and although this is no reflection on Edward G. Robinson as an actor, it surprised me to see Humphrey and Lauren feeding off scraps and left me disappointed. Given their sizzling chemistry in other collaborations, they just never came near it here, and if I watch a gangster movie with Bogart as the hero then I want to root for him and not spend most of my time with the villain!The mostly economical settings don't help much, either. Yes, they're used effectively as a way to build tension, but they also carry the unwelcome side-effect of making things seem staged, and therefore much easier to telegraph. There's very little spontaneity in this film, all that takes place is either conveyed in showy monologues or brooding silence. No dynamism until the end.It's nice to finally see the chap who's supposed to be the hero conquer his demons and stand up for the people he loves, however I felt it all came a little too late to properly endear me to a character who spent most of the film either obscured or overshadowed.I have to consider this as a waste of one of the greatest couples The Golden Age ever gave us.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, maybe I'm a little PO'd that I didn't record this movie on Turner Classics... But this is a Pretty Good movie... I would record it for "historical" purposes only... That scene where that Old Lady says she is like 112 years old, has tons of 1 inch deep wrinkles, and then they stuff a cigarette in her mouth!!! Holy Cr*p!!! Of course, never mind that Bogart dies of throat cancer in his 50's... Could have been due to the alcohol, but who knows, they were promoting cigarettes like they were Vitamin C tablets back then... Then that part where he tells Bacall he met his first sweetheart on a boat... Holy Cr*p!!! That was a blatant reference where he was referring to their very first movie together and he was playing captain of this small boat... Never mind he was married to someone else at the time... I guess in retrospect his first wife wasn't a sweetheart??? What's up with that... Anyway, the more I watch, the more I become addicted to these old movies... They are like great literature... The more you read one, the more you understand the other... Thank God for the IMDb and the Hollywood stars!!!! (and the non-Hollywood "stars" too!!)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not so much</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I used to not like that Bogart had no range and just kept playing himself in movies, but now I've enjoyed enough of his movies that I don't care. What I do mind about this movie is the placement of the Bogart &amp; Bacall characters into such an odd, ill-fitting plot structure &amp; milieu. Here he's required to be a passive hostage for the entire movie. This just isn't where I want to see the Bogart character. Bacall is transformed from a sultry tease into a hand-wringing, passive '50s housefrau. No thanks. Instead of a plot that develops, a "held captive by gangsters" scenario is introduced in the early portion that renders everything inert. Rather than introducing tension via plot developments, it's a device to infuse all the proceedings with tension, but tension can't last for 90 minutes, and the gimmick makes for a film which is claustrophobic and stagey.There's more to viewer identification than liking the moral characters and disliking the criminals. The ailment that requires Lionel Barrymore to use a wheelchair is never named, so I guess he's just a lazy overeater. (He even gets out of the chair at one point.) He has an enormous belly and the costume designers chose to just move the waistline up to his armpits. It takes about a yard of extra fabric to cover his entire gut. Its repulsive and ridiculous. That alone made me resist identification with him. He looks like an absolute ass. Worst of all, he spouts tiresome, self-righteous, salt-of-the-earth, hick opinions at the drop of a hat, always half an hour after a viewer has thought the same thing and assumed the movie was smart enough not to verbalize it. Not so. I wanted to throttle him every time he opened his mouth.The tone of noir is abandoned for full-on sentiment. Dramatically this represents some rotten moment when stars thought that great acting meant a characters sub-text was expressed explicitly on their faces at every moment. What world is that? An annoying, hammy, crappy, overwrought song in the Judy Garland idiom, is coaxed out of an alcoholic gangster moll (Claire Trevor), and signals all the horrible, gratuitous songs that are coming in the 50s (i.e Que sera sera).It's just so homey &amp; conventional. Cross Die Hard with Lady in a Cage and toss in some storm effects.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although a big fan of classic movies, Bogie, and John Huston, this movie is way overrated. The plot is lame, and the acting is wooden. We never really feel the tension we are supposed to due to the "Stagecoach/Lifeboat/Grand Hotel" group-of-people-trapped in a strange/funny/tragic/tense situation. My only supposition is that the marquee-level stars (Bogart, Bacall, Robinson, Barrymore) cloud reviewers critical faculties. Watch this one once for your "files", but that's it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting themes, hideous direction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Possible spoilers, I guess.Key Largo is an appalling piece of filmmaking that shamelessly conceals its clumsiness under the attendance of celebrities. Nevertheless, John Huston still manages to shed Lauren Bacall's inimitable appeal and gives her the part of a hotel ornament. Lionel Barrymore has to pardon the script and go through several ridiculous representations of his character, whereas Lauren's dear husband does not really have to channel any effort, since his role is already imbued with all sorts of psychological complexes. The cinematography, on the other hand, is not bad, though the quality is rather unbalanced. Huston's vision can be calm in scenes like the one in which Lauren lights up all the lamps in the lobby while her husband shuts all the windows from outside. Throughout this single take, Rocco's men never cease showering their ominous gazes onto Lauren, until her husband enters the lobby and breaks the silence. This shot is the one of the few saving graces of this catastrophy. The real catastrophe is caused by the horrible intrusion of unnecessary music, that accomplishes in making the scenes look more cheesy than they are supposed to be, as if the laudable absurdity is not enough to shatter the audience's appetite.Despite the heartfelt advice from the late film critic Andrew Sarris, I still rented this movie out of my unrestrained infatuation with young Lauren. Furthermore, I was curious to discover why John Huston's career has been so severely undermined in Sarris' review. He is the man who made The African Queen, and I remember liking it. This has been an unpleasant yet worthwhile experience, because I know that I do not have to waste any more time on any other Huston film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this together with the TeeVee version of "Petrified Forest" and I was mortified.That's because this is pretty bad.Yes, I know it has some popular people involved in it. And I presume it was effective in its day.We probably didn't notice that the actors (especially a young Bacall) are what Brando called lazy personality actors. Or that the characters and dialog are cartoonish, and not in the way we allow, but in a stagy artificial way. Or that the effect of the storm (created on a sound stage) really doesn't threaten, with shaking light fixtures and all.It is to drama in today's context what Mystery Science Theater is to science fiction. We've moved so much in what we expect that this has become self-parody.But it is illustrative of the battle that was going on at the time for the form cinema would take. It wasn't until 1941 that the matter was mostly settled. For the ten years before, all sorts of contenders were trotted out, one of them being this form: a stage play with some wild nature or scope that couldn't be conveyed on stage.Fortunately for us, it is all but dead now. So when we view this, we somehow have to appropriate a different world. Its not simpler, what's happened is that the things we simplify have moved.This is a good lesson in noir, which is the form that flowed into the hole left when the simple stage play was blown away by the storms of an evolving audience. Compare this to "African Queen" which has many of the same sensibilities, personalities and weaknesses. But it has fully abandoned both the reliance on theater conventions and the reliance on a stage.The emotional pull is on the US appreciation for the silent war hero who helped rid the world of large evils through merely their natural (American) goodnesses.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.</fullReview>
