		<fullReview>I really loved the movie's revolutionary Graphics, sometimes it doesn't feel like CGI anymore.The story is a mature story, liked the twists and the darkness it.The action is incredible and the movie is full of it.The only downside is that the Japanse VA weren't lip-synced with the movie. As the movie seems lip-synced with the English version of it. But I am pretty sure that with the English VA cast the experience Will be even better. I am awaiting the Movie English release, will love to hear Sean Voice I give themovie a 10/10 Good job SE!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfect Fantasy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>&#x203b;I saw Japanese dub version.Uncompromised graphic makes you feel that the world is really exist.Combination of magical fantasy and 21st century earth is very simple to understand the world and people. So you can concentrate to enjoy the action and story. You don't have to have any knowledge of Final Fantasy game. Action sequence is EPIC! Warp action is very new and SUPER COOL! You never saw this kind of battle before. I believe that Hollywood is going to use this action idea in many hero movie within few years.Storyline is touching. Some Japanese audiences shed tears as I did. Every characters are so impressive and feel be detailed. It's not happy ending. But it makes you want to go to adventurous trip to save the world.Trailer is just an introduction. I strongly hope every fantasy movie fans have chance to watch this in big theater.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Kingsglaive" creates a gateway for fans and audience into its visually fantastic world, yet the muddled plot can be exhausting despite the effort to make it accessible.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's no denying the graphical barrage "Kingsglaive" constantly throws for nearly two hours is brazenly stunning. The vistas are absolutely marvelous, its characters look eerily lively and the fights are utterly unworldly. With all of these mighty productions, it's still vexed by occasional choppy pace and sporadic hop in screenplay.The story is delivered in a sci-fi fantasy realm. It's a very politically focused tale and it does try to deliver many subplots and characters, no doubt a foundation for the game's world and its splendor. The problem lies as it often skips from one scene abruptly without giving the audience much sense for the flow of time or the clarity of vital motivation. It's all dramatic in presentation, yet it can feel a bit muddled, more so since it's quite the lengthy showing.Characters are relatively well done, especially the ones with famous names. Usually the dubbing in English for such production looks jarring, but here Lena Headley's or Aaron Paul's voice is implemented properly. The lip sync is fine and there's a boon on having fantasy oriented voice for the cast. A minor flaw would be the dialogues or sound effect don't convey the sense of urgency at times, but it's mostly understandable.The visual ramps up as the battles progress. These are very hectic occurrences, the fast cut can leave audience wandering on what transpires on the screen since there are many effects and motions cramped into brief composition of scenes. However, when it retains the focus or follows the action, it is arguably one of the most eye-popping spectacles from animated movie.The sheer graphical prowess produces an entirely captivating world, even though it stumbles on overly complex narrative or overly fast editing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worth the wait</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let us be frank, for a moment. Square Enix had been in a funk for some time. It seemed as though their golden era was long gone, and in was mediocrity. Then the buzz began anew, and with the reworking of their most famous title, they also blew the dust off of FFXV. I am happy to see that they have done so, and to get everyone into a frenzy gave us a movie. Now, the critics aren't happy with the movie because they don't quite understand. They don't understand that we have been waiting for about a decade to see the swords that can move you from one place to another (funny enough I used tel word and it is telling me it is a prohibited word... What did that word ever do to you?) the crystal that protects all, and a little glimpse into the world of FFXV.To those who have waited, this was exactly what we wanted. The graphics, stunning. The music, breathtaking. I don't think a single person didn't let out a slight gasp as Somnus Nemorus (the track originally released with the original trailer) began to play in the background at the gala. You knew at that moment that the dark, grittiness we were promised would be delivered. The monsters were all noticeable: a behemoth, Crazy Eyes, a Ultros, and the mother of all monsters that anyone who has ever played Final Fantasy VII would immediately know as Diamond Weapon. Yeah. You know things are going down when you have Diamond Weapon unleashed in the middle of a city. So, yeah. I got my money's worth. I went in expecting exactly what I got. Was the story perfect? No, but it isn't supposed to be. It is a gateway into the world we have waited for, a way to whet our appetite and give us the strength to wait just a little longer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best animation for a full feature length movie to date.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Its very hard to look at this from my already biased view since i am a final fantasy fan, but hands down, this movie was incredible. The graphics had me so confused, i was unsure whether they were CG or if they were real people. Story was dark and the characters all had a strong presence on screen despite their short screen time.The soundtrack was also amazing,it really helped set the scenes and create a very powerful tension in all of the scenes and it really brought it home with the fights and the incredibly realistic world.Two minor flaws i found with the film with 1 being because i saw it in Japanese.Voice acting was superb in Japanese, but the acting was originally made for English Voice acting. It didn't ruin anything as i got used to it after the beginning and didn't notice it afterwards.The second one being Shaky cam. I understand it helps action scenes feel more intense, but for a CG film it made some of the action scenes hard to follow. Advent Children felt rather smooth in comparison, but it did not detract from the combat and if you blinked there are some things you could miss. All in all it was a awesome movie and even for my friends who know nothing about the universe could still sit and enjoy the film. It truly felt as if it were a fantasy based on reality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could have been better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had high expectations for the film given the fact that I am a fan of the long running Final Fantasy franchise.While it excelled in the graphic department with stunning visual that puts it on par with the works of Square Enix, the mediocre story eclipsed this momentary allure.Its unfocused plot is to blame for this. It featured a stereotypical "hunky hero saves the day" story line, with female characters as damsels in distress. The women in this testosterone-loaded film are depicted so weak that a bee sting could kill them.Curiously, this is a far cry from the appeal shown in the FFXV promotional material whereby the female lead, Lunafreya takes on a water elemental monster Leviathan on her own. In this film however, Lunafreya did not displayed any of such willpower. The film utilized her as a helpless plot device to justify the screen time for the male lead, Nyx.Another lamentable plot device is Crowe, Nyx's friend who was killed off before she was given substantial character development. Predictably, her death sets off a chain of reason that catapulted Nyx into action to save another helpless lady.Not even the top notched cast starring Sean Bean as voice actors can save this mess. The climactic fight scenes were a feast to the eyes, but it gets numb from watching it after a while.The suspense build up was just too late for the satisfying release of the battle between good guy vs bad guy in the finale.The graphic was spectacular, but the story wasn't. It is hard to develop attachment to the characters you are not fond of.Overall, this is a good effort from Square Enix, but let's face it, it is just am overjoyed 110 minutes of advertisement for the real gem: FFXV the game.I'm calling it out now, the Kingslaive characters seen in the film are unlikely to be referenced to in the real game. There cannot be two heroes in a game.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredibly Disappointed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off I a huge Final Fantasy fan with my favorite games being FFX and FF7. After watching this movie I am worried about FFXV. Based solely on this movie, I am considering waiting a week to buy FFXV to see it's true colors. For example, No Man's Sky was hyped to be an amazing and epic game, only to fail so badly that many players requested full refunds. The only thing I liked about this movie was the realistic looking CGI and imagery. I can't imagine how anyone other than a FF fanboy could even sit through this movie. I actually created an account just to make my first review, which is for this movie. I am just so incredibly disappointed that I felt I had to warn people not to watch it.There is no character or story development. It just throws you into a futuristic time with random characters and random people. It shows random scenes that don't make any sense relative to the "Story", you're forced to go along with the ride and accept all these random things going on. It talks about all these different things without explaining or giving backstory to them. There are scenes where characters die and they play sad emotional music in the background to try to make you feel sad, but I could not relate emotionally at all. I would feel more sad watching a random dog die in this movie over one of these characters. It completely fails trying to engage you into the story, half the time I was trying to figure out what the point of this movie even was. Halfway through the movie I was regretting even watching it, I even felt bad that I dedicated 2 hours to watch it. The ending was horrible, the main character defeats the main villain and all of the sudden the war ends and the princess is free to walk into the city and all is happy and well, I don't even know, it was so boring I was fighting to stay awake. Please don't spend $15 on this movie, because you can't get it back.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can't believe this turned out so badly.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First 12 minutes? exceptional really awesome fight sequence really setting the kind of universe you are dealing with and the technological level of the time and everything from thereon this is a huge downward slope.My main gripe with this film is that during the insomnia gets destroyed segment what the hell is going on again? There's no indication of who's fighting what anymore it's a huge demon slugfest with random titan monsters sparring across the levelled city, the last duel between the glaives captain and the protagonist is irrelevant who cares if the general dies? I sure didn't what relevance does that have, why does the princess and some random prince marrying matter at all when niflheim controls the entire world? What are the baddies motives? No indication given. Truly a feast for the eyes here and nothing more and it could have been a trillion times better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie introduction for the video game!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite reading some of the other reviews, I'd say Square Enix did an amazing job on this movie. As a Final Fantasy fan, I have a little bit of a bias, but I can understand where other people are coming from when they say that the plot was a bit lacking. I don't necessarily think it was lacking a it is a prequel introduction to the video game, I just believe people wanted a bit more out of the story, but did not realize that the continuation lies within the video game and that the story isn't finished yet. Final Fantasy as always has been on point with its CGI animation and leaves you wanting more. I believe this is one of the best CGI film to date when comparing the Warcraft movie as its competition. Final Fantasy I can definitely say for sure, they did a good job when transitioning scenes through the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't expect the story to go really deep for an animated movie. It dared go into politics and plot twist which animated movies seems to avoid. 10/10 for Plot.Pacing was OK, long introduction but it helped us get the background story.One thing I didn't like was the shaky cam + dark (as in night) scenes. It makes action hard to follow and you just almost only see the sparks.I was already excited for the game but the movie got me even more excited.Kingsglaive &gt; Warcraft.Warcraft is good but Kingslaive is 10x better and more relate-able.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Square Enix and Stage 6 managed to make this movie Standalone and provided an excellent story for newcomers and fans of the game alike!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm going to keep this short because it's better that you read this quickly and go see the movie as soon as possible. Like me, if you've been waiting 10 years for FFXV, then this movie is obviously just as important to watch, along with the anime. Now the movie itself, holy f***ing s**t the cgi and animation is phenomenal. I have to say these guys at Stage 6 really raised the bar when it comes to the photo-realism and the motion capture aspect. All actors did a wonderful job and the voice acting was excellent, well for the important characters anyway. The story takes place during the game so you can watch this before or after you play, same thing applies with the anime. This gives a lot of people a chance to get into the FFXV universe and in my opinion this is how you do marketing right. The movie exceeded all of my expectations and I cannot wait for the games release. It was delayed and that's going to sting a little, but hey if you waited 10 years, 2-3 more months won't bother you. Seriously though, fan or not go see this movie, download it or buy the bluray, it's going to be worth the watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lost opportunity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are many positive things about this movie. Graphically the movie is really great. Sometimes you catch a character in the right light and you think it's live action, or the facial expressions will be spot on. The voice acting is also really well done with the main characters being voiced by some great and recognizable actors. They had amazing composers for the music, as anything Final Fantasy related tends to have some of the best composed music in the industry.The movie fails in the writing department, however. I titled this review as a lost opportunity. The opportunity was to tell a good story as a prequel to the next game and accomplish some world building. In this they failed. They decided that world building was the only reason for the movies existence. This means the story they could have told is not there. They opted instead to write boring characters with lousy motivation. They decided to tell a long drawn out story that is essentially boring that is punctuated at parts with good writing or is at least fun to watch. They opted to set up the next game rather than write an interesting story that made me interested in the world and the characters therein. They opted for a poor conclusion that felt just plain disappointing.The most egregious thing the movie did, however, was make me less interested in the next game. I don't think this was the intended reaction they were going for.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A step up from Square-Enix</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Initially I came into this film with certain concerns and worries that it would follow the same 2-Dimensional trajectory as Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children - A movie with a lack of plot points, designed to branch out the franchise with some cool CGI cinematic sequences and showcase a higher class of action sequences. Although the film didn't disappoint in the cinematic action sequences and CGI department I was pleasantly surprised to see a convincing, relate-able and most importantly understandable plot; meanwhile becoming emotionally attached to characters throughout this one hour and 50 minute journey.As far as voice acting is concerned Sean Bean and Aaron Paul gave exceptional performances and were very well cast, Lena Hedley not only performed well for her character role of Lunafreya Nox Fleurt but also narrates various parts of the movie beautifully. The soundtrack for the movie was excellent, as is standard for the series and even incorporated some tracks and OST from the game trailers which is a real delight for any die hard fans out there.Storytelling in this movie really stands out, which is something the previous two Final Fantasy movies failed in. A brief history of the current affairs between the regions of Niflheim and Lucis is established as well as an actual motive for the cause. Some things aren't established within this movie; however as a prequel that is later to be expanded on a different platform I can understand the deliberate neglect for it. Lunafreya also has various redeeming qualities and avoids becoming your typical "Damsel-in-Distress" character we've seen throughout the years and is very likable throughout the film, as are many other minor characters that the movie succeeds in keeping relevant and redeeming.Die hard fans will also appreciate small Easter eggs within the film such as small references to chocobo's, Gil and even a small homage at the end of the film to the game's upcoming heroes.Cinematically nearly every scene is beautifully illustrated and nearly every landscape shot is breathtaking and memorable. Action scenes are very fast paced as well as incredibly intense and every character is given their own unique fighting style which allows every battle to come across as fresh and bound to have you on the edge of your seat.All in all this is a fantastic movie and you won't need a Phd in Final Fantasy to understand the plot or enjoy any other aspect of the film. The film is a prequel to a game that expands on a few loose ends on a secondary platform and should be treated as such, go in with an open mind and you'll come out with a blown one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Refreshing!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just to point out I have not played nor knew anything about the Final Fantasy universe, yet I have been looking forward to Kingsglaive and what can I say... It did not disappoint.The CGI is jaw-dropping even though it takes a minute or so to get used to, since it's still not perfect. The English lip sync as well as the voice acting was exceptionally well done.(10/10) The characters were plausible and detailed, each and every one of them had their own motive, except the Empire, now this may be because I lack knowledge of the games but their goal and motive is a mystery to me, the statements they make and their actions are contradictory.The plot in and of itself is predictable, though it has some really surprising (sometimes unnecessarily sudden) twists.The fight scenes' choreography was well thought out, they were tense and really showed off both sides' unique fight style and made them look evenly powerful.Overall I really enjoyed the movie it is creative and a must watch if you are a fan of Final Fantasy or just want a beautiful new fantasy experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After starting with a fairly clunky prologue with the obligatory voice-over-- which I told myself to endure, since Kingsglaive: Final Fantasy XV is obviously not some stand-alone/origin story-- my jaw just kept dropping throughout the movie... until I picked it after the final credits (with the somewhat tongue-in-cheek easter egg).That the script steep in Final Fantasy lore, with its huge cast of characters and no end of plot-twists, could stay so clear and connected means it must have been worked over at least 10 times more than Blizzard's Warcraft movie.... And viewers (especially on repeated viewings) will probably thank the Japanese writer for trusting the audience to follow the main thrust of the story (and for trusting the voice and motion-capture actors to deliver), instead of stuffing with tendentious exposition or character moments (how many different ways do we want to see Marth Stewart's or Uncle Ben's death?).And despite all the western voice actors, 3D models and high fantasy tropes-- this is Asian 3D film-making at its best, with animation studios from Shanghai to Thailand being led by a Japanese production team that clearly worked with a lot of budget/time constraints but also a very, very firm vision. The details, close-ups and slow-mos are only there when there is an action or dramatic beat to be hit and never felt gratuitous (hint to Zack Snyder: it's about how much weight, not clutter, you can put into a scene/sequence-- take it from Superman'78)For a movie primarily designed as advertisement/periphery for the Final Fantasy franchise, I can pay it no higher compliment than saying-- this is the way sequel baiting should be done! It may not have anything truly new/original to say or show-- but as one of the few frenetic fantasy action movies that actually manages its diverging/ converging plot-lines and action-sequences rather well (vs say, the live-action Transformers movies), it was just a pleasure to sit through (&amp; try catching up with everything!).TL;DR: Would watch again! Recommended to genre-fans as one of the few truly uncompromising genre-film (hence the positive word-of-mouth in Japan vs general/mainstream movie-goers).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't watch the game play the game.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wanted to like it but I found it weak. The animation was of course spectacular that was a given. It was some of the best animation I've seen, with the most detailed character design, absolutely mind blowing. It's the same issue I have with Final Fantasy: the Spirits Within. The film's animation was great but I got very little from the story and found the characters far two dimensional. The story may work if your playing it as a game not just watching it.I can only imagine if I were a true die hard Final Fantasy fan, other than just someone vaguely familiar with the games, that I would like the movie just a little more, maybe being able to point out the trivia would get me excited.As a movie, there is a lot of amazing action sequences, like this cool war sequence at the beginning of the film, The heroes of the film do this thing where they toss their swords at something then teleport themselves to the place the blade is, kick ass.The only problem is, getting to these action packed parts means having to bare though a poorly produce plot that's easy enough to follow, but hard to get into. It was a series of characters that I could not get into.Not even with the voice talents of Arron Paul and Sean Bean could I gather enough emotion to give a crap about anyone or anything in this movie. May have been a better movie if it was just one big action sequence.http://cinemagardens.com</fullReview>

Plus the voice actors they did it very well. the CGI and Animation is almost perfect. there are times that you will think if they are real people or just a CGI.

		<fullReview>Love Final Fantsy, and THIS was a MUST SEE movie for me. Unfortunately, this film adopted "bad movie" principles... bad acting, slow story, and anti-climactic scenes. Everything that makes a film a drag. There was definitely "FIGHT" to this film, sorry to say that the fight consisted of me trying not to doze off. This film does receive some credit for the attention to detail, like hair and landscape though, but it definitely took me back to 2001's "FF: The Spirits Within" and that's not a good thing. Square Enix is so much better than this movie. This average jo was very disappointed, and KINGSGLAIVE is a BUST! Consider yourself "REVIEWED".</fullReview>
