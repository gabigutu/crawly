		<shortDescription>Well balanced movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>W.T.F. is a movie which tries to belong in too many genres simultaneously, including Comedy, Drama, Romance, War, Action, Documentary, and has a statement to make about pretty much everything including long-distance relationships, politics, professionalism, cultural differences etc. etc.Without excelling in any of that, it manages to be a well balanced movie in the 110 minutes of its duration.Tina Fey plays Kim Barker, a real person and an actual journalist, who is dissatisfying from her career covering low profile stories, and decides to go to Afghanistan as a war correspondent for a few months, or so she thought...The movie has a good structure. It starts as a comedy, something you might expect because of the main actress, but soon the situations become real and more dramatic.The rest of the cast includes well known actors like Alfred Molina, Billy Bob Thornton, Martin Freeman and Margot Robbie.Overall: Don't expect a comedy because of Tina Fey. It starts like that but it evolves to other genres really quick. It might not be a great movie but it's not boring and you get something out of the inner journey of the protagonist. How easy is to feel unnatural situations as normal when you are a long way from home...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strong Satirical look at the Afghanistan conflict</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the reasons that I write reviews of movies is that I hope to turn people on to good movies that might otherwise fly under their radar.Such is my hope with Tina Fey's latest film WHISKEY TANGO FOXTROT - a satirical view of the conflict in Afghanistan as seen through the eyes of a novice International reporter (Fey). What starts out as a funny and corny "fish out of water" movie, slowly morphs into a more serious film about the addictive nature of constantly being in a warzone situation.Fey is perfectly cast as the central character - war correspondent Kim Baker - who heads to an overseas assignment in Afghanistan to escape a rather humdrum life. I was a little nervous, at first, as all the funny parts that were in the trailer were in the first 1/2 hour of this film - and Fey handles those with aplomb. She is a gifted comedienne, so these scenes looked effortless for her. It is her transition to a more serious reporter, addicted to the adrenaline of her job that Fey really shines. I was impressed with her serious work in THIS IS WHERE I LEAVE YOU and was anxious when it looked like her career regressed with last December's SISTERS, but I'm happy to say she continues to grow as an actress and she is strong in this part.But, this movie is more than just Fey. She has a very strong supporting cast around her - Martin Freeman as an Irish photographer, Margot Robbie (who continues to grow as an actress) as a friend/journalist competitor to Fey, Alfred Molina as an Afghanistan politician and newcomer (at least to me) Christoper Abbott as Fey's interpreter - they all bring something interesting to the table that helps this movie along.Special mention should be made of Billy Bob Thornton's General Hollander - the US Commander in the region. While he does not have many scenes in the movie, he brings a presence that is heads and shoulders above everyone else when he is on screen. This fits well in this movie, for the Commanding General in that region should be heads and shoulders above the rest. He also gave me the best laugh in this movie (a joke I will not spoil here).This movie is much, much more than a simple rom-com or military comedy, it is a Comedy/Drama that brings quite a bit of heart to it. I would strongly encourage you to seek this one out, you'll be glad you did.8 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to Bank (of Marquis)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>WTF, shouldered by Tina Fay, is NOT a comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Whiskey Tango Foxtrot" (2016 release; 111 min.) brings the story ("Based on a True Story" we are reminded) of Kim Baker (played by Tina Fay.. As the movie opens, we see Baker in a heated argument with an Afghani man. Then we go "Two Years Earlier", where Baker, looking miserable, is in a team meeting for some news outfit. When told that there is a shortage of TV journalists in Afghanistan, Baker does not hesitate, and she volunteers, supposedly for a three month assignment. Next thing, we see Baker arrive at the Kabul Airport. At this point we are at most 10 minutes into the movie but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this movie is the big screen adaptation of the book "The Taliban Shuffle: Strange Days in Afghanistan and Pakistan" by real-life TV reporter Kim Barker (not sure why in the movie the names becomes "Baker"). The movie is the latest for directing team Glenn Ficarra and John Requa, who previously brought us "Crazy Stupid Love" and "Focus", among others. Here, they, along with producers Lorne "SNL" Michaels and Tina Fay herself, try to give us a glimpse of what it was like for an inexperienced journalist to come to Afghanistan in 2003 and report on the war. The early past of the movie shows us how Baker is adjusting to her new environment, and what a shock to the system it is indeed. Along the way we get to know fellow journalist Tanya Vanderpoel, (played by up-and-coming Australian actress Margot Robbie who also was in "Focus"). But the movie really takes off in the second hour (no worries, I won't spoil). Incredibly, Google Movie Times bills this as a 'comedy', and IMDb categorizes it as "Comedy, War". Please note: this is NOT a comedy. If you are going to see this, expecting many laugh-out-loud moments as only Tina Fey the comedian can bring them you are going to be sorely disappointed and let down. Sure, there are a few good chuckles early on as Baker/Fey adjusts to life in Afghanistan, but that's it. "Whiskey Tango Foxtrot" is a journalistic war drama, period. Not sure whether it is the producers or the studio who are pushing this as a 'comedy' but that is a grave mistake. Besides Fey and Robbie, there are many other fine performances, including Billy Bob Thornton in a small role as a Marine Corps General. Last but bot least, there is a lot of great music in the film, including the original score, courtesy of Nick "DeVotchKa" Urata, and also a bunch of song placements, such as Radiohead's "Nude", the National's "Green Gloves" and Harry Nillson's "Without You", which I will never listen to the same way again, seeing how it was used in this movie. Bottom line: "Whiskey Tango Foxtrot" is a fine movie, shouldered by Tina Fey NOT being funny."Whiskey Tango Foxtrot" was released nationwide this weekend. The Sunday matinée screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was not attended well, I am sad to report. Apparently it underperformed elsewhere too, grossing only $7 million, far below expectations. That is a darn shame. I blame both the (intentional or not) mislabeling of this as a 'comedy' when it is nothing near that, and/or fatigue among US audiences on seeing movies about the wars in Afghanistan or Iraq. Regardless, I enjoyed "Whiskey Tango Foxtrot" a lot for what it is (journalistic war drama). If you have a chance to catch this, be it in theaters, on Amazon Instant Video or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, I strongly encourage you to do so as this movie deserves a bigger audience. "Whiskey Tango Foxtrot" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tina Fey may Strike Gold in 2017!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've just returned home from watching "Whiskey Tango Foxtrot." I don't know how to begin to explain how intelligent, perfectly paced, unpredictable and spot-on the film is. They got everything right.Tina Fey as "Kim Baker" deserves an Oscar. This is by far her best performance yet, but as with anything Tina Fey is attached to, you'll see nothing but excellence. She is stunningly brilliant in her journey from utterly green, sheltered, cube farming news writer to seasoned, battered, weary war correspondent. Martin Freeman was equally captivating as Scottish correspondent "Iain MacKelpie." His journey from jaded journalist to the realization that this life, as "Kim" says, "isn't normal", is just as engaging.The supporting characters fully flesh out their roles becoming very real characters that you know and understand, especially Christopher Abbott as "Fahim Ahmadzai," the driver. His farewell scene with Ms. Fey was beautifully touching and at the same time respectful of the cultural divide between US and Afgan etiquette. Evan Jonigkeit won the end of the film with his explanation of his own journey through losing his legs. "You embrace the suck; you move the f*ck forward." Oorah, Sir. Do not go into this film expecting a comedy. This is a dramatic portrayal of life as a war correspondent, with intelligent humor sprinkled throughout in equal measure to moments of terror. It hits every nerve and every note. It's extraordinary all around.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the few movies I've paid full price for and didn't regret</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a fan of 30 Rock and The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, so when Tina Fey's name was attached to this movie I knew I wanted to see it. More than that, knowing it was based on the memoirs of female war correspondent meant I probably would have seen it anyway. I want to read the book.I've read the reviews here and agree with the many insightful positive comments on the movie. There isn't much need to go into them in detail, so I'll summarize what I liked most:A chance to see what it's really like to be an embedded journalist in a war zone, including the partying, but also the more realistic aspects, such as dealing with network executives responding to public indifference. I liked the focus on career rivalry/friendship between the two women. As many other women, including Fey herself, have observed, usually women are portrayed either as romantic rivals or enemies, while good looking women especially are portrayed as empty headed or mean, and marriage or man obsessed.I liked the movie's emphasis on career as a source of satisfaction and growth. The movie has been criticized because it allows Fey's character a romantic/sexual interest. Somehow that ruins the movie's "integrity" as a feminist story for some. Why aren't career women allowed boyfriends? It felt more true to life than the type of rom-com relationship women are usually allowed; either a one-night stand (that results in hilarious pregnancy) or a happily ever after. The real triumph was her success at the end, which by the way neatly turned the tables on the "damsel in distress" story. I loved it and it was worth seeing for that alone. It's worth taking your tween or princess obsessed daughter (who is old enough for mature content) to see.I enjoyed seeing Fey get a chance to grow as an actress, especially a 40-something one. They don't take her too far into drama or tragedy territory; just enough.The movie has gotten some criticism for using a Western actor, Christian Abbot, to play an Afghan role, her translator and fixer. I went in prepared to dislike that. However, I could see that they chose to cast an actor with the range and depth they needed, rather than the ethnicity. It works. The scene where he tells her why he no longer wants to drive for her broke my heart. It was so sweet and his Fahim had so much depth. So, all the things I liked. Here is the one thing I had a problem with: The portrayal, or lack thereof, of Afghan women. This probably reflects the book, which I haven't read. At the same time, they added other aspects that weren't in the book. A real missed opportunity comes when Kim is asked into a room full of village women. They take off their veils. The camera stands behind them. We never see their faces. This could have humanized these women in one shot and we miss it. She comes out later to report what they told her, but we never hear them speak. It was a real disappointment. If any group of people needed a voice in this story, it was the women of Afghanistan.But anyway, see it. I did, and I'm sure I'll watch it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Movie About Women in War Since Fort Bliss</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, so Tina Fey isn't actually a soldier, but she's not the horny bimbo who gets busy with George Clooney in Three Kings either. Its now clear that Tina Fey is one of the most multi-talented people in the entertainment world, and this movie will go far toward solidifying her reputation as a broad gauge polymath. Aside from everything else, its clear she's a wonderful actor, and interestingly enough all the really strong central characters in this movie are indeed women (as Tina ruefully laments that she should have googled one particular character.) Don't worry, there's plenty of blood and guts, bad language, and techno porn for the teen-aged boys (why on earth would anybody come to a R rated movie with WTF as the title and give it a bad review for being shocked by language, sex, and violence. Don't however, expect Margot Robbie or anyone else to replay Margot's Wolf of Wall Street shenanigans.) Even the Anglo actors playing indigini (as we called the locals in Viet nam) are wonderful. Well worth seeing, worth owning.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Film, But The Sexual Content And The Bad Language Are Unnecessary!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dissatisfied with the state of her career covering low-profile stories, television journalist Kim Baker (Tina Fey) agrees to take a short assignment as a war correspondent in Afghanistan during Operation Enduring Freedom, to the disappointment of her boyfriend, who also spends a lot of time traveling. Assigned low-budget living quarters with other international journalists, she begins friendships with noted Australian correspondent Tanya Vanderpoel (Margot Robbie) and openly lecherous Scottish freelance photographer Iain MacKelpie (Martin Freeman). After a period of adjustment aided by her Afghan "fixer" Fahim Ahmadzai (Christopher Abbott), she begins taking well to the assignment, eliciting frank remarks on camera from soldiers questioning the value of their assignment there, and putting herself in harm's way to capture combat incidents on video. American Marines commander General Hollanek (Billy Bob Thornton) takes a dim view of her, as an inexperienced nuisance.Despite the danger, Kim stays in Afghanistan for months, then years beyond her original assignment. She catches her boyfriend unprepared with a middle-of-the-night video call, and finds him with another woman, ending their relationship. Against her better judgment, she begins a sexual relationship with Iain, which over time also develops into a more personal one. Although her status as a woman presents challenges in a society which places restrictive roles on women, she also uses it to her advantage, gaining access to women in a village who explain that they've been sabotaging the US-built well because they welcome the daily walk to the river away from the men, and recklessly carrying a camera under a burqa to record a religious demonstration. She also walks a tightrope, taking advantage of the thinly-veiled sexual interest of Afghan government figure Ali Massoud Sadiq (Alfred Molina) to use him as a source. Fahim ? who treated opium addicts before the war ? cautions her, pointing out that danger can be like a drug.Despite their mutual friendliness, Kim remains in competition with other journalists for stories and for resources from their employers back home. Kim flies to New York to argue for more support from her network's new boss, only to discover that Tanya is slated to take over from her. Meanwhile, Iain is kidnapped for ransom while traveling cross-country to cover a developing story that Kim had been working on. Kim returns "home" to Afghanistan, where she blackmails her "friend" Ali for information about Iain's whereabouts, and impresses upon Gen. Hollanek the political value to him of rescuing Iain. The mission ? accompanied by Kim's cameraman ? is a success, both militarily and journalisticly. But Kim begins to see the danger that she is putting herself in, bids farewell to her colleagues and to Fahim, and returns to the U.S. to stay.After returning, she looks up a soldier (Evan Jonigkeit) who was transferred because of his on-camera comments to her, and subsequently lost both of his legs to an IED. She tries to apologize for the consequences of her actions, but he refuses to let her take the blame. She moves on to an on-camera desk job, where she later finds herself interviewing Iain, who is going to be in New York soon, and invites her to meet him for a drink.Rated R For The Sexual Content, Bad Language And Violent War Images.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From the Book: The Taliban Shuffle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is totally worth a prime-time ticket and a big popcorn. Then get the DVD to show it to friends. No scenery/FX worth a BluRay. Some folks question changing the excellent title of the book on which it is based to: WHISKEY, TANGO, FOXTROT. That phrase may not be as well known as what it translates to ("What The Fsck,") but wondering-then-figuring-it-out does get attention. The sales cycle Attention/Interest/Desire/Action is thus well served.I suspect that "Foxtrot/Fsck" in a movie title with Margot Robbie's character admitting she knows she's a "15" in AfPak and then "usin' it" in the trailers, sets an expectation that we'll see at least as much of her as we did in say, "The Big Short" or "Wolf of Wallstreet" and that sells tickets. Ms. Robbie has a lot of well deserved "body confidence," which by itself did not sell me a ticket - but it didn't hurt either.Co-Producer Fey wants to tell tickets, yes, but she has told us a story and she wants us to see it. A 5-star business decision, say I. The movie shows what happens when you mix a stone-age culture with modern weapons from the POV of a New York Girl/Journalist. Neither book or movie have suggestions on what to do about AfPac. It does however help us understand what "The Graveyard of Empires" is all about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Has soul</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am impressed. This is one of the few films which has inspired me to read the source material; the autobiography by the journalist Kim Baker..The film starts with comic moments as greenhorn middle-America Kim Baker (Tina Fey) arrives in a war zone. Then, the film darkens as it touches on the corruption of the expatriate community and the seduction of war reporting.Surprisingly, Tina Fey can act in a dramatic role. Being comic with a straight face, facing danger, fending off romeos, and falling in love. In the end, Kim Baker rediscovers herself and returns home.The film deals superficially with the horror faced by Afghan civilians and the root causes of the insurgency. However, this is the story of a white woman in a foreign land.Overall, the film was predictable but lightly touches the soul. Credit to the editor for walking the difficult line between entertainment and horror. The rest of the cast did a creditable job.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nearly Flawless, 9 out of 10 for Tina Fey and Lorne Michaels</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow. If I wasn't already a fan of Saturday Night Live's Tina Fey, I sure am now. The same barbed wit is evident throughout Whiskey, Tengo Foxtrot (military acronym for What the F***), but this isn't a skit. Tina Fey portrays a nuanced character, a low level employee of a network news department who makes an impulsive career move and ends up as a war correspondent in Afghanistan. Doesn't sound entertaining? It probably wouldn't be without the amazing touch Fey puts on her character. While it's not a war movie, it certainly captures the hopelessness of a culture doomed to perpetual war in the arm pit of the world. Afghanistan ultimately gets dismissed as a place undeserving of American military support, or even interest. The people shoot each other and blow each other up in conflict over interpretations of their medieval religion, and the movie correctly concludes "who cares"? But the Americans and individual Afghanis touch each others lives in ways that transcend cynicism. Fey and her Saturday Night Live co-producer Lorne Michaels find humor and humanity in ways that make you root for all the characters. The movie has no dull moments, and the pacing keeps you in your seat. Like Afghanistan itself, there were potential landmines of preachiness, boring politics and hopelessness...and WTF avoids them all. There are subtle, brilliant, and stereotype breaking supporting roles by Billy Bob Thornton, Alfred Molina, (Spiderman 2), Margot Robbie (Wolf of Wall Street) and Martin Freeman (whose correspondent character is as far from Bilbo Baggins as Kabul is from New York.) Three cheers for Tina Fey, who manages to give us entertainment and a smile while showing us how lucky we are to be Americans. WTF could have been boring and preachy, and instead gives us a feel good movie from the most unlikely place on earth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tina Fey shines and surpasses her "next-door girl" cliché</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A real gem of a film that you shouldn't miss. I saw the trailer and immediately felt the need to see though I had my reservations about Tina Fey in a black comedy/drama film. Guess what! Tina surprised me with her performance (not acting-wise, but presence-wise). I know this doesn't make any sense, but picture an actress shining in a movie without an over the top performance, not an easy job to do. Whether Tina has grown to be great at many genres OR the movie was simply destined for her real life character.The story-telling and events flow like nobody's business and the representation of Afghan People in the movie is beyond great. The movie balances between realistic approaches and the mainstream Hollywood agendas.I really recommend this film to all kinds of viewers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not sure I've seen a military comedy since Sgt. Bilko. Or maybe it was Operation Dumbo Drop. Nonetheless, this is a post-9/11 world. We just don't have the same levity with war like we used to. Especially when it comes to the war in Afghanistan. It's just something we don't do. But maybe it's time. Apparently it's time.And who better for the role than Tina Fey? She plays Kim Baker, an American war correspondent who is sent to Afghanistan for a few months. A few months turn into a few years and she becomes an expert on everything Middle East. But as her life back in the states fades further into the past, she's realizing that Afghanistan is now her new home. We see her make this transition. It's one that's subtle, but felt by the end.Fey is perfect for the lead. I honestly can't imagine anyone else who can just be as funny without being over-the-top and unrealistic. She gives us her same quirky and witty humor, but the film carries a much darker David Fincher-type of tone.The jokes are never rapid fire, but always well-deserved. It makes the film more real. And that realistic tone places us in the mindset of the characters a bit easier.Not too much about this film is cliché. Predictable, maybe, but not really cliché. Perhaps you can credit the source material which it's adapted from--an autobiographical novel entitled The Taliban Shuffle.What I'm most impressed with is the balance of genre. Although it's a military comedy, it never feels like the film is pushing or pulling for one or the other. It's symbiotically both.There's nothing obviously wrong with this film, in my opinion. I guess it may have failed to solve that "so what?" question for me, but it's still an entertaining watch. Maybe not one I would want to necessarily own on DVD. But that's not to say I wouldn't watch it again.Twizard Rating: 84</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here's the story of a female war correspondent covering the war in Afghanistan when there wasn't much interest in the war in Afghanistan. It is produced by Tina Fey which explains how she got herself to play the lead in a not pure comedy. Tina Fey doesn't work to hard and doesn't break a sweat even in the dessert. Billy Bob Thornton seems uncomfortable but not nearly as distracting as Alfred Molina who looked like he was auditioning for a role in "Fiddler on the Roof". It was a bad audition.There is plenty of drinking, drugs and swearing. If you are expecting a laugh a minute Tina Fey movie, this isn't it. If you want to be taken where you will never go, this is an interesting journey. There's a good use of extensive period music.The movie doesn't need a big screen and will play well on home platforms. The language and violence my cause you to give up in the first thirty minutes but it eventually hits its stride and it is worth your time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After reading some of the tepid reviews for this film, plus not really being a Tina Fey fan, I have to say I was pleasantly surprised with this movie. It's based on the book by network correspondent Kim Barker, which chronicled her experiences covering the war in Afghanistan, from 2003 to 2006.Fey's portrayal of Barker is the best performance I can recall of hers in any of her films. She also has a top notch cast with her including the likes of Martin Freeman, Margot Robbie, Billy Bob Thornton, Alfred Molina, and Christoper Abbott.Although the circumstances of the movie are deadly serious, there is quite a lot of well placed humor in the film, especially in the first half. To note, there is also tons of explicit and very raw language throughout.Robert Carlock provides a sharp script here, and the film is well directed by the team of Glenn Ficarra and John Raqua.All in all, I was reluctant to even view this movie, and although it has some rough spots, I ended up liking it quite a bit and would recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Good Showcase For Tina Fey's Acting Range. Don't Be Fooled By The Trailers Though, It's Not A Straight Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't imagine it was easy to make this movie. Finding laughs while people are blowing up and dying is a tough task. Wartime comedies have been done before and some have been successful. But finding the balance between truly showing what's going on in modern warfare and finding enough stuff in those situations to be funny must have been difficult. The trailers for Whiskey Tango Foxtrot looked like it could be pretty good. Tina Fey is one of the funniest comediennes working today and this looked like it could be the vehicle to put her over the top. I'll confirm that this should be the role that vaults her up but it's not the movie it's been advertised as.*Minor Spoilers Ahead* The film opens in 2006 Afghanistan during a raging house party. Our lead character is Kim Baker (Tina Fey) and like everyone else she's drinking and dancing through the night. A bomb hits a nearby neighbourhood and the whole party springs into action. You see them sprinting to get their press passes and organize their camera crews. We then see Kim at the site trying to talk to her superiors back in New York. Even with the chaos around her, she seems in her element but has to cuss out a guy who sexually harasses her.We then flashback to 2003 in New York City where Kim is working a desk job, writing articles on how specific food products are silent killers (it's obvious that the story is crap and she knows it). Her boss calls a meeting and tells the participants that they need people to go cover the war in Afghanistan. They would get to be on camera as war correspondents and get to see things first hand. This might have been exciting but the editor specifically chose all these people because they don't have families or many prospects going forward, one woman even starts crying. The original tour is supposed to be for 3 months. Kim deliberates it for a while, gets permission to go from her boyfriend and sets out for Afghanistan.I mentioned in the summary that the trailers are misleading and I would like to explain that here. The trailers for Whiskey Tango Foxtrot make the movie look like a r rated comedy with some drama sprinkled in. That's not what this movie is. I describe it more as equal parts drama and comedy. The movie does both well at points but not perfectly throughout. You can't help but laugh when we find out why a specific well in a town keeps getting destroyed over and over again (not for the reasons you would suspect) or feel for the character Fahim (her appointed fixer, Christoper Abbott) when Kim's dangerous antics almost get him killed. I found the beginning to be a little dry and the ending to be a little sappy but it's to the movie's credit that they keep you interested. Especially when in another movie Kim would be pretty annoying (jeopardizing both herself and other people to find some excitement in her life). It took a little while to get used to the pace and the tone of the movie but after I settled in, the movie was pretty involving and I enjoyed it.As much as this is the story of this brave woman this is a chance for Tina Fey to show what she can do. She's always been funny but there are points where WTF calls for her to be emotional and she handles them very well. I don't think it's an award worthy performance but this is an impressive job nonetheless and so much of this film is on her to make it engaging and she shines. The rest of the cast are very good in their supporting roles. I was surprised that the biggest supporting performance came from Martin Freeman and not Margot Robbie. Martin was great, he's got a well written character here and the relationship between Iain and Kim is fun to watch. Margot was good (that's no surprise), I think the interesting thing with her here is that this movie shows that she doesn't have to rely on her looks, she's got comedic chops and she gets some good laughs playing off of Tina Fey. Christopher Abbott and Billy Bob Thorton are excellent in their parts. I don't think Alfred Molina was bad here but his character seems to come in for an important scene and then vanish only to reappear later. His performance is consistent but his character will show up and I was wondering why was he involved there? Or is he coming back? I think you get a better understanding of his character in the end.After the first 15 minutes of this movie, I was worried. I was having flashbacks to Eat Pray Love (which I really didn't like) and I thought it was going to be a drama pretending to be a comedy, asking us to sympathize with this woman who wasn't sympathetic (the movie even calls her out on it, when she describes her story at a party, one of the other people calls it the most American white lady story they ever heard). But the story got moving and I got more and more into it. The characters in this movie are written well, they are all at least remotely believable and the story of this woman who becomes addicted to the rush that goes hand in hand with this style of journalism is interesting. It can be a little insensitive to specific groups at points though so come prepared. It's too bad it's going to get bounced from theatres so quickly. The ending started to moonwalk into being cheesy but I still found Whiskey Tango Foxtrot to be a solid movie. It'll hopefully get Tina Fey more varied roles and bring some more attention to the conflict in Afghanistan, which has largely been cast aside for more recent conflicts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fey is the film's biggest distraction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's getting close to the point where we need to put a moratorium on Tina Fey playing Tina Fey. Don't get me wrong: Her creative energies are nowhere near exhausted (case in point: The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt). I'm referring here to the endless variations of Liz Lemmon: A career woman, often the smartest guy in the room, who's main internal conflict is how to rationalize herself as she enters middle age and the end of baby-making territory.As far as I can discern, Whiskey Tango Foxtrot and other films of hers like Baby Mama or Admissions are not projects close to Fey's heart but script creations of other people in which Fey happened to be cast because her career-woman-on-the-verge-of-becoming-a-spinster is striking some sort of demographic. In cases like this, Fey is the biggest distraction. It's like if Bob Hope was in the Hurt Locker: The presence of an established comic persona in a war film takes away the film's opportunity to surprise you with nuance.Still, the film deserves credit for being one of the few in recent years to inject levity into a war story and execute it relatively well. The film's efforts to capture the politics of war coverage fall flatter than the film's efforts to portray the distance between a war correspondent and an actual soldier.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like many others this summer I have spent a lot of time watching movies. I have seen most of the movies recently released and am a person who spends a good amount of his time watching a lot of movies. I've seen so many movies that I have become a harsh critic and am not easily impressed. Anyway to save you the long drawn out review that wastes away precious time, I just want to say that this movie really was pretty amazing. Hard to give any film a 10 of 10, but this one has to be close. Their combination of humor with a serious tone made for one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. If you're looking for a movie worth while this summer this is one to seriously consider.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Made me realize what exactly I wanted from two other, lesser quality films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I was watching "Whiskey Tango Foxtrot," the latest film by the directing team of Glenn Ficarra and John Requa ("Crazy, Stupid, Love," "Focus"), I began not only to further realize why I wasn't a fan of two similar films released in the past couple months, but also discern what exactly I was demanding from them. The films in question are the Coen Brothers' latest film "Hail, Caesar!," released last month and David Gordon Green's "Out Brand is Crisis," released back in November of 2015.Both films were noble efforts, but almost entirely misguided and rudimentary; despite limitless possibilities, both films felt confined to limited ideas. "Hail, Caesar!" was a parade of presumably expensive actors for basically cameo scenes and a whole lot of nothing going on and "Our Brand is Crisis" was a juvenile display of a serious story that significantly undermined the talent of Sandra Bullock and Billy Bob Thornton (also in "Whiskey Tango Foxtrot"). "Whiskey Tango Foxtrot," however, corrects a lot of the missteps those films made, as well as showing both films what they could've been had more care and attention been brought forth in the writing department. Here's a film, like the aforementioned two, featuring a slew of great actors, but delightfully merging comedy and drama to create consistent humor, affable character chemistry, and some considerably commendable pathos during the final act.The film revolves around Kim Baker (Tina Fey), a simple scriptwriter for Television news, who gets the opportunity to prove herself when she takes a job as a war correspondent in Afghanistan and Pakistan in 2003 during America's "Operation Enduring Freedom" mission. Planning to only stay three months, which turns into calling her base in Kubal "home" for several years, Kim develops a friendship with coworker/war journalist Tanya Vanderpoel (Margot Robbie), in addition to Marine Corps General Hollanek (Billy Bob Thornton), who leads the band of men Kim is following and interviewing.Screenwriter Robert Carlock (who wrote "30 Rock," also starring Fey) always seems to have a fairly loose grip on the film and its events, allowing the characters to essentially meander within their surroundings and create their own subplots. This feels very much like a "character-created" film, in a sense that there's a beautiful, natural presence to the events in "Whiskey Tango Foxtrot" that feels like it was created from the film's characters rather than a slew of overworked people behind the scenes.This sort of casual, believable environment makes the film that much more entertaining and believable, yet much of that is attributable to the wonderful Tina Fey. Once again, Fey proves herself as one of the funniest and most charming actresses of our time. Her conversational humor and simultaneous, almost perplexing, blend of self-deprecating humor and confidence show just how fearless of a comic presence she is. Also showing solid comedic timing is Margot Robbie, and when these two get in the same frame - which doesn't happen as often as I would've liked, unfortunately - they are a comedic dream-team, working off of one another in ways that you don't see too much, particularly from two female performers. Their chemistry, despite working for the same station, isn't competitive nor argumentative; it's simple, refreshingly so.When "Whiskey Tango Foxtrot" becomes more dramatic in the third act, it works to remind you that war isn't fun and games, despite this film making it all seem pretty lax and almost carefree. By the end, the real politics show their side, almost as if Carlock, Ficarra, and Requa are making the statement that war is inherently political, and while we can joke about it and propose our alleged "blindness" to racial and class politics, it'll always be there, waiting for us to address it. The politics, as one can expect, largely come in the form of what the news stations actually want us to see from the frontlines, sort of like "Nightcrawler" but not nearly as intense. In a strange way, it almost works to be the antithesis of Michael Bay's "13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi," a film that was just about as apolitical as you could get for a film about a seriously political event.However, "Whiskey Tango Foxtrot" is a thoroughly entertaining film; one that sneaks up on you with its smart writing and bears performances and direction that you grow to respect throughout the film. It plays almost like "Our Brand is Crisis" might have had David Gordon Green actually written it and not just directed it. The only nudging thought in mind as the credits rolled was what the phrase "whiskey tango foxtrot" actually meant. A quick search on Urban Dictionary explained it's a largely meaningless term to substitute a vulgar expression. I'll advise you to do what my stupid self should've noticed by now; look at the first letter of each of the phrase's words.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tonally Inconsistent and Painfully Uneven</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A movie is only as good as how well the tone is established and kept. For Whiskey Tango Foxtrot (WTF), it's all over the place and inconsistent from the word go. So by the time the film gets interesting around the 3rd act, it's all but too late.WTF stars Tina Fey in a far more dramatic role than she's usually accustomed to, but even that couldn't stop her from throwing some Fey-isms in every now and then. Except, those punchlines I loved from Sisters (2015) don't work in a film that's trying to take Afghanistan conflict in the mid 2000's seriously. In fact, for a while I thought I was watching a version of one of Fey's SNL characters take on the war on terror.It's not all bad though. WTF has a pretty nifty cast which includes Margot Robbie, Martin Freeman, Billy Bob Thornton, Alfred Molina, and Christopher Abbott. The problem being that a few of them are way too over-the-top and goofy to be in a war drama. Thornton, who played a similar role in Our Brand is Crisis, never gets enough screen time to showcase his world class talent. Freeman and Molina, who are normally great, merely play two characters pining for love from Fey's character, Kim. I don't think there was a single scene which didn't included one of them asking for sex from her. A little more depth added to the supporting characters would have been nice. With that said, I really dug Abbott's performance as Kim's bodyguard and a moral conscience of sorts. He was the reason I stuck with this story all the way through.There are elements of this film that really work. For example, Kim interviews a soldier early on in the film, and although he doesn't have a major part in the film, you feel the emotional weight of that interview and character throughout. Unfortunately, scenes like that are overshadowed by an entire first act devoted to Kim partying with Margot Robbie and trying to simultaneously get over her American boyfriend and get laid. It's not what I was interested in seeing after popping in a film taking place at the heart of Afghanistan.Somewhere in this script there was a good story to tell, but what we got wasn't it at all. After a promising start with 'Crazy, Stupid, Love', Glenn Ficarra and John Requa take another step back after the so-so 'Focus' from 2015. Whiskey Tango Foxtrot is a bummer.+Christopher Abbott nailed it+Good dramatic premise in there somewhere-Wasted by an overabundance of untimely goofy comedy-First and second half are completely different-Male characters strictly looking for sex4.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't even know this movie existed until I saw the trailer for it at the cinemas but the trailer and Tina Fey instantly made me want to see this movie.I really like this movie. We've all seen war coverage repeatedly on TV but at the height of the wars, you never really thought about the reporters but this movie gives us a glimpse of that.There are funny moments throughout the film ? expected with Tina Fey ? but there are also some really tense moments, even to the point of yelling at the television.I've loved Tina Fey since Saturday Night Live and I absolutely loved seeing her in a serious film even if her character gets on your nerves at some points and happens to be the reason you want to yell at your screen.But Fey is just one among many of the amazing acting talents in this film including Billy Bob Thornton, Alfred Molina, Martin Freeman, Josh Charles and Cherry Jones. But Christopher Abbott as Fahim was one of the best parts of this film to the point where I think he actually steals the show in any scene he is in!While the film may have been filmed in Albuquerque and Morocco, the scenery and look of the film feels authentic as is the story telling.One of the things I didn't like about this film was how some characters would just disappear, most to never to appear again but I think that is mostly due to how the film is structured with telling the story in years.An awesome film with an awesome cast but one that I'm still not sure whether I would watch again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Earnest Film Barely Misses the Mark</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While Tina Fey is associated with comedy, she delivers a crisp and understated performance as a career journalist who accepts a dangerous reporting assignment in Afghanistan. The film traces her frustrating and often fruitless attempts to find newsworthy stories from the period from 2003-2006.One of the themes of the film is that the American commitment to war in Afghanistan took a backseat to other events unfolding concurrently in Iraq. But the film probes even deeper by exploring the utter futility of any significant war stories. The footage and reporting from the ground in Afghanistan is strictly insignificant interviews with the soldiers and a random explosion of a vehicle. Subtly, the film raises the question of what on earth are we doing in Afghanistan? The film would have been better if the people of Afghanistan had been portrayed in greater depth and humanity. Alfred Molina plays the oily Attorney General who attempts to seduce the female reporter. A twelve-year-old child is depicted with a shrewd business sense in making the journalist feel sorry for him and getting a hundred dollars. A group of women destroy the wells that the American Marines have saved. An elderly man genuinely confuses the Americans for the Soviets from 1978. Perhaps the most well-rounded character is the translator and guide, who recognizes the "addiction" of journalists who become desperate for advancing their careers.In the end. "Whiskey Tango Foxtrot" was a thoughtful film that sought to raise awareness about the stupidity of war in general and America's war in Afghanistan in particular.</fullReview>

It's probably weird thing to say but it just never was my cup of tea. Although I always knew that she has tons of natural talent and kinda shame that it didn't come thru in the right way. In this movie however she is just 10/10. The movie itself is a comedy of the reality in which she is in. And there are just some awesome and original short comedy sequences that I was just blow away by. I never write reviews actually but I just wanted to say well done Tina Fey and all the actors and directors, casting and crew. I really really liked this one. Hopefully more to come from Tina and hopefully she donsen't go back to the earlier stuff. She really deserves so much more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first impression was the reaction to the title abbreviation, and then I thought I saw Jody Foster on the poster, but surprised to find Tina Fey in the trailer. It is a great war-drama, filled with lots of fun and hard to believe it is a biography. This should be the best film for these directors till date. Amazing cast, but Tina Fey totally cracked it. This is one of the best films of the 2016.I have seen many Afghan war based films, but not quite fun as this one. It gives you a completely different take on the war torn Afghan. It was the story of an American journalist Kim, who was sent to their for the latest coverage. At first she struggles with the new place, then makes a few friends and finds comfortable despite security threat. The rest of the film reveals how her life, as well as career transforms with the experience of working in the dangerous environment.Apart from starring in it, Tina Fey produced it and this is her best film in the recent years. The first half was wonderful, then during in the middle I felt it lost its track, but it came back strongly to end. This tale focused mainly on the living-style of the reports in the hostile place, besides their tough jobs. The battle scenes were minimised and highlighted the journalism. So don't expect it to be another 'A Thousands Times Good Night', it is refreshing though. It is a well worth, so don't miss it!8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Whiskey Tango Foxtrot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whiskey Tango Foxtrot is the second film about North Americans trapped in the Middle East this year (after Rock the Kasbah). I imagine this is the logical progression of the cycle which started approximately 10 years ago in Hollywood: first, we had films which denounced George W. Bush's government; then, we had movies about the experiences lived by soldiers during the "war on terror"; and now, we have finally reached the truce/acceptation phase: a cautious opening of relationships in order to explore the similarities and differences between both cultures, with symbolic Western ambassadors who represent the average man (or woman), without weapons, but with some prejudices and many questions. In the case of Whiskey Tango Foxtrot, the questions are taken literally, because it's based on the real experiences from reporter Kim Barker (even though the character's surname is "Baker", the real reporter is "Barker"). And even though her mission in Afghanistan has good dramatic moments and deep reflections on the never-ending conflict, the diffuse structure of the film avoided me from feeling completely satisfied by it. I guess that Whisey Tango Foxtrot can be considered a "character study" on its most basic level, because it's focused on Baker's evolution, starting as an office worker and ending as an audacious combat veteran. Her change of attitude feels credible and sincere thanks to Tina Fey's solid performance and the relationships she builds with other eccentric persons trapped in similar circumstances, while learning new things about their setting or even themselves. Those characters are interesting, and they are well played by Margot Robbie, Christopher Abbott, Martin Freeman, Alfred Molina and Billy Bob Thornton; however, they are employed without too much order or harmony; they just enter or leave the scene according to the whims of the screenplay, without organically integrating themselves to the narrative. In conclusion, I liked Whiskey Tango Foxtrot scene by scene, but the whole ended up being less satisfactory than its individual parts. As for this cinematographic "truce" with Middle East... I still can't figure out where it's heading exactly. Maybe, Whiskey Tango Foxtrot should have focused on that, instead of displaying the best bars of Kabul. Anyway... I guess that will be valuable information for someone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A realistic movie showcasing the talents of Tina Fey</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A number of reviewers have criticized the sometimes coarse language in this film but given the pressures of working in war zones, the language is not out of line with reality. Reality is often coarse and so the film is a true reflection of living with constant stress and danger.What struck me most about the movie is how flawlessly Fey moves from comedian to dramatic actress. She is at once believable and deeply flawed but in the final scene, she does strongly once again resemble a certain character from SNL - whether by design or happenstance I don't know.This is a raw look at the middle east in general, Afghanistan in particular. It isn't pretty because the ongoing conflicts aren't pretty. Journalist occupy a strange place in the process - neither combatants or true civilians and Fey produces the role flawlessly as does the supporting cast.If I have any criticism, it's that the film was probably 30 minutes overtime. This type of story needs to be non-stop, smacking you in the face from one minute to the next. By not leaving enough on the cutting room floor, there are times when the viewer is allowed to catch their breath, take a bathroom break, pop up some more popcorn and not really miss anything.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An insulated take on the Middle East conflict</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whiskey Tango Foxtrot is a rather insulated take on the Middle East conflict. An American female journalist is given the opportunity to take the limelight as long as she is willing to cast caution to the wind and cover the war in the Middle East. That's the by line this film takes as a starting point but whats really obvious, from the get go, is this is an insulated take on the conflict that reflects the distancing between the reality of war as experienced by ordinary local people and the US take, on the conflict. Indeed, the clear impression is the journalist of the piece never really experiences what the war is, beyond the accommodating but clearly defined confines, imposed on her by her handlers, US backed local politicians and the US military. She even talks of returning to "reality"(life in the USA) and on the one occasion, when she is, inadvertently, confronted by the cold harsh realities of life as it is under US occupation,she almost looses control until she is rescued by her Scottish colleague. For me, Whiskey Tango Foxtrot offers up a predictably US centric take on the Middle East conflict. Its an entertaining, well acted flick and its an interesting one too. That said, for me, there appears to be little recognition of how much pain and misery this conflict has caused ordinary people in Afghanistan and elsewhere in the region. Sufficed to say, the truth is really not owned by anyone. Certainly not the US mainstream media. Six out of ten from me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ah, Whiskey Tango Foxtrot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is based upon a true storyJournalist Kim Baker (Tina Fey) becomes a war correspondent in Afghanistan.Whiskey, Tango, Foxtrot are codes for WTF. Now you know the real title of this movie. This goes along at a good clip as we see Kim imbedded with the US Marines under General Hollanek (Billy Bob Thornton) and she goes on missions with them and interviews them for the folks back in the states. We get to see the flavor of Afghanistan with crowded mud streets, many people smoking the hubbly-bubbly, lots of night life where everyone drinks like a fish and swear words are the norm for normal conversation. Kim meets Tanya (Margot Robbie) a veteran war correspondent and they get along. . The best scenes are with Kim and Tanya as it's hard to keep one's eyes off Tanya and we just love that accent too. There is humor in many conversations and it is welcomed, but you must listen very carefully. At times we see some dogs having sex; and the scenes whereby an Afghani woman is the first licensed female driver gave us a chuckle. I suppose the highlight of the movie is Kim using her influence with the Afghani Attorney-General Sadiq (Alfred Molina) to help get Ian (Marty Freeman) her friend and lover rescued from a kidnapping. Except for that there really isn't much to the movie. Yes, there are some action shooting/explosion scenes and they are well done. Notables: Josh Charles as Chris, Kim's stateside boyfriend; Christopher Abbott as Fahim Ahmadzai Kim's driver and friend; and Cherry Jones as Geri, Kim's stateside boss.For a true story there really isn't too much in here to write home about. After a time, Kim is told her stories are no longer newsworthy and she must find a way to adjust and move on. Her friend Fahim - a former doctor in another life - tells her the human body produces its own heroin and with the rush of the war, the war itself becomes a habit that is hard to break. Kim must find a way to break that habit. I think I can sum up the entire story by saying: Whiskey, Tango, Foxtrot. See? (5/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: No, well the dogs. Nudity: No. Language: Yes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maybe I'm suffering a little battle fatigue myself but following on from TV series like "The Honourable Woman" and "(American) Odyssey", and movies like "Zero Black Thirty" and "The Hurt Locker", but I found this latest front-line Afghanistan movie adding little to my understanding of the undoubtedly disembodied, chaotic life that serving soldiers and entourage of news reporters and others no doubt go through. The film centres on Tina Fey's Kim Barker, a 40-something single TV reporter with a steady boyfriend but who surprises herself by volunteering for a supposed six-month "field-trip" to Afghanistan in tow with the American Marines to no doubt give purpose to her life. What follows is a ramshackle five year stint as her channel's face of the war, which sees her settling into the shambolic lifestyle of the various misfits around her, including an established glamorous female rival played by Margot Robbie, an expletive-heavy Scotsman played by Martin Freeman, bedecked by a Celtic F.C. scarf, although he pulls off the accent, a cynical, tough-as-old-boots, Marine commander played by Billy Bob Thornton and especially a friendly, everyday serving marine played by Josh Charles and who perhaps more than anyone else keeps her grounded. On the Afghani side she connects with a young doctor played by Christopher Abbott who acts as her sometime driver and a lecherous local politician soon to be Attorney General played by a bearded-up, slightly over-the-top and almost unrecognisable Alfred Molina.There were some acerbic touches of inevitable black humour, like how Fey's "babe-rating" of about 6 in America becomes a 9.5 in sex-starved Afghanistan, her receiving a live "Dear John / Julia" communication by video-link and how she strings along Molina's "special- friend" aspirations to her own eventual advantage mixed in with the hedonistic off-duty lifestyle of the foreigners as well as her sometimes reckless attempts to get newsworthy stories to maintain and justify her position to her executive bosses back home.I found the movie somewhat hit and miss in its aims. It aims I think for a "M.A.S.H." type unorthodox mix of humour and realism but ends up too focused on Fey's own character rather than a true anti-war message. Like I said, I just didn't get anything new from it in terms of the soldierly experience either, trying to encapsulate five years into two hours just doesn't go and makes her various relationships come off too sketchily. I get the de-rigour, constant use of hand-held camera shots and audio-verite dialogue for added realism, but actually found it hard sometimes to see and hear what was going on in the gloom and murk served up.I quite liked the acting of all the main characters even if too many perhaps verged on the stereotypical. I gather the movie was based on the real-life Barker's own memoirs (otherwise I'd have seriously questioned her almost too-easy springing of her kidnapped boyfriend from captivity) but in the final analysis felt myself having to justify whether this movie shed enough new light on the Afghanistan experience compared to what I've seen before. The fact I'm asking that question of myself probably gives its own answer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I rarely move my vote 1 point over what I believe, usually it is when movie deserves more attention. That was exactly the case here. Kims story is a rear beast: for once main character is an independent strong woman and script wasn't toned down to meet needs of a spherical viewer in vacuum or pegi12 standards. It's a dark comedy about never ending war and lives of people involved in it, both locals and westerners. First half is a brilliant real life dark comedy and the second is more drama. If you want to see something you haven't seen before, wold definitely recommend WTF. Strong story. good production, excellent cast. It will not change your life, but you will definitely have a good time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"You embrace the suck and you move forward." Kim Baker (Fey) is a journalist who is floating through life. She agrees to take a job covering the war in Afghanistan. When she arrives it is nothing like she expected but little by little she finds something she never expected. Herself. This is just a great movie. This is not a straight comedy and Tina Fey really shows she can act. She is really the perfect choice for this role because she brings humor, heart and seriousness and really brings the real life character to life. This is a comedy, but it reminded me a lot of Good Morning Vietnam and the more recent Rock The Kasbah. Very serious issues dealt with in a more comedic way that really makes you understand and feel for what is going on. You can tell she is out of her element when she arrives, but by the time she settles in you really do see the change occur and it is a pleasure to watch. This is a movie I highly recommend and is a real turning point in Tina Fey's career. Overall, funny with heart. Great acting. Great story. Great movie. I give this an A.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>F***ing awesome ride!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What I gathered as a reason for low score based on reading negative comments on IMDb: 1. I thought this was a comedy. 2. I hate Tina Fay and/or women as leading actors. 3. I don't understand the point of this movie / I thought it was a war movie... 4. All above.My take on that: 1. So, it's not a comedy. But it's not a heavy drama either. 2. I don't watch movies because of the actors in the first place. So I don't care if it's a male or female lead. And I don't care if the lead is Tina Fay or Curt Russel or Meryl Streep or... you get my point. If the story is good and well told and camera work is OK I'm happy. 3. It's set during a war. It plays a big part in the whole story. But it's not a war movie - almost no action... 4. I loved the story of a reporter feeling trapped in 'normal' life, looking for a change and finding it in a war zone. Only to.... well you'll have to watch the movie. I don't want to spoil experience for someone who decides to watch the movie.So, take my opinions into account. Or don't. Your choice. I already got what I needed from this movie and writing this review.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whiskey Tango Foxtrot abbreviated to WTF wants to be M*A*S*H or Catch 22 as it wants to satirise the chaos of war but ends up being glib, superficial and pointless. Can you really take a film seriously in 2016 that casts white actors to play Afghans? Could they not find any Afghan or Pakistani actors or were they just inundated with employment opportunities?Tina Fey plays Kim Baker an inexperienced television journalist who because she is single and without kids is sent to Afghanistan as a war journalist where her naivety threatens to make her a laughing stock but soon gets involved in the action and quickly becomes an adrenaline junkie putting herself and her crew in danger.The journalists from around the world spend time in what is called the Kabubble, drinking, partying, having casual sex. Baker is told early on that she might not be deemed too be attractive back home but here with the men either in the armed forces, her bodyguards and others in the Kabubble she would be deemed a 10 with plenty of people trying it on with her.Baker bonds with the other journalists and falls for a Scottish war photographer (Martin Freeman) who later gets kidnapped, she rebuffs the advances of a slimy Afghan politician and schemes to advance her career in the television network.The film is mildly amusing in places but is certainly not a freewheeling black comedy about the absurdity of war. It is not crazily humorous as M*A*S*H with an underlying serious message.</fullReview>

Walking around in a country other than my own, with different customs? Make sure I don't read/learn anything about that country first. Check. Sexually oppressed culture which should conform to me because I'm visiting? I'll be sure to give my advice to any woman who will listen. Check.

		<fullReview>If you haven't seen Whiskey Tango Foxtrot yet I highly recommend you see it. It is very well put together and I thought at first some gag reel comedy about how the war in Afghanistan is wrong and all that.But instead you are sent on a journey with this reporter as she learns the ropes in a war zone. There are outright hilarious moments, action packed moments and at the end there is a moment that my allergies hit hard, and for you ladies there is romance and some strong female characters.I think it tells a great story about live no matter your job in a war zone. It really impressed me in how it portrayed the events both good and bad. It is a movie that viewers will walk away with something from the movie.

I told myself.Fey's character is a journalist who, bored of her daily life in NYC decides to attempt to find meaning working in early 2000's Afghanistan. I was expecting to see her mingle with the locals, witness the culture shock, understand the Afghans. However none of that happened.Instead we see her spend most of her time surrounded by military personnel and drunk reporters. Everyone is portrayed as grotesque caricatures, from the soldiers to the local population, even her co-workers are extremely one-dimensional with no redeeming qualities. It was very difficult to empathize with any of the characters as they were so cliché.The story in itself could have been so much more. The abundance of unfunny sexual jokes gave the impression of lack of inspiration. The pacing was quite slow and the conclusion very bland. I left disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to a screening of WTF, and really just went because it was a free night out away from stress. But I'd have happily paid for this movie. It was well written, the music was spot on (and, for me, music makes or breaks a movie). It's also not a chick flick as I thought. I hope that people will see this movie, because I thoroughly enjoyed it. Frankly, I'm shocked at the low metascore. It deserved much better. Maybe it's one of those "sleeper" movies.There were plenty of belly laughs, but also drama and action. This movie felt real, and not just because it was based on a true story, but because of the acting, dialog, writing, and heck probably all the aspects of movie making. This isn't a farce, or silly slapstick, I guess I'd call it a dramedy. Or even a drama with a lot of funny moments.I don't think I've ever seen Tina Fey do such a great job in a dramatic role, and Martin Freeman was equally engaging. Even many of the smaller roles were done so well that you felt attached to the characters.Again, I wasn't expecting to like the movie, I just wanted a worn-out-mom's-night-out. But what a nice surprise, I did enjoy it! And I think my husband would have also found it as good as I did.This movie is good. Go see it.</fullReview>

Martin Freeman is good in everything he does, as is Billy Bob Thornton and neither of them fail in this story about a war reporter. The first thing that struck me was that you could easily believe you were actually in Kabul. The customs, the sets, the people all appeared genuine and gave you the feeling you were there. There was very little about war politics, thankfully this film was about people and their experiences. The characters were truly believable, every single one, and the pace was perfect. The dialogue was meaningful and amusing at times, and the direction was deft enough to pick up nuances of feeling. The ending is in fact...genius. I've watched a lot of rot lately and been saddened that there is so much rubbish around, this raised my spirits no end and I am now a definite Tina Fey beginning-fan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tina Fey's limitations, disconnected title, superficial take on the serious backdrop, unfunny and unfocused - not worth a watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tina Fey - best known for her exploits in SNL, sit-coms and rom-coms tries her hand at a bigger budget wartime satire loosely based on a biographical book 'The Taliban Shuffle: Strange Days in Afghanistan and Pakistan' by Kim Barker. By large it is still a generic rom-com with Afghanistan as the backdrop while depicting serious and complex situations in light comic scenarios. The title sticks with the story only for like 5% and the rest is just to connect with contemporary populace. Kim Barker (Tina Fey) has hit midlife crisis in her head and unsure of her personal and professional future. This is when she takes up an opportunity to be a wartime journalist in Afghanistan and packs herself off to be a stranger in the strange-land. While she takes her time to get accustomed to the culture, people and new job, a chance situation delivers a story that puts her in the limelight. Things brings along new friends in Tanya (Margot Robbie), a brewing romance with Iain (Martin Freeman), a budding friendship with Fahim (Christopher Abbott) and a persistent (forceful) admirer in Ali Massoud Sadiq (Alfred Molina). When Tanya betrays her for professional advancement, Kim starts to fear whom to trust. Even though Tina Fey is a very respected Hollywood actress with a vast list of credits and long career span, she has her own limitations which doesn't let her go beyond a certain type of role. This limitation is even more magnified with the more serious backdrop and very talented co- stars in Martin Freeman, Margot Robbie and under-used Billy Bob Thornton. While she might be a part of the problem, the bigger issue lies with the direction of the story and its screenplay that is unsure whether it has to be serious or light-hearted and eventually ending up as an uneven mix of both. The romance between the characters Kim and Iain is mature and could fit well into almost any rom-com backdrop. Going against what the teaser promised, the expected funny ride quickly turns into a superficial drama that is neither here nor there. The editing and screenplay could have definitely helped with some runtime chopping as it gets a little repetitive and boring in the middle. The climax gets even more unrealistic when she goes on to meet a soldier who she thought that her irresponsible action could have led to his tragic fate. Tina Fey's limitations, disconnected title, superficial take on the serious backdrop, unfunny and unfocused - not worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whiskey Tango FoxtrotThe worst part about being a female war correspondent is that every one naturally assumes you're just there to report the weather.However, the scribe in this dramedy is drab enough to pass as a reporter. Gung-ho to get in front of the camera, copywriter Kim Barker (Tina Fey) accepts a field assignment in Afghanistan. Paired with a general (Billy Bob Thornton), mentored by a stringer (Margot Robbie) and wooed by a photojournalist (Martin Freeman), she quickly learns to navigate close quarter combat.But when her segments go unaired due to audience apathy, Kim tries to seduce an official (Alfred Molina) for an exclusive. Adapted from Baker's own biography, WTF takes a lighter look at Operation Enduring Freedom that comes off more flippant than empathetic, especially the unfortunate casting of white actors in Afghani roles. Furthermore, being a female war correspondent isn't as dangerous as being a female sports reporter. Yellow Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.ca</fullReview>

In addition why would Martin Freeman and Alfred Molina want to be in this movie. I started to fall asleep half way in. A better screenplay adaption would have helped. The lucky winner is the woman whom the story is based on; Kim Barker. Her book The Taliban Shuffle is better. I will say the movie accurately depicts the chaos of the middle east, the lack of respect for women.the dirtiness and senseless violence which goes on each day. You could not pay me enough money to travel to Afghanistan. Any journalist who risks their life to tell a story deserves a much better movie.</fullReview>

I'm glad I went. While some of it was a little contrived, I think it had that aura of incredible threat that well made movies of this type have. I thought Tina Fey was very good, as were Martin Freeman (unsung generally) and Billy Bob Thornton. I don't know if the partying and drug use are as rampant as presented (maybe they are), but the best parts of this picture are the scenes where we wonder what's around the next corner. One of the most frightening scenes is when Fey's character is inadvertently dropped off at the wrong house. Suddenly, she knows fear. She is defenseless, just for a few moments. She does a nice job of showing that trip into the adrenaline rush that these people have to have. Those of us who think we are sane would probably say, "Why would someone not in the military want to go to a place like this?" We see them every night on the news, many of them women.

		<shortDescription>TV journalist grows addicted to adrenalin</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As Kim's faithful doctor/translator warns her, the adventurer's adrenalin rush can be very addictive. You keep needing another fix. That's the film's central theme. What makes this film important is how that point works on the national political level as well as on the personal. The personal level is obvious. Kim (Tina Fey) is a TV news writer who risks a three-month assignment to report on camera from the Afghanistan war. Hooked by the thrills she grows increasingly foolhardy. In a domestic parallel, her lover back home starts sleeping around and. blames her for being absent.Kim's translator soon quits rather than risk widowing his new wife. The other journalists and cameramen experience the same rush that compels them to stay. Their every danger and thrill leave them craving another, bigger one. Their addiction drives them to betray each other, however close they may have drawn.Only when Kim realizes that mortal danger has become her new normalcy ? and sees its controlling, distracting effect on her Scottish lover ? does she fly back to America. There she takes a high profile posting in NYC or Washington. There the drama is domesticated.That dynamic also plays out on Kim's network. The news department has a woman boss but she reads its needs the same way a swaggering man would. The network needs new stories, new locations, to hook the jaded audience. The key point is that a nation can also get hooked on war. The film is cross between MASH and Eisenhower's warning about the military-industrial complex. Billy Bob Thornton plays a worldly marine officer who leaps at Kim's plan for a filmed rescue of a kidnapped Scot (her lover, as it happens). The commander has practical considerations in mind ? he needs a spectacular success to bolster his budget. But the thrill is the real draw. Like the politicos at home, the commander and Kim stay safely on base while the troops go out to risk their lives. Kim's visit to an interviewee who had both legs blown off underlines the human costs of the nation's military glory.In the context of the US presidential election, the film conveys the Democrat party's reluctance to get America embroiled in yet another distant war, especially where the culture is so different as to be incomprehensible and the adventure of unlikely success. The producers include Fey and Lorne Michaels, also of Saturday Night Live. If Trump, Cruze and Rubio could think about what the film is saying they would be mightily offended. As is, they might well enjoy it. Except for the profane language, which Cruze and Rubio would loudly object to ? and Trump would trump.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie is funny and tender</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The good news is this movie is very funny and very tender, bringing back the very best of Tina Fey as Liz Lemon from her time at 30 Rock. The bad news is that if you've seen the extended preview at the movies, then you've seen most of the movie already. But it is a valiant effort from Fey and company at the life of a news correspondent trying to blow up her life into something new. In this case, as one of the few single people without children she gets the chance to go to Kabul in Afghanistan to report on the war there. This directly results in her character, Kim Baker (who is based on Kim Barker who wrote a book about her experience there as a journalist) getting the chance to stare death in the face and laugh, repeatedly, even when she shouldn't.Journalists from around the globe called such an experience spending time in the Kabubble, sheltered away and yet directly involved in the front lines. Fey's cohorts on the front line of journalism include Margot Robbie and Martin Freeman as well as a Marine Colonel played jovially by Billy Bob Thornton and the Attorney General of Afghanistan played incredibly not seriously by Alfred Molina.Baker arrives and gets thrown to the wolves and uses her I don't care about life attitude to get involved in a gunfight straightaway leading to her being embraced instantly by her peers. Much drinking and carousing ensues thereafter and everyone becomes very close. Not very close are Baker and estranged somewhere on assignment in America boyfriend Chris (Josh Charles) who gets caught cheating on Baker on Skype of all things. Suddenly finding herself single, she is drawn to the oddly charming Iain (Freeman) and a more serious side of the film ensues as a result of this new relationship.Its a different look at the war in Afghanistan from the side of the journalist though the reality of everything is still the same. It starts out very funny then has a long lull and could easily have shaved off 20 minutes from the nearly two hour running time. Though enjoyable there is little about this movie that screams out to be seen on the big screen. I'd wager this is much more suited to a night of Netflix or Red Box.Source: http://www.megashare-viooz.net/whiskey-tango-foxtrot-2016.html</fullReview>

Sure there are a few jokes here and there, the burqa scene was the only part I actually laughed at because it was clearly intending to lampoon the idea. Apart from that, it's the same old dry humor you would expect from Fey but without any payoff. This film is a drama with the lead character being a comedian. War films are becoming less popular as we drain the bottom of the barrel here, ironically this is a plot point for the film too. It's as predictable as you would expect and way too long. After an hour I was ready for the film to be over, but realized we had another 50 minutes to go. Slow pace, not funny and just boring. Three stars at best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whiskey Tango Foxtrot follows the story of Kim Baker a war correspondent journalist and her experiences in Afganistan based on a book by her "The Taliban Shuffle: Strange Days in Afghanistan and Pakistan".I'll be honest i have not read the book but i heard great things and reviews.Starring Tina Fey in a different role than we expected her she is just incredible she manages from her days in SNL and 30 Rock to her starring roles in Mean Girls , Baby Mama and her most recent role Sisters to get you laughing hard.The movie is directed by Glenn Ficarra and John Requa who they previously directed the amazing Crazy Stupid Love and in my opinion the great Focus with a script by Robert Carlock which at times doesn't make the jump from comedic to serious as well as we want to so it ends up messing the tone .But still there's so much to the story and the interactions between Barker and Tanya(the great Margot Robbie) the help of her driver(a stunning Christopher Abbott) and a photographer(the charming Martin Freeman) and also the great Billy Bob Thornton. So even though the script sometimes gets confusing in tone the performances are what keeps this movie alive with the humor playing also a big factor.7.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jesus Christ, is that what you call "entertaining"?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll try to summarize this crap show in the simplest way I can. There's a pretty white American lady, who just wants to get out of her daily life bubble. When she finally does and sees what goes on in the real world, she craps out and runs back to her homely own comfortable same old boring bubble.This was the most 1st world movie I have ever seen in my life. I urge you, Jesus Christ, do not go through this torture. As for the "story"? this movie literally has none! we're 3/4 our way in and THEN something happens, Martin Freeman gets kidnapped. By that time you'll get so bored, you wouldn't even care if an atom bomb fell on them and literally everybody died. Just save yourself and skip this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Life in the Kabubble</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film actually turned out to be really good and I am really glad that I put aside some time to actually go and watch it. Just to think that I was going to let it drift by like many of the other films that seem to come and go and just stick with the superhero and sci-fi blockbuster offerings. I guess if I were to just leave it at that then I would end up not having experienced some truly good movies, even at a time when we seem to be getting remake upon remake upon remake.So, this film is about reporter Kim Baker who is given the opportunity to become a war reporter in Kabul. Actually, it's not so much an offer but an assignment, namely because all the good reporters have gone over to Iraq and there is no longer anybody left on the ground to report on the war in Afghanistan. Actually, because the attention has shifted from Afghanistan to Iraq, so has the viewing public, so Afghanistan has simply become one of those follow up pieces that are put onto television when nothing all that interesting is coming out of Iraq.Like many movies about reporters this one is about the reporter chasing the big story, however it is somewhat more than that because it is about how Baker slowly becomes an adrenaline junkie. Right from her first assignment, when she leaps out of the humvee in the middle of a fire fight simply get to footage for the television station, we see her becoming ever more reckless with the desire to get airtime. This almost culminates when, dressed in traditional Afghan garb, she wanders into a male only meeting and is almost killed ? yet this doesn't set her back, she continues to look for the next big scoop, despite being warned otherwise. Moreso, it isn't a question of the adrenaline, and living the action, but rather the thrill of having her story, and her footage, up on national television, a desire that is fed by the ratings, which means that when ratings drop, her desire to get into even more danger increases.It is interesting how they refer to Kabul as the Kabubble; that is a reality that is essentially disconnected from the rest of the world. In a way this changes our perspective because many of us see that life in the industrialised world as existing in a bubble where we are disconnected from the realities of the developing world. However this world seems to be more so as throughout the movie the war footage, and traveling with the military, is punctuated by the drug and alcohol fueled parties, as well as driving from enclave to enclave in the city where the western world has made its stamp. In fact these parties always seem to be the same to the point that the filmmakers appear to use the same footage over and over again.Life back in America is life in the suburbs where one goes to work and back again in relative safety. As Baker comes to realise, life back in the United States is boring, where as life here is exciting, whether it be traveling through a war zone or simply going to the parties every night. Yet outside the compound we see a different world, a world without infrastructure where warlords are fighting for control and a very evident ruling class in place. It isn't a world of shopping malls and motorways, but a world of dirty streets and packed markets. Yet this world grows upon Baker ? at first it is only three months, but this slowly stretches out to three years as every time she is about to go home something causes her to remain.Whiskey Tango Foxtrot, as well as being a black comedy, is actually a very confronting movie about how our life can be transformed even when we remove ourselves from the industrialised west, and how even when we live in a world where we lack the comforts of home, we can still find ourselves becoming disconnected from our former life and find ourselves being transformed to a point where we have fallen in love with a place that at first we could never have imagined doing so. As they say, home is where your heart lies.Yet it is also how when we are taken away from the familiar, and put into the unfamiliar, we can become much more than what we were back home. As they suggest, there is the 4-10-4 rule in Afghanistan ? a woman who is a 4 in New York is a 10 in Afghanistan, but becomes a 4 again when she returns home. This, in many ways, can actually cause people not to return home, because even though home may provide comfort, it also provide normalcy and mediocrity. In Kabul one is exceptions, while back home one is simply a part of the crowd. Such is life in the graveyard of empires.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining enough, but there's a more interesting story in here somewhere.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Crafting out a comedy within the setting of a real life war is not an easy task. Which probably explains why the humour dries up halfway through and this sorta-biography heads down a more earnest, and rewarding, path. Recounting reporter Kim Barker's (Baker in the film) journey from desk-jockey to on-the-ground war correspondent in Afghanistan (circa 2003-2006), the movie leans heavily on clichéd fish-out-of-water antics for the first act to squeeze out a couple of titter-worthy moments. When the following two acts become more serious and reveal deeper layers in both the story and our likable protagonist, the interest level drastically increases, but it also highlights just how miscalculated the comedy-angle was to begin with. Adapted from Barker's 2011 memoirs 'The Taliban Shuffle', the screenplay suffers from numerous time-jumps that muddy the journalist's personal growth rather than emphasise it, whilst a few supporting characters are given oddly anti-climactic closures. A more in-depth mini-series beckoned. Tina Fey brings her usual dry wit and every-woman charm to the role of Baker, sharing a nice chemistry with Martin Freeman who almost steals the show as the irreverent and arrogant Scottish freelance photographer Iain MacKelpie. Unfortunately Margot Robbie is completely one dimensional as fellow journo Tanya Vanderpoel ? who could be a Brit, Kiwi or Aussie going by Robbie's accent ? whilst Alfred Molina is woefully miscast as the sleazy Afghan official Ali Massoud Sadiq. Fey and Freeman are charismatic enough to keep WTF entertaining, but there's definitely a more intriguing, meaningful and captivating story in here somewhere.</fullReview>

And how Afghanistan is a place that people live. I believe that since it does turn out to be a war comedy is what makes this movie special. It's also spans over a 7 year period that enables the life lessons to appear more real. Australians are loose, Americans have good libido's and people from the UK tend to have patience. The Afghans are respectful and considerate. It's not an 8/10 production or story, it's a 8/10 comedy war drama.

		<shortDescription>A mixed but engaging film...but not the comedy I expected.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most movies have several layers of meaning and sometimes a hidden layer will tell an unintended story. Whiskey Tango Foxtrot (2016) is described as a comedy, but it is not a laugh out loud kind of film. The iconic M.A.S.H. proved you can mix humour and war but WTF goes beyond wisecracks in a tent to make light of a superpower war with an ancient impoverished country. Based on a real war correspondent's memoirs, this film adaptation ultimately casts a poor light on large numbers of non-combat personnel who are there for reasons that have little to do with altruism or professionalism.At 40-ish, bored desk-bound copy writer Kim Baker (Tina Fey) is sick and tired of staring at the same carpet spot near her gym treadmill and is desperate for a change of life. She is drawn by the excitement of war reporting and ends up spending several years in Afganistan. There are several connected strands to the story, like Kim's makeup-destroying experiences as an embedded reporter, exposing the persecution of Afgani women, and encountering a variety of characters including a love interest and some quirky Afganis who do things very differently in that part of the world. The attention of the global press has turned away from Afganistan to Iraq, and Kim and her reporter fraternity face reassignment. There are two standing gags that frame the film. The resident female stunner Tanya Vanderpoel (Margot Robie) tells Kim that girls who rate 6 in the States are a 9 or 10 in a war zone so her sex-life will be amazing. The more telling gag uses the boiling frog metaphor, where the water temperature rises so slowly that the frog does not realise it is about to die. The war zone press corps are depicted as adrenalin junkies and sex-crazed alcohol or drug addicts. The longer they stay the more humanity they lose.This is a mixed but engaging film. It is well paced with filming that captures both excitement and danger. More importantly, it fills a gap in most people's awareness of what it is like to be a female war correspondent. While some have panned Tina Fey as not comedic enough, this is war and she nailed her part. The comedy did not get many laughs in my cinema, just some sniggers over frat- house one liners. Although the film is not the comedy I expected, Whisky Tango Foxtrot is very entertaining.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think this film is a significant effort in recent filmmaking. Its is at turns funny-serious and everything in between. I enjoyed watching it. I thought it gave an eye opening view of the way Kabul was in the recent past due to all the war related activity in that part of the world. I recommend this film to both Cinephiles and the casual movie goer. I thought the acting was also pretty good which is something you don't see very often these days in the movies. Tina Fey is someone recognizable from her work on Saturday Night Live-at least that where I know her from-but she is effective as a movie actress as well. This is a good movie to go and see with another person rather than by yourself as it most certainly will spark a discussion about it afterward. Good cinematography and it looks like it was filmed actually in Afghanistan. I should have checked the credits to see for sure...oh well-this would be a good film to see at home also...two thumbs up!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>30 Rock meets Zero Dark Thirty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was entertaining throughout and enjoyable, but not a blockbuster. As my subject line says, it's like a mashup of 30-Rock and Zero Dark Thirty. This is not a "Tina Fey comedy" as the trailers seem to say. But it has a lot of great laughs nonetheless, but mixed in with some serious drama.There are a few very realistic and gory combat scenes, mixed in with the work-a-day world of Tina Fey's character. Based on a true story, the real Kim Baker described herself as a Tina Fey type character. She had a humdrum job, boyfriend issues, workplace politics. She then gets asked if she'd like to (read: told) to go on assignment in Afghanistan. She accepts because her life in New York was getting boring for her.In "the Kabubble"--as the press and contractors refer to their fenced in life in Kabul--she finds that she still has workplace politics, boyfriend issues, etc. but at least she'll have fun stories to tell to her friends and maybe children. Another big plus for her--in New York she's a "6, maybe 6 1/2", but in Afghanistan she's "like a 9, maybe 9 1/2" as her colleague (Margot Robbie, who appears to be channeling CBS news' Lara Logan) tells her. "What are you then, a 15?" asks Tina's character.So the story arc ends up being mostly around a Scottish photographer who "fancies" her, though Tina's character will have none of it, for a while anyway. Various things happen, a backstabbing (figurative) by a work friend, and a kidnapping of a close friend--the latter for which she ends up trying to use her Kabul political connections (which her "9" status has helped her achieve) to try and get information about the kidnappers' identity. This would be a double-whammy for her--getting a friend free and also getting a huge story.So without getting into spoilers, that is pretty much the plot-- nothing earth shattering but it was enough to keep me involved, laughing, and entertained throughout.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved every minute of this movie, and not just because I love everything Tina Fey touches (which I do). Disclaimer - I have lived in Afghanistan, albeit as a contractor working inside the wire at KAF, so I had a soft spot for this story from the start. Even better, it's based on a true story! AND THERE'S A BOOK!! MY FAVOURITE!! Both Margot Robbie and Tina Fey were fantastic in their roles, as was Martin Freeman and the rest of the cast. But I gotta give it up to the ladies on this one - from the bad-ass lady reporter Kim who's experience this is based on, to the actresses, this is just a fantastic story that definitely deserved to be told on film. Oh, did I mention, there is even a scene with a camel spider vs scorpion battle...this is a real phenomenon, people, I saw it happen on base. True 2 Life! To all the haters complaining about the use of language, or drinking/partying, seriously get a LIFE. You swear more when you're in a war zone, that's just how it is! If I were out filming beside soldiers in a firefight, I'd party my ass off, too! Quit being so judgy! And it's based on a TRUE STORY. So why why WHY complain when they're emulating an experience that actually happened!? Go watch something rated PG if you don't like language, k?In summation, this movie was fabulous and you should watch it. &#x1f918;&#x1f3fb;KLJ</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The lighter side of war</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's not often that you find the two genres Comedy and War in the one film but Whiskey Tango Foxtrot combines both effortlessly. Based on the novel titled The Taliban Shuffle: Strange Days In Afghanistan and Pakistan by Kim Barker, this is the real-life account of the Chicago- based journalist Barker who escapes her mundane city life and discovers a bizarre mix of Eastern and Western culture whilst covering the war in Afghanistan.Tina Fey plays the main character Kim and as always, her comedic timing is perfect as she plays the strong yet also vulnerable woman flawlessly. The chemistry between herself and love interest Iain McKelpie (Martin Freeman) pops on screen and is charming to a T.Whilst the horrors of war are nothing to be undermined, this film successfully pays respect to the touchy subject matter and at the same time, miraculously manages to keep the tone light-hearted and playful. It focuses purely on Kim and her experiences and takes you deep into the world of wartime journalism ? a place we don't often get a true glimpse of.motherofpopcorn.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fey shines in effective drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Journalist Kim Baker takes a job as correspondent in Afghanistan in order to escape a job and a relationship which are going nowhere. The people she meets and the actions which follow do, indeed, change her life, in ways she never expected.This adaptation of the real Kim Barker's Afghanistan memoir features Tina Fey as Kim, and has been heavily trailed as a wacky war comedy. It is no such thing. Though it undoubtedly has humorous moments (mostly care of Alfred Molina deliberately cast as a broadly comic senior Afghan civil servant), this is actually a fairly serious look at the effects of the Afghan action on journalists and journalism. Have said that it is serious, I must also say that it remains light enough to keep the viewer engaged notwithstanding some very sobering moments.The screenplay is pleasing, as are most of the performances: Tina Fey shows that she has chops as a serious actor. Only Molina seems out of place with a performance which would have been more at home in Carry On Kabul.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is not anti-war so much as the usual war is a fog of mistakes, a miscalculation, never gets what it aims for if it aims for anything. Afghanistan had some reason to it as Iraq did not. As someone said this is not a comedy and Tina Fey, the comedian, does what comedians do best: find the absurdity, the gall that nations have that this will solve all the social, historical, environmental rot that has accumulated for centuries. Kim Baker did her stint and then took care of herself.I only have four lines, need ten. OK.I loved Alfred Molina as the opportunistic turd who gives government a bad name. Our men die for wastes of breath like this now and in the past. In Vietnam, you had Vietnamese generals dressed in tennis whites sipping drinks with General Maxwell Taylor, in tennis whites, at the club. In the middle of a damned war where the Pentagon said, "50,000 kids killed? That many would have been killed in car accidents." No big deal. Or the friend who gets married and sends in his certificate and gets drafted anyway because they lost the papers and then when his paperwork is returned there it is in the bunch and he's saying how great the new weapons are at keeping the men from getting killed because that's the hogwash they are handing him and his affect is flat and depressed. War is absurd, not funny, and Tina Fey touches on that absurdity and that makes it funny. It was absurd for Kim Baker, the original writer. Give absurdity a look. See this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'WHISKEY TANGO FOXTROT': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A war comedy-drama flick; about a television reporter, that takes on an assignment in Afghanistan (during Operation Enduring Freedom). The film stars Tina Fey, and it was directed by Glenn Ficarra and John Requa (the team that also helmed movies like 'CRAZY, STUPID, LOVE.' and 'FOCUS'). It's based on the memoir 'The Taliban Shuffle: Strange Days in Afghanistan and Pakistan', by Kim Barker, and it was scripted by Robert Carlock (a veteran writer of 'SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE' and '30 ROCK'). The movie costars Martin Freeman, Margot Robbie, Christopher Abbott, Alfred Molina and Billy Bob Thornton. It's a somewhat interesting, and funny, war flick; highlighted by Tina Fey's performance. Fey plays Kim Barker; a television journalist that took a war correspondence gig in Afghanistan, during the 'Global War on Terrorism'. The job started out as a short assignment, which stretched into years there. While adapting to the job, Kim also formed multiple different relationships with soldiers, other journalists and an Afghan politician (Molina); with a crush. One relationship also turned into a little more than just a friendship.The movie offers little in the way of political insight (to Afghanistan, during that time), but it is funny. Largely due to Fey; who I'm becoming a bigger fan of (with every film). The supporting cast is all good as well (especially Freeman) and the directing is more than adequate. The script could have used a few more rewrites, but there's definitely some good material in there.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/8JsPKeI7y6U</fullReview>

Her journey wasn't an ordinary one, it had laughs, heartbreaks, violence &amp; even betrayal. But Baker's journey is worth watching on celluloid, as its engaging for the most bit.Robert Carlock's Adapted Screenplay is good, although the last act doesn't quite add up. Baker's Journey is exciting, but the culmination of this chapter of her life, doesn't come up as a whole. The Writing needed to be better, no doubt. Glenn Ficarra &amp; John Requa's Direction is passable. Cinematography is superbly done. Editing is alright. Art &amp; Costume Design are perfect. Performance-Wise: Tina Fey is the life of 'Whiskey Tango Foxtrot'. She's in top-form &amp; owns the show form start to end. Martin Freeman is first-rate, as always. Margot Robbie is stunning, both appearance &amp; performance wise. Alfred Molina (with a Afghani accent), is a hoot. His scenes with Fey, are fun to watch. Billy Bob Thornton stands out.

		<shortDescription>Quite the unexpected surprise from comedienne Tina Fey!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Paramount Pictures' Whiskey Tango Foxtrot is one part self-reflexive film on television news production and one part self-discovery. Unlike the feel of the previews, WTF is not really a comedy--not in the traditional sense anyway. There certainly are moments throughout the film that are funny and will cause you to chuckle, but it is definitely more of a drama. The brilliance of Fey's acting in this movie is truly showcased by her ability to display that she can do serious just as well as funny. Most of the funny parts are given away in the previews, so don't think you're going to get more laughs during the movie. Based on actual events, WTF takes you behind the camera and behind enemy lines to depict what it is like for television news foreign correspondents in a war zone. Although the movie was not what I expected at all, I am very pleased with the story, all be it, slow burning. Beyond the self-reflexive subplot in the movie is the foreground story of self- discovery. Fey represents so many of us who just feel like we are spinning our wheels, treading water, or even moving backwards. The inspirational elements of the movie come from her willingness to take chances, make mistakes, and get dirty (as the Magic School Bus's Miss Frizzle would say).What would you do? You're dissatisfied with your job as a television news writer/producer, have a mildly depressive boyfriend, small apartment, and just need to get away. If you're Kim Barker (Tina Fey), then you head off to Kabul, Afghanistan to become a foreign correspondent during the early days of the War on Terror. After an expedited visa and passport, Barker embarks on her journey as a representative of the U.S. press in one of the most dangerous places on earth. Armed with her laptop, camera, notepad, and two staff members, she sets out to discover the real stories in Kabul and the surrounding areas. Thinking that she is the only girl in a military barracks, Barker is relieved to meet Tanya Vanderpoel (Margot Robbie) who takes Barker under her wings to show her the ropes of reporting the news amidst a war and hundreds of "thirsty" journalists and military personnel. While covering the stories of the war, Barker concurrently takes a journey of self- discovery that is filled with mountains and valleys.Let's be real here. Even if you analyze movies on a regular basis like me, you too were probably thinking that this would be a dramedy (drama/comedy). And yes, comedy is really drama in disguise; but I digress. The previews are certainly cut together in such a way that it looks like a very Fey-esque wartime comedy. I am not going so far as to saying that Paramount pulled a bait 'n switch--because the movie is of a good quality and enjoyable--but the is no doubt that I went in expecting classic Fey and was presented with her more serious side. Still, through her witty quips and non-verbal dialog, she infuses conventional comedy and self-deprecating humor throughout the narrative. Like many dialog-driven dramas, even ones during a war, this movie has a very slow pace especially in the first act. Some additional comedy probably would have helped in the beginning to hook the audience. Speaking of the hook, that is probably what's missing from the first few minutes of the movie. I think the studio sacrificed a traditional hook because the hook was Tina Fey herself. Fortunately, the film wastes no times in getting Kim Barker to Afghanistan, and that is definitely a good move. Although we are introduced to several chief characters in the movie, the focus is definitely on the character development of Barker with some minor development and introspect on the other principle players.There are really two stories here: the foreground story of self-discovery and the background self- reflexive plot. Both are seamlessly married together in order to accurately tell both without sacrificing the other. Although we all know that there are foreign correspondents in war zones, we don't always get to see what it's really like to uncover stories, pitch to executives back in the states, and maintain sanity and safety; but through this film, we witness just how hard it really is to be a foreign television news correspondent. From networking, to interviewing, to shooting B-roll and stand-ups, Barker takes us on the journey from concept to delivery of producing news int he middle of a battle zone. Beyond the battle field, Barker is coping with her own personal and professional battles. If it isn't the cheating boyfriend, it is the network who put her on the hourly plan and gives her no screen time. But, through it all, Barker never gives up and refuses to sit idly by and allow herself to be walked over. Fortunately, Barker does get her big break during the climax of the movie, but you'll have to watch the movie to see what that is.If you plan to see just one movie this weekend, I definitely encourage you to see this one. It's gritty, funny, and inspirational. This is also a great opportunity to watch Fey in a more serious role and decide for yourself if she convinces you that she can play serious just as well as the comedy we all know and love her for. You may have seen other wartime movie, but this one plays out differently in that the focus is truly on the character development of the protagonist with the war merely being the backdrop and conduit through which we see her story of summits and pitfalls.</fullReview>

No one in Middle Earth argues in favor of saving the Orcs. Everyone agrees that Mt. Doom, Sauron, and Mordor must be liquidated ASAP if any Principles of Civilization are to survive. Perhaps WHISKEY TANGO FOXTROT deserves a Best Picture Oscar itself for teaching us the same lessons championed by LOTR, only this time in a Real Life context. Afghanistan has been a thorn in the side of Civilization for centuries. While the concept of a "United Nations" sounded good on paper in 1946, it has proved to be a horrendous boondoggle in practice. Nowadays, therefore, when a country is attacked as America was on 9-11, it must decide its own response without resorting to a bogus organization of appeasers that would give Hitler's Third Reich an equal standing with the USA if the Nazis popped up for the first time Tomorrow. This movie's legless Marine corporal represents thousands of foolhardy American and Allied Troops needlessly killed or maimed in Afghanistan since W. Bush deployed them in 2001. If ever Civilization cried out for a Culture to be eradicated once and for all through the means of the most humane and hands-off, long-distance delivery system possible, WHISKEY TANGO FOXTROT proves that Afghanistan is it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the usual Tina Fey flick...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, there are glimmers of the funny, irreverent Tina in her character; but, this is a driven woman with courage and a strong moral compass. Another thing she shares with the funny Tina is that she's never boring.The movie/book that this movie kept reminding me of was "Catch-22." It captures the insane mood of an environment that is pulled apart by war: whether it is Saigon in 1969, Italy in 1944, or Kabul in 2005 the usual rules and morality of society do not count: no one knows if they will survive another day. This is transmitted beautifully.The United States Marines are also represented in a terrific manner...surprisingly, no condescension by the film makers. And enough genuine smiles and laughs. Tina Fey's breakout movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you still haven't learned that 99% of EVERYTHING coming out of Holly-weird these days has one or another tool for political brainwashing built right in, i.e., Joseph P. Overton's principle carefully inserted and filtered through a rancid pipe running through Washington, D.C., then you are sadly way too intellectually lazy to understand any better, and you will likely not only enjoy this film, but you would equally enjoy the prospect of flailing and swinging wildly with your hands at an object faintly resembling a mouse and suspended by an elastic string from the ceiling of your kitchen. This dreck calling itself a "film", and as with all the garbage being churned out from that sewage pipe called Los Angeles these days, would only be funny if it were not so darn sad and horrific. Tina Fey, who is famous only because of being a part of the once funny but now contemptuously stupid SNL show, and who is an unapologetic idiot, would have never been a part of a movie making light of war if these were different times under a different administration.This filth reinforces the idea that it can be okay for 'murica to murder people if the right guy says it's okay. Why not? Obama says so and we all know Tina Fey's a left wing nut-job, right? So it can't be bad then. Sure, let's make a lighthearted summer comedy about killing people who are of absolutely no threat to western existence other than that they happen to be oil rich and a strategic geopolitical target, which of course renders its inhabitants expendable and their blood worthless if spilled in the name of uncle Sam. Yay. Tina will play a "journalist" and she'll meet funny people and have all sorts of haphazard misadventures and push women's rights in a place where 9 out of 10 people have had their families torn apart by western military shelling and who can't eat but once every 3 days, but hey, Tina Fey is okay by us! Fun for the whole family. Oh ha ha ha, hee hee hee, all-of-a-sudden Afghanistan is funny. Aw gee. How come? Where are all the liberal 'war is bad' overtones so trademark Fey? Ah yes, lest we forget, the Messiah Obama and HIS administration are in charge, and surely HITLERy say it's okay too, and therefore, Tina's fine with it. Oh those liberal principles, eh? So strong and well rooted. Yes, that was sarcasm. Laid on pretty thick too. I bet her next "comedy" (only if hypocrisy is funny to you) will be about "Russian aggression" or some other propagandized bologna gibberish that doesn't exist but lays comfortably within the party line and media tag line of the state department.What a crock. This movie's just one giant "it's okay to kill if THIS administration says so" message made funny for the cattle who can't think beyond their barbed wire corral.Pff! One star because if we can't put actors and actresses in prison for being sellouts then this is the best we can do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hollywood creates a Kabubble</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WHISKY TANGO FOXTROT Tina Fey stars, produces and dedicates this war correspondent film to her late father, Donald Fey "Veteran and Journalist". The film is based on the book "The Taliban Shuffle" by American journalist Kim Barker, recounting her five years as a female war correspondent in Afghanistan and Pakistan.When "Kim Baker" (played by Fey) first arrives as a rookie in Kabul in 2004, she is out of her depth but quickly earns a reputation for brinkmanship and scoring cred points as a plucky "embed" journalist. Like her peers, Baker develops the addiction that besieges war reporters; she constantly seeks the rush of being on the frontline. Over time the mainstream news networks turn their focus from Afghanistan to Iraq and interest for Baker's hard won stories wanes. We see the ruthlessness that exists amongst journalists for scoops and the pressurised environment in which they work. Living in a "Kabubble" as they call the bizarre mix of ever present danger and foreignness, the journalists, photographers and their minders live in a frat house atmosphere with constant partying and heavy drinking interrupted only by bombs and the pressure to file stories from the frontline.The use of hand held cameras in the streets of Kabul jostles the viewer inside dusty cars and further unease is created by the sound design where, at times, the volume of the surrounding field threatens to drown out the dialogue. Despite the gritty realism of the film's visual and sound elements there is an implausible plot detail involving the blowing up of a village well which contradicts the tone of naturalism. Add Tina Fey's unshakeable Los Angeles demeanour and the blonde bombshell treatment of Margot Robbie as a rival correspondent, Tanya Vanderpoel, and the film has the Hollywood stamp on it. These odd casting choices add to the dissonance between a complex subject matter and flippancy. Baker's Afghan minder, Fahim Ahmadzai, is played, controversially, by an American actor Christopher Abbott.For his part Abbott does an excellent job of portraying an Afghan man honourably attempting to cross the cultural/gender abyss using English as his second language. Ironically the relationship of Baker and Ahmadzai is one of the few poignant elements of the film and something of a retreat from the shallow relationships of hardened war hacks. One of whom is a dissolute Scottish journalist, played by Martin Freedman. Billy Bob Thornton faultlessly plays an ultra focused US Marine colonel.There is a haunting reference to an image of the brilliant Pulitzer prizewinning photojournalist, the late Anja Niedringhaus (killed in action in Afghanistan in 2014). In the film Kim Baker is wearing a blue burqa and a hand held camera shoots from inside her burqa looking out at the world through the fabric grille. This is an exact image of the still by Niedringhaus.The film is reminiscent of the absurdist war comedy, "M.A.S.H". Other writers have documented the peculiarly comic unreality of the foreign journalist's life in a war zone ("Absurdistan" by Eric Campbell, "Despatches" by Michael Herr). A female-positioned gallows humour successfully sustains the script and narrative but the strength of it seems to be undermined by the casting and incongruously smooth presentation of the female characters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Comedy writer extraordinaire Tina Fey takes on the role of foreign correspondent Kim Barker after reading the real life Kim Barker being compared to herself in a review about Kim's book 'The Taliban Shuffle'. It only seemed right for her to star as Kim Barker and also produce the film with directorial duo Glenn Ficarra and John Requa at the helms; who gave us Crazy Stupid Love and most recently Focus. We find Kim bored and lost working for a news network who gets quickly pushed out to Kabul, Afghanistan as a war journalist because of her marital status and not because of her experience and talent, which is zero. Leaving behind her boyfriend (Josh Charles from S.W.A.T. and Dead Poets Society) and plants to find gunfire, sand and plenty of bottled water; what was suppose to be a few months soon becomes a couple of years. Welcome the culture shock and getting lost in translation, Kim's character is nothing less than brave or stupid, going on patrols with the marines under the protective eye of Billy Bob Thornton's Gen. Hollanek. Who is amazing at speaking friendly fire and shouting about monetary values of missiles and Toyota pick-ups. He honestly has the best lines in the film and no, I didn't come here for the smell of sweaty balls. It has an amazing cast though a little confusing and possibly off putting with Martin Freeman with an Scottish accent. Alfred Molina is typically brilliant, Margot Robbie is typically stunning but it's Christopher Abbott's Fahim that is outstanding, Kim's Afghan guide and eventual friend. Home &amp; Away Aussie star Stephen Peacocke (looks like a hench, taller version of Hugh Grant) plays a Canadian pretending to be a Kiwi, like, yeah... Whiskey Tango Foxtrot? It's funny, entertaining and borderline outrageous, but has a seriousness constantly ticking below the surface like an IED that blows toward the end of the film, and instead of hitting the topics like sexism, feminism and war politics direct, we get little bits of golden shrapnel from time to time. It has a good, mixed soundtrack including music from The National, House of Pain, Pharcyde and Iron &amp; Wine with an almost surreal use of Harry Nilsson's 'Without You'. Not forgetting to mention a beautifully score from Nick Urata. It's superbly scripted, well directed and doesn't lose momentum. It's certainly not a four-ten- four but more like an... 8! Running Time: 7 The Cast: 9 Performance: 8 Direction: 8 Story: 8 Script: 9 Creativity: 8 Soundtrack: 8 Job Description: 9 The Extra Bonus Points: 10 for Billy Bob Thornton's lines and Christopher Abbott's Fahim. 84% 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How many times have we sat at our work desks and yearned for more excitement, more danger and more fun? I know I have but I don't think I would have contemplated following in the footsteps of Kim Baker. She's a news writer for a US network writing copy for stupid beautiful people to say on screen while she goes no where. It's 2003 and the network asks for volunteers to go to Afghanistan to report on the war so she takes the opportunity.On arrival in Kabul, Kim meets an eclectic collection of foreign journalists, private security contractors and local translators. They all live in the compound where they submit stories to their respective employers between forays with US Marines to local villages and return each night to drink heavily and enjoy themselves in a country dominated by Muslims adhering to strict Sharia laws. The irony is Kim had to travel thousands of kilometres from the comparative safety of New York to one of the world's most dangerous locations to discover a security within herself and her abilities.Whiskey Tango Foxtrot is well written with some solid laughs, high drama and quality tension from beginning to end while the direction offered by co-directors Glenn Ficarra and John Requa is spot on. Each scene is purposeful and engaging without wasteful conceits and they avoid diverting into self-serving dead ends. Thankfully the directors chose to limit the explosions so when the action scenes arrive they have greater impact and appear much more realistic. The film is tight and edited to just under 2 hours and never feels like it is treading water or merely offering scenes for the sake of filming.The cast is excellent led by Tina Fey who has the greatest comedic timing this side of Julia Louis-Dreyfus but should now be considered for more than just funny roles. Fey can bring the drama, the anger, the tension and the heartbreak when required and confirms once again an intelligent actress really can perform every role.The casting directors certainly outdid themselves putting this cast together with the always impressive Australian actress Margot Robbie as an English reporter, the brilliant English actor Martin Freedman as a Scottish photographer, the American actor Chris Abbott as an Afghani fixer and another Australian actor Stephen Peacocke as a New Zealand security contractor with a secret identity. This group is then topped off with Billy Bob Thornton as a grim Marine General and Alfred Molina as an eccentric Afghani politician. They are both perfectly cast and almost steal each scene underplaying their performances beautifully against Tina Fey.This is such an excellent film. The undercurrent is a reflection of the media and government who were initially so enthusiastic to fight the Taliban yet lose interest and become apathetic as their focus is directed to a new war in Iraq. However, the heart of the film is that an intelligent, sincere and competent woman must go to a dangerous frontier just so she can be seen by millions of viewers yet in the very same place because of the laws imposed on them by men, Afghani women cannot be seen at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The presence of Tiny Fey would make you believe this is a comedy. Also that's what it's listed as, but it's pretty far from. Whiskey Tango Foxtrot is an uneasy, grounded and natural story of a journalist in Afghanistan with an interesting look at life in the war-torn country.Tina Fey is great in the central role as the likable fish out of water - you get a good sense of her fearful enthusiasm. Through the course of the film she starts to become addicted to the war zone adrenaline, although not done as effectively as in, say, The Hurt Locker, and as her decisions become more daring, we do become *slightly* detached from her.As mentioned, for a 'comedy' it's quite devoid of humour. There are moments though, Alfred Molina's Afghan politician brings a few, as does Martin Freeman as the Scottish cameraman. This isn't necessarily a criticism though because it works better when it shows the lifestyle of US marines and journalists in a raw way without trying to be funny or Hollywoody. Everything that happens is perfectly believable, and more humour might have spoilt that.Ficarra and Requa's direction balances the tone well between being harrowing and enjoyable, with effective music by Urata and well paced editing by Kovac (although it started to drag towards the end). The characters are well created, but the movie didn't quite carry the emotional weight it could have.4/5</fullReview>

I was leery of this movie because its a serious setting with a comedic actress. I have always been a Tina Fey fan, she is a very funny woman. As for that, I have never seen her act in a serious role so I wasn't sure how this was going to turn out. The first 15 minutes or so had me questioning watching the rest of the movie. Once I got over that initial hump I couldn't stop watching the movie. Not only does the movie have a bit of romantic drama to it, it is still a war movie. Its a movie that a guy and gal could sit down and watch together and it will keep both entertained.</fullReview>

There is a lot which helps here. Kim Barker's book itself (The Taliban Shuffle: Strange Days in Afghanistan) was a very good read. The scenery is stunning, and well filmed. The music is excellent. But...Martin Freeman, her Scottish Kabul-style temp lover, is just not compelling. Still the Hobbit.

		<fullReview>Tina Fey Waltzes through Whiskey Tango Foxtrot playing herself in KabulWhiskey Tango Foxtrot (WTF) is tepidly entertaining and hits us like an ounce of lint. It is mildly amusing, mildly political, mildly sentimental, mildly dramatic; it's mild. And it leaves out the stories of the Afghans to a large extent. Fey as Kim Baker is entertaining, and I became a huge fan of Martin Freeman after his appearance on the first season of Fargo, the TV series. Billy Bob Thornton is excellent as General Hallanek. In fact, he has most of the good lines in the film. However, I can't tell if Margot Robbie as Tanya Vanderpoel does a terrible job acting or if her character is just poorly written. She is not convincing as a war correspondent or at anything else. I assume her character is taken from The Taliban Shuffle, the book the film is based on, but the film would have worked as well without her. That's not the worst, however. Ali Massoud Sadiq, played by Alfred Molina, is a caricature of what a Taliban leader turned minister would be. Frankly, he's embarrassing. Again, I am not sure if we should blame Molina, the script or the casting director. Molina plays it like a clown, and that's a poor choice. I wonder how many of the events in the film really happened. At one point, one of the ancillary characters, Shakira Khara played by Sheila Vand tells Kim after hearing her story about leaving New York for Kabul, "That is the whitest white-woman story I ever heard." How true that is about much of the film, but it is momentary moments of self-awareness that makes WTF worth watching. The film doesn't address the "why" of our adventures in Afghanistan except for one fleeting moment lost in the rest of the film. It doesn't share much sadness for the lives of the Afghans lost, as if the Afghans were window dressing for the actions of the Westerners. That is troublesome, but then again, that would be in the movie I wanted to see, not that one that was made. Rating: Matinée. Really, WTF! Fey is well worth watching, and if you are a fan of hers, see it. Otherwise, watch "The Year of Living Dangerously" or "Salvador", much better films about war correspondents.

		<shortDescription>"Whiskey Tango Foxtrot" is a well-named, entertaining war comedy - and much more!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Often it happens that the title of a film fails to adequately communicate a given motion picture's subject matter and the film's advertising poster and theatrical trailer provide little additional clarity. If you'll kindly permit me, I shall clarify the title and advertising for the 2016 film "Whiskey Tango Foxtrot" (R, 1:52). Since the mid-1950s, transportation industries and military forces throughout the western world have used a spelling alphabet called the NATO Phonetic Alphabet. Within this system, each letter of our Latin alphabet is spoken as a specific word beginning with that letter, so as to avoid confusion (especially over various forms of electric and electronic communication) between similar-sounding letters like "B" and "D", "F" and "S" or "M" and "N". The phonetic letters Whiskey, Tango and Foxtrot, for example, represent the Latin letters "W", "T" and "F". Combined as an acronym, "WTF" is often used today as an expression of extreme surprise, incredulity, anger, or some combination thereof, e.g., "WHAT THE F(bleep)?!?" (Ya feel me?) Accordingly, it is in this context that the film "Whiskey Tango Foxtrot" refers to the experience of a westerner becoming personally involved in Operation Enduring Freedom, popularly known as the War in Afghanistan or the Afghanistan War. It is also instructive to note that this film is oft identified as a war comedy, a label supported by the prominent image of popular comedienne Tina Fey on the movie poster and by the video clips and narration used in the theatrical trailer. In reality, however, this film is more of a drama than a comedy, a fact which should not necessarily imply a lesser degree of enjoyment in watching this film. (This ends the lesson. Here begins the plot summary.)WTF indeed! Living and working in a war zone is no joke. And it's not just the constant danger that gets you wanting to look to the heavens and shout those three letters (or the words they represent). It's also the culture shock, some of the ways that the military and other outsiders do things over there, some of the people you meet and work with, etc. It's all this and more that confounds, frustrates, infuriates and eventually motivates cable news reporter Kim Barker and also leads her to find the humor in the midst of any number of situations that most people would consider anything but funny. As an actress, Fey had help, as did screenwriter Robert Carlock and co-directors Glenn Ficarra and John Requa. This film is loosely based on the 2011 quirky and darkly comedic memoir "The Taliban Shuffle: Strange Days in Afghanistan and Pakistan" by former Chicago Tribune South Asia bureau chief / reporter Kim Barker.As Barker, we see Fey volunteering for an assignment as a war correspondent in Afghanistan. She has a steady boyfriend (Josh Charles), but she nevertheless feels like she's stuck in a rut and she needs a change. Her arrival in Afghanistan is quite the culture shock as she has to get used to wearing a head scarf whenever she's around the locals and is forced to "fix" her bright orange camera bag before she's allowed in a military vehicle. She gets help adjusting from Tanya Vanderpoel (Margot Robbie), the only other female reporter in the area, and from interpreter Fahim Ahmadzai (Christopher Abbott), a bodyguard (Stephen Peacocke) and a video guy (Nicholas Braun). Soon, Kim establishes a good working relationship with local Marine commander General Hollanek (Billy Bob Thornton) and she starts to do some gutsy reporting, gets some excellent stories on the air and even starts to enjoy herself.Kim's steep learning curve, however, is just the beginning of her challenges. Her gutsy reporting endangers herself and others, but she continues to take greater and greater risks to get the story. Then there's the problem of getting air time for her stories. She does excellent work, but as the Iraq War heats up, she finds herself covering what becomes something of a forgotten war. Still, she keeps plugging away. Her initial three-month-long commitment to her assignment becomes much longer, sucking her more and more deeply into a "new normal", which is actually anything but, and puts a steadily increasing strain on her relationship with her boyfriend back home. The separation isn't easy on Kim either. She finds herself attracted to her bodyguard, pursued by a Scottish photojournalist (Martin Freeman) and stalked by a high-ranking Afghan official (Alfred Molina) who wants to trade information for sex. Eventually, Kim has to make tough choices about her relationships, her work and her future."Whiskey Tango Foxtrot" is indeed a war comedy, but it's much more than that. Although a few small details don't ring true, most of this film looks and feels very authentic. If you've ever wanted to know what it might be like to be in or around the military on a deployment ? without actually worrying about bullets and IEDs ? this movie is for you. Yet, rather than a story filled with battles and danger, in between the few but well-done intense moments, Movie Fans will experience much more than they might expect by seeing the story through Kim's eyes and in the context of her personal journey. Casting Fey in the starring role ensures that the film remains true to the spirit of the book, and that the audience will be entertained by her usual wry, although toned-down humor. WTF is a comedy, but better. "B+"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first letters of the title's three words pretty much sum up my mixed reaction to this war-zone rom-com. What the? were producer Lorne Michaels and super comic Tina Fey thinking when, coming from Saturday Night Live, they offer a film that doesn't know if it's a drama or a comedy. Well, dramady works here.Kim Baker (Fey) transfers from her nowhere TV news writing to the hotbed of war in Afghanistan. With WTF trying to balance between the danger and horror of the Mideast battleground and Baker's uncertain love life, with its low-level melodrama, I was left with an empty feeling of getting neither into good order. If it weren't for cool General Hollanek (Billy Bob Thornton), there would be few distinguishing light moments. Certainly Alfred Molina's goofy character, Afghan Attorney General Ali Massoud Sadiq, can qualify as embarrassingly over the top.However, one of the better lines comes from rival reporter Tanya (Margot Robbie) when she greets Kim with the observation that "In New York, you're like a six, seven? Here, you're a nine ? ¬borderline 10." Tanya's face makes her about a 15. It's not brilliant comedy but good enough for TV (the home of several artists on this film).So we are left with Kim's little dramas that rest in mediocrity while the country burns. Her affair with Scotsman Iain MacKelpie (Martin Freeman) seems an add-on to please the romantics in the audience. Fey is always an engaging comedian, now dramatic actress, but I'm beginning to think her best work is behind her on SNL Yet, the array of spot-on music saves it</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Quixotically, while watching Whiskey Tango Foxtrot in theaters, the first movie comparison that immediately came to mind was 28 Days (2000). Not Catch-22 (1970) not Salvador (1986) nor any other pitch black war comedies that make bold statements with familiar conceits. This little flick is more aptly compared to a feel-good Sandra Bullock vehicle about an alcoholic forced into rehab. Maybe it's because there are a lot of comparisons in this film between drugs and making your mark as a war correspondent. Maybe its the film's half-solemn, half-realized message of self-actualization that makes Tina Fey's character able to adjust to different scenarios. Or maybe it's the fact that despite taking on a difficult subject, the film comes off trite and superficial.The film concerns itself with the exploits of wartime news correspondent Kim Barker (Fey) as she files her stories from Kabul between 2004 and 2006. When we first meet Kim she's living a life of quiet desperation, typing away at her news desk and submitting domestic story scripts for dumb pretty anchors on the evening news. With all outlet resources going to Iraq to cover the war there, Kim is chosen to pick up the afterthoughts in Afghanistan. While there she befriends veteran journalist Tanya Vanderpoel (Robbie), freelance photographer Iain MacKelpie (Freeman) and Fahim (Abbott) her translator and "fixer". As she slowly gains her barrings in the hostile war-zone around her, country-wise General Hollanek (Thornton) sees her as a liability while reluctantly taking her on missions through the mountainside.Let me be clear, Whiskey Tango Foxtrot is not a bad movie. The mechanics of the script works well, the characterization by Fey, Freeman and Robbie are on point and the cinematography keeps enough of a visual rhythm to tie everything in a nice, pretty little bow. The action sequences are a little sloppy, but you can't really blame co-directors Glenn Ficarra and John Requa for taking bold risks. There's a moment where a rescue team gears up and neutralizes targets to Harry Nilsson's Without You. It's an inspired moment and I appreciate their instincts but it could have been done so much better.My main issue with this film however has to do with it's off-putting melding of message and genre. Our plucky hero Kim goes through a character arc and completes her self-actualization within all the satisfactory story beats, yet what the movie never seems to get around to adding weight to is: we're still watching a movie about war. Despite the film's location and timeline, not one of our characters except maybe the General seems to mind their surroundings. Near the end of the film Fahim makes an off-hand comment about Ramadan while Kim looks blankly out her car window. This may have been added to clarify to the audience, but really it just makes Kim look ignorant about Ramadan rituals. This is despite Kim living in Kabul for two years. We as the audience are treated to extended moments of different cultural norms as well as end-of-the- world-type debauchery, witty repartee and the occasional IED all reacted to with the same dismissive shoulder shrug and not with any level of gravitas, existentialism or pathos.What could have been a challenging and engaging film about modern warfare ended up simply being a Tina Fey vehicle (no she did not write it) with a "I am woman, hear me roar" narrative. This is not altogether a bad thing, just not a plot worthy of similar films such as The Year of Living Dangerously (1982). Instead, watching Whiskey Tango Foxtrot was like watching Crazy, Stupid Love. (2011) through the lens of Jarhead (2005); it can be entertaining at times but mostly it just makes you cock your head and ask why?</fullReview>

Very good acting talent brings to life some interesting characters. I could point out the obvious talents of Billy Bob Thornton as a Marine general or Martin Freeman as photo journalist Iain MacKelpie, but I would definitely like to sing praise to Christopher Abbott as Fahim Ahmadzai who played a local driver in Afghanistan who relationship with Tiny Fey's charter, Kim Baker was beautifully done.I think what I like most is that it was a refreshing change up in a contemporary war movie, as we got to see the lives of journalist living and working in Afghanistan, rather than the usual soldier movieIt was funny, dramatic and romantic all at the same time. Just a perfect blend of everything that always kept the movie interesting and entertaining. Worth the price of admission.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A flawed comedy drama set in war time Afghanistan, the film has its moments, but a lot is left to be desired.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whiskey Tango Foxtrot is a film I truly wanted to like, its a got a great ensemble cast with the likes of Tina Fey, Martin Freeman, Margot Robbie and Bill Bob Thornton in the film, it has a novel story of making a comedy/drama set in Afghanistan wartime ( cause god knows another serious film on terrorism would have just been too much) so what goes wrong. Well a lot does, but the film does salvage some good comic moments, and good acting, but its just a lot was left to be desired with WTFT. It just feels the film was not researched well enough, like the film was a comedy not a parody on the war on terrorism in AFG. Like the parties that news reporters were having, and the way people walked so freely around AFG in the early 2000's, just didn't give the feeling of a war zone that AGF was then. And this is just the surface for some of the flaws of WTFT, but let me get into a in-depth analysis now.Story wise in 2002, cable news producer Kim Barker decides to shake up her routine by taking a daring new assignment in Kabul, Afghanistan. Dislodged from her comfortable American lifestyle, Barker finds herself in the middle of an out-of-control war zone. Luckily, she meets Tanya Vanderpoel, a fellow journalist who takes the shell shocked reporter under her wing. Amid the militants, warlords and nighttime partying, Barker discovers the key to becoming a successful correspondent.Acting wise Tina Fey is just a one track actor, and I can never takes her performances seriously and the same happens in WTFT. Whether the film be Sisters or this film she pitches the same act, with the same comic punches. And when she tries to act seriously (in many instances in this film), its unconvincing. She needs to up her game soon, before she starts to get typecast. Martin Freeman is good, but he doesn't get much screen time, all we get see him do is work his new Scottish accent. The same goes for Margot Robbie as mentioned for Freeman instead she uses a British accent. Bill Bob Thornton is the best of the lot, but he has a special appearance of sorts, so there is nothing to gloat about here either. Together however its a nice ensemble to see on screen.WTFT could have been a great film, its just that so much just went haywire for the film. Makers trying to make a film on journalism or news reporters need to watch Spotlight as reference. I know the film is a comedy drama but still showing news reporters doing cocaine at parties daily after a hard day at work in a war zone, is just stupid. The whole war zone angle of meeting political figures, and terrorists is just to easy for the news reporters in WTFT, real reporters wait for years for a phone call interview of wanted terrorist, and in WTFT your local terrorist is just one phone call away. These are just some of the obvious flaws the film had, its almost as though the makers did no research. Film has no realism for a film that supposed to be.The screenplay and script is muddled ( there is no coherent arc), and there is no character depth or real emotional depth in the characters in the film. The films pace in the 2nd hour is very snail like. The positives though few are enough to salvage some of the film. The films production values are amazing, AFG looked beautiful and the sets/locales accurately depicted a war zone.The film also had some nice action scenes especially the drone attack sequence, which looked very realistic. The comic moments are the films biggest ace as there are many comical moments that had me chuckling. For example the scene when Tina Fey's character realizes that the women keep destroying the water well ( and not terrorists), that the US soldiers keep fixing is hilarious. The films tone of taking war time lightly was very novel, and nice to see.Overall Whiskey Tango Foxtrot leaves a lot to be desired it a flawed film, but for films runtime ( well for most of the runtime) I was entertained with the comic moments/ idiotic moments, its a serious film to be taken lightly, but this a film you will enjoy more if watched at home, because then you won't complain you didn't get your tickets worth.3/5* Grade : 62%,C</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not A Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw "Whiskey Tango Foxtrot", starring Tina Fey-Sisters, Mean Girls; Margot Robbie-Focus, Pan Am_tv, Oh Yeah, she is playing Harley Quinn in the upcoming Suicide Squad; Alfred Molina-Secret in Their Eyes, Prince of Persia:The Sands of Time; Martin Freeman-Fargo_tv, Hot Fuzz and Billy Bob Thornton-The Judge, Fargo_tv.Contrary to the trailers for this movie, this is not a Tina Fey comedy. It does have Tina Fey in it and it does have some comedy in it, but the trailers are a little misleading. The movie is based on a book by Kim Barker called 'The Taliban Shuffle'. Tina plays Kim, a journalist for the Chicago Tribune, that gets talked into heading over to Afghanistan in 2004, to do some reporting. The real Kim stayed until 2009. Tina meets Margot, another reporter that has already been there for a while, and they become friends. At first, Tina is a little shook up and a little scared of the situation but she soon becomes more relaxed and even a danger junkie; When their caravan is taking fire from hostiles, she jumps out of her jeep and starts filming the firefight. Martin plays a Scottish photographer that likes Tina. Alfred plays a big political figure-I can't remember his actual title but he is like the second most powerful man in the country-and he likes Tina, too. Billy Bob plays a military commander that would take Tina out on the trips to document the war, and yes, he liked Tina, too. Heck, I really like Tina, myself, but not in this movie. There are scenes of night time partying at clubs or in the American bases after a hard day of engaging the enemy, and then they will usually end up hung over in some unknown locations or maybe in bed with someone. Like I said earlier, it's not just a straight comedy. It's rated "R" for language, drug &amp; alcohol use, war images and some sexual content-no nudity, except a derriere here and there-and has a running time of 1 hour &amp; 52 minutes. It's not one that I would buy on DVD. I don't think I would rent it, either. If you really want to see it, I would wait until it comes to cable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not your typical Tina Fey comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tina Fey was lead actress and producer. Directors: Glenn Ficarra and John Requa. Writers: Robert Carlock (screenplay), Kim Barker (Book: "The Taliban Shuffle: Strange Days in Afghanistan and Pakistan"). Notable supporting roles: (Billy Bob Thortton) as General Hollanek, a competent military leader. (Martin Freeman) as Iain MacKelpie a war correspondent and friend, (Margot Robbie) as Tanya Vanderpoela a war correspondent and rival, (Alfred Molina) as Ali Massoud Sadiq a bureaucratic buffoon.The heroine, (Tina Fay) as Kim Baker escapes her dull life in New York and must adjust to life in a war zone in order to overcome personal and professional obstacles. After enduring years of war she is shocked back to reality and returns to the USA a very changed person, more focused and down to earth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolute garbage</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have only walked out of two movies in my life. WTFh was the second one. Total garbage movie, save the time, energy, gas, concessions and ridiculous ticket price...you would be better off investing in a kidney infection. You might laugh a bit more with the infection.The story could have been entertaining, I believe, in the hands of someone capable of developing a character that is not based upon herself. The topic had potential, the premise could have turned into something of interest, but it was completely lackluster. If this is what the press corps actually does when embedded with the armed forces, I'd suggest they stay home permanently.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saw two excellent movies this week, but this was not one of them</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As my daughter would say, that's two hours I'll never get back. Personally, I love Tina Fey and this may be better than some of the movies she has made in the past, but that's not saying much. The movie was created to give you feeling of what it was like to be a newspaper correspondent in Afghanistan during the war, and it does a pretty good job of that, but there is no good story to go with it. Although the camera wasn't necessarily jumpy, I felt the movie was with a lot of chaos making up most of it. I told my wife after the first half hour there would probably be 20 minutes of an enjoyable move in here someplace. I didn't measure it exactly, but the last 15 minutes or so was pretty good. It's not worth the price of admission for that 15 minutes.The two excellent movies we saw this week were Revenant and Race. I highly recommend Race as an enjoyable time to spend two hours, and would give it a 7.5. Revenant, my wife and I gave a 9, but it is not for all tastes. A lot of it is gruesome and not easy watching. However, if your stomach is up to it, you prefer a really well made movie, and you can deal with some gore, go see the Revenant. It should be seen in the theaters.</fullReview>
