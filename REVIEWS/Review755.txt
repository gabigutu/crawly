		<shortDescription>Stereotypes at its best (or worst)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a big fan of thriller &amp; horror movies where the threat are real people rather than ghosts. Hostel, Saw, Wolf Creek are some of my favourite sequels. The Purge, with its intriguing concept, was also one of them... until I watched Election Year.Nothing wrong with the cast, movie style or effects. It's just that the stereotypes have become so annoying in this third movie! It would be okay if the director were able to make it more subtle, but since the movie is dumb proof, the persistent displays of "LOOK HOW WHITE PEOPLE ARE CORRUPT AND BAAAAD! LOOK HOW GOOOOOOD THESE POOR IMMIGRANTS AND DARK-SKINEED PEOPLE AAAAARE! LOOK HOW EVERYONE WHO COMMITS MURDER IS CRAZY - EXCEPT THE ONLY SANE, GOOD GUYS WHO KILL THEM." can get pretty annoying.What was supposed to be a nice date with the person I dragged to the theatre after months waiting for the premiere... became a stressful session of torture to the audience's intelligence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I wish I could purge this movie from my system</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love a good action movie. The last two "Purge" films were okay, nothing amazing, but I was willing to give this one a shot. Honestly, it was nauseating - not from violence, but from politicization. Regardless if a movie's political message resonates with me or not, if it gets to overshadowing the whole thing, then I feel it ruins the film. That was the case here.I was fully expecting cheesy one liners (trust me, plenty of those) and gory action, and if that's all you want from this film, then I think you'll like it. I wanted to be lighthearted and enjoy it, but it went sour from preachiness REALLY fast. I'm just glad that I went to a free screening - if I had spent my money on this, I would have been mad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A worthy contender for the Razzies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even though the first two 'The Purge' movies weren't all that great I still had a fun time seeing it and was interested in what this newest installment in the series could bring.The movie starts off with an uninspired news broadcast that sets up the story about a senator running for presidency whose goal is to abolish the annual purge (an event where for one night all crime is legal). The current government or 'The New Founding Fathers' want nothing of this and would prefer to have this senator out of the way.In the beginning of the movie the director uses some interesting lighting techniques whenever new characters were introduced where the way their faces were lit gave an indication on their moral standpoint is on the purge*. Sadly after a mere half hour these subtleties disappeared and what was left was a movie that just went from action scene to action scene with some poorly written dialogue in between.The characters themselves are also very bland. With only a few lines of dialogue their entire backstory is revealed and with these same lines the movie tries to get the viewer emotionally invested. This is not done successfully however and when things spiral out of control and the unavoidable does happen it is more likely met with laughter rather than tears.Blaming all of this on the dialogue would be too harsh however considering the acting is sub par. Often times lines are delivered in an almost laughable manner, although with a script like that you can't really ask much from the actors.Overall the movie was incredibly boring to watch and is a worthy contender for worst movie of the year (although I think Independence Day: Resurgence will claim that 'trophy'). If you've got money to spare then please save it for when a better movie comes out.My rating: 3/10* for instance the senators face is fully lit up when we first see her, while the faces of the government officials is fully dark on one side</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I enjoyed the 1st &amp; 2nd, but this is a lazy effort</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought the first movie was unsettling, and a great thriller. The second still delivered the goods, although it wasn't quite unsettling. But this one is a lackluster effort. Except for the climax in the church, there's nothing to recommend "The Purge: Election Year" With that girl attempting to shoplift, you can sense the movie is headed for an opportunity to be something, but alas, it is not to be. I have a feeling part 4 (and I read somewhere there will be) will be even less interesting than this one. There either needs to be an improvement, or just retire this franchise altogether. Any more mediocre efforts like this, and it might have to be retired anyway.** out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Purge goes political, at its own risk</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Purge: Election Year" (2016 release; 105 min.) brings the continued stories of the Annual Purge, set somewhere in the not-too-distant future. As the movie opens, we are treated to a "Purge playlist" (T. Rex; George Clinton). and we witness how a family is being purged by an evil-doer. We then are told "18 Years Later--2 Days before the Purge", as we get to know US Senator Roan, the sole survivor of the family massacre 18 years ago, and now campaigning to end the Purge. That is not to the liking of the ruling NFFA, a white supremacist-trending party. With Roan just 1 point behind in the polls, the NFFA decides that Roan must be 'taken care of' in the upcoming Purge. In a separate story line, we get to know Joe, owner of Joe's Deli, who confronts some teenage women trying to shoplift candy. We're 10-15 minutes into the movie at that point, but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the third movie in the Purge franchise, again written and directed by James DeMonaco. The sole returning character from the second movie is Barnes (played by Fred Grillo), who now has become the head of security and trusted right-hand man of Senator Roan (played by Elizabeth Mitchell, still best known for her role in the TV series Lost). While DeMonaco cleverly picks up on certain undercurrents in the political scene as we know it today, as well as mixes in other current themes (the use of drones), the movie takes a dangerous turn by playing up the racial card to the max, with the NFFA clearly patterned after the South African ANC's Apartheid regime. Political considerations aside, the movie does a good job of raising the tensions but for me the movie is also too predictable and frankly a bit too long."The Purge: Election Year" opened wide this weekend (to coincide with July 4, of course). The Saturday evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was PACKED, and close to a sell-out. Seemed like the audience was enjoying the movie, hollering and hooting at all the bright moments. I sorta enjoyed the movie, although something bothered me about playing up the political and racial undertones. As a social experiment, the idea itself of an annual 'approved' purge, remains fascinating to check, although I believe that if the Purge franchise is to go on, some new ideas are badly needed. Bottom line: this is till worth checking out if you liked the first two Purge movie. If you are new to this franchise, I'd still recommend the first one as the standard bearer of this franchise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another success; The Purge franchise hasn't messed up quite yet.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here we all are with yet another year of purging; The Purge: Election Year, or just The Purge 3 is a film that finds itself in assumption for the worse, but has actually managed to stabilize itself into it's third year, keeping solid, as well as keeping The Purge franchise followers happy.So knowing that the first film was pretty good, leading to the second that actually managed ( In my opinion ) to rise itself a bit higher.. this was exciting news to know another installment was coming, and here we are; This film was interesting as a whole. The film now takes upon the more deeper insight of the entire ordeal, the political standpoint on the entirety of the purge itself, and how it can be used to surpass wants. At the same time, the film, like the others in a way succeeds in bringing the audience into an adventure that revolves around the characters / protagonists as they are forced through the horrifying events that follow the entirety of the purge. With all of that being said, this film as a whole was intriguing. It had a pretty good villain to hero - type of plot going for it, and that stood out well for the entire film. We, the audience are overall sitting intrigued, unable to look away as we're greeted with surprises on every corner, challenge after challenge, and overall ordeal of action that strikes fear to those watching. The scenes of action were intense, and thrilling. Whenever such actions take place, we suddenly find ourselves watching an all out battle, wondering if anything drastic toward our main characters shall happen as we sit, intrigued; It was absolutely awesome, as well to see such events take place, and to see the film succeed in such levels, and portrayals of intensity and action. Aside from all that, on the other hand, this film seemed to take an even more interesting turn toward it's horror side of things. Throughout the film there we're greeted with a rather eerie, impending - doom type feeling; Of course, such vibes and such were given off in the other two films, but this one seemed to crank the level up a bit on that note, introducing itself overall with it, leading to it's success within it's eerie atmosphere, visual eye candy, and just overall events that were executed. Overall on such note, the film cranked up its levels in this one, which of course was a very pleasant surprise, and an exciting aspect for Purge franchise followers. This film felt more intense, and eerie throughout the entire length of the film, the action scenes, as well as events were executed intriguingly, and smoothly. And the Purge blood, gore, and even jump scares as well were well themselves. Another element that was extremely eventful to watch through this horror trip were the characters. From the senator, to the NFFA organization, to the purgers' themselves, it all stood out, and surprisingly enough lead itself into some pleasing twists, and turns. The main characters including The senator Charlie, the characters picked up throughout the film, Leo, and of course her overall competition / enemies each worked in unique ways, and all seemed to work with the story, and not just seem like a pointless character dropped off. It was extremely fun seeing characters such as Leo return, as well ( After being in the second film ) they had great roles, and truly executed their survival throughout simplistically. Overall, with all of our leading characters however, each had a heavy heart throughout the story, displaying their care for each other, how each of them connect, and look out for each other as a whole through the hellish ordeal; Sappy. Overall it was fun to see characters return, and watching them go through the twists, and turns of the overall purge was fun as well; The film succeeding in stabilizing their characters, keeping them from becoming boring, or worn out. In conclusion, this was a fun watch. A third installment that's assumed to suck - but ended up being just what the entire franchise needed. Fun characters, awesome portrayal of them as well, returns, unique personalities, as well as additions to the story that works. A turn - up within the topic of their gore, as well as shock value with how the kills are executed, not too much, but also not to little. And to top it all off, an interesting story that stays solid throughout, not seeming to give up with its twists, turns, and overall adventurous, yet at the same time eerie overall execution. The only real problem that stood with this film is the fact that it tends to drag on at times, the film became slow within the middle - to end parts; But every movie has it's moment like such. I feel as if Purge franchise followers, and overall fans won't be disappointed, instead pleased. This was a fun watch, I personally recommend experiencing it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was god awful. I expected it to be at least a little entertaining but its not. The trailer for the film pretty much spoils the entire movie. The acting is the equivalent to a pornography film and the cinematography is beyond terrible. It's a cliché cash grab that is not worth the money to see in theaters or buy on blue-ray. I even found myself laughing at how bad some of the scenes in this film are, specifically the ending where the whole thing is predictable. Hell even in the second act of the film, they introduce these "Candy Bar" girls who not even kidding try to kill a main character for a candy bar. The script is lazy and not engaging in any way. The tension completely drops as you realize the protagonists will always find a convenient way out of a bad situation. Deus ex Machina. Do not see this film unless you want to have a laugh with a couple of friends over how bad it is. It's really not a good movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>To Purge Or Not To Purge?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After a pretty effective but fairly muted debut with its first instalment "The Purge" franchise actually took a few very welcome steps forward with the much improved and thoroughly entertaining "Anarchy", a pretty rare feat at any point in time, but especially in today's prequel, sequel, reboot and remake flooded movie scene... That positive change came in large part at the hands of Frank Grillo, a genuine on-screen bad ass if there ever was one!So I was very much looking forward to the third (and final ?!) instalment of this franchise. But from its opening frames until the closing credits, "Election Year" proved to be a disappointment and a letdown. It is as far as I am concerned the weakest entry in the franchise!First of all Frank Grillo, who was the heart of the second movie, and a large reason of why "The Purge" franchise improved, is completely misused here and basically relegated to a glorified secondary character. "Election Year", is a messy and underwhelming creation of bad casting, bad acting, bad directing and writing. Too bad that this franchise stumbled at the end, and offered a most unsatisfying concluding chapter...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Purge: Election Year Continues to Explore a Great Horror Concept With a Heavy Political Slant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think it's cool that this franchise seems to be evolving to what the fans want. I didn't like the first Purge movie but I did want to see where the idea would go. So the movie going public seemed to collectively say "make another one but go bigger, show it on a national scale." That's exactly what they did with The Purge: Anarchy and it was much better. The Purge: Election Year is more about the political side. It's pretty topical and The Purge franchise has always worn it's politics on it's sleeve so you have to accept that going into it. With the election in the U.S.A. coming up, there is a lot of good material to tap into so I was eager to see where it would go.*Minor Spoilers Ahead* We actually start the movie pretty far back in the past. A family is tied up on their couch, they are bloody and bruised and have obviously been tortured already. The villain has a mask on and is rocking out hard. He's enjoying himself and talking about how careful he was in selecting specific songs for his Purge playlist. He tells the family that they have arrived at the final purge game, he tells them only one of them is going to survive the night and that the mom gets to choose. We then flash many years ahead of time (approx. 15-20) where the NFFA (New Founding Fathers of America) are running into problems. The word is out about the Purge, how the government is using it to eliminate the lower class. A political candidate running as an independent Senator Charlie Roan (Elizabeth Mitchell, Charlie was the same little girl from the opening) has gained enough of a following that she is threatening to win the election and to topple the current regime being led by Minister Edwidge Owens (Kyle Secor) and the NFFA. Leo Barnes (Frank Grillo) is the head of her security team. He supports her completely but he's annoyed by her disregard for protocol. Meanwhile, the NFFA are less than pleased for sure and decide to have her taken out on purge night.In the spirit of the previous film, we don't just follow Charlie and Leo. Also in Washington D.C. a shop owner Joe Dixon (Mykelti Williams) and his hired worker Marcos (Joseph Julian Soria) are anxious about the upcoming purge. Joe's purge insurance has been raised exponentially and he cannot rely on their protection. To make matters worse, there's a couple of teenagers with attitude to burn who are trying to shoplift from his store. If not from some help from Laney Rucker (Betty Gabriel) they might have got away with it. Laney is already busy on Purge night running a triage van, Joe and Marcos resolve to come back and protect the store.This franchise expands the mythology and keeps expanding it's world with each passing movie which is impressive. Sometimes when it comes to sequels, the studio and the creative team are just content to just repeat the same formula. Not in this franchise. In this one, people are travelling to the U.S. to be part of The Purge, people are trying to make money off it with elaborate costumes and offering services for money like body removal. It's cool that James DeMonaco and his team aren't just content to coast on what they've built and try something different each time.The Purge: Election Year also represents a change of genre. The first Purge was a straight bottle horror film. The Purge: Anarchy brought more action in but still was survival horror. Election Year is an action movie with horror aspects. There's a few cheap jump scares but anything that's meant to be scary is more through the imagery. I have to commend the people who designed the sets, the costumes and even the cinematography. The designs are more freakish and the costumes while outlandish are very creative and are creepy as hell.So while I want to keep heaping praise on this, I'll get into the more mixed aspects here. Starting with the plot, the direction they decide to take it in is interesting with the fight against the purge actually forming. The character development hasn't been the deepest throughout the franchise but I think this one takes a step back with the exception of Charlie and Leo. I just didn't care as much for guys like Joe, Marcos and Dante compared to the characters of the previous entries. I also thought the dialogue was pretty bad throughout. I felt bad for Mykelti as so much of his dialogue is very hokey and cringe-worthy at points. So while there's some new and interesting stuff in the writing, it's not all great and not every aspect of Election Year is exponentially better.I think that with the acting you get 2 really good acting jobs and the rest are a mix of okay to bad. Frank and Elizabeth carry the movie, they're the most believable and you want to follow them. I don't want to blame Mykelti and Joseph too much , they're saddled with some lacklustre parts of the script. The villains (the NFFA and the evil purgers) were overdoing it but in a weird way it fit the movie. This movie is far from subtle and their performances were consistent with that.When it comes to The Purge franchise, I think that Anarchy is still the best entry. Anarchy completely achieved what it wanted to achieve and was a deeper movie than you would think at first glance. The Purge: Election Year builds on the groundwork of the first 2 movies well even though it has some setbacks. With the heavy political message it conveys, it won't please everyone and I understand that. I'm up to see another entry though and watch where The Purge will go next.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Too much of a social message in The Purge 3. I would have liked to see more of the actual purge/sci-fi itself. The film could be interpreted as a G O P vs Dem social messages. Old, church etc, vs disadvantage, idealists etc. The film hits hard with a social message, with the same message, jokes, flat characters the viewer has seen in the last 20 years with movies and t v. The film ends with a happy ending. I would of loved a plot twist where the two presidential candidates duelled it out and the winner became president. Maybe the new president had a month long purge and made things even worse. The stunts, plot twists, loud mouth guy etc were predictable. More like a T V movie with flat characters. 3 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>White men are stereotyped to a new level. The hero is a white blonde who cares about "poor people" and uses terms like "over represented". More poor people are heroes talk. A room full of rich people say that they need to stop the poor from destroying them- all white men, no one Jewish, no one black, no one middle eastern- just those evil white men.A room of black people acting like stereotypes, one black guy saying "I only care about waffles and p***y", a sensitive hispanic guy who loves the liberal blonde woman, looks like he will cry at the TV showing the blonde liberal. I wonder if blacks will get offended by this, but judging by the black directed comedies that have come out recently, I doubt it. this is seen as "endearing".Since whites in the US have been stereotyped from the first second, they had to fly in some Germans to stereotype europeans as well. Blacks are peaceful, whites from anywhere are murder crazed...great messages.I think the only people not stereotyped by this movie are Jews, Asians, and native Americans. I would hope that no one would support this movie and its racial hatred towards whites. Facebook and youtube are now shutting down channels critical of the liberally correct hatred of whites and other type of liberal hatred, i.e. feminism's hatred of men. Now mass murdering whites is encouraged, cause their all rich right?!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With all immunities revoked everyone becomes game on Purge night and a bodyguard must protect his boss to help end the Purge one and for all. Whereas the first instalment was very much confined to one location and its sequel The Purge: Anarchy had wider city scope, in this third instalment it goes further in scale story wise, touching on the politics involved. Interestingly it also touches on tourist visiting to take part in the Purge.Elizabeth Mitchell (of TV's V) is perfectly cast as senator Roan who is campaigning for the Presidency and intending to end the Purge. Not only does she look the part,she is a convincing actor. While were not given any great further insight into actor Frank Grillo's returning Leo Barnes he gives a great physical performance as Roan's security head. Director/writer James DeMonaco offers some hard hitting violence and action, there's a good setup where the senator is betrayed and they have to make their escape. As a shop owner and his co-worker thwart an attack from the local female yobs who are lit up in fairy lights touting guns and disc cutters, they then help the senator and Barnes. DeMonaco injects some good character interaction and dialogue, with the on location feel adding to the city realism. Actor Betty Gabriel's Laney Rucker is memorable as she goes about helping both groups. Later after the senator is kidnapped - to be sacrificed at midnight Purge mass, Rucker and her anti-Purge team assist Barnes in a violent rescue attempt.DeMonaco's third instalment has plenty of night-time atmosphere akin to Anarchy's feel but even with the higher stakes, chaos, murder and haunting images on display it doesn't feel to have as much tension as the second outing. The ending while satisfyingly finishing of the trilogy does leave it open for future films with pro-Purge unrest. Nevertheless, it's a solid entry, if you enjoyed the first and second this will meet expectations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still an OK film to watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To begin with, this is the third part of the movie series called Purge. They all have the same setting, so I highly recommend watching two preceding films before. However, it is not mandatory. So, main idea of the film is that American government wants to reduce violence. Even though their intentions are pretty obvious, the concept of accomplishing the goal is unique. Creating "Purge" night, where every act of brutality and violence including murdering and torturing was allowed, supposed to cut down the level of crime during non-purge nights. Pretty interesting approach, huh? While first two films were mostly about characters who wanted to survive, this movie delivers us a "special" purpose. After so many years of purge, America has finally found an senator who wants to cancel "death" night. Her name is Charlie Roan (Elizabeth Mitchell). On the other hand, minister Edwidge Owens (Kyle Secor) works for the government and wants purge night to continue its existence. Debates, interviews and dialogues - all this we can see during first minutes of the movie. This part is pretty interesting and fits into the "rhythm".During actual purge night, unlike previous films, we see the goal - make sure senator stays alive. As we all know from Purge: Anarchy, the best guy to do so is Leo Barnes (Frank Grillo). Film provides us with basic plot twists and action scenes. Even though, movie involves intriguing personalities such as Joe Dixon (Mykelti Williamson), Dante Bishop (Edwin Hodge), Laney Rucker (Betty Gabriel) and Marcos (Joseph Soria), directors do not provide us with all needed background information so you can understand their motivation fully. Other characters are mainly considered as a "crowd actors". Film mainly consists of action scenes where we only have couple of minutes to be like "huh, that was intense". After that directors make us to jump into another location. Having a few drama scenes also makes it even a better thriller movie. But it still lacks atmosphere and because of fairly "obvious" goal the ending and plot overall is also pretty clear.To sum up, I would like to tell that I liked the movie. Despite it is not as well structured as typical good thriller, it gives us an adrenaline we need during all 100 minutes. On the other hand, I would not recommend to continue this franchise as it has said everything it needed to and making another film to "clear" all details is not worth it. Typically, I would give this film 6.5/10 marks which results in 7/10 on IMDb. However, Purge: Anarchy received 7/10 as well, so it is fair to give The Purge: Election Year its honestly earned 6/10 considering it has already gathered more than 70 million dollars domestically.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>expanding the Purge universe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Senator Charlie Roan (Elizabeth Mitchell) is running for President on a platform of ending the Purge. Her family was massacred during the Purge in her childhood. The NFFA revokes the Purge rule protecting high rank government officials but Roan refuses to add security. Leo Barnes (Frank Grillo) from the previous movie is now her head of security. Store owner Joe Dixon (Mykelti Williamson) is informed that his Purge insurance has been canceled. Roan is betrayed and escapes with Barnes into the streets where they are hunted.This tries to add politics to what started out as a simple horror franchise. It's making social commentary. The world of the Purge continuous to be expanded. There are fun Purge visuals. There are some fun action although I wouldn't call it a scary horror. It goes down some weirder paths which is interesting. One thing holding it back is that there is only one possible good ending and the movie would ignore it to its detriment. Roan has to die.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Propaganda Aside This Really Is Just A Bad Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So I'll start off by saying that I actually liked the original Purge, I know many people were expecting it to be a bit bigger and to expand more on the premise but I still enjoyed it and thought it was a pretty fun Horror/Thriller. Then the second Purge (which really wasn't a sequel, more of just a separate movie set in the same universe apart from one little tie in) came out and I enjoyed that one as well, however I thought it was a bit more cheesy than the original and it was really more of an Action/Thriller than a horror movie. I was pretty set with those two, I didn't think there was any need to continue on with the franchise, but we rarely ever get big release horror movies anymore so I decided to just suck it up and give The Purge: Election Year a chance.So the premise was actually pretty interesting, a Senator whose family was slaughtered in front of her on Purge night is running for president in an effort to stop the Purge. However from there things start to get really really stupid. Since her opposition wants to keep her out of office they decide to disband the law that protects political officials on Purge night, thus making her fair game. When this news is shared with the Senator she decides that instead of locking herself up in a safe house (which would keep her and her dream to stop the purge alive) she'll just put the life of herself and the lives of her security team in jeopardy by just hanging out at her house on Purge night. This is one of many stupid decisions made by the Senator, and that is one of the main reasons why I found it very hard to root for her. Luckily she has a bad ass security guard (the main character from the second film) who is there to rescue her when things go south on Purge night, from there the film basically just becomes a rinse and repeat of the second film. There is also a sub plot about a extremely cookie cutter deli owner who will do anything in his power to protect his deli.I think my main issue with the film is that the characters were just so cheesy and unrealistic. All the good guys who we are suppose to care for just ooze cheese and almost every line that comes out of their mouths is cringe worthy. The is one character in particular (the deli owner) who I found myself rooting against because he was just such a lame and unbelievable character, they actually tried to give this guy catch phrases. These felt like characters out of a bad action movie, and that's really what this film was at it's core, a lousy action movie in a horror setting. The villains weren't much better, at one point they try to pass off a group of obnoxious teenage girl as villains, the scenes with these girls were drawn out and extremely irritating, these characters belonged in a teen comedy not a R rated "Horror" film.All in all I thought this was a lousy sequel and that the Purge Franchise would have been better after just being two films. They basically just repackaged The Purge: Anarchy with worse characters and a little bit more of an expansion on the story. The worst part is they will probably make more of these, they will run this franchise into the dirt just like the Paranormal Activity franchise. My expectations were not very high, yet I was still pretty disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the worst movies I've ever seen. First of all so many parts weren't realistic whatsoever. For instance they know there will probably be a huge assassination attempt yet almost none of the main character's security wear body armor including her head of security. Then, her head of security gets shot in the shoulder and proceeds to shoot, reload and function as if nothing happened. Also throughout the movie he shoots one handed (same hand as the shoulder he was shot in) and hits targets no problem at 50+ yards with one shot. At one point he unloads a full mag and the slide doesn't even lock back when he's empty. Put this all aside and you still have obvious political points trying to be made. During the movie the talk about how keeping government spending down "lines the pockets of the rich" which is clearly false, how the purge "lines the pockets of the NRA" and even go as far as to have a scene in a church where people sacrifice live humans in the name of Jesus. I tried making it all they way through but ended up walking out early and getting my money back. Absolutely terrible movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great way to destroy a decent film series.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I actually enjoyed the first two films as they were thrilling and there were some parts that I found intense. The first based around a family under attack by two types of people, in there own home. Then the second is based around a man who wants revenge for his sons death but gets tangled up in other situations, which I found made it a fairly decent film.Then there is this third addition the the set The Purge: Election Year, it was firstly so predictable on what was going to be the overall ending to the film. Woman goes against the purge, rich guy who profits from the purge doesn't like that. Rich man get mercenaries to catch her, they fail cause of the bodyguard and then s**t happens and the woman survives it all. Whooow totally not enjoyable. I would say it is clichéd. Too many films have the same standard plot. Someone is wanted dead "the bad guys" try kill them and in the end they fail and "the good guys win". Yeah not all films are like that but most are and its boring.I personally found the film the best way to end The Purge. I want The Purge to go on. I like the films they were something to watch. I wanted Sen. Charlie Roan or Minister Edwidge Owens to be killed so that the ending had a twist to it and wasn't predictable. But the film has been made so nothing I saw will be taken into account.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first Purge was a good movie, tells the story of survival for one family on Purge day. The second movie is a masterpiece, beautiful scenes, great ideas and the all-night-er adventure. Grillo is set for success.So the Purge has given you unlimited stories to tell, you can do so much with this but the third installment turned out to be really really bad.Just to mention a few bad parts (spoilers) So the school girls are way to flat. She kills her mother and father and next on the list is the store clerk preventing her from stealing candy the day before, doesn't hold up. too weak. You only did that to show the pretty girls in cool outfits.The store clerk and his assistant hope that the purge will end, they don't want any part of it yet they point blank execute 6 school kids without hesitation. Very weak characters, no build up, nothing.The Nazi gang paid to deliver the lady wanted to bounce right after the delivery yet they stayed and shot down the place after for free. No way.What I'm so disappointed about is the characters and their stories. They are completely weak. I fell asleep in the theater and when I woke up near the end there were only my girlfriend and 2 girls in front of us, rest had left at that point. Horrible movie and I really hope you do something like Anarchy the next time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw the original 'The Purge' and would give that a 5.5/10. I certainly didn't think it was good enough for a sequel. so never bothered to see 'Purge 2' which by all accounts I didn't miss much. Went to see Purge election year expecting nothing much.If you suspend disbelief of the actual 'purge' concept (where on one day per year all crime including murder is 'legal') then its a reasonably exciting if predictable thriller/horror/action film. Senator Roan is anti purge, campaigning to abolish it. Her polls are rising and the establishment, worried by her potential election change the rules of the purge so no one is exempt. (previously senior politicians were excluded) Thereafter follows a somewhat predictable assassination attempt of the senator by mercenaries (on behalf of the government) aided by treacherous members of her own security staff (yawn) The senator and her head of security manage to get away only by heading out into the streets on purge night. What follows is quite exciting story how ordinary people help her try to survive the purge. The ending is a bit duh! Where the ruling class hole up in a cathedral for a midnight mass as quasi religious nutter sect celebrating the purge as some sacred order. Which made it rather ludicrous that they were supposed to be the government (reminded me of the villagers in 'Hot Fuzz' one of us, one of us) So the ending was a bit of a let down and re-hash of multiple endings from 'die hard' style predecessors (and much better films)It's an OK watch once, nothing special but not disastrous if you like the genre 6.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Trumped</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Politics is in a really strange place at the moment with such events like; Britain leaving the EU and the American Trump vs Hilary election. The Purge: Election Year, if you haven't grasped from the title, is a political horror action film that is anti Republican as well as the "Rich White Man." The third instalment of the Purge franchise follows Senator Charlie Roan, a woman who campaigns against the Purge and the capitalist party that support it as she runs for President in the US election... But of course the Purge still happens and this year Senator Roan has the worlds largest target on her back. With help from her head of security, Leo Barnes (or Sergeant as he was called in The Purge Anarchy) and an interracial community who run a deli, Senator Roan may have a chance at surviving the night.The political messages that Anarchy and Election Year have expressed is what, to me, makes the Purge film stand out. It's whats unique about this horror action film series. Although I do feel that Anarchy delivered its message of "it's not the black people in the ghetto who what you dead, it's the rich white people who run the country", far better and subtler. It's blatantly obvious that Election Year is a political film and the messages that were embedded in the previous film and verbally addressed in a less than subtle way. The films final act perfectly depicts the political bias of the film as; (SPOILER ALERT) the church setting, 100% white audience in the church, priest purging etc. are all obvious signs that the Christian, capitalist, rich, Republican, white man are the bad guys in this film and in life.The film's concept of a woman running for president with the goal of ending the purge intrigued me. I had hope that this film would execute its relevant plot just as well... But sadly I was wrong. Instead of a film focused on Senator Roan and Leo Barnes, we get a film that is too focused on the band of characters that aren't relevant for half the movie. This is my biggest issue with this film. To me, this film took its main story and pushed it to the back, instead focusing way too much on Joe and Marcos' relationship and the deli. The Joe's deli story line is a side story but it got the attention that the main story of a film would normally receive. I can't help but feel this film squandered its own potential, opting to tell a little story rather than the big picture one that the entire film is built around.As Joe, Marcos and Laney get a fair bit of screen time I can't help but feel that Elizabeth Mitchell wasn't utilised well as Senator Roan. Instead of really being a force-to-be-reckoned-with she is more of an escort mission objective in a video game. We are told of her risky nature and all that but she really only is precious cargo. This isn't the actors fault to be fair as her character just isn't given anything to do once Purge night begins.Overall, The Purge: Election Year is a political horror action film with a strong agenda but a misguided execution. The film had bags of potential but Writer/Diretcor James DeMonoco does a repeat of the first Purge, a film with promise that leaves you underwhelmed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>&#x2605;&#x2605; - disappointing 'conclusion' to the series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Considering the premise is so preposterous, I've always been relatively entertained and gripped by the Purge movies. It's quite weird, now that a real life Purge seems more likely than ever, that the third chapter in the series is much less convincing and stupid.The main thing that went out the window was the tension. The first two movies were very self-aware - they knew the premise was ridiculous, and the characters are always the victims of this ludicrousness. This time they've cranked it up, almost glorifying the violence rather than harrowing at it, the soundtrack playing cool rock guitar riffs during action sequences. The jumps are enhanced, but even the scenes roaming the streets are nowhere near as nerve-wracking as in the previous films. This, combined with the insane 'mass' thing, makes for a really unengaging two hours.The characters are much less interesting too. Mitchell in the central role as the mini-Hillary does a fairly convincing job of someone politically against the Purge, and adds an air of sophistication to a pretty unsophisticated movie. Grillo, reprising his role from Anarchy, does a fair amount of ass-kicking, though less mysterious and intriguing as last time. Williamson is also surprisingly likable, seeing as he's embodying pretty much every black guy stereotype, but the rest of the cast is amateur, unbelievable and dull.Following a pretty good first two, DeMonaco has undone the hard work with his third Purge film. It's all too shallow, flimsy and daft, with no scares and not enough grit.2/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Making a final killing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my review of The Purge: Election Year (spoiler free)*** (3/5)Cast: Frank Grillo, Elizabeth Mitchell, Mykelti WilliamsonPlot: America, 2025. As public sentiment rises against the Purge, ruling class the New Founding Fathers Of America target Presidential candidate Charlotte Roan (Mitchell), who's lobbying to end the annual lawless mayhem. She'll need the help of Leo Barnes (Grillo) if she's to survive the night.With his scary vision of a near-future United States where all crime including murder is legal for one night in order to keep the peace for the rest of the rest of the year, writer/director James DeMonaco has crafted a successful, thrifty franchise. As real-world America slides further into electoral madness, the latest Purge feels more apt than ever, even as it ramps up the terrifying politics and the slow-motion violence. Although Election Year comes dangerously close to repeating or even remaking the first follow-up 2014's The Purge: Anarchy we're once again out on the streets close to the action but this time in Washington DC, (weirdly filmed in Providence, Rhode Island) as opposed to Los Angeles, though at this it could really be 'Anycity, USA' as our heroes try to find safety. Barnes, Grillo's reliably relatable tough guy, must this time shepherd Mitchell's determined Roan through the madness to keep her political chances ? and, more importantly, her ? alive. The added wrinkle here is that the rule protecting governmental people has been relaxed, and the New Founding Fathers have not only paid off a chunk of her security detail, they've also sent a mercenary to take her out, because they enforce a new rule that will now make government officials of ranking ten vulnerable for the night, so now the New Founding Fathers will kill everybody who is involved.Set two years after the merciless killings in The Purge: Anarchy (2014) Leo Barnes (Grillo) who is now head of security for Senator Charlie, he and his employer has to survive as they put it "one last purge." This film takes you right into the action something that the first one failed to do now The Purge: Anarchy was actually better than the first although this despite all its craziness and its terrible scripting it is a very entertaining end to the trilogy, although not what you might have thought it was because writer/director James DeMonaco keeps the same style as he did in the previous it unfortunately fails to deliver one thing and that is an actual story, it just continues as a psycho killer film and all though it has pretty good action and good acting from Frank Grillo and Mitchell and fortunately down have to go down the romance route ? no time for love when you're on the run from a skull-emblazoned drone., it fails to deliver in everything else. It also decides to add not only torture which has a bad impact on the film but also adds a schlocky alternative to Trump vs Clinton not exactly a great way of putting it, but you get the idea. Good things about the film it adds a creepy song which is what many good horrors like Nightmare on Elm Street tend to do, but instead of "Freddy is coming for you" it adds a new spin and is put 'we are gonna purge tonight', in a very creepy tone which gives it a dark and edgy feel to the film. It's much more suspenseful because with the first one it had suspense but didn't do anything else besides that and the second one had plenty of suspense and action of course but lacked the craziness that this one has and although some killers come out dressed as previous American Presidents it does get more than that, but that is the start and the middle of the crazy. Weirdly enough in the first two government officials ranking above ten weren't affected during the Purge night, but now in this one everyone is affected but that's basically nobody wants Charlie Roan as the President so the killers try to make a killing to get rid of her, but don't quite succeed.Amongst the anguish and pain it decides to take a religious turn but instead of praying it makes it turn out that the people who don't kill are sinners as the film puts it, and although that idea is original it really wasn't needed in a film that was already cold hearted but this adds even more cold heartedness. We should really forgive this series for taking pride in creepy masks and world class warfare. This one is very problematic and simplistic but keeps the idea alive and although it may not be the best in a series that takes pride in senseless killing, it's still an enjoyable addition to the trilogy and a pretty good ending. This final film adds a killing end to the surprisingly successful B-movie franchise and maintains to keep the thrills and the entertainment just as well as the previous two. VERDICT: Election Year maintains the nervy tension that made the first film entertaining, but doubles down on the political metaphors, overwhelming you with its soap-box rhetoric. 6/10 an enjoyable conclusion</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Purge: Election Year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not a fan of this franchise, but I have to admit that it has got more ambitious with each new film. The Purge wasted its complicated (and too improbable) premise on a typical home invasion tale. The second film, The Purge: Anarchy, focused on the urban chaos. And the third part, The Purge: Election Year, (excessively) exploits the political satire which had barely been suggested in its predecessors. This doesn't mean that The Purge: Election Year is a very good film, but at least, it offers a more interesting and fluid story, supported by a relevant message... even though it's said on such an obvious and strident way that it's difficult to take it seriously. The ridiculous exaggeration employed by director and screenwriter James DeMonaco in every aspect of the movie barely surpass the reality; 3 years ago, when the original film was released, the Purge looked like a distant fantasy, but we are currently so close to that social collapse that an even more extreme screenplay is needed in order to return to the fiction field. The bad thing is that DeMonaco's narrative manipulations keep being weak and illogical: the heroes make inexcusable mistakes, while the villains vary between invincible and incompetent, according to the requirements of each scene; and the political rhetoric of the screenplay seems written by a first semester university student who has just read his first communist pamphlet. But, well... at least, the actors make a good work in their roles, bringing an appropriate balance of humor and seriousness. Frank Grillo brings a credible performance, while Elizabeth Mitchell is perfect as Senator Roan. And as common people trapped into the violence of the Purge, we have Mykelti Williamson, Joseph Julian Soria, Betty Gabriel and Edwin Hodge... they all play cinematographic clichés, but they still managed to bring humanity to their characters. In conclusion, I wasn't left very satisfied by The Purge: Election Year, but it didn't bore me and I found it superior to the previous two films, so I can give it a slight recommendation, mainly to the followers of this saga and public servers searching for spiritual peace because they aren't as evil as the ones portrayed in this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Predictable . If You've Seen The Trailer You've Seen The Whole Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original film in this franchise had a great premise but failed to do anything with the concept and I wasn't expecting anything with the sequel but was stunned by how much the production team developed the idea , so much so that I was genuinely excited to seeing the next film in the series which is a rare occurrence for me to get excited about upcoming film . As the trailers were released earlier in the year I did feel my excitement being negated and felt we'd be getting more of the same from a concept that with hindsight might not have much in the way of legs . Yeah the promos did feature some very topical satire about a female Senator and a right wing nutjob battaling for the future of America but seemed a little too obvious The bad news is that's exactly how THE PURGE ELECTION YEAR plays out . You could say the studio has been honest and constructed a trailer that is refreshingly accurate and what you see is what you get but is a backhanded compliment really a compliment ? Worse than that the trailer is edited in chronological order and there's no surprises . One great thing about ANARCHY was that the story revolved around the mystery and the enigma of the mysterious violent anti-hero who had his own motives for trawling the streets during purge night . Here there's no mystery or character development . Here Sgt Leo is a knight in shining white armour saving the Senator from the fascist establishment and purgers thereby trying to save America from its extreme elements . Everything is black and white and painlessly simplistic . Everyone is good or bad with no in-between and no ambiguity involved Being positive about this at least the dichotomy of the characterisation means no one is going to confuse the noble and genuine Senator Charlie Roan with any female politician running for President in 2016 so at least the film can't be accused of being cheerleaders for present American party politics . It also contains the occasional haunting image such as a body lying burning in a street , but there's nothing here that matches the impact of a burning bus driving along a road or the nail biting heart stopping tension of the hunting ground we saw in the second movie . Don't get me wrong ELECTION YEAR is still better than the original film and if you loved ANARCHY you'll probably like this one . The downside is that you had hoped for something a bit better and are left feeling rather disappointed by a rather predictable movie</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film had its moments but in all honesty it could have been a lot better. It was not as intense or as crazy as the second film (Anarchy) and it also had less Action than Anarchy did. I thought this film was just an Average time waster.its the type of film you could watch on a rainy day if you were bored but its nothing special. I don't like or Hate the Film.my feelings on this Film are Mixed.There were parts of the film I liked and parts that I didn't like.the film is definitely a mixed bag for me. Don't get me wrong I like Frank Grillo and he was a BadAss in the Previous film.I thought he kicked everyone's Ass in that film but in this film he has much Less to do which was disappointing. I don't understand why he hardly had any fight scenes in this movie.doesn't the director understand that's what everyone liked about the previous film?. You,d think he'd have put More action and More craziness in the film but instead he has Less.Don't get me wrong Frank Grillo&nbsp;kicked some Ass in this movie but there should have been more.I liked the Ending fight he had with the main Soldier bad guy.I thought the fight was okay and I liked that it was a knife fight,that made it interesting. I liked that fight and I still think we should have had more fights like that one Not Less. Overall I liked Franks character Leo I found the guy to be quite cool and his acting was good. The acting from the main six Actors was also fairly good.I small problem I had were the villains.I thought the villains were very Lame,as well as over the Top and Dumb. There were these two girls who got upset and had a temper tantrum because the guy who works at the store wouldn't let them steel a chocolate bar.can you believe that?. I also predicted what they would do and yes surprise surprise they come back to the shop on purge Night to get Revenge against a man over a Chocolate Bar!?. They try to kill him with a chainsaw and just like the first film these Girls act totally Demented and Stupid.it was obvious they were insane.One thing I did like in this film were the main characters.the Senator lady.Frank/Leo who is the Senator ladies body guard,I liked the two men who worked at the shop.they were cool and likable,and I liked the two young women that they were friends with. As well as Edwin Hodge and his group who are Haters of the purge.i thought the two women were also cool and likable and the character played By Betty is a total BadAss and she kills some bad guys in a very cool way.I also liked how they all worked together to bring down the bad guys.that was definitely one of the films good points.But sadly the film is lacking in the Action department its also predictable and cliché and the Film is Never that Exciting or engaging like Anarchy was.the writing also could have been a bit better.its also Never scary.to be Honest I found it more ridiculous than Scary.The Ending also could have been slightly better.Overall the film only has a few cool scenes but not enough for me to call this a good film. Its just an Average rainy day film that I would only recommend if you had nothing else to do.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here we have the third(and hopefully final)Purge film. Over the course of two movies and a few years, you would think that this movie would improve on the things that plagued the first two, but this one seems to get even worse in certain ways. First off the acting is really bad and almost laughable in a lot of scenes. Frank Grillo and Elizabeth Mitchell do an okay job and aren't too cringe-worthy but everyone else was expendable. I will say that Mykelti Williamson had a glimmer of hope until they gave him dumb, race related one liners that got annoying. The script also seems to believe that profanity=comedy when it does not. You'll have to excuse me for not being twelve, but I just don't think that repeated F,C,S and all other bombs are equivalent to decent writing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Purge: Election Year" is the deepest and most entertaining, but most overdone of the trilogy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2016. A presidential election year. Both in reality and on the big screen ? with high stakes AND what seems to be an increasing amount of insanity working its way into the process. 2016 marks the second time the GOP is lead by a candidate mainly known for his accomplishments as a businessman, the third time with a candidate named Clinton heading the Democratic ticket ? and the third time for a story about an annual 12-hour period at the beginning of spring during which all crime is legal ? even murder.As many questions as have been raised by the first two iterations in "The Purge" film franchise, writer-director James DeMonaco (accomplishing the rare feat of creating three movies in a single horror series) manages to find even more questions to ask in "The Purge: Election Year" (R, 1:45). For example, might such an annual event attract foreigners who would like to get away with murder for a night? (Yes. They're called "murder tourists".) Does insurance cover property against purge night destruction? (Yes. But they might hike up their rates at the last minute, even beyond what people can pay.) Is it possible for a politician to turn back the clock and end the annual purge? (Maybe. But it wouldn't be easy.) Senator Charlene "Charlie" Roan (Elizabeth Mitchell) is an Independent candidate for President running primarily on a promise to end the purge, mainly because of seeing her entire family murdered on an earlier purge night. She has the backing of a guy who actually has her back, her head of security, former police Sergeant Leo Barnes (Frank Grillo), who was stopped from nearly carrying out a revenge killing on a more recent purge night and now hates the brutal tradition almost as much as Roan does. Although there is a growing anti-purge movement, including a group led by Dante Bishop (Edwin Hodge, the only actor to appear in all three of the films), there are a lot of powerful people who want the purge to go on.On this purge night, the usual ban against killing high-ranking politicians is lifted. That puts Roan's life in danger. It also exposes the NFFA (New Founding Fathers of America) to being targeted themselves, but they have the money to hire plenty of security with plenty of firepower. When the NFFA turn their considerable resources against Roan, she finds herself on the run in the streets of Washington DC, trying to survive the night so she can (hopefully) win the election and make this the last purge night ever.As the usual purge mayhem unfolds around them, Barnes and Roan are saved from certain death by deli owner Joe Dixon (Mykelti Williamson) and his loyal employee, Marcos (Joseph Julian Soria). With their help and the help of purge night triage vehicle operator Laney "Little Death" Rucker (Betty Gabriel) and (later in the movie) Bishop and his followers, Roan and Barnes just might survive the night? but it won't be easy and it may cost the lives of some of the main characters. NFFA leaders like Caleb Warrens (Raymond J. Berry) and Minister Edwige Owens (Kyle Secor), Roan's opponent in the presidential election, have money, influence, superior technology and ruthless thugs like Earl Danzinger (Terry Serpico, looking like an evil Anthony Michael Hall) to help bring their nefarious plans to fruition.Like the pervious "Purge" movies, "The Purge: Election Day" is surprisingly entertaining and deep. The first film explored the idea of income and class inequality taken to extremes, but it just felt like an interesting one-off. A 2014 sequel added more action ? and made the franchise's theme more obvious (especially late in the movie), while adding the subplot of growing popular resistance to the purge. The third film throws its message right in the audience's face, but what it lacks in subtlety, it makes up for in even better story-telling. The plot is multi-faceted, but not overly complicated, and features some interesting twists along the way. Some of the characters are over-acted, parts of the script are unnecessarily crude and there's a distracting amount of blood and gore, but "The Purge: Election Day" gives Movie Fans plenty of engaging action and biting social commentary.

		<fullReview>You know what's funny (sad) about these Purge movies? They simultaneously make you believe in murder and hate it at the same time.Oh, boy do you want the assholes dead. Not just dead, but die a horrible death. But, we're lead to believe the Purge is bad. Given the choice, I would believe the latter and yet, want these horrible, despicable human beings to meet a wicked end.No spoiler, but the number one character I wanted to take it right up Main Street was the Candy Girl.According to my previous accounts, I hated and apparently forgotten the first in this series. I really, REALLY enjoyed the second one. That one was a nice way of taking the concept of part one and broadening it tenfold. This direct sequel to part two is still a good movie, but it needs to end here.Movie franchises never know when to quit. The Bourne Trilogy should've ended there. Terminator at Judgment Day. Saw with the death of Jigsaw in #3. But nooo. Studios see receipts and milk the series to no end. Please end this. It's getting harder and harder to see the carnage the twelve hours of the Annual Purge creates. Basically, this time around involves a Senator who is devoted to ending the Purge if/when she becomes President (hence the subtitle) but our AWESOME hero from part two must keep her alive during this year's Purge.If you don't know what "The Purge" is, you're a little late to the game. It's an annual 12-hour period where anything goes and no one's accountable for their wretched and criminal acts. Supposedly, in this alternative future, this cleanses people's darkest desires and keeps the remaining 364? days virtually crime-free.Like this franchise that I really would prefer to end here, I want 2016 to be over as well. I cannot wait to say goodbye to Independence Day: Resurgence, 2016's Ghostbusters, Pokemon-A-Go-Go and most definitely, the most whack Presidential Political race in history. Let's move on and bring on a more fun 2017!***Final thoughts: Trump won't win, by the way, but if there is one thing he does represent fairly well it's that he gives us great nostalgia for 1980-90s bad action movie leaders. He is the epitome of those over-the- top evil dictators. The saddest thing is, people still believe in him and this gives us insiders (to the movie world) a good laugh and sad cry.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pure anti-Trump, liberal bias, Hollywood muck. Garbage. Imagine if the reverse message were made into a movie? The whole country would be shouting and screaming "Nazis! Racism!" When it's reversed, perfectly fine. That's the thing about liberals. All bets are off if all the hate is against the guy THEY decide to hate. Liberal mentality and "logic" in a nutshell. Pure stupid in raw form. This movie is disgusting and those who like it are idiots, period.The only thing in need of an actual purge are the liberals who smear this fecal waste on our movie screens. And frankly, people never learn. Just as with Hitler, people are generally cattle and vote in their own demise, which is why this pro-HITLERy movie is just a symbolic piece of evidence of how 'murica will destroy itself and take millions of innocent lives with them as that filthy maggot HITLERy starts WWIII and all the libiots will wonder how and why and then find a way to blame someone else for their stupidity.If you have more than 10 brain cells, refuse to watch this movie out of sheer self respect if nothing else.Judging by the other reviews and the unfortunately high rating (and I consider anything above a 1 for this vomit a high rating), there are way too many brainwashed walking dead in this world. Zombie apocalypse? Just look outside or look at what Hollywood just puked out for the cattle-brained with this piece of filth. It's a full blown reality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best of the 3</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw "The Purge:Election Year", starring Frank Grillo-The Captain America movies, The Grey; Elizabeth Mitchell-Lost_tv, Frequency; Mykelti Williamson-Justified_tv, Con Air and Kyle Secor-Veronica Mars_tv, City Slickers.This is one of those love it or hate it movies. I love them. In case you missed the other 2-or are unfamiliar with the action/horror franchise-it takes place in the not-too-distant future of 2025, where the NFFA-New Founding Fathers of America-have instituted a yearly 'purge'. On this one day, any crime is legal for 12 hours-sunset to sunrise-with most people preferring murder. The only exception is government officials. You can't just walk up to, say, the President, and shoot him. All 3 movies are written &amp; directed by the same man, James DeMonaco, the first in 2013 and the second in 2014. Basically, the government uses the purge to keep crime and the population under control-pretty much taking out the poor, lower class since the richer people can afford fortresses to hide in or bigger guns to hunt with. Frank plays a secret service agent that is assigned to protect senator Elizabeth, who is running to become President on a platform that she will eliminate the purge. Kyle is her opposite; he is a proud NFFA member and wants to continue the tradition of purging, so he too wants to be President. It seems that the NFFA do not want Elizabeth to win so they plot to take her out of the equation, during the purge. And to do that, they suspend the amendment to the purge about government officials being exempt. Open season on everybody! Frank must spend the night trying to keep Elizabeth alive so that she can win the election and get rid of the purge. Mykelti is a sympathetic shop owner that helps Frank on his obstacle course of death while they are evading Neo-Nazis mercenaries hired by NFFA plus the regular purge participants. If you liked the others, you should enjoy this one, too. It is rated "R" for bloody violence and strong language and has a running time of 1 hour &amp; 45 minutes. I really liked it and I think it's the best of the 3. I would buy it on DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Did not enjoy this movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had no idea what I was walking into or what this movie was about. I just went along with some friends. Previews typically tell you what kind of movie you're about to watch, so I paid attention. I saw 2 horror previews first, followed by some comedy/action. Anyway, it starts out looking like a pretty decent/frightening horror movie. After about 2 min, it quickly goes another direction. Apparently, the government, the "new founding fathers" creates a system where once a year, society has 12 hours without laws where you can murder, rape, and do whatever you want, "purging" society of the excess. Other than Elizabeth Mitchell, the acting is pretty horrible. The plot is very typical, unrealistic, and does not follow a smooth path. The strange side "candy bar" plot was ridiculous. The black deli owner told horrible racist jokes throughout the movie, and the "elite" government officials were cartoonishly evil (worst being the priest, getting off to stabbing some guy). Overall, very basic and not well thought out. Even the fight/shooting scenes were mediocre at best.</fullReview>

A group of black and Hispanic people were the heroic saviors and the loving and caring people...a couple of white people thrown in the background. Moral of the story...white people are horrible, crazy murders! This movie was so silly that they even to the quote "that's the pot calling the kettle black" and changed it to "that's the pot calling the kettle brown". Seriously?!

		<fullReview>I was expecting this movie to be hot garbage and I certainly wasn't wrong, but frig, I was unaware that a movie could be so offensive to such a degree. The directing was terrible and amateurish with awkward cuts and mystifying editing choices. The characters were terribly sketched as I could barely remember their names by the end. The acting was just awful like for goodness sakes do a couple more takes maybe, try something. The plot made no sense as it was mostly ridiculous and random purge visuals along with pointless side plots (candy bar anyone?). It was very clear that the director thought of something he thought would look cool and put it on screen. It wasn't hard to tell that plot was a secondary factor. There was a certain character who was introduced and given a little bit of time but was quickly and unceremoniously killed off in a ridiculous way that only killed him somehow. I guess they couldn't have the screen filled up with too many deep or racist characters. The founding fathers were cartoonishly evil, and set the precedent right away for the horrible acting. I almost forgot about the opening sequence with it's jarring editing, its only purpose being to provide backstory to a character which is pointless. I say that because this movie is not about the plot; oh no frig the plot this is about random and stupid violence throughout. The "good guys" don't seem overly concerned with sparing lives as they brutally stab and murder unaware people who could of easily been taken down with a knock on the head. That's really what it's all about though is captivating the stupid audience members who are cheering for blood. Look around at some other reviews; anyone who gave it above a 7 is not someone you want to be associated with. The movie is just so undeniably bad and made for the lowest common denominator it's disgraceful. This is all without yet mentioning the totally offensive token black character who is an awful stereotype to be in a movie coming out in 2016, and is only there to be comedic relief for the more racist people in the audience. Good lord some movies really do take a piece of you that you can't get back and this movie took a chunk for sure. Easily one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Just an awful combination of racism, terrible acting and directing, pointless plot, and thoughtless violence that combine to create absolute cancer. I'm disgusted.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Election Has Truly Disturbing Bite</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the holiday coming up, the movie industry is doing its best to rope people into the theaters. You would think something patriotic like a war story, a biography of a founding father, or some type of political coming of age movie. But my first review is on a horror instead?that has to due with politics. My review is on The Purge: Election Year, the third installment in a series I never expected to have this much ground. Yours truly heads into the trenches to provide you another review and help guide your thoughts on how to spend your tickets in the theaters. The GOOD: ? Comedy ? Semi Decent plot ? SuspensefulThe first point has to be a surprise, but yes the Purge: Election Year has some decent comedy to lighten up the aggressively somber mood. I mainly laughed at the commentary from Joe, a local deli shop owner with an interesting background on his own. Joe's lines are a menagerie of one- liners, quips, and racial banter that had the audience laughing. Despite some of the intense moments, the writers made the lines very tasteful, making sure to add a fun edge that hopefully won't insult the masses. Some of the other characters have their moments as well, timed equally well to maximize the laughs. But you didn't come for laughs, you came for suspense that the night of legalized murder has provided in the past. You might think that a third installment has lost its edge, but surprisingly Election Year keeps the same on the seat moments as the last one. Like its predecessor, this movie takes our characters onto the streets, each forging their own path through the chaotic forest of crazy violence. I was pulled into the movie not by the mindless killing, but by the wonder of which member of the merry band would bite the dust. Part of what helped this was a semi-decent, albeit rushed, plot that had a little more backbone than mindless murder. Election Year's plot brings us further down the rabbit hole as to the point of the Purge and fills into those pot holes left at the end of the second movie. It's nothing special, but the character profiles were what kept my interest and fostered a bond with all the characters. The BAD ? Pointless cursing/overacting ? Violence substituted for plot ? All the political issues it can drum upNo surprise, but a Rated R movie is going to have cursing, I get that I do. But as always the case, our writers get a little overzealous with dirtying the mouths of characters. Election Year unfortunately is not spared that fate as characters, mainly extras, fill their roles with overacted, dramatically-emphasized cursing that is more annoying than anything. I know it is to make you hate the character who will certainly die in the end, but they could have done it without such grandiose tactics. The silver lining of this, it is for limited run times so yay for that. A second weakness for me, is substituting the violence for the plot. Now don't rip my head off, it is the Purge, a holiday that is only about violence and celebrating death, of course there will be violence. However, the Purge really needs to drop the glorified torture scenes and disturbing dances of craziness to provide more kick to their tale. That doesn't mean get rid of it all, after all there were plenty of jump at you moments where the violence was perfect, but Election Years tangents showing mask-wearing extras dancing or setting an elaborate trap that really doesn't work. This is another example of editing not eliminating all unnecessary scenes. But perhaps the biggest weakness for me is the political issues this movie is sure to spark. Back in the day, you could make a movie like this and not start a revolution, but modern times have left our people a little more easily offended these days. The Purge's overdramatic antics, dialogue, and factions are certainly going to divide people and perhaps incite their own revolution on some level. All of the excessive violence, racial slurs, and political issues are over glorified, and I saw these effects take fruit in my theater with a few overzealous fans. So why did I bring this point up? Two reasons. The first is the political rants and corrupt speeches are cheesy, overdone, and eye rolling. The second is that if you are easily offended, no matter how much you like horror, you should not see this movie. The VerdictDespite being a third installment, The Purge Election Year certainly brings the same bite it always has. Yes, it is overdramatic and glorifies violence, and at times is certainly reflective of a mad man's mind. However, as far as horror movies go, it is surprisingly decent in terms of plot, action, and suspense that will entertain many of this genre. With interesting characters and a fast moving pace, you certainly won't be bored for the 105 minute run time. Necessary for a trip to the theater? Not really, but those who love the dive into the mad realm of murder, will certainly enjoy this tale. My scores:Action/Horror/Sci-Fi: 7.0 Movie Overall: 6.0</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Regrettably, I haven't seen the previous two purges as the premise sounded ludicrous so there'll be no comparison with the prequels, but I'm sure this can be reviewed as a stand alone film. What I do know is that all three films are written and directed by James DeMonaco and there's a hint something has gone on before with Frank Grillo's character but wasn't enough to make me wonder what was happening, instead I am intrigued to what went on before.&nbsp;You get the gist of the main story simple enough but it's just such an unbelievable idea, however, having watched this it does make interesting cinema and reminds me of films like Judgment Night, The Warriors, The Crow and consoles games like Freedom Fighters and the more recent Tom Clancy's The Division, demonstrating the sadistic side of human nature.&nbsp;Senator Roan, played by Elizabeth Mitchell, wants to make a change by ending the purge and bring down the powers behind it; which obviously puts her in the firing line by the nations blood-thirsty, murder-maniacs and tourist killers. An attempted assassination turns into a run for survival with Grillo and a few other peaceful sympathisers.&nbsp;There's good tension, fast-paced action and was actually better than expected. I enjoyed the film for its dreamy illuminated pieces, costumes and action. Though there's a couple of jumpy scenes and to what some might consider disturbing, I wouldn't go as far to say it's all out horror but a dark thriller, yes.&nbsp;The whole cast perform well enough, and there is a good character balance between Bubba Blue Mykelti Williamson and the main leads; but I felt there was a lack of emotional investment and the script could have been better, even with the good, dramatic score from Purge regular Nathan Whitehead.&nbsp;Still, it's not a bad film and it has urged me to watch the previous two.&nbsp;"Good night, blue cheese!"&nbsp;Running Time:&nbsp;7 The Cast:&nbsp;7 Performance:&nbsp;7 Direction:&nbsp;7 Story:&nbsp;6 Script:&nbsp;6 Creativity:&nbsp;8 Soundtrack:&nbsp;7 Job Description:&nbsp;9 The Extra Bonus Point:&nbsp;064% 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Election Year is a solid purge but once again works better in concept than execution...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Purge: Election Year takes a lot of glee in exploring the twisted nature of the annual tradition, often fetishising the brutality but never using it overtly - yes, there is a lot of blood but never uses it too graphic or dwelled up, avoiding the gratification most horrors employ. Instead, it takes aspects of both the horror and thriller genre to satisfyingly jolt audience between the two, crafting another potently satirical cultural critique, mixed in with the mindless mayhem that ensures it moves at a thrilling pace (when it gets going, that is). It still is frustrating to see a franchise squander so much potential on another 'good but not incredible' film, but that shouldn't take away from the fact that this is still one of the strongest genre entries from the past few years, and a franchise that continues to find things to say, even if it doesn't go about saying them in the most effective way. While Election Year closes on a somewhat conclusive note, the possibilities for further instalments are endless, and with renewed inspiration and dedication, could continue the upward traction The Purge series has experienced over the course of their neat and chilling trilogy.Summary: Election Year, rather unsubtly, captures a timely zeitgeist, and while the franchise continues to work better in concept than in execution, it still manages to offer another thought-provoking and exciting instalment in this unashamedly exploitative and savage franchise.FULL REVIEW: http://perksofbeingnath.blogspot.com/2016/09/the-purge-election-year- 2016-review.html</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't listen to all of the negative reviews. This film was great.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As an avid lover of both the first and the second instalment of The Purge movies, I read the reviews before watching The Purge: Election Year thinking it was going to be less of a horror film and more of a politically driven plot. Still, I went in with high expectations and they were met.This film - though one of it's major themes is political - is fantastic. It shows many purges and at times is highly disturbing, which makes it a great film. The whole idea of The Purge is eerie in itself and this film shows (as well as the others)that people will kill for anything and most will enjoy it. However, this film shows that many people are tired of the annual event and losing loved ones is pushing them to retaliate.I must applaud the people who created the costumes; every single piece of clothing the purgers wore was haunting and the masks, well, they were brilliant and effective.The acting was brilliant, the story line was brilliant. The dialogue as well was excellently disturbing at times. When you see it, you'll know what I mean.I loved this film, I actually thought it was better than the second one as it did show more (even if they were glimpses) of different purges, but they are all fantastic films so they all get a 10/10 for me.Go see this, enjoy it for what it is. It's not realistic, we will never have the annual Purge available for us in the future so enjoy it as a movie. The concept is original, it shows that we are primitive in nature and given the opportunity, many of us would put those 12 hours to use.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not a fan of this franchise, it just seems like it's trying to be a American take on the classic "Battle Royale" film. Except this time the plot takes place before the election. With one of the candidate being against the Purge and the other who is all for it. So a group of people who are against the Purge is trying to protect the candidate that is against the Purge. So that she could win the election and put an end to the Purge. During the Purge, against the crazy civilians and the other candidate's team with guns. I liked the political satire on hiding behind a political scheme of getting rid of crime. But basically trying to benefit the rich while wiping on the poor and the defenseless. But What I didn't like was how it was portrayed in this movie. All the political parts was just so darn boring to sit through. And made the movie drag, more than making it thought-provoking on certain issues. I just wanted it to get straight to the Purge with fights breaking out between people that are all in it for the Purge and people that are against it and wanting to just survive through the night. I know they were trying to stick to something different from the 2nd installment, but the political parts was boring to sit through. I think if they added some more development with the characters and some psychological elements it could have benefited this film.5.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good background movie, but total predictable nonsense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly, if you ever find yourself in a position where you truly have nothing better to watch/do than watch the Purge series, then start with the knowledge that the films are absolute nonsense. The concept is nonsense. The logic is nonsense. The story line is nonsense. The Purge: Election Year is absolutely a film that despite its attempts, cannot, and should not be taken as a serious critique of modern American society. That being said, the film relies on lazy stereotypes of minorities (who are swiftly killed off protecting the white senator) and monotonous bonding scenes in the middle of predictable and repetitive shooting and kidnap scenes. The film is a truly underwhelming and thoughtless piece, that attempts to gloss over it's shoddy story line by attempting to make a point about the NRA and gun violence in America. What this point is, however, is entirely unclear as the film is based in a universe based upon logical fallacies and bizarre notions. The story line itself is lazily put together and ill thought out. If you're looking for a film that showcases everything from a ludicrous scene where a young girl is driven to murder over a chocolate bar to a bizarre Christian ritual murder attempt of a US senator, then you've found the film for you. For all the hype, and heavy spending on advertising however, this film truly fails to deliver time and time again. The acting itself is very average. To be fair to the cast, the characters they play are shallow and cookie cutter. You have everything from the overly masculine secret service hero, who distrusts everyone and brushes off getting shot like its no big deal, to the poor, black shop owner who can't afford insurance for his shop on purge night (they kill him off obviously). I wouldn't hold my breath on an Oscar going their way any time soon. The film as a whole is something that I would recommend only as background noise. I certainly wouldn't bother watching the entire series, as once you've seen one, you've truly seen them all. The only real redeeming feature of this film is that it's the last in the series, so perhaps if we act fast we can purge it from modern cinema lest the next generation stumble upon this disgrace to Western entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Purge Series-Part 3: Election Year.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Finding the second title in The Purge series to be far better than expected,I was happy to recently find out that Frank Grillo was coming back for the third flick.Since having not seen her since the role she played in the peak years of Lost, (which itself got lost in the light terribly cheating TV endings) I was surprised to spot that Elizabeth Mitchell had a lead role,which led to me getting ready to go on a third Purge.The plot-2025:Watching her family get killed on Purge night 18 years ago,US president candidate Charlie Roan vows to make her first act as president be bringing The Purge to an end. Helping to bring The Purge into existence,The New Founding Fathers of America (NFFA) get Edwidge Owens to run against Roan as a rival. Since surviving on the purged streets, Leo Barnes has been leading security to keep Roan safe. Fearing that Roan may win,the NFFA decide to change one of their oldest rules just before the latest Purge is to begin,by making it legal for politicians to be killed.View on the film:Whilst some of her dialogue is a bit goody two shoes, Elizabeth Mitchell gives her performance as Roan a real flair,who Mitchell pushes into the midst of action,and makes sure that Roan's firm backbone remains visible. Coming back for a 2nd round, (with an appearance from Edwin Hodge making him the only one to appear in all 3 films) Frank Grillo gives a great,hard edge performance as Leo Barnes,with Grillo hitting the action scenes with an energetic fury,and also dicing Barnes with a new,fragile shot of optimism.Going from the suburbs in the 1st to "da street" in the 2nd, returning writer/director James DeMonaco &amp; returning cinematographer Jacques Jouffret purge on the political stage.Kicking off with terrifically quirky songs, DeMonaco and Jouffret limit the Horror shakes to chilling side-tracks ,lit in stark,saturated colours giving the terror a rancid,acid mood. Smoothly returning to the action thrills, DeMonaco gives Roan's fight for survival a delicious neon-lit atmosphere,where splashes of yellow and blood are thrown across with slick chases and tense Mexican stand offs.Gathering up major themes from the first two,the screenplay by James DeMonaco delivers the most open political statements of the films,from DeMonaco taking great care to show the ethnic minority working class to be the ones to suffer the most from the yuppie and old white dudes Purge,to naming the NRA as one of the groups to benefit from The Purge.While having noticeable plot holes, (why are none of the anti-Purge groups protecting Roan's house?) DeMonaco keeps the explosive action smoothly flowing with vicious satirical horror,thanks to Barnes and Roan battle to the political stage moving at a whip- fast action pace,as anti-Purger Roan finds herself the centrepiece of The Purge.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Same Purge, Another Title.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The idea of The Purge seems to be more real in today's society than ever before, what with the meme's going around and all the negative talk surrounding Politics. So, naturally, Universal had to create a movie titled "The Purge: Election Year" to showcase what The Annual Purge would like in that time. I really enjoyed this movie but, I really enjoyed the first two as well and the overall idea of this movie hasn't changed from film to film. Yes, their are different characters and slightly different plot lines but, for the most part what happens on Purge night stays the same. People die horrible and terrible deaths. The one thing I did absolutely love about this movie are the characters, however, I'm not talking about the main characters but rather the random people roaming the streets looking for others to kill. These characters are absolutely psychotic with the way they talk, laugh, smile, etc., and I have to say every single one of them was brilliant. I don't think psychotic is an easy part to play but they all made me feel scared. If I was on the street with any of them I would want to run away and I think that's the way the characters in these types of films should make you feel. In terms of watching the film from beginning to end the plot did increase in suspense as the film went on and ended with an ending I was definitely not expecting. However, aside from the suspense I felt like I was watching the first and second Purge all over again with minor changes and that is the reason I gave this film a six. I do understand that it is difficult to make the plot more complex with the story line is so simple so, you just have to take The Purge for what it is. Overall, if you are a film watcher who likes diversity within a series I would not recommend seeing this movie in theaters. For all you film watchers who loved the first two, like myself, I would recommend going to see this movie in a heartbeat. However, please leave your little ones at home, I had a three year old sitting next to me, and it wasn't mine, who was crying because they were so scared!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An (p)urge to quit.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**** May contain strong spoilers ****This is a review made by StoneDraim... and that means that if you want to read a probably different kind of review, keep reading....This is my personal experience, my personal point of view/perspective and my personal opinion... and my opinion is just one of like 7 billions in this world.The first scene feels like it is pointing into a forced script and an attempt to give "The Purge" series more life. Na....this seems little down the drain, from the others. It even has some soundtracks snippets and effects that tries to convey and enhance too much. Why is that? Well.... ask such as Quentin Tarantino, Michael Mann and Steven Spielberg... too just throw out three there. (The writers behind "The Purge : Election Year" try to polish a little bad script instead of writing it really good.)This is a massive nod to the election in America and the situation evolved around Donald Trump. The highest voices for a change in this movie is... yes, that is correct... immigrants, minorities.... and also a lot of prejudice here; "coloured" human beings (we all have one colour or another colour). And a military force called "White Power". Kind of cheesy the way it is presented. I thought mankind had come a lot further even in the movie world. (I sense a feel of forced moral in myself when writing the following: When shall we allow everyone to be the one they want to be? When should we allow everyone look like they want to and come from wherever they come from?)There is a blend of good intentions and bad acting divided with some horrible ways of building up the momentum... such as slow motion in the wrong places. A man throws an apron devastated over the purge and... there....boom....slow motion. Well...... it could have done a lot better.The Purge has grown into a distorted social experience mixed with devastation and a little taste of how the world is closing in to a disaster. The harsh environments and messages going all along has gotten too much. This gives me the feeling of "Saw". There is one little story, one little thing that the production team pushes forward to the maximum. And... that is a bad thing. Can you tell one story three...four....five times before it is getting boring?A couple of scenes is so far off. A security guard has to comply and program a few codes that indicates that it is maximum security and safe all through. And then.... the door opens and it is just an ordinary wooden door. Now...that is one of the biggest goofs (intended?) and script mistakes I have seen in a loooong time. One more scene.... this is just....no! About 1 hour 15 minutes into this one; a giant axe is swinging like a pendulum about 1,5 metres above the ground. and still... the agent and the senator count when to run when they simply can get on their knees and crawl...? Did they throw the book of logic out the window when making this movie? Frank Grillo plays Leo Barnes, a stone cold agent holding up to the senator. Still... in the end of the movie...he does a "great-job- vertical-bump" with Joe Dixon (Mykelti Williamson)? That is just way out of the character written as Leo Barnes... and...it is even enhanced with camera movement. No. I will watch another movie. Glances of poor "like F-movies" with a low rate here and there in "The Purge: Election Year".What would happen if you mix up a blind "religious" denomination/cult and the conviction from the German leader in 1945...? They try to gather 'round it here.Over to the movie as a product: - The production : Some good acting... some good production. I would write more if I had the motivation from the movie. - The actors : Almost.... almost approved throughout. - Entertainment : Third time...same story. I want something fresh. - Age : 15. Killings, cruelty... and more.4,6 out of 10. (The final rate is based most on my own entertainment of the movie. Short elucidation of the rating: 5 Approved. 4 Failed. Lacking in character.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Airless but screams guilty pleasure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here's what I seem to get out of the Purge movies up at this point, on account of not being a fan of any of them. So far, the whole point of The Purge trilogy is to construct an alternate world that allows one night to commit any crime they want without penalty in order to commentate on real world tendency to go full anarchy mode at any moment. That's fair enough, but here's what I don't get: these movies constantly make it clear how BAD it is ? even go as far as to blame the Purge on the One Percent making money out of the working classes insurance ? yet they have no problem glorifying it either? Seriously, for all its jabs aimed at the demonized right wing rich guys profiting off murder, it all feels like an excuse to show director James DeMonaco's tendencies to film what should be classified as flashy montages of music videos saying basically "LOOK HOW AWESOME YET AWFUL THIS LOOKS!" At that point, it's reasonable to explain how contradicting all that is, but this honestly seems like it's the series lasting charm, however, odd it may be. In the case with The Purge: Election Year, it's a film that clumsily tries to mix political allegories with gratuitous money shots of murders and carnage straight out of a Michael Bay-produced playbook, but with an extreme passion for doing so that it gradually sustains itself into being its own fascinating hybrid. This time around, it immediately draws parallels to the current presidential nomination, to which a blond woman runs for in order to discontinue the Purge. This doesn't bode well for the rest for the rest of the city ? after all the Purge proves to deplete crime ? as they vote an unsubtly sketched Republican evil-doer with a hidden agenda with the Church (I forgot to say that this isn't subtle, right?) that plans an assassination against his opponent. Thankfully, she is aided by Frank Grillo as the Punisher Who Could've Been, who teams up with her and an army of rebels in order to survive the Purge and ultimately end it soon. I utter this again, guys, this movie is not subtle! You could practically paint the face of the running mates as both Clinton and Trump and it would not make one bit of difference, the dialogue exchange offers more hammer-to-the-head allusions, and the aforementioned carnage porn the film keeps throwing at us is about as on the nose as anyone could expect. But it's also oddly enjoyable, mainly because of how much action and over-the-top sequences the film keeps throwing at us. Sure anybody can point out the implausibility's and roll their eyes in its aloofness, but I'd like to refrain from that on this movie alone. Bottom line, it's airless but screams guilty pleasure.For more reviews, check out my blog! https://itachisan125.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A copy of the previous entry with politics added</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Purge: Election Year puts a new spin on the Purge series by adding a political element to the story. Senator Charlie Roan (Elizabeth Mitchell, Lost) plans to end the Purge if she is elected president against the minister opponent who is a pawn of the NFFA, National Founding Fathers Administration. Leo Barnes (Frank Grillo) returns now as a secret service agent having come to terms with the loss of his son and realizing the vengeance he had desired in the previous film was caused by the evils of the Purge.The secondary storyline is really the best part of this Purge film. Joe Dixon (Mykelti Williamson) steals the show as a shop owner screwed over by the Purge insurance company forced to protect his property. With the help of Marcos (Joseph Julian Soria) and traveling Purge night nurse Laney Rucker (Betty Gabriel), they fend off young teenage murderers and murder tourists.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"I want my Candy!" - School Girl</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was way over the top and a good conclusion to the Purge trilogy. There were moments in the movie were I thought the actors were pushing and action too crazy though. I wish the intro scene with the guy talking in the chair somehow came up again later, because i thought that the scene had some importance. The whole time watching I was waiting for the scene to be scene again, or at least some explanation to it.I really liked Joe Dixon played by Wykelti Williamson, he was great with the humor in the film. Frank Grillo delivered another solid performance as the protector of senator Charlie Roan in this movie. The narrative of this movie is really great visually. I think the script was okay, their weren't too many clichéd lines. The twist with the involvement of the government officials was really interesting and made this addition memorable. My one complaint though not a big one was the School girl wanting to kill Joe Dixon just because she didn't get candy. This choice in writing did not make the choice to purge good enough in my opinion, but what they heck. The Candy girl scenes to me seemed like something miley cyrus would make if she directed a horror film. The church scene made me a little uncomfortable. It was weird.The priest was creepy looking. And i don't understand his involvement other than looks, and his actions towards the end. The movie definitely will satisfy Purge fans. Any comments please, help. I want to start reviewing movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad and cliché</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not so talented at commenting movies, but ill try my best.I found the first iteration to be meh, but was really impressed with the second one: an action-flick with a great atmosphere, tense plot and interesting characters&amp;relationship.The comparison between this 3rd and the 2nd movie is relevant on many points. First thing first: the main character. In the first movie, he was on the purge, he was a killer that didn't give a sh1t but his goal. Although, on the way to murder, his conscience calls him for duty when he see armored men kidnapping a mom and her child. Prepared for the purge, the man is well trained and well equipped and soon demonstrates that when he gets off his car to kill the wrong doers. The action is fast, tense and this is one of those rare movies where you feel what a firearm does, what a kill is. The main character is fast, he executes his moves impeccably and never forgets to double-check fallen corpses with his aim.There is a scene very alike in Purge: Election, and by comparison you can see how bland and cliché the action has become: Two girls in a truck come in rescue of some dudes in a shop. Outside the shop, four girls are trying to break in to get some kills&amp;sugar.The director is doing his ''best'' to make it like ''oh look this girl is a bad4ss'', toying with the camera, the zooms, face zooms and music. This kind of direction rarely happened in the previous movie, but it would happen, for instance: when a guy was coming out of his truck with a fr4eck1ng MINIGUN and was bl0wing the hell out off things. Or when an army - mostly of black people - comes from nowhere to save the day and kill a large group of bad guys. When something was actually big and b4d4ss, the 2nd movie went down the path of ''directing'' like the action was b4d4ss. In this 3rd movie, it happens all the time and the action is far from being exciting to watch. There is just nothing happening, no tension, no thrill, no feelings. Back to that scene: the girl is driving the truck, there are two villains in front of the truck, the truck pass through the villains. It didn't require any maneuver, the villains just stayed there in the path (possibly because other members of their group are very loud trying to breach the entrance to the shop), yet again, the camera goes to face with the ''b4d4ss'' girl - that is introduced as such in the first place - with a compelling music that incites us to think ''oh yeah, so b4d4ss''. Ofc, this is absolutely ridiculous... but... why the hell not? THEN AGAIN, she takes off the car, the camera stops, she stops to face the camera (yeah, loosing some precious seconds just to pose, making a mean face) and she then proceeds to take her shotgun. And again, the camera, the music, the face, with this time, the shotgun. She advances, she aims, she kills, she stops, another villain facing her, she aims, she skills. There are no other movements as the villains are 4 meters away from her. And there is still that music reminding us that everything we saw was absolutely thrilling. Only, everything that happened during this scene bl0ws. And the whole movie is this.The main character, is probably still the best part but he has become so bland. He is not anymore this conflicted character obsessed with assassinating a certain person, but reluctant to kill. Reluctant to help people that could stop the achievement of his goal, but whose conscience tells to do the right thing.The Purgers. They BL0W!! In the 1rst and 2nd movie, purgers are wearing masks and killing mostly with firearms, knives, blunt weapons; They often act in groups and remind us of gangs (also of the movie The Warriors). Here: W-T-F is this cr4p. They are all completely eccentrics! Every time you see them, it looks like a painting, they are taking the pose with robes, with thematic lights, with stuff, the f4ck??? Some good ideas with the ''tourismurder'', actually concludes on a scene that isn't bad, with people who behave more like in the 2nd movie. But most of the time, the purgers are just ?????Now, for the plot. Well there is a plot, and it isn't worth debating. It just is... you know, nothing special.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Election Results Are In!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Get ready once again for this year's annual purge. From Universal Pictures and Blumhouse, The Purge: Election Year is a cinematic roller-coaster of espionage, action, revenge, campaigns, and of course the trade mark unbridled violence. Horror is one of my favorite genres to discuss because this genre often includes fantastic themes and subtext that act as social commentary on gender, politics, religion, economics, sex, or technology. Going into this movie, I was already prepared for the political themes, but there are many more themes for one to discuss with this film. In many ways, I am not even sure how to proceed with analyzing it. Cinematically, or from a technical perspective, the movie is fantastic. Yeah, a little campy at times but that is par for the course. Contains just the right amount of comedy, albeit dark, to balance out the darker or heavier elements. The fact that this movie is truly prompting me to think about its content is fascinating. Often times, I have a good idea of how I am going review a movie while I am driving home from the theatre; but this one is definitely requiring me to think about it more than I typically need to. I suppose that entire articles could be written on any one theme in the movie, but I only have 1000- 1500 words to analyze it. Haha. The biggest question is whether or not this movie is actually counterproductive.Although the first movie did not exactly have much in the way of social commentary themes beyond greed, Purge: Anarchy and this present installment are certainly drenched with rich themes that could fuel discussions for hours. One could surmise that the principle theme of the second installment in this thriller franchise was rich v poor. A very apropos theme considering the US economy was only-then emerging and beginning to grow from the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. Walking into this movie, I was prepared for political themes; but politics was only a principle element in the plot by extension and used as a highway to get from beginning to end. Not even in subtext, but the predominant theme of Purge: Election Year is clearly white v black. I find this concept and theme is dangerously and carelessly carried out because it really serves to perpetuate the idea that there is a difference between whites and blacks in the Unites States. Instead of the movie showing audiences what could, albeit unlikely, happen in a future America if not challenged or changed, it serves to add fuel to the fire that there is a difference. Furthermore, I find that the movie is unfair to both whites and blacks. It's unfair to whites because it shows most of them having a hatred from blacks and nearly unanimously in favor of the purge while it depicts the predominant demographic of violent offenders as blacks. Now, I am sure the intention of the movie is not to be counterproductive or perpetuating a negative idea, after all it is produced to be entertaining; however, it's difficult to watch the movie without wondering if it really is counterproductive in message and theme.Beyond the social commentary on white v black, the movie also spent a lot of time on the perversion of organized religion. Although the religious aspect to the NFFA was included in the previous installment on a minor level, Purge: Election Year spends a great deal of time connecting a perverted organized version of warped Christianity (very much Catholic or Anglican in structure) to the driving forces behind the NFFA's passion for and dedication to the annual purge. Just like I feel that the producers and writers of this movie crossed the line with the white v black violence, I feel that this version of organized religion only serves to perpetuate the idea that those in organized relation (mostly Christianity) are hate mongers. Obviously, most people know that this isn't the case; however, that idea is certainly out there because of differing views on some socio- political areas of community and life in general. Perhaps the movie is commenting on how different groups of people may perceive one another. If that is the case, then the groups of people depicted in the movie can gain a better understanding of how an opposing side views them. Sometimes seeing your actions through another's eyes helps to ignite positive change. I think that is a beauty in a film like this. It can be read in so many different ways and dissected to support one theme or another.Quite the antithesis of the U.S. holiday most will be celebrating in one way or another this weekend, The Purge: Election Year paints a picture of a fractured country. In light of the recent massacre at Pulse in Orlando and other massively violent acts around the world, I am not entirely sure how well this movie will do over the weekend. Certainly around here, it may not be well- attended since I live in the Central Florida area and have been there many times myself. Universal Studios Florida is even revisiting the inclusion of The Purge as a house at this year's Halloween Horror Nights. If for no other reason, this movie stirs may emotions whether they are motivated by race religion, or socio-economics. Like with most horror movies, I suggest watching this one with a friend or two. That way you can have fun discussing it afterwards.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lots of fun, but a few flaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Purge: Election Year is very similar to The Purge: Anarchy in that it is much better than the first installment in the series, but tries to put too many things into one movie. Election Year introduces some great visuals and themes, but does not expand on any of them to their fullest. This makes for an action-packed ride with a lot of fun splatter horror, but not as much substance as the concept leaves room for.My main problem with the film would be the way it tries very hard to make the purge seem like a plausible occurrence for America while simultaneously showing some very implausible scenarios. Afterall, the movies are set in near-future America to present them in a "real world" kind of scenario. But then it shows ridiculous things like an entire guillotine setup in an alleyway, or two cars completely covered in Christmas lights. Who is actually trying to do such over- the-top things in the middle of the purge? How are there so many people going out of their way to look scary and kill people who seem to have very little interest in staying home and not being killed by other people? Furthermore, the movie presented some interesting topics like purge insurance, murder tourism, and underground resistance but didn't really develop them. I would have preferred development of substance rather than crazy visuals and meaningless violence.Overall, it was a fun ride that I'm glad I saw in theaters, but probably would not buy for my own collection to watch again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You just kinda have to watch this train wreck of a movie with brain in neutral. If you think about it too much you dwell on the image of the Nazi white priest in the church insanely gunning down the innocent homeless black people. Or you find the depiction of the baddie resurfacing when you least expect it: the white bald head, the Swastika tattoos on his white shaved scalp and the Confederate flag stitched to his evil white man's uniform. Or maybe all the good Latinos and black people will stick in your mind, saving the weak white people's asses (they even say at one point, "You can't have these white boys; these our white boys.") I paraphrase, but you get my drift. All I can say is thank God for black people, Latinos and women, cus the world clearly ain't safe in the hands of white men. Or Christians. Wow, white Christian men--just who the world needs to fear, isn't it?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THIS REVIEW WAS Originally WRITTEN IN Spanish AND TRADUCED THROUGH GOOGLE FOR LAZINESS OF NOT Writing IT AGAIN IN EnglishHowever, many people are ba very excited to see this movie, and I understand if excited to see an action movie this season so even though the previous films were not made me very good enters the room THE OPEN MIND. Well I want to first talk about the story. It is about a senator who seeks to end the PURGE call if you have not seen the previous films, basically is that for one night all crime is legal and there will be some for whom repercucion cause the crime. Many people agree with the definitive cancellation of the PURGE but at the same time many people do not this so the senator has to stay safe with the help of his bodyguards. THE GOOD: 'I can not deny that the scene that are about to begin 12 hours of crime I liked a lot. I just get excited much as it is a pretty good sequence. -The Musical choice (EYE NOT THE SOUNDTRACK) ie Party on the USA and the song of the credits are used perfectly in their respective sequences. No stops to be CRUDE is violent images and what is shown on screen is exactly as the director wants it to look, there is no censorship for less or much less. If the director wants us to see 3 people moored on the hood of a car, that's exactly what we'll see. BAD (UFF AND IS ENOUGH) This is where if you gave me a little afraid to write but this is my opinion and if you enjoyed the movie, congratulations really happy. 'The script is very silly, all the characters say line after line simply annoying and has no sense what they mean, full of unnecessary profanity just to make them look more rough or me that. -The Performances made me exaggerated but not power and very unreal. -The Acting seriously and photographic direction is a disaster, most of the shots are Hand-held and photography itself is very loose. -The Issue: Music and as are connected scenes feel like they belong to another film, very quick cuts that barely let you process what is happening on the screen and music too distracting that no tone movie. -the Decisions of the characters are very silly, almost in every scene a character decides to do something that no human being with half a brain would in either situation only to add more tension to the scene. -Jumpscares false. 'The script is very racist: All black characters are criminals or perverts like Latin characters. -The Chava sweets (When you see the film will understand me) -The Audio Dubs were super obvious and misplaced. -A Wall that tells you everything you need to know just when you need to know (Home of the 3rd act) -Each VES THAT A MAIN CHARACTER IS IN A DIFFICULT SITUATION HAPPENS a deus ex machina. Finally, I feel that the biggest reason that people were excited to see this film was the Marketing and scenes and images that came to the public that to be fair, if they look pretty good unlike the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The icing on the cake for the trilogy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The third installment of The Purge series was the icing on the cake for me that solidified my enjoyment of this trilogy. Since the first came out, I have thoroughly enjoyed the brutality these films presented to the audience and myself. Being possibly the weakest of the three, the first still was memorable for me. With the second, DeMonaco broadened the scope, added more plot, and kept the brutality and insanity. Now with the third, the plot hits its climax and the terrifying imagery hits a new high as well as the brutality of the kills and sheer insanity that the purge night brings. I love Frank Grillo and his presence radiates badassery and this film lets him be just that. Elizabeth Mitchell played a convincing politician driven by passion to end the purge. Yet on the flip side of the coin, The Founding Fathers are as sadistic as the night they created. The supporting actors within the film, Mykelti Williamson, Joseph Julian Soria, and Betty Gabriel, carry the movie very well, in my opinion and are enjoyable to watch with their story and also their slight comedic relief at times.Overall, 'The Purge: Election Year' brings back everything I love about this series with its intensity, brutality, and terrifying imagery. For a film that relies on brutal violence, The Purge does a good job at bringing in a plot that does not feel too forced unlike the first film where it relied solely on the horror thriller feel of it. If you love films with violence, profanity, and intense scenes, this is the film to see. If you love the series, this is the best one to see of the three.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Purge: Election Year is a good suspenseful movie that is sure to make you just at least 2-3 times throughout the movie. I thought the plot was pretty good and the acting was good except for the candy girls (You'll understand who I am referring to when you see the movie) I felt they are a bit over-the-top in every aspect of their character. But they do get what they deserve in the end. However, they did stay true to the nature of the Purge series and of a typical thriller/horror genre movie, even killing all the black ppl at the end; even the guy they brought back from the 1st one. This movie is funny, gory and engaging. Recommended for appropriately aged audience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great movie!! The Purge: Election Year lays it all out in a action oriented, fun horror style.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a far better follow up to The Purge: Anarchy than Anarchy was a follow up to the original Purge. It's the same element of social science fiction action horror. It helps that Frank Grillo reprises his role from Anarchy, but it's a different story altogether.A senator is running for president on the idea that she would fight to end the purge and her body guard, Leo Barnes believes in her cause. So when her enemies wish to use the purge to kill her, he puts his life on the line with the help of some citizens who also believe in her make sure the senator survives the night. the combination of horror with the social commentary makes it scary. Adding to that, the movie is released in the year of the US's biggest election. It's an exaggerated reflection on society, but still its like looking into a mirror of what people would do if they could get away with it.I felt the movie was pretty even on every side of what the purging does: the poor get eliminated, the rich get richer, and Election Year adds those who are poor who fight back and those who see it as a religious day. My favorite was a group of girls that represent a generation who grew up just knowing twitter who live all year waiting to seek revenge on adults who they think make their lives horrible, and have fun unleashing their anger.Election Year touches all emotions, it almost acts as my purge. It lays every thing on the line very real like.Great action, socially scary and very funny. A must see.</fullReview>

But there's a few old fossils who won't accept the change &amp; create a plan to kill her &amp; those in the government to keep the purge going!The film, just like the first 2 was epic as always! The violence &amp; gore was just how I liked it &amp; never failed to disappoint in the slightest! The kills &amp; purgers were also great as well &amp; again didn't disappoint!The film did have a good story line &amp; some pretty impressive scenes of violence &amp; politics! The ending was pretty satisfying too, though it made me worry this will be the last one in the series. These films are too good to end at 3! They could make as many as 4 more or more they're that good! I give this one 10/10 it was epic &amp; you should watch it! You'll not be disappointed! Really was looking forward to this 3rd installment &amp; wasn't disappointed at all! We Brits were finally able to get it in the UK on the 26th (today) August unlike the original date which was the 15th July! But it was worth the wait all the same! Hope for a The Purge 4!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Purge: Election Year Pokes Horrific Fun at 2016 Election</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My wife and I are fans of The Purge movies, so as we were winding down a weekend getaway staycation I decided we should go see The Purge: Election Year.The Purge series is a different type of horror movie?almost more thriller than horror. When I think of truly scary horror, I think of things like Poltergeist (the original one), or The Conjuring 2. That's just me. Movies that deal in the semi-plausible world of the supernatural and unexplained are far scarier than movies dealing with gratuitous homicide for me.That said, The Purge seems to walk a thin line between reality and the absurd. It seems like something that should be pure fantasy, and yet when you look around you can sort of see signs of how we?as a society?could actually embrace something like this. It's sort of how the movie Idiocracy should just be a&nbsp;dystopian Dumb and Dumber, yet it eerily resembles what the&nbsp;United States&nbsp;could possibly turn into depending on how the election goes this November.The second Purge movie was OK, but not nearly as good as the first. In my opinion, The Purge: Election Year is also not quite as good as the original, but it's much closer. It also took the franchise in a slightly different direction, though, because it's sort of like a mashup of The Purge and Olympus Has Fallen. It still has all the brutality and gore that makes The Purge great, but this one is built on a premise of a candidate for President being targeted on Purge Night because she has vowed to do away with Purge Night if she wins.The similarities between the protagonist and Hillary Clinton, and the primary antagonist and Donald Trump are apparently not entirely on accident. Director James DeMonaco told Entertainment Weekly that the current election cycle influenced the movie: "Little things drip into you when you're writing or you're on set ? you're grabbing from the ether or what's out there in the press. I think there's a lot of representation of everyone who's in the game right now, from Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton to Bernie Sanders to John Kasich. I'd like to the audience to play with it and see who they feel is representative of the actual candidates in the real world, without me saying who's who. I think the audience will have a lot of fun saying, 'Oh, that reminds me of something Donald said!'" Ultimately, I feel it was a good movie. I definitely feel like I got my money's worth and that it was worth my time to see it. I will be curious to see if they continue trying to stretch this premise further, or if this will be the end of The Purge franchise.If you've seen it, let me know what you thought in the comments below.

		<fullReview>It was just okay. It was neither great, nor awful. Who takes to time to wrap their vehicle with lights during purge night and who comes back for revenge because they stopped you from stealing a CANDY BAR? I kinda see this movie like The Hunger Games. They do the Purge, fight for the purge to be over, and then the purge is over. Seems like they were trying to get caught or die. Everywhere they went was lit or crawling with purgers Nothing to it. Some main characters are killed off, like expected, bad people are either killed or defeated, and the good people win. Over all, I wouldn't watch it over again. It was just a time filler.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Imo this is easy the weakest part of the Purge franchise. Whereas the first movie was a suspenseful home-invasion-thriller and the second one put some more emphasize on an actioner approach the third installment is almost purely an action-movie with a political conspiracy plot, and that's imo the main problem - for this kind of movie it has to stand against such stuff as Bourne Identity, 96 hours and so on and it loses. The pace to slow, the gunfight-action mediocre stuff and almost nothing left of the ingredients of the first movie. Also there is no real twist or suspense: who is the bad guy or who is the boss behind the conspiracy etc. Imo this was the wrong step to take - the franchise should return to its core or the producers should just shut it down. Another Purge Part 1 I would watch. Another cheap version of Running Man or Snake Plissken I will just pass. The Purge got a 7 and Anarchy a 6 from me, Election Year I rate 5 with a tendency to 4.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the goofy dump you'd expect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now I gotta admit: I ain't seen the first two Purges. Seems like an alright kinda idea for a moving picture. I even proposed a simyular idea years ago: every day on your birthday, you get to kill one person. That seems tame compared to This Here Purge, when no crime is verboten, and this time around, not even killing top gubment officials.So we get a nice . . . blend? Or is it gauche to say pastiche? Of soup du jour, of-the-day hints at social commentary. The obvious: gun violence (meh, violence generally); classism; racism; despotic blind faith. The less obvious: we all got it comin'.Our "hero," a white powerful woman who needs poor black people to survive ironically, says so poignantly that we don't need the Purge. There are, as she says, Other Ways. But much like a Bernie Trump, we are left with a quarter enchilada, and let's be real: with 7,000,000,000 of us, life really ain't too special.The cinematography was better than needed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I won't spend much time on this review, since they clearly didn't spend much time making this movie very worthwhile. I'm a fan of the idea of the series, because it could really be something special. But the movies have never really been able to live up to the hype. Election Year is much of the same with a pretty average story and a predictable plot. People go crazy for a candy bar and come back for vengeance. Average character dev but you don't care too much about them. Oddly, only one of them gets ghosted.It ends with a black mass that erupts in gunfire. No tricky maneuvers, nothing really surprising. The only new element is the politics.</fullReview>

Suspension of laws for a night so that a state can make cheap profit just is peculiar philosophical topic.Nowhere does the movie discuss any of the issues that can be raised.The Purge: Election Year contains no true horror elements - only some common shootings. Horror and action fans will be disappointed as much as those who are looking for some political inquiry.This movie is very political but only in a propaganda sense. Even the subtitle says: "Keep America great" which is an obvious reference to Trumps' campaign.The only great thing about this movie is a concept. Unfortunately, none has been utilized.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Poor casting, hammy acting, aimless plot and stereotype undertones sums this movie up in a nutshell. And don't get me started on the pointless violence! With previous offerings, you got the sense that the violence was part of the plot and helped push it along. You could feel the dread and despair. Not this time. Throughout the movie, I kept asking myself "why did they do that for...what was the point of that character?" The supposed 'lead character' appeared to be phoning it in and everyone else seemed uninspired or miscast. I tried to persevere but at some point found myself wishing one of the psychos roaming the streets on purge night would put this drab lot out of their misery. It was then that I promptly terminated this misadventure. I had high hopes for this movie and I am truly sadly disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Purge is officially a trilogy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many people have argued that the first Purge film wasn't all that great. Many people have mentioned, that the film's premise didn't make much sense, the wanted to see the mayhem of the country, and know if we get any vigilantes during the purge. On the other hand, I actually enjoyed the first film. Also, The Purge: Anarchy is a rare example of the studio taking the criticism from fans, and making in my opinion a much better film than the first. Now we have The Purge: Election Year. We have the purge trilogy. Sadly, I believe that The Purge: Election Year is a slight step down from the last film.In The Purge: Election Year, we have our returning protagonist, Leo Barnes, played by Frank Grillo (Captain America: The Winter Soldier, The Grey). Leo Barnes, has to protect Senator Roan, played by Elizabeth Mitchell (The Santa Clause 2, T.V.'s Lost). Senator Roan wants to rid the country of the dreaded day, known as the purge. We all know that in this world, the purge is an American tradition, founded by our new founding fathers, and these people aren't going to give up the purge without a fight.What I do like about this movie is how they make the world feel somewhat realistic. For example, they have ads, commercials, election ads, billboards, etc. to promote the purge. Even though some people argue about the plot being dumb. Such as, someone in the theater saying, "So on this one night, I can blow up a football stadium like Bane in batman, and be seen as a proud American?!" Honestly, on Purge day, I would just take a couple of books, and blurays. But, like the other Purge films, this movie does have an interesting message.Also, I like how this film isn't so focused on just the horror aspects. It's action, political, a thriller, tension, in some ways a comedy, and has a lot of similarities to John Carpenter's Escape From New York. In addition, the acting is very well done by Frank Grillo, and Elizabeth Mitchell. Even though some say these movies are silly, the two characters bring a serious tone.What I personally didn't enjoy all that much was how it toned itself down from the last purge film. Meaning, we don't see anything that we will remember a couple of weeks after. Also, some characters feel cartoonish.An example of this would be the character Joe Dixon, played by Mykelti Williamson (Forrest Gump, Black Dynamite). He is in the movie as a deli owner. Don't get me wrong, he was great in the movie, he brought some light humour, but I believe it went just a little too far. For instance, he says the line, "Goodnight Blue Cheese!" Even Frank Grillo had that look on his face like "'scuse meh? What the hell did you just say?" Also, he says " What in the Mississippi Fu#k are you talking about?"Furthermore, there is a young lady in this film, who taunts Joe. She simply wants a candy bar. She tried to steal it from the deli, and Joe is like hell no, pay for it, or put it back. Even though I found her to be a little cartoonish at first, she was clearly a psychopath. Along with her friends, one wearing a pig costume with a chainsaw. Piglet with a chainsaw, and covered in blood. I know the purge is like Halloween for adults, but everyone has one the craziest and what I believe to be an irrelevant outfit.So these are my final Bitchin' Buddha thoughts on The Purge: Election Year. It's not the worst film in the series, but I believe it is a step down from the last film. It over does it with the characters, humour, dialogue, and wardrobe. Like the last films, I do enjoy hearing about the film's overall message. After this film, I would like to see the purge go in a new direction. The Purge: Origins, The Purge: Reborn, The Purge: Worldwide ? (Anyone, just me? Lol). I believe The Purge: Election Year earns a...6/10This review is brought to you by Boogie Buddha, and remember, don't just get down, but get Boogie. Thank you all for reading/viewing, and I hope you all have an amazing day, and good night blue cheese as always. :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'THE PURGE: ELECTION YEAR': Four Stars (Out of Five)The third installment in the popular horror flick franchise; this one adds some political commentary, to the social science fiction/horror series. It deals with a popular Presidential candidate, that's targeted for execution on 'Purge' night; due to her promise to eliminate the controversial ritual. James DeMonaco returned to write and directed the movie (as he did the last two installments) and Frank Grillo (who starred in the first sequel) returned to star in this film. The movie also costars Elizabeth Mitchell, Mykelti Williamson, Terry Serpico, Betty Gabriel, Joseph Julian Soria, Kyle Secor and Edwin Hodge (who also costarred in the original flick). Once again (like the previous two movies) the film has been (mostly) well received by critics and viewers alike; I really enjoyed it as well.Grillo reprises his role as Leo Barnes; a former police sergeant, that almost murdered the man who accidentally killed his son (on a previous 'Purge' night). He's now the head of security, for Presidential nominee Senator Charlie Roan (Mitchell). The two have made it their obsessive mission, to end the annual ritual, and the Senator is gaining a lot of support for it. The 'New Founding Fathers of America' created the 'Purge', to drastically reduce the poor population, and they'll now do anything to stop Roan. They remove a 'Purge' rule, for the first time ever, that protects top Government officials; in order to take her out. Barnes and Roan end up on the streets, banding with other survivors, in order to try to make it through the night (alive).The movie has a lot of the same creepy (and highly disturbing) thrills, and high-energy action scenes, as the previous two films. It hasn't lost any of it's strengths, impressively, this third time around. It's also added some pretty insightful political commentary, to the already impactful social commentary, and it's very effective (and timely) as well. Senator Roan does show a lot of strong similarities to Bernie Sanders; and you can argue that her opponent greatly resembles Ted Cruz. The controversy over 'Purge' night can also easily be compared to the heated debate over gun rights. There's a lot of interesting parallels, to modern politics, that can be found in this movie. Besides that, it's just a great action-horror flick. Fans of the series won't be disappointed.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/lcZBQp0HBZg</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Purge: Election Year (2016): Dir: James DeMonaco / Cast: Frank Grillo, Elizabeth Mitchell, Mykelti Williamson, Joseph Julian Soria, Betty Gabriel: Third entry is thus far the weakest with its constant array of graphic violence. It seems less focused here and more about innovative methods of death. The new election is upon them with the promise of ridding the annual purge. These nights involve a twelve hour bracket where crime including murder is deemed legal. As nonsense as that sounds its the rich seem to afford protection while the poor are picked up. Elizabeth Mitchell plays Charlie Roan who is running for presidency with the aim of ending purge night. Eighteen years prior she was bound and gagged and forced to witness the execution of her family. Now she faces the corrupt opposition. Frank Grillo returns and is assigned to protect her when there is a breach in security. Mykelti Williamson plays a deli owner bent on protecting his store when it becomes a target. Joseph Julian Soria plays an employee bent on helping him defend his store. They stake out on the roof as a car lit entirely in lights cruises down the street. Betty Gabriel plays a woman cruising the streets looking to assist those in need. She owes a debt to the deli owner because years ago he help her change lifestyle choices. This all boils down to a massive bloody shootout in a church that contains none of the style of the one in Kingsman:The Secret Service. While the original Purge contain an interesting theme, this sequel elects to gross out viewers with more executions that went into crafting a decent screenplay. Score: 5 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Three strikes, DeMonaco, now will you please get a career change</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Years after choosing not to kill the man who killed his son in a drunk-driving accident, police sergeant Leo Barnes (Frank Grillo) becomes the head of security for United States senator Charlene "Charlie" Roan (Elizabeth Mitchell), the front runner in the next U.S. presidential election. Due to her vow to eliminate the Purge after losing her family to sadistic murderers on the night of the Purge several years earlier, Barnes continues to campaign against the Purge after witnessing the deaths during his night on the streets years prior. The government secretly opposes Roan's campaign, and plots against her to keep her from destroying the Purge. On the night of what could be the final Purge, a betrayal from within the government at the hands of the New Founding Fathers of America (NFFA) forces Barnes and Roan out onto the streets, where they must fight to survive the night, and come across a group of anti-Purge rebels that support Roan's campaign.The concept of the Purge series, while admittedly absurd, is a compelling one. It could work as a dark comedy rich with jet-black, balls-to-the-wall satire on America today. It could also work as a straight crime drama focusing on a character outside during the night of the Purge questioning whether it's right or wrong. As a horror film, it doesn't work at all. The first Purge is nothing more than a scare-free, nonsensical home invasion thriller backed by the dumbest characters you'll ever see in a horror film and a pretentious script. The sequel Anarchy wisely takes the action to the streets, but the change in setting doesn't result in a better film. You still couldn't care less about the characters (with the exception of Frank Grillo's Leo Barnes), the attempts at social and political commentary and satire are empty-headed and beaten over your head like you're an idiot, and the terrible CGI blood and gore are just the icing on the manure sundae. We have now reached #3 in this franchise and James DeMonaco still tries to have his cake and eat it too. Needless to say, he desperately needs a career change.First of all, the writing. It's terrible. You don't care about the characters. Other than Leo, it's hard to get invested in any of them. Elizabeth Mitchell's character Charlie Roan is sorely underwritten and it's such a waste of her talents. Every other character that isn't these two is either annoying or just plain boring. I can't even remember their names. That's how forgettable they were. There's also some awful comic relief in here to boot. The dialogue is godawful. Three of the worst offenders have to be "I like black people but these are my white people," "There's a whole lot of negroes coming this way and we're sitting here like a bucket of motherf*cking chicken," and "I ain't thinking about nothing but waffles and pussy."Once again, attempts at social and political commentary and satire on the current state of America fail miserably. Not only is it empty-headed, not only does the way it's written make DeMonaco come across as the dumb kid in school who thinks he's smarter than everyone else, not only is it shoved down the audiences' throats, but it also comes off as massively hypocritical. Why? Because DeMonaco revels in the same senseless carnage and gratuitous violence that his script supposedly condemns.The plot tries to be an urban action thriller just like Anarchy, but with more of the horror elements from the first film sprinkled on top. It's because of the failed attempts at commentary and satire and the boring, poorly written characters that you never get emotionally invested in the plot and story at hand. We also have unnecessary, badly thought out subplots that DeMonaco forgets about. It's also hard to take what's going on seriously when everything is so over-the-top and cartoon-ish, especially the villains. One character Purges over a candy bar (no, I'm not making this up, it's really that stupid).Like Anarchy, instead of using practical effects, the filmmakers use horribly rendered CGI for the graphic bloody violence and gore and it looks atrocious. All of the action scenes are boring. The camera- work courtesy of DeMonaco and cinematographer Jacques Jouffret is decent occasionally, but it's mostly quite poor, almost to the point of being incomprehensible. The horror elements fail as well, relying on cheap, lousy jump scares instead of actually building up tension and creating atmosphere.Really, the one thing I like in this film is the acting. It's good for the most part. While Elizabeth Mitchell, Mykelti Williamson, and Raymond J. Barry are stuck playing thinly written nothings, all three of them deliver fine performances along with Frank Grillo. When Grillo's being a bad-ass, he really sells it, bringing a lot of intensity and conviction. Based on his acting in this, the last film, and the last two Captain America films, I can see this guy playing an amazing Frank Castle in a Punisher film. I know it will never happen, but hey, I can dream, right? The musical score by Nathan Whitehead is also pretty solid.In summary, James DeMonaco wants to have his cake and eat it too for a third time, and it's at this point that he should give up because it's never going to work. The Purge: Election Year is yet another poor installment in this atrocious franchise, once again wasting good actors and delivering tenfold on awful dialogue, boring characters, and empty-headed social commentary. Screw this series.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Purge Election Year is practically a movie about the weak get eaten and government being corrupted. That's basically the movies symbolism.Start with the two high school girls who are just purging because of wanting some candy bar. These characters were completely irrelevant to the plot however served a purpose of how most teenagers are spoiled these days and believe can do what they choose.We then focus the majority of the movie with senator Charlie running for president who is trying to end the purge. While her running mate was a minister who sorry this is the screwed up part strongly believes in the purge. Which made no sense at since most religious people are strongly against this. The senator focus on trying to stay alive whole night. While interacting with others such as Dante bishop who is trying to kill the minister. However Charlie is strongly against this and believes she can win the election based on voters.Purge election year strongly served on what some government official will do to ensure their win in an election and how others will put faith in the voters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Normally I don't bother writing reviews of films I have watched, but in the case of this one, I felt compelled to put fingers to keyboard.The premise of the film is quite good, in the fact that the purge has been going on for several years, and a senator who's family were on the receiving end of it several years earlier is making a stand against the establishment to bring an end to the Purge once and for all. I immediately thought I would enjoy the film, as the underdog scenario can be quite good.The writing and characters - After a promising start, things went rapidly downhill, and continued on a downward spiral, with characters I found it difficult to even try and find some empathy for. From the senator who won't do as her security team advise, to a KKK(?) presence which goes from being super efficient (they are able to head shot from a distance) to almost keystone cops (think the shooting scenes from naked gun where the police and the bad guys are about 3 feet from each other and hiding behind a bench and a bin but unable to hit each other), and a teenage girl who tries to steal a bar of chocolate but gets caught, and then comes back to "purge" the shop owner and get the previously mentioned bar of chocolate (at this point, it would appear that it was bring your kids to work day, and the script writers may have taken a tea break and left their teenagers in charge of the computers) with a group of about 7 or 8 friends (all heavily armed and wearing enough clothing for at most 2 of them).The main bad guys, in stereotypical style, are mainly white middle aged men (there did appear to be a couple of women in the NFFA), and its only thankful that they weren't English as well).Onto the plot -Where to start? Great idea, lots of potential, but completely gone awry from about 5 minutes in. Instead of being tense and keeping you guessing what was going to happen, you could step away from the film for 10 minutes and know pretty much what had gone on. Following a basic plot line with no twists which couldn't have been guessed - teenager coming back to purge the shop for the chocolate bar, NFFA wanting to get the senator and do her in themselves, someone in the senators security team working for the NFFA etc etc, it spectacularly failed to grip and entertain, whilst leaving it open for a fourth installment (please, NOOOOOOOO)In summary - If you like boring sequels, this is probably the film for you, as it stretches the franchise just that little bit too far for it to be believable and entertaining (think the third and fourth outings of the resident evil films)If you want a film which is entertaining and keeps you on the edge of your seat wanting to find out what happens next, avoid this one, and choose something like The Usual Suspects, Quarantine or The Purge (the first one in the trilogy).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ceaseless Political Propaganda</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This sole purpose of this movie is to promote illegal immigrants, promote Hillary Clinton, and demonise white people.In short:: The angelic female senator is running for presidency against the terrible white male patriarchy. She wants to end the purge which the evil white patriarchy don't want, so on the purge night, they send people out to kill her. They send... Skinheads. They send assassins who, get this, have "white power" alongside the swastica, alongside the confederate flag on their armour, and on their shoulder lies the American flag. Clearly white conservatives and patriots are pure evil Nazis and so who is left to save the good senator? You guessed it, African Americans, illegals, and women!This is just the tip of the iceberg of the propaganda in this film. There is also a healthy dose of anti Christian propaganda towards the end with the white male patriarchy performing ritual murders in a church, led by a priest. (literally every single person in a room filled with hundreds of horribly evil people, is white).It's just pure political propaganda. Nobody should support this film. Even if you are sympathetic towards its ends you must recognise the dangers of injecting such propaganda into supposed entertainment for the masses to mindlessly consume.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For those who can think and see how humans do want to murder/purge</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie only took $10 million to make. It profited $68 million take home after the 10million. So yeah, it made profit first off. 2nd, I love the bloody horror side to it. But most of all, I agree with the running theme to purge. The concept in the movie that we have blood lust is correct. God did send his son to be sacrificed. So to some degree, we need to murder to cleanse our human souls The strong will survive. We've made a country of weak people, because we cater to the weak and poor. I really enjoyed the nail being hammered away at the idea of a society purging off the weak. Now this 3rd installment had more humor laced in with a added black guy (deli owner).But the writers over did it a tad, and it got a little old with him talking about black people this and black people that. A little less of that, and it would of been funnier. But I appreciate the effort to bring humor into something so serious. People want to see this kind of movie, because we are of the flesh, and it's in our nature to want to see taboo things such as what this movie brings to the screen. It's sick, but not too twisted. It's honest about how we would be if we could get away with murder one night of the year. Micheal bay directed it btw. That was interesting to see his name on the credits. It's a huge hit in my book of great movies. So don't listen to all these other critics putting it down. They are simple minded individuals who can't see past their own two feet.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well....we saw this pattern many times before. Clear distinction between good and bad guys. Good guys have mental and physical abilities to win in all dangerous situations because they are fighting for the greater cause and they are invincible. That is clear from the very beginning. The other pattern, as seen in many movies, is moving from dangerous point A to dangerous point B and in the meantime killing the bad guys. There is no thrill in this movie. Saying that, I mean that you can easily sit in your armchair, having a beer and pop corns and wait for the outcome which you knew from the very beginning. I don't want to hurt the patriotic feelings of the American public (I am an European), but there are the situations which suggest that the America is sick society - which I don't believe. Briefly, this particular movie is not at all intriguing to Europeans. You watch it like you watch the characters and corresponding screenplay like an animal in a cage in the Zoo.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Purge Franchise - Fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The concept of the Purge is something that I thought was very interesting... the first movie played off like a traditional home invasion film, the 2nd explored outside of the realm of the purge, and Purge Election Year examined the politics behind the film.This film is very similar to Purge Anarchy, however there are only 2 main story lines that intersect. The first story line is the politician who wants to end the purge, and the second story line deals with a store owner who just wants to keep his store from being looted / destroyed.There's a lot of interesting ideas that would be impossible to cover in a 100 min movie. You see the insight of why the purge happened, some of the low brow politics, the big business of the purge, and how people deal with the purge. This is all similar to Anarchy but they explore the concepts more.The film also plays out like a horror movie at some points with a Spring Breakers style montage with girls with chainsaws and some unnecessary kill montages, though the film might be the least gory of the series.The final sequence was a little anti-climatic, but leading up to the point was pretty fun and there were some good sequences that weren't formulaic enough that I enjoyed the ride.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first film in this franchise was unique and brilliant then the people beyond it got greedy and we got a second film which was very poor so thought it was a bit ballsy to make a 3rd outing. Its the same old story of survival against the free killing purging, charlie roan (Elizabeth Mitchell) witness her family getting slaughtered as a teenager the film then fast forward to 18 years later Roan now a senator and doing all she can to get the purge abolished and yep you guessed it is the number one target for the purge. With a great cast the purge election year is a pleasant surprise to a franchise that looked on its way out after the awful sequel. Some great tense scenes and a decent run time of just under 2 hours its worth watching so for a great night watch the first film then this one ignore the second one as if it does not exist.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An OK 'Save the president' movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Fair, but inferior Sequel of the Purge: Anarchy. The movie is an OK 'Save the president' movie. In contrast with the previous Purges there are political messages and clichés, but this is not the main issue.The problem with purge 3 is that the movie has its characters justifying and explaining everything they think and do. They tell us why they do the thinks they do all the time, like a soap opera. They are talking literally and take everything too literally.The movie focuses more on the plot and less on the claustrophobic/grotesque/chaotic element (like Purge 1&amp;2). Though, the plot is still predictable.Overall, the purge concept has a good potential, but this movie could have done better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not disappointing.. Good job as usual with the purge series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Given the political climate and people being braver in print than often times in person, it is not surprising that the reviews were horrible for this movie. I typically like to go through reviews before watching any movie but that trend for me stops today at least until the movie is already seen by me out of strictly curiosity. I have come to realize a trend in movie reviews as it pertains to myself. Often times, a movie ( I won't mention any specific titles) was boring or lacked creativity and meaningful dialogue and it gets all 10's from reviewers and I leave wanting my money back. This is because I have come to realize that all reviewers are typically monolithic in appearance and probably vary slightly in life experiences. So in other words, buyer of critiques beware. As I feel about most areas of life that involve public opinion and input, diversity in contributions are essential!!!!. OK, with all that said, I am a black 40 year old school teacher and I loved this movie. It wasn't as divisive as others want to claim it was and honestly spoke to real human conditions and made heroes out of faces that haven't typically been shown as heroes but at the most sidekicks that needed guidance. The action was incredible and I never wanted to leave my seat! The message at the end was also relevant, powerful and positive. The characters were realistically portrayed. A must see. Thank you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The politics of The Purge.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first Purge movie was a taut home invasion horror that took place in a single location, on the one night in the U.S. that all crime is legal. The second film took the chaos to the city streets. This third film in the franchise paints a much larger picture, depicting the power struggle between the New Founding Fathers, instigators of The Purge, and those who want the yearly night of violence abolished, believing (quite rightly) that the event was created by the rich and powerful as a means of culling the poor.Elizabeth Mitchell plays Senator Charlie Roan, leader of the political opposition to the Founding New Fathers, who finds herself running for her life after the current administration decide to use The Purge for a spot of 'spring cleaning', targeting their rivals. Protected by her head of security Leo Barnes (Frank Grillo), Roan tries to survive the night, all the while hunted by vicious white power mercenaries. Helping her to make it through to the morning alive are deli owner Joe Dixon (Mykelti Williamson), his loyal employee Marcos (Joseph Julian Soria) and one-time street punk Laney Rucker (Betty Gabriel).Together, the three Purge films work as a neat trilogy, each expanding on the initial intriguing premise, offering up social satire and a liberal anti-violence/anti-gun message (while delivering plenty of shooting and graphic violence in the process, so that even those who don't agree with the film's politics have something to enjoy). I do, however, feel that, like the protagonists of Election Year, it is finally time to call it a day on The Purge: I'd rather leave matters as they are than see the series go rapidly downhill as the makers begin to scrape the barrel for ideas.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very timely..even in the exaggerated sense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, so me and my fiancé went to the movies with a good friend today. We really could not afford it but we did anyway. We went to the Mt. Airy theater where pathetically small drinks were 5.15 each. We did not get popcorn- which started at 7.00! So, I have enjoyed The Purge series. The first one was heavily flawed but I liked the idea of it and where it took my mind. The Purge: Anarchy was a HUGE step up and took the action out where I wanted to first to be. Now comes along The Purge: Election Year! My expectations were high- especially with the timely title. The story centers on a female presidential nominee (who was once a victim of the Purge when she was younger) who saw her entire family massacred. Her main objective, among others, is to end the Purge if elected. The opposing side likes The Purge and thinks it is essential, not to mention it causes the lower classes to kill each other. The plan is to change the rules and to allow politicians to be murdered also- in hopes of ending this woman's campaign forever. There is also a side plot of a store owner (Bubba of Forrest Gump) whose Purge insurance just shafted him and he is fearing for his store so he wants to keep watch and save his investments. One of his best friends with a dark past also factors into this. We also get the return of Frank from "Anarchy" - who is now in a "The Bodyguard" situation with the presidential hopeful. Well, The Purge commences and a lot of action and insanity comes. What I want to talk about really is what I liked and what I didn't like about this movie and to tell you there must be SOME SPOILERS. So stop reading if you do not want to know- though I won't tell you everything. This movie is very much a reflection of today's society and the current political climate- that is taken to cartoonish levels of exaggeration at times. This movie is quite liberal and I don't mind that because I am. I do wish, however, that is was a bit more subtle. It's more like a sledgehammer. But, then again, so is this election! My main problem was the over-the-top portrayal of religion. I do understand that many people are killing in the name of religion today and hating and excluding minorities. I also think the other half is never represented anymore. The ending becomes so over-the-top that Evil Dead 2 begins to look subtler. I love Evil Dead 2! One of the best parts of this movie for me was the representation of this entitled teenager generation who feel compelled to get revenge just because some pesky adult doesn't let them steal a candy bar. It may sound hokey on paper but I feel it is more than on point with today! All in all. there is a lot of politics. Some of it is largely exaggerated. However, Isn't that exactly what is going on right now? An over-the-top cartoon definitely works for this political climate. Conservatives, however, will not enjoy seeing the worst of their ilk presented in the ugly face they portray to minorities. Before it's all said and done, we see Crips..we see preachers with shotguns..foreign murder "tourists" who want to come murder for a holiday. I could've used some less cheesy lines. I could have used less satire and more horror. I could've went without the false jump scares. I guess the one thing that stays with me after is I am one of those poor class that a good percentage of the rich wished they could do away with to lessen taxes. I also thought about the fact that the hate and insanity I have seen this year politically is very much exaggerated and immediate. Also, this Purge idea doesn't seem like such an impossibility. It also reminds to VOTE democrat!!!! Despite it's flaws, it was entertaining and I appreciated what it was shooting for. Pardon the pun...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Purge cranks things up a notch, and the result is one big thrill ride</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Three summers ago, writer and director James DeMonaco introduced us with a wildly compelling idea that lead to box office success, high enough to spawn a sequel the following year which manage to score a nice feed at the box office as well. Though the franchise didn't start off on a high note, it was strong enough to establish more than just a stand alone thriller flick. The first film answered the question of what would happen if the government legislated an act known as The Purge, an act where the law enforcement becomes suspended for 12 hours and citizens are allowed to commit any crime without the fear of arrest or prosecution. The sequel supplemented the idea and took at a wider scale rather than the home invasion type plot we saw on the predecessor, and the results showed a quality improvement. This film however, takes a more ambitious and compelling direction with a plot energized with political themes and psychological elements. This time around, we meet U.S Senator Charlie Roan (played by Elizabeth Mitchell), a candidate running for president with an intent on abolishing the Purge Act as she sees it more harmful than beneficial to the country. Her political campaign ignites outrage to the public. On the night of the annual Purge, Roan is enclosed in her home with Leo Barnes (played by Frank Grillo from the previous film) now working as a Secret Service agent to protect her. When the angry citizens including corrupt law officials outside come after her with an intent to assassinate her, Roan must band together with Barnes along with a few other individuals to survive against the gangs and bandits who prey on the poor senator.This third entry swallows basically the same premise as the previous two films. However, this is the first film that finally makes further use of the concept introduced in the first outing. Rather than relying on solely on the survival of a band of individuals, this film spawns a political premise centering on the lead character running for presidential election against another candidate with opposing ideas relating the Purge, a concept that coincides with this year's presidential tug-o-war between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. Does the film succeed in making the political elements of the plot work? In some degree, it does. But politics are not the only subject that grip the spotlight here, the film also employs some psychological elements in the mix. The plot progresses with Frank Grillio reprising from the previous film to protecting the senator when society attempts to turn the tables on her, and we experience not only a more cohesive plot than what we endured in the past but also how the characters including a store owner played by Mykelti Williamson, his employee played by Joseph Julia Sora change during the dreadful night, and the script does a fine with this. Though not all the characters are likable or particularly developed, the performances the cast delivers stand strong. The crude racial stereotypical dialogue Mykelti Williamson's character spits out often alternates between very funny and out-of-place but serves as the dark humor counterpart. Aside from a few flaws in the plot and characters, there are plenty of effective heart-pounding thrills and tense action sequences including bloody shootouts that are pulse-pounding to watch, while occasionally tainted by some jerky camera work.The Purge: Election Year is an intense, thrilling third installment that pulls off a rare task of improving upon both the first and second entry, and this all done with an ambitious direction and plot that though suffers some blemishes, manages to make up for one big thrill ride.</fullReview>

Somehow, he manages to bring back the personal stakes from the first film and incorporate them organically with his nihilistic world building in the second. The acting was solid and cinematographer Jacques Jouffret continues to paint the scenes with his odd palette of American Gothic and gaudiness.Be warned: There is a clear political stance held by all three films designed to rattle the Evangelical Right and the One Percenters, so expect much nay saying from reactive trolls in thrall to the like.The Purge: Election Year wins my vote by bringing an unpredictable and unsettling end to a violent and thought provoking series.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Purged. Not bad.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved the concept for these films right off the bat. When I saw the first one I was let down by how much the film covered. I watched the second one, which had a great concept about the difference between the rich and the poor; I loved it. And then today I saw the third, and honestly, I'd put it's quality between the first and second film. So I saw the film today and I don't see a whole lot in the theaters but I've paid and went for this trilogy. So yes I was looking forward to this. The concept for this film was as good as the second. It brings more meaning behind ruthless killing aside from the obvious 'purging'. --First the bad..The concept for the film brought me there and kept me there but a few things I couldn't get over. One of which was the hired mercenaries with the swastika tattoos and white power written on their gear. They didn't say a single thing about it. Some people are just racist, yes but their whole squad was with no backstory and no one saying anything about it the entire film. Truthfully, they needed more characters, good and bad, over the three films that they could expand on. Too many new characters are pushed into an hour and forty-five minutes. I just needed more character development.On the topic of putting in too much into the film, these movies always have great ideas but don't quite expand on them. For example: the immigrants coming to America to purge is absolutely brilliant, and it does tie in at one point but for way too brief of a time. Truly this alone could make a film. Also I want to mention the rescue van, the senator's family being murdered, and the killer of the senator's family, what was his story? --Then the good..So I loved that they brought back Frank Grillo. Being the nerd I am I know that he said he would only come back for the sequel until after he read the script and thought it was good enough. Speaking of which, it sounds like a lot of a-list actors are doing that lately; thank God. His character being in this film is a good part of what made it work, partly because he was so good in the previous film. Returning to the film that's probably loved by anyone who watches these films, is the 'adult Halloween'. Nothing is better than a bunch of murderous psychos except dressed up ones. I mean who doesn't like any film before this one that has strong examples of such.Now the story arch is pretty simple but not bad. The idea is terrific of someone from past traumatic experiences brought on from The Purge, makes her join politics and try and stop The Purge. However like the other good examples in the film, they don't do enough to expand it. However watching the senator go from point a to b while being hunted is fantastic entertainment. The film is half horror and half action which isn't really done very much. I guess it's also kind of a thriller; I'm not sure but who cares cause it was awesome. All in all I gave the film a 7/10 because it could have improved but hey, so could most films. Anyways the film as I said was between number one and two in my opinion. The first was okay, slightly disappointing. The second film exceeded my expectations. This third, and I think final film, was basically what I thought it would but. It was okay. I would recommend seeing the film in theaters just because of the action and the sound of the action in the theaters makes it much better. All in all, not bad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Urge To Purge Continues</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During the second decade of the 21st century, there has been a particular series of films that manage to posit a spectacularly Dystopian American future in which there is a twelve-hour period of government-sanctioned killing and pillaging. That series is the "Purge" series, a series that writer/director James DeMonaco (who had only directed 2009's LITTLE NEW YORK before starting this series, but had also co-written the 2005 remake of John Carpenter's 1976 cult classic ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13), began with the original film in 2013, and then continued on with THE PURGE: ANARCHY in 2014. And in the summer of 2016, he slipped in the political angle to the whole thing with THE PURGE: ELECTION YEAR.Pushing the series into the third decade of the 21st century, DeMonaco sets the action, horror, and violence in and around our nation's capital. It is almost the coming of spring, which of course means that the date is coming for the annual "Purge Night", where everyone gets to purge themselves of their violent tendencies and takes that violence out on others. But this year, specifically 2025, there is pushback, in the form of senator Charlie Roan (Elizabeth Mitchell), who is running for president on a campaign platform to do away with the Purge on the grounds that the poor and indigent are the ones targeted the most by it. The problem is, however, that this makes her the target for the National Founding Fathers of America (NFFA), the vaguely White Supremacist supergroup that has supported the purge from the beginning. And on this particular night, save for her principal Secret Service agent (Frank Grillo, reprising his role from ANARCHY), her security detail is unknowingly made up of NFFA agents, who proceed to slaughter the real ones assigned to protect her. Mitchell and Grillo thus find themselves on the streets of D.C. having to survive, but being able to entrust a store owner (Mykelti Williamson), his Mexican-born clerk (Joseph Julian Soria), and various others in avoiding the worst of the worst of the NFFA. But the group they have fallen in with has plans to assassinate the NFFA's top leader (Kyle Secor), something that Mitchell clearly doesn't want to have happen, not only because she fears it would taint her campaign, but would make martyrs out of the Messianic maniac and his NFFA institution. After some extremely violent battles with the NFFA, all but destroying the group, Mitchell is finally elected president and immediately signs the executive order doing away with the Purge?or so she thinks.One cannot help but think that DeMonaco designed THE PURGE: ELECTION YEAR to be, among other things, political, as its release coincided with possibly the most toxic presidential campaign cycle in American history. The first two "Purge" films took elements of such disturbing films as NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, and STRAW DOGS, and also added in the surveillance state angles explored in MINORITY REPORT and THE OSTERMAN WEEKEND, as well as George Orwell's "1984". Here in the third installment of the franchise (and, it would appear, not to quite be the last), DeMonaco adds the political assassination angles of JFK and IN THE LINE OF FIRE. Mitchell and Grillo are very good in their roles, as are Williamson and Soria, The notion of ethnic members of the community helping White pillars of the political structure like Mitchell and Grillo because they agree that the Purge is something that needs to be put on the ash heap of history is also a hopeful angle. As had happened in ANARCHY, however, DeMonaco seems just a little too intent in upping the profane language to a bit of a ridiculous level, and the violence to levels just a bit too close to such "torture porn" films as HOSTEL and SAW for comfort. One wishes that he had more confidence in his storytelling abilities to leave all of the extreme language and violence out in the cold, and avoid turning this into another ultra violent summer action/horror flick.But for all of the violent and verbal excesses, which seemed to try and make an appeal to a crowd out for that stuff, THE PURGE: ELECTION YEAR maintains a certain dark continuity in the danger of extremist political groups, many of them of the White Supremacy variety, out to conquer and divide Americans so that they can set up a long and wide kill zone from New York to Los Angeles and every little town and big city in between. Secor's role as the power-crazy Rev. Edwidge Owens is that of a modern-day Jim Jones, and only a slight exaggeration of the extreme forces that can and often have been unleashed in America from time to time when Americans need someone else to blame instead of looking into the mirror at our own selves. Perhaps this is all propagandistic to many;, but it would seem that that's how DeMonaco wants, even though he stumbles a few times here.</fullReview>

On the other hand, this completes the series perfectly, or as close as it may ever get to it, and they should let it end here.Once again, this is not sci-fi. That hasn't changed. What we have is an expansion and development of the dystopian, modern-day alternate reality the first setup so well.

		<fullReview>The first Purge film was my least favorite mainly due to the fact of the pacing it felt really slow and most of the scenes took place in a house felt very cramped... Second film probably my favorite because of how crazy it was very entertaining you really have to cherish gems like this too far and few good films come out to the big screen especially horror/slasher genere its pretty non existent actually all horror is pretty non existent as of late mainly floating on the dollar bills of paranormal type films lots of ghost stuff right now and all pg 13 sadly.. almost all horror recently or any good attempt at horror has been met with either negative reviews for no reason or just plain bad rating choices limiting the horror experience to a family crowd for just jump scares and no gore. One title in particular being The Lazarus effect really well done film great ideas could have done better with story but really left a good ending for a sequel sadly poor reviews because it had a similar plot to some past films and tried to do something different which was really cool I thought. But my main point is this franchise is golden who ever says the purge films sucks have never seen a good film. I agree they could be a little bit better a little more on the scary side instead of action but I wouldn't have it any other way because its hard to really scare people these days we seen all the tricks Id rather a film do what it can do instead of try and fail miserably. Purge really makes a good slasher/gore/action film there are some horror/thriller elements present but that's not what holds the film together its mainly a thrill ride. I would rather see more purge films than all these other reboots and remakes we keep getting so I say keep on! I would like another Seargent storyline but afterwards I think its time to drop him and tell a new tale its time for some nice spin offs from the purgers viewpoint or some really cool stories outside DC maybe a farm town where a band gets stranded and has to try and defend themselves on the tour bus from a bunch of redneck purgers! Either way if you haven't seen a purge film watch not just one watch two to get a good feel for it you might hate one and absolutely love the next one. I cant stand the first one I hate it... so to each their own. But give it a try you wont be disappointed its a really fun watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Purge movies have never been perfect, though how often can you call a movie perfect? What was important to me was that Purge: Anarchy sidestepped the curse of the sequel to better the original, and whereas my intuition had me worrying that Election Year would be its downfall, it's now in my opinion the best of the three! I believe that decent movies with potential deserve sequels over all else, with that in mind, and to see The Purge going from strength to strength has been a pleasure. Election Year's strength is that we get one particular surviving character that we can be emotionally invested in before the film has established itself.Frank Grillo returns as Leo Barnes, once a cop and now personal security for a senator pushing to end the Purge if she becomes president. With that, the clock is already ticking as the powers that be want her dead.Establishing new characters surviving purge night in Los Angeles, the addition of Mykelti Williamson is more than welcome, but I especially loved some of the new villains brought in, such as the psychotic schoolgirls and the battle hardened mercenary leader. It further reminded me of the Playstation 2 Manhunt games which I once lived for and gave Barnes way too much to contend with, upping the stakes, the suspense and the thrilling edge-of-your-seat battles.One one hand, the film doesn't leap as far as it could, but not in the premise or where some actors seem to go overkill with their characters. Some others don't act like they're fighting for their lives or have any sense of conviction at all and some opportunities for jumps and scares aren't utilised. There were underwhelming moments just as I was warming up for a good fright.But on the other hand, whereas critics miss the point in explaining why this would never happen in reality, Purge continues on the path not taken to bring something of a modern day Orwellian nightmare crossed with Manhunt and The Running Man.It's sheer action and suspense, fantastical and unashamed, and you will root for these characters like never before if you loved the last one!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent thriller that has you screaming for more</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you liked the first 2 purges, or at least the second one, you'll love this. So far the only negative reviews I've seen come from conservatives who really hate liberals and their "agenda". Granted this movie is heavy on politics and the main bad guys are portrayed as all white old men. However there are plenty of gang fights and killings as well as a group of psychotic murderous black girls, contrary to the reviews that say "all the white people are depicted as bad, and all the minorities are depicted as good". If you are a white supremacist or ultra conservative, yeah, you probably won't like this movie and will give it a bad review just because of your political beliefs. However if you can put all that aside and just enjoy the movie for the action packed thrill ride that it is, you won't be let down. I hope for more purges in the future, but if not, it was a hell of a ride.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A thought-provoking horror film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It can be hard to take a movie in the 'Purge' series seriously at times, for the simple reason that the idea is so insane and irrational. Yet the films take themselves very seriously. I'm a big fan of the series, but I'm well aware that you have to completely suspend belief before going in, otherwise you're not going to have a good time. By the looks of things 'The Purge: Election Year' will be the final film in the series, completing the trilogy. The series has kept the same director, James DeMonaco, for all three films and I believe this has helped in a large way to keep the quality across all three as well.This is a really fun film. Visually it's stunning and the usual violence levels are certainly there. The thing that blew me away in this one though was some of the issues it chooses to deal with. There are more political and religious views in this film than most dramas ever come close to touching on. For a horror film to achieve that is a very special thing. It's safe to say I've enjoyed each 'Purge' movie more than the last one, so I'll be a little sad if this does turn out to be the last installment. I still think there were a lot more ideas to be explored with the idea (a prequel would be a lot of fun), but if this is indeed the end then bravo to them. They went out on top.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>3rd Times The Charm?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was good but not the best we have seen out of "The Purge" series. It was the same story line, everyone purges and something bad of course always happens. This time though, it was a Senator that was running for president. The movie became about protecting her so she could be elected and end the purge for good. I think it was a good story line, except the one part of the girl that wanted to kill a guy for a candy bar..and the fact that they made it seem like every single person wanted the Senator dead. The movie became all about the protection of the senator vs any actual purging. One part that was pretty awesome for me though was when the psycho candy bar girl finally got shot and her crazy friend got ran over. I think this movie was great but they seemed to go off track a little bit compared to the first and second. Three is enough, a fourth one will kill this series.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as the The Purge: Anarchy but still pretty good.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoy it for what it was a good action rump with a half decent story and a shallow political untone. It could have been done better, it needed more politics, more double, triple, Quadruple crossing you expect during an election year. It would have been better if it was link more into the last film, more integrated universe.There were a few scares, seeing people making money off the purge, it becoming something tourists attend were all plausible. The villains were over the top but that kinda works in this universe. Looking forward to seeing what Purge 4 does.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the best but... Really good.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Elizabeth Mitchell (Lost) is Charlie Roan, a Presidential candidate targeted for death on Purge night because of her vow to eliminate the Purge. And Frank Grillo (Captain America, Warrior) is her bodyguard. A fun horror action style movie. This part turn political and the stereotypes are always the same. White people are corrupt and bad boys, and looooove kill blacks and inmigrant people. And its annoying. Best part for me? The church, so creepy and... bizarre? Finally, the franchise make his point and get a movie that keep you on point for almost two hours. I expected a bit more from this movie but still interesting. Great concept, its not my fav, but very good. I hope they don't make a fourth part and we're gonna remember The purge like a great saga movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We were cruising along, and everything was just fine. Of course, there was a little problem with realism and believability, when it came to a guy who has long helped out in the community, somehow denying a high school girl a candy bar on the day of the purge, but everything else was okay. I even turned to my wife and said how wonderful it was that Black Men, a White Man, A Latino Man, A White Woman and Black Women were all working together to get through the ghastly purge. I remember telling her that that is the way it should be (different races and sexes working together for the good of humankind). Then, suddenly, in the last few minutes, devoid of necessity, the new Purge showed that America and Hollywood are still the same...In the end, the heroes, the Black Men, are murdered, while everyone else lives to enjoy the benefits of their labor, just as in the majority of all other Hollywood movies...just as the US has tried to keep it and believes it should be in real life.At least, they are consistent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>With America's first Real Life Purge set for March 21, 2017 . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>. . . THE PURGE: ELECTION YEAR could not be more timely. What some U.S. Citizens STILL do not realize is that President-Elect Trump is inevitable. His inexorable surge into the White House is guaranteed by a U.S. Supreme Court tied 4 to 4, leaving the American Military as the Final Decider (after Trump buys enough "Faithless Electors" to insure at least a 269-269 Electoral College stalemate). Since the U.S. Armed Forces already have given us such Famous Purgers as Texas Tower shooter Charles Whitman, Dallas JFK assassin Lee Harvey Oswald, Oklahoma City Bomber Tim McVeigh, Dallas Cop Shooter Micah Xavier Johnson, and countless others like them, they surely can be counted upon to flunk out Hillary from the Electoral College, install Trump in the White House, and close out America's last freely contested election. THE PURGE makes it clear that Trump will immediately declare Martial Law, suspend the antiquated 1789 U.S. Constitution, pledge allegiance to the New Founding Fathers of America Party (few Republicans ever thought that Trump actually was one of them), and institute a Real Life PURGE to Rid America of all the Poor People taxing its budget. His female rival (Hillary, called "Charlie" in this template flick) will be ceremoniously slaughtered, as pictured here: by Fundamentalist, All-White Rich People wearing Confederate Flag Patches and Modified Swastikas, which describes typical Trump Rally-Goers to a tee.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horror Sci-Fi brings the message with intelligence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first Purge was a straightforward horror film with a scary idea. The second one was better as the idea expanded to include social commentary. This final part brings the trilogy together and brings the ideas presented frighteningly close to Real World problems.Sci-fi at its best in literature and movies talks about our Now by showing us the future. Also great action movies don't have to be dumb, Look at the first Matrix film. Smart ideas hidden in blistering action and hard core Sci-Fi.It's a pleasure to watch this trilogy grow and an equal pleasure to watch a writer and director expand his ideas and his filmmaking skills across the three movies. As a side note, there is a lovely John Carpenter vibe to parts two and three.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>the stupid people who rated this movie as a bad movie may go to china sea and drink all the sea water there, the movie without hesitation is an excellent movie, it shows how good and bad versus each other,Frank Grillo is showing his best as usual, i hope Hollywood directors can reconsider to use this actor with a long term contract, i am sure he will have success more when he is acting solo, thanks to Michael Bay as one of the producers the movie was perfect in my eyes, it should not be any further criticism otherwise, critics are just trying to lose their stupid mind, that is my opinion and i hope it is helpful to viewers and finally i wish Frank Grillo all the best in his future movies, i respect this guy a lot</fullReview>

		<fullReview>great movie! the best purge so far, better be a 4th. It was more of a sick twisted action movie then scary. Loved it, I would say for the 4th movie to make it scarier but an unreal movie.I really hope there is another movie after. I think included more scary parts will make it better. Loss focus and became more action. Please produce more purge movie and asap. If you liked purge 1 or 2, you will love 3. If you never watch the purge you will love it. I do say watch Purge 2 before 3. You may get lost with relations between both movie 2 &amp; 3. Overall I would give this movie a 9 out of 10. I would say to up that score would to be scarier. That's the only improvement I can say to make.Thank you for reading my review. Have an amazing day. Watch the Purge 3. You will be missing out if you don't.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't been watching "The Purge" films still yet decided to catch this one called "Election Year" as it's only fitting that they have one made and out during the presidential election year. The plot is pretty simple Mrs. Roan a survivor of a purge years ago is now a senator and she plans on running for president and her opponent is under the table and behind the scenes supporting the night of the purge a night of terror and destruction. You name everything goes from murder to hostage taking and many scenes include people tied up and gagged and even having their mouths taped with duct tape! It's crazy to do this so people can all come over to the other side clearly it's war it's anarchy it's like the end of time. Overall this film isn't the greatest still it entertains it's a fun little watch of a rising of tyrants and vigilantes at their tried best!</fullReview>
