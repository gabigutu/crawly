		<shortDescription>Absolutely delightful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This rainy day emergency activity last weekend turned out to be the best decision of the holidays. Based on the Arthur Ransome classic with a slightly altered plot, it was a bit slow to get started, but once the main family arrive in the lakes the kids' adventure begins and my two were on the edge of their seats.The scenery is breathtaking (without any special effects) and for the kids the sense of a REAL adventure must be inspiring. The Walker family children (Swallows) are allowed to go and camp on an island in the middle of a lake and basically fend for themselves. Once on the island it becomes clear that they're not alone and soon war is declared with two local pirate girls (Amazons). The kids catch fish, play with fire, shoot bows and arrows. There is no need to add superheroes or special effects, real life is adventurous enough.There are some great funny moments, a couple of which had the whole audience in stitches.Thoroughly recommended, even if it's not raining!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautiful breath of fresh air.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A breath of fresh air in these CGI-dominated days. And in fact fresh air is something this film promotes. Getting the kids out and into nature.For those unfamiliar with the story, it is from a classic book from the 1930s. Four children, the Walkers, are on holiday in the Lake District and plead with their mother to be allowed to sail alone on a lake and discover an island.Reluctantly, after gaining permission via telegram from their father "Better Drowned Than Duffers. If Not Duffers Won't Drown" they set off on their adventure. The island, however has been claimed by two other children, The Amazons. The two groups decide to battle it out to decide who can call the island theirs.In the meantime, the Amazons' uncle is a shady character who seems to be up to something. He is being tailed by two spies who want to get their hands on his secrets.The two story lines collide and the children find themselves in a bigger battle than they first imagined.Firstly, this film is beautifully shot and is a real treat for the eyes. The great British countryside, in particular the Lake District, has rarely looked so good.Director Phillippa Lowthorpe has obviously realised how stunning the scenery is and made full use of it.The child actors, too, are really great. They fight and squabble like all families do, but there is a real bond between them and I could see myself in all the children - particularly headstrong John Walker.I also loved the Amazons. Two feisty, funny girls who don't need boys to help them. Great chemistry between them.The adults, too, are fine support. I really liked Jessica Hynes as Mrs Jackson and Andrew Scott as a suave, sinister Russian.The script is excellent. A story that gentle needs a little bit more to it. After all, kids just scooting about in boats in an attempt to win a small battle would not really do these days. The beefing up of the spy angle kept the pot boiling and apparently is true to the original author's life.All the kids in the cinema loved it. There are a lot more laughs than you expect and the boy Roger Walker makes the most of them. Many of the children near me were glued to their seats and when the final, dramatic scene unfolded, they were gripped.Overall, it is proper family film. Grandparents, parents and kids could all go and enjoy it for different reasons. I don't think this is a film for older teenagers or anyone in their 20s. It's not really for them, I expect, though.I thoroughly recommend this charming and warm British film. I'm so glad I saw it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A vibrant new adaptation of a much treasured book.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story of 'Swallows and Amazons' occupies a small place in my heart. Every night, I used to read a little bit of a book to my kids when they were tucked up in bed. And one of these books was 'Swallows and Amazons' by Arthur Ransome. I thought it might be a nice read and so we launched into it. The book grabbed me as much as it grabbed my kids. Here, you see, give or take a few elements, was my own childhood transcribed in a book. The lake, the boats, the island, the camp fire, the fish, the adventure. The little story transposed itself effortlessly into the vivid geography of my own memories and validated the adventures of my youth.So, this afternoon, I set off to see the brand new film that's just been released in cinemas. I'm glad to report that those places in my heart are safe and sound and, if anything, have been made just a little bit bigger.There are additional story elements in the film, necessary to enable the transfer from page to screen in a completely engaging way, and these work admirably well. But it is the very 'outdoors'ey, adventuring nature of the book that weaves the main magic here. And that's the thing with Swallows and Amazons, it is a real accessible adventure. You don't need to be able to fly or leap tall buildings in a single bound to have an adventure. All you really need is a back garden, some conspirators, and a will to venture out. That's why the kids at this afternoon's show remained enraptured. The parents might have been nervous on their behalf, for where was the million pixel animation and where was the primary-coloured super hero? These heroes point their bow to the centre of the deep lake and, before they are done, will hold real fire in their hands. These are adventures that can be carried out from the cinema and into the real world. Children can see all that. Children know. In my own childhood adventures, I was definitely Roger. My elder brothers kept the knives, real and metaphorical, for themselves and always stood a little in defence between me and the world. You could see it clearly in young Bobby McCulloch's eyes, on screen. The burning need for acknowledgement, to be a bona fide big boy. I was Roger and he was me but each of the Walker children will find a soul mate in each darkened theatre where the film plays. Tatty is so wonderful, literate and feisty and the elder children carry the pressures and responsibilities that come with their station. This is, at the end of the day, a story for children and there must be an element of gentle threat and conspiracy and ultimately a general 'winning of the day'. But lots of adults, like myself, will come to the picture house with their furtive popcorn and they, too, will find what they seek. A sense of the outdoor childhood that we all remember a little better than it actually was. A time of freedom and adventure. A sense of home.I would highly recommend Swallows and Amazons. If you know the book and have some regard for it, or if you just want your children to see an adventure of the kind they could then go out and create for themselves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A reminder that a summer spent outdoors is the most memorable of all.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is this reviewer's humble opinion that British children's literature, with its whimsical nature and picturesque settings, is the best of its kind. It is also this reviewer's opinion that British filmmaking best capitalises on these elements, making for full-length features that are every bit as captivating as their source material.Set against the backdrop of the 1930s English Lake District (shot on location and realised here in breathtaking aerial views), Swallows and Amazons sees an innocent childhood sailing adventure become embroiled in a sinister conflict of interest between two mysterious parties. Though it preceded Enid Blyton's Famous Five stories it is strikingly similar in tone, and reinforces the notion that childhood detective fiction has been consistently appealing to us from Arthur Ransome's classic novel through to the television adventures of Scooby Doo.Held up by a veteran supporting cast including Harry Enfield and Kelly McDonald, the young Walker children are all an enthusiastic delight, chiefly responsible for rendering this particular adaptation so cheerily playful for the majority of its running time. Even when the atmosphere shifts and the film must briefly cease to reminisce on the carefree pleasures of our youths, the focus adapts accordingly to challenge the audience's perspective on responsibility; as Rafe Spall's cryptic Jim Turner tells an accountable John Walker, this is not (always) a game. While the topic of childhood privileges is one which the film has no obligation to comment on directly - the source material predating the advent of smart electronics by a great length of time - there are subtle nods to taking the great outdoors for granted which director Philippa Lowthorpe delivers as contemplative gestures, rather than heavy-handed sermons. Swallows and Amazons is precisely the film that family audiences need in 2016; a reminder that a summer spent outdoors, rather than five inches from a screen, is the most memorable of all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Timeless, Refreshing Family Adventure Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Took our 3 boys &amp; girl (aged 15-10) to watch this Arthur Ransome classic, based in the breathtaking Lake District. With not a spectacular Hollywood effect or Pokemon in sight, we were unsure if this film could keep the attention of our hi tech action addicted family......How wrong were we!! They all absolutely loved it.The plot was slightly different to how I remembered from the book (many years ago!) however the story was just as enjoyable.The Walker family head over to the island on their 'Swallow' boat, where they soon discover they're not alone. The Amazons, have already set up camp and a battle starts for the island. With Britain on the verge of war, their gutsy adventures are complicated by the adult world of espionage.This film was full of laughter, drama and adventure, bringing this classic novel to life.A family film not to be missed this summer!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Charming film, delightful story line</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was interested to watch the film having seen the promotion and trailers. Having never read the book and despite having bought a copy to do so before watching the film, my daughter grabbed the book off me and avidly read it before I had chance! I was also keen to see a film directed by Phillipa Lowthorpe having seen the first series of To Call a Midwife. I also love the Lake District, so what better way than to spend a rainy Saturday than watching a film showing one of my favourite areas of the U.K.I wasn't disappointed. The film was full of old charm, an innocence of children long gone. The scenery was stunning and shot beautifully. I was also incredibly impressed by the young actors, especially those not established in the film industry and whose first role it was. I thoroughly enjoyed the film and it's great to see a film that isn't all "Hollywood" special effects, but good acting, good story line, and beautifully shot scenes.I now need to revisit the lakes and remind my children adventures don't start on your phone! My daughter who had read the book also loved the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Take me to the Lake District</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched the latest Swallows and Amazons with some trepidation as I was a huge fan of the old version. I hadn't mind that the old one was so slow and so uneventful. But the new version is simply perfect. I love that it operates on two levels: the joyous if sometimes chopsy relationships between the kids; and the clever way that Arthur Ransome's life as a spy/Guardian journalist is woven into the plot. So much for the script (which is terrific). As for the scenery and cinematography well I could have stared at the lakes for hours and the boats bobbing along. I would have liked more sailing and more time for the children to have messed about having fun to sharpen the contrast between the adult and children story lines and because the kids were so good. The adult acting was generally excellent. Andrew Scott was and is always amazing. Fenella Wolgar got some of the biggest laughs and it was lovely to see Harry Enfield obviously enjoying himself. I think the child actors are well cast and can carry the film as and when needed. I saw quite a few kids crawling onto parents laps during the moments of tension or jumping at key points. It's undoubtedly the only true and honest family film of this summer. But you can revel in it as an adult too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Swallows and Amazons: we bring the summer with us</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I took my two nieces and two nephews to this film today with their grandparents/my parents and my sister. It's a rare occasion when 3 generations can sit in a cinema and watch and enjoy the same film. For a start the film is visually LUSH. It's so beautiful to look at and combined with the music is a tonic for any frazzled parent/grandparent. Secondly the children were absolutely gripped by the action; and the boys immediately identified with John and Roger and the various injustices they suffered. The girls (both 13) were delighted to see girls who could do everything the boys did and more; who didn't care about appearances or looking messy and who stood up for themselves. I left wanting Kelly MacDonald to be my mum; I wanted to take the kids sailing: or better still let them go sailing on their own. I can't remember a more vivid evocation of childhood: the dialogue sounded so much like real conversations that I wondered at first whether it was improvised. I cried at the end because the children portrayed seemed so much more alive than child actors normally appear. And super support from the likes of Andrew Scott and Jessica Hynes. Enjoy and remember!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good childhood flick that makes you proud of the British Countryside</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>British TV movie and mini series director Philippa Lowthorpe, films an adaptation of Arthur Ransome's popular children's book series 'Swallows and Amazons' set on a fictional lake but inspired on the Lake District and the Norfolk Boards. Admittedly, I haven't read the novels so it's hard for me to comment on the adaptation but it's a cute children's adventure with bravery, drama and some sibling rivalry. We follow a cast of young unknowns, the Walkers, which are similar to the children from Narnia or the Famous Five; typically British for that era going camping, fishing and sailing that brought me back to my childhood of secret base building and wading in the local stream looking for sticklebacks. The names we should recognise are Kelly Macdonald and Rafe Spall, with an up and coming Andrew Scott. Kelly playing the encouraging, free-spirited mother and Rafe playing a suspicious and mostly obnoxious character who's obviously got something to hide. But the kids steal the show, and rightly so, it's about them after all and they do a grand job especially the emotional and excitable Roger played by Bobby McCulloch. Have to mention Brit comedian Harry Enfield who plays Mr. Jackson which was a surprise to me but a delight in any case. The scenery is lush and makes you proud of the British countryside which makes me wonder if people from the rest of the world see all this green and think "wow, that looks so beautiful." There's a great score from Ilan Eshkeri, (Stardust, The Young Victoria) that's enchanting and very fitting for the children's adventure adding dramatic effect and suspense. It feels longer than the 97min running time and wavered slightly in the what felt like the middle of the story. I can imagine there was a lot of ground to cover and possibly a challenge to fit everything into the film, not that any part felt rush. It's well shot with some great camera work and is some light-hearted entertainment for the whole family, however it isn't a grand spectacle but then again I don't think it tries to be.

		<shortDescription>Updated but not quite ruined. Would Arthur Ransome approve?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For many of a certain age, Swallows and Amazons is embodied in the 1974 film, shot on the lakes and around the towns that Ransome knew and with a script quite faithful to the book. John, Susan, Titty, Roger, Nancy and Peggy were all terrifically well spoken and there was never so much as a strong word shared between them. The lakes were sunny and idyllic and nothing, not even a false accusation and a burglary could really upset the peace. Let's be clear, this remake sheds much of this and introduces more peril and to be honest, a more accurate representation of sibling interaction the world over.The saying in the Lakes is that they don't have poor weather, you just have the wrong clothing for the current conditions. Maybe in Ransome's memory, the sun did always shine, but for anyone who has spent any time in the area will know exactly how the lakes remain quite so full and the countryside quite so green. This is faithfully presented in this version and all the better it looks for it.The writers have chosen to add slightly more animation to the original story line, but have done so in an innovative way by calling on Ransome's real past. He spent long periods in Russia during the Great War and it is widely understood he was a spy as much as a newspaper reporter. Bearing in mind that Ransome based Captain Flint on himself, this seems perfectly acceptable. Right from the off, the action steps up a gear and the finale is to be honest, a little contrived. It does however, add another facet to the story line, as well as a little more back story and purpose to Captain Flint's life. The cast is generally very good and the kids do a great job of playing slightly restless, bickering siblings, exploring not only their surroundings, but also the limits of their capabilities. One thing Ransome was always very clear on was that there could not be any "frisson" between the older Swallows and Amazons and it is good to see that at least this aspect has been respected by the writers.The scenery is still beautiful, the production values high and on the whole, the editing keeps the pace jogging along quite nicely. I do have a problem though. Just who is the film aimed at? No doubt a die-hard bunch of 50-somethings will watch it, dragging children and grandchildren along in tow, but compared to the current crop of fantasy action adventures, it still feels quite tame and slow moving.One for a rainy afternoon maybe, but possibly not destined to become a modern classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>disappointing to say the least</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To me this was a perfect opportunity to create something special from something classic gone completely wrong. Some of the scenes were lovely to look at but overshadowed by the underwhelming story lines. The acting was completely wooden, the 2 smaller children were quite fun and played their parts well, the older ones however could really have learned something from them. Their characters were completely wooden, no personality, enthusiasm or expression. In the past few years we have seen some amazing child actors such as, The BFG, Pan and What we did on our holiday to name just a few. How then did this go so wrong? As a family we watch a lot of films , old and new, we also spend a lot of time going to the cinema , so pride ourselves in being able to appreciate all sorts of film genres. When we saw this advertised we were quite excited and thought it had a lot of potential. Sadly we walked out of the cinema after seeing this feeling totally unfulfilled.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Children on a boating holiday in the Lake District get mixed up with spies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The makers of this rather odd film don't seem to have been able to make up their minds whether they were doing Swallows and Amazons or The Thirty Nine Steps, and so have gone for a rather awkward blending of the two. Clearly they don't think that Ransome's gentle story of a boating holiday in the Lake District is exciting enough for modern audiences, and they may be right. So on the train on the way to the lake District we get Sinister Spies erupting into the Walker children's compartment (mother has gone outside for a smoke) and one of them (Uncle Jim no less) ends up climbing about on the outside of the train and jumping off. Uncle Jim is in fact the world's worst spy ever. He leaves secret papers and photos lying about in the cabin of his boat in plain view, and doesn't even bother to lock the door when he goes out. He does everything to draw attention to himself except wearing a hat with 'Spy' on it. There is still room for some boating and camping on the island, and when the film stick to what is actually in the book it isn't bad, but the spy stuff weighs the film down, and gets steadily more absurd as the film goes on, culminating in a scene of such joyous absurdity i was reduced to tears of laughter. As a film of Swallows and Amazons this is badly flawed, but is worth 5 out of 10 for making me laugh so much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Script lets it down</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a real shame for me. I haven't read the book and went into this blind, but didn't enjoy it all that much. What's saddening about this film is that it's one of those films that gets everything right, from the beautiful cinematography to the amazing directing to the great casting, but with a lacklustre script. Maybe it's true to the source, but it comes off as awkward and fake, with pieces of dialogue not making much sense followed by the previous piece, and characters going from upset to overwhelmingly happy in a split second. It doesn't feel real. This is sad because the script is only one element of a huge project, but a film needs a good script to be great.Overall, though, I did enjoy it. Not as high as other films released this year, but definitely not one of the worst I've watched. Children probably will enjoy it, as will fans of the novel from what I've read, but I'd recommend something else for others. If you're going for anything, it should be for the beautiful scenes and shots. Love the use of fog.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605; - like Narnia, but without the interesting stuff</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Philippa Lowthorpe's first feature film as director - during a summer holiday in the 1930s, four children head off for an adventure in the lake district. While they're up there, they sail on lakes, claim ownership of an island, make enemies with another family and get tangled in a Russian spy mystery. Sounds interesting on paper.The trouble is when you do movies like this that revolve almost entirely around children, you have to have really good child actors and directors who know how to get good performances out of them (like Spielberg does). 'Swallows' Hughes, Hill, McCulloch and Malleson- Allen, with the best will in the world, aren't great. They just about incarnate the innocence needed, but really have no conviction or substance like Fegley does in the new Pete's Dragon, for example. It all feels a little too much like a school play. Spall adds a little experience to the mix, but his actions are outdone by 'Amazons' Hawkes and Thorp, who bring the tone back down again.I've not read the original novel, so I can't compare, but the story is a bit of a mess. Four siblings on a camping adventure is fine - it all gels nicely - but the added side plot of Spall perhaps being some sort of spy, and Scott (reusing his Spectre character) chasing after him, felt misplaced and conveniently adjacent to a completely different story. There are a fair few moments in the movie that also just seem to happen because they needed something exciting to occur - like people falling overboard for no reason - which are more confusing than entertaining.Swallows And Amazons isn't a bad movie, it just could have used more experience and quality in front of and behind the camera. It's a fairly fun and innocent two hours, but it'll never be a classic like the novel is - pity.3/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The acting and the script are the worst and it gets more and more ridiculous as it goes on</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the 1930's novel, four children sail out to an island near their holiday destination until they come across another group of kids in their own boat which then leads to a series of incidents with a mysterious man living in a houseboat.Apparently this film is based on a "timeless,classic novel". Unfortunately this adaptation is neither timeless and I highly doubt it will ever become a classic. This is mainly due to the fact that a film that seems to be a sloppy mixture of a bad BBC 90's Christmas special, dodgy Countryfile and the acting and script of a primary school production (but a little bit worse) has and never will be a classic. As you may well have already worked out from the opening of this review, I didn't enjoy Swallows And Amazons. One line of dialogue is "This was going to be a very long summer" and I just sat there and thought "This was going to be one extremely long film!". And it was. It went on and on and on and as it went on the plot and the events unfolding on screen become more and more ridiculous. Yes it's a fictional film and you can stretch the boundaries with this sort of thing, but even with where this film goes it goes well over the boundaries and near the ending goes from about 90 to well over 1004 on a scale of how much nonsense the film is producing. As for the acting of the four lead characters all I can say is it is some of the worst acting I have ever seen by children in a film, even the older ones couldn't act for all the money in the world it's like primary school play, but much worse and ten times more annoying. One stand out child actor in this is the youngest lead who doesn't stand out for the best reasons. In a year where we've seen brilliant performances from younger actors in such things like Pete's Dragon and The BFG, this child knocks down that giant well built and strong tower with a piece of A4 paper. It's one of the worst performances of the year and yes he's a child but still a primary school production with an angry child in the supporting role not delivering his lines properly because he wanted the lead role is better. In fact it seems that the only person who can act is Andrew Scott who is one of the only decent and bearable thing about this film, unfortunately he's not actually in the film that often and doesn't have very much to do.What doesn't help is the fact that the script is unbearably stupid and annoying, all one character seems to say is "I don't like this..", "I don't like that...", "I want this...", "I want that.." and "Let me do this or I won't do that" and it gets so annoying and repetitive and causes the film to become longer and longer than it actually is. And that's about the middle ground of things along with the film getting more and more ridiculous as it goes on. There is so, so much wrong with this film and it get's worse and worse as it goes on.If you enjoyed the original book then you'll hate this adaptation of Swallows And Amazons, if you haven't read it, you'll still hate it, if you hated the book, guess what.. You'll still hate it! From the most annoying child actors ever to one of the worst scripts ever Swallows And Amazons gets more and more ridiculous as it goes on.** &lt;-- Two Stars (Out Of Five)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A children's classic besmirched by unnecessary sensitivity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How sad that someone's sensitivities (who's?) were considered so important that Titania's original name was changed to 'Tatty' for this film. The character's name is Titty, and has been since 1930 - a very long time - and I consider that the producers should be ashamed of themselves for giving in on such an insignificant matter. Do they not know the expression 'to Roger someone'? Do they not know what a 'John' is in certain societies? Where does all this lunacy stop?Perhaps the film lacks the intensity of modern, CGI, 'shoot 'em up' films, but the pleasure should lie in the bucolic idealism that Ransome illustrated in all his books. Oh, and the basics of how to sail, alongside other matters naval and historical. Fortunately interest in such activities remains high and will probably remain so for the next few centuries, unlike passing fads passed off as 'entertainment' but actually merely being another vehicle for profit.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Went off to spend a few hours on a wet afternoon to watch this..having never read the book i went in blind..First of all I can understand why the book was a best seller..the story of 3 parts comes together perfectly..a real pre-war naive telling of spies ..growing up and loneliness.Beautifully filmed and cinematically splendid..it has 2 things to let it down...and both are down to the director.Firstly..he got nowhere near as much from the young crew..sometimes you could tell he was unsure of how to communicate with the kids here...secondly the direction itself was very poor...maybe needs a lot more experience ..it was too early for such a classic story and should have waited 6 or 7 years to take it on.The film itself was a good enough way to spend a few hours and could have been a modern day Railway Children but was not magical enough..also the editor seems to have had a lapse in concentration...some things just did not make sense and felt rushed.Most sites give this a 7 but I think 5 is more on the mark as I am a twice weekly cinema visitor and expected more.</fullReview>
