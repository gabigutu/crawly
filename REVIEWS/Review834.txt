		<shortDescription>Heck of a Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Heck of a Western, I expected it would be good before I viewed it when I saw Joel Edgerton had a major role in the movieEdgerton can really bring it as a lead or support role. And he didn't disappoint.But I was extremely impressed with Portman. She has picked some stinker roles in the past however she proved IMO she is no longer just the pretty face and she has honed her craft to be a very good actor.Blows my mind that IMDb is only giving this movie a rating of 5.9 I am a big fan of westerns and I don't hand out high ratings with a whim or fancy.Good to see Ewan McGregor in a small role. I thought he nailed his part, as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a recent western made to be impressive</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To me, this movie makes a significant impression as it is being in our age of fewer western films because it plays realistically like an old authentic cowboy story used to be and supplies good scenery and props too. Jane, played by Natalie Portman, is convincing in a woman's perspective living on a tough frontier land where there is not much law and even less sympathy. In her bravery she is not invulnerable, yet she is believable as she perseveres through hard and traumatic times. The man acting as her former love plays great in a role where the two people need each other. The storyline could almost be seen as a love triangle plot with some twists. This film raises the audience's spirit as pertaining to the quality of Jane's character and her former fiancée's. It is a well done, recent cowboy saga reminiscent of some classic early westerns. The film has a good dose of action but one needs to understand the fill-in information flashbacks to appreciate it properly even though the plot is easy to grasp. It has a bittersweet ending overall and I recommend the show to romance and western enthusiasts as well as older movie goers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Serviceable Western Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After years of a troubled production, Jane Got a Gun finally got to the big screen, albeit in the month for cinema to dump their weak films, January. Although for me, that may have improved my enjoyment of the picture. I went in barely seeing any of the trailers or TV spots (were there any?) and with barely any expectations, so perhaps that improved my likeness of Jane Got a Gun. The film stars Natalie Portman, Joel Edgerton, and Ewan McGregor in a production that once had names like Bradley Cooper, Michael Fassbender, and Jude Law attached among others. I actually think the ending cast turned out pretty good as Portman and Edgerton shared unexpectedly great chemistry. I think the problem with the film is that I'm not sure the film had anything new to add to the world of cinema. There isn't anything special about Jane Got a Gun, but it is a well made film by Gavin O'Connor. His last film Warrior, is one of my favorite films of all time, and while it's nowhere near as good as that film, I think I can consider it one of the first surprises of 2016.O'Connor's choice of using flashbacks to fill in the gaps between the years in which Edgerton and Portman are apart, was a mistake. We get all of the character development we need in a few sit down scenes between the two later on in the film. The ending is also an extremely well handled shootout climax even if McGregor's character is very under developed. Overall, I think this a solid entry in for the western genre and O'Connor's filmography. But I also think that it doesn't feel like a polished project even though it has taken years to get to the big screen. There's plenty to like, including the incredible lead performances, but there's also plenty to shrug your shoulders about. No matter, I definitely enjoyed my experience watching Jane Got a Gun.+Portman and Edgerton+Tense finale+Much better than expectations after a troubled production-Still doesn't feel finished-No need for flashbacks7.2/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A rare Western jewel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was unpleasantly surprised by the bad reviews that Jane Got a Gun has received in the US by "experts". I'm a fan of Western movies and was delighted by the high quality of this film. The photography alone (superb) makes it worthwhile to watch. The dusty desert environment is awesome, the costumes magnificent and the acting s excellent.The story-line is original and Natalie Portman, as usual, extraordinary.In my opinion, this film has captured the style of the best Clint Eastwood westerns. Granted it uses the well trodden revenge plot, but it does it cleverly and keeps the spectator in constant suspense. Those daft commercial critics of the film, probably did not like both the story. But then, as usual, they were resorting to their pseudo sophisticated, near sighted inane criteria. I enjoyed the movie enormously from the beginning to the end. I certainly recommend this film to those Western film addicts like myself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jane Got a Gun and kind of missed the shot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was among the lucky people to have seen the movie premier in Paris tonight. Going in I was mildly excited for the film, wondering how much of an effect the tumultuous development had on the final product.Jane Got a Gun is interesting for sure but it's slooow. The first two acts are desperately trying to built tension with a slow dead like pace, and long silences, that only puts the audience to sleep. I actually dozed off a few times. It's a shame because I think there's something special about it. The story is good with a few minor surprises and solid acting. Even in the long silences the actors were engaged and conveyed the adequate emotions. Joel Edgerton and Natalie Portman have some great moments, their performances are riddles by subtleties that make for powerful scenes, ruined by shots a couple of seconds too long. The movie picks up though, it come as a breath of fresh air, after slogging our way through the first two acts.So after all of the cast and recast of actors and directors what suffered? My guess the editing because some scenes could have been cut short while maintaining the message. Jane Got a Gun could probably be one of those movies that will become a cult classic.By @ericgarcy</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>With fragmented narrative and awkwardly shot moments, Jane might have the gun but not the spark.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At the skin "Jane Got a Gun" might look like a gunslinger action flick, but this is more of a drama set in the Wild West with some action undertone for the backdrop. The visual often displays the scenes with overly dark contrast or extreme close up which is annoyingly jarring at times. Also, having high caliber actor and actress such as Ewan McGregor and Natalie Portman doesn't elevate the movie beyond average frontier drama.Jane (Natalie Portman) is searching for a bouncer to protect her and her wounded husband from a gang of outlaws. The one guy volunteering is her ex-lover, so you can see there's a lot of love triangle plot at play here. Its source material doesn't really offer anything more, there might be a couple of intense sequences, action and twist towards the end, but they are far from remarkable and the journey to reach there is dry.To its credit, the storytelling attempts two different timelines. The movie will shift from the current events to the ones from the past, it's a particularly nifty effort to highlight the encounter with specific characters and their relationship with the leads. However, the screenplay feels disjointed at times since there's barely any difference between past and present, and the drama from both eras are equally stagnant.Visual is mostly decent, although it too often shoots the characters' face far too closely, even simple conversation or motion is done needlessly in this manner. There's not adequate cinematography to showcase the gritty frontier atmosphere,, although a few scenery shots are commendable. Action is surprisingly soft, only occurring briefly and sporadically, it's passable but by no means outstanding."Jane Got a Gun" is not as exciting as it sounds to be, it's a casual drama that simply happens in Wild West.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jane's got a gun.No there ain't gonna be that song by Airosmith anywhere in the movie.The movie is average, pretty good acting, hot Natalie Portman is a major plus.But the story is a one dumb ass story.Get a load of this-A hot chick lives with a young guy. Guy leaves. She is pregnant with his child-The daughter is born. He doesn't write letters. She thinks he's dead. She decides to move to Cali.What does she do??-She hires a gang to transport her and her daughter to Cali or whatever-Gang leader thinks to use her and her daughter as sex workers.-One guy in a gang falls in love with her. He kills couple of gang members, steals Natalie from Big Boss and tells her that the gang killed her daughter-Natalie seriously cries and they leave to live happily ever after somewhere-They guy and Natalie have a new child. Also a daughter. Coz strong women give birth only to daughters. We all know that. Coz women have power. But they need protection.-Then one day the guy comes home all messed up shot up and bleeding. He tells Natalie that the gang is onto him and they are coming to kill him-Natalie as it says in the movie title Picks up a Gun, but now she gotta find someone to help her.. once againGuess who does she go to??You would never guessRemember that guy who left in the beginning??Yeah.. he came back and lives like 10 miles from the house where Natalie lives with this gang guy who stole her from the whorehouse-So Natalie comes to him and says.. yo dude.. i like really need your help.-The guy is obviously upset, coz it seems he already knew about Nataly living with that gang guy and was quite upset about it and already had a talk with Natalie about the whole situation before.Natalie told him before that she has new boyfriend now, she is a free woman and you can't control me. So GTFO of my face etc etcBut now she is all up in his face asking for help. And that's coolCoz Jane's got a gun.The guy tells her to GTFO. And she does. But later she gets caught by some gang dude in the alley and almost gets killed and raped but is saved by that old boyfriend of hers, who apparently changed his mind. So now they are sort of back together. They go back to her place where that new boyfriend of hers is lying in the bed wounded.And right at this moment the old boyfriend teaches Jane how to shoot guns but she can't shoot guns. She drops the guns and picks up a rifle and shoots a rifle right at the target. So now Jane's got a rifle coz she can only shoot rifles. Coz she says it's for the rabbits. To hunt them. That's why she can shoot rifle but not hand guns. Coz hand guns are for killing people right?? LOLSo.. in the end they kill every gang member. The old boyfriend conveniently dies in the process.And check this out..Remember that first daughter of her that was supposedly killed by gang while she was at the whore house??The gang leader says that her daughter is alive and is still working at the whorehouse.So they kill the gang leader and go get her daughter.So in the end Jane's got both of her daughters, old boyfriend, all guns and the bounty for the gang members.I wouldn't be surprised if she planned it this way from the beginning.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>uneven, but better than the disastrous production might have led to you to believe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jane Got a Gun is a good example of what a movie can do for you if you're going in with certain expectations, especially when they're of an exceptional variety. In the case of this, the word 'troubled' is putting it lightly for the production, as numerous stars (Fassbender quit, Jude Law was briefly hired, as was Bradley Cooper, and Edgerton actually had the role of the *villain*, not the sort of co-hero), and the director (Lynn Ramsey) left while in the midst of shooting over problems with the producer and a lack of final cut. It's the kind of production that has 'disaster' as its mark, and that's not a fair way to immediately judge a film, at least not initially. What if this was the next superb western, in a time when there seem to be a good amount considering how few westerns come out nowadays (i.e. The Hateful Eight, Bone Tomahawk, and Slow West all in the past year or so)? So I went into this with an open mind, to see what is in front of me (via Warrior director Gavin O'Connor) and left with the opinion that simply... it's OK. Sometimes a little more than OK, and mostly thanks to a game cast. The premise is somewhat simple initially, that a woman finds that her husband (Natalie Portman and Noah Emmerich respectively) has been shot and though she's tending to her wounds she realizes from him more men are coming after him, so she goes and hires a man (Joel Edgerton) who she used to know... actually in some intimate ways.The movie has a flashback structure that is not really too new. Matter of fact, by 2016 this sort of thing has become kind of tired; of course the drama is meant to be this siege that develops at their home: they can't ride away since Emmerich's Bill Hammond is too injured, so they'll have to set up some things to make sure they aren't caught like fish in a barrel when Ewan McGregor and his men come. But the bigger issue is that the movie has just a lot of peaks and valleys as far as compelling scenes; when people do pull guns on one another and there's set-up with that we see (the plan to fortify the outside of Jane's home with liquid explosives and such is clever), it's exciting.What seemed to not work quite so well are the quieter scenes, where confessions are made and that drama has to be tapped as to who did what to who in relationships and the old wounds being scorched. There is one really tumultuous sequence where Bill discovers Jane inside of what seems to be a brothel (or it just is) and after he kills a bunch of people she starts sobbing. Moments of high drama register but it's the quiet moments that fall a little flat, or they don't register as they should in a movie that depends on their quiet moments for impact. And it's not so much the actors at fault - Portman and Edgerton are formidable, and McGregor makes a fine figure with that mustache (a bit of a chip off the Val Kilmer in Tombstone block), and one of America's underrated character actors, Noah Emmerich, is terrific even as a lot of his performance is post-shooting in a bed - but with the script.Strange since the screenplay was originally on the "Black-List" (best scripts produced that got submitted, across the world basically), and Edgerton actually did work on the script too (whether this was before the production problems or during I'm sure I don't know). It's hard to know if it was due to the producers not allowing final cut - a big reason why Ramsey left, which might have been wise - but as a Weinstein Company release it seems a little fishy, like there may have been better material that got left out or moments put together that don't quite fit.And yet for all these odd feelings watching it, overall I would recommend it to fans of Westerns (believe me, I've seen weaker offerings), and the climax is really solid. James Got a Gun has some original moments, and yet wrestles with becoming generic at the same time: bad-asses pulling guns on one another has been done for so long and in such gritty tones. Maybe it's missing... a tiny bit of humor(?) It's a strange movie to peg what doesn't work about it, but it's not all bad. For all the hard times it took to get to being completed, I'm glad it exists in some form.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jane shud shoot the editor n director for making a mess of what could hav been a memorable western.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story follows Portman (Black swan, No strings attached, V for vendetta), who tried to have a new life with her husband Emmerich (Warriors, Super 8, Windtalkers). Emmerich is shot and injured by a gang led by McGregor (Trainspotting, The Island, The impossible) who is after them. Portman finds her ex lover Edgerton (Warrior, Exodus: Gods n kings, The gift) to seek his help in defending them against a group of bandits. Sounds good but alas it's a slow and boring Western. McGregor's (the villain) character is underdeveloped. If your main villain is rarely seen its hard to hate him. It has the worst showdown in the history of western films. The final gun battle when the McGregor's gang comes upon the ranch shooting everything in sight, these scenes were in the dark so much we couldn't see what's happening n who's shooting who. Worst editing. The flashbacks from the past to the present felt inconstant and distracting more than helpful. Jane Got a Gun is a mediocre western that wasted a talented cast. Boyd Holbrook (Run all nite, A walk among the tombstones) n Rodrigo Santoro (300 n Rise of an empire, The last stand, Focus) were totally wasted.Natalie Portman was good in the lead role but that is not sufficient to save a disaster like this. Director Gavin O'Connor (Miracle, Pride n glory, Warrior) did a terrible job of what could hav been a good memorable western.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perhaps the name of the local town here Lullaby could be a signpost for viewers, because the glacial pacing of the movie might very well put you to sleep. It has a top-notch cast which includes Natalie Portman, Joel Edgerton, Noah Emmerich, and an unrecognizable Ewan McGregor. It certainly isn't the worst Western I've ever seen, but I felt it was hampered by its pacing as well as shop worn and hackneyed plot elements. The film does have its moments, the best of which I thought come as Jane's (Portman) tragic story slowly unfolds, offering chances for forgiveness and hopes for a better future.All in all, this Western is directed by the talented Gavin O'Connor, who has brought to the screen the terrific film "Miracle" and the underrated "Warrior". However, I can only give this one a fair rating for the above reasons.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had high hopes for this film because the lead is a woman. But I was so very disappointed. This western story has been done to death and putting a woman as the hero did not help. I saw nothing that I have not seen before. I was not impressed by Portman, with her oh so fake and over done southern accent. The first two flash backs were well placed, but the rest were not needed. The chemistry between the two was a flop.I now understand why I did not see much about this film before I watched it. For this lover of westerns it was a big let down. This film added nothing to the western genre. The 'big names' associated with this film did not help, they are better actors than this. Don't pay to see it wait until you can watch it for free.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A dull and unimaginative western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 2011 director Gavin O'Connor delivered a very special film in the form of the on face value generic sporting themed family drama Warrior, a film that despite low end box office takings has since gone onto become a well-liked and respected tale featuring memorable turns by its three leads Nick Nolte, Tom Hardy and Joel Edgerton.Warrior was a film with heart, relatable characters and a cinematic energy that burst out from the screen, it is in many ways then a completely opposite film to O'Connor's troubled remake Jane Got a Gun, a film completed in 2013 but only emerging this year to little to no fanfare.Taking over the reins at quite literally the last minute from the film's original director Lynne Ramsey (who perhaps realised there was no saving this sinking ship), O'Connor's take on the classic tale of farm girl Jane taking it to the gang out to kill her husband and ruin her life is so devoid of purpose and life that its mightily hard to even envisage what this film was aiming for and from the lacklustre start through to its long gestating yet disappointing fire fight finale, Jane Got a Gun struggles to make any form of impact on the viewer and bares all the hallmarks of a film that's behind the scenes actions impacted badly on its final product.O'Conner has for some time now with films like the aforementioned Warrior and others like Miracle and Pride and Glory has shown himself to be a fine director of both action and actors but Jane Got a Gun fails in both these elements. O'Connor try's hard to liven the film up with sporadic yet bloodthirsty violence but it's all played out in such a generic nature that it matters little while the films competent cast all fail to make a dent with Natalie Portman and Joel Edgerton delivering some downright average performances as Jane and Dan respectively while the seemingly fake tanned Ewan McGregor stumbles his way along as the films big bad John Bishop.Devoid of any spirit, Jane Got a Gun is tiresome and impact free remake. It's hard to know who exactly is to blame for the end result here but all involved should've known better and have all done much better in the past and its likely all who were apart of this box office misfire (the film didn't even appear at Australian cinemas) are likely to erase this from their memories quicker than a you could draw a pistol.1 hot air balloon out of 5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Even The Action Scenes Were Boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is truly an astoundingly bad movie and another example where an enormous amount of talent was wasted due to a poor script and even worse direction.The first maybe 70% of the movie was slower moving than molasses at the South Pole on 21 Jun. There are extended periods of pointless silence and even the dialog and little bit of movement makes no sense because we lack the backstory. Eventually, through a series of disjointed flashbacks, we do get the backstory which is a tale built on one stupidity after another. For example, a man leaves to fight in the War Between The States failing to write to his fiancée even once over three years. This leads to a misunderstanding which is the basis of the film. The stupidity of the players persists. A bad guy captures Portman threatening to rape her and kill her husband. Good guy comes on the scene and instead of simply croaking the bad guy, does the 'brandish and cock weapons' routine which, of course, leads to a standoff for a bit. Later on, our good guys are staked out at a ranch waiting for a small army of bad guys to attack. They sit on the porch, back lit at night aimlessly chatting instead of doing a blackout or, gosh, being on the lookout for the army to arrive. And yeah, of course this leads to a bad result. Later on bad guys get on the roof where the good guy sound shoots them with extreme accuracy but do they leave the roof? No, instead they remain clumping along up there while the good guy picks them off.I can go on and have not even hit on some major idiocies present here. To sum it up, at the penultimate showdown between chief baddie and chief goody, I turned it off in disgust. So I got over an hour maybe an hour and a half of boredom topped with so much disgust at the dimwitted players at the very end that I gave it up when it should have been most engaging.</fullReview>

But let's go to the actual review this film is boring and it's amazing that Natalie Portman actually produced it and the final battle if someone could call it that it's so dark that you can't see who shoots who and it's annoying like i said the 3 leads are trying to do their best but the poorly screenplay and direction drives the movie down and when Jane Portman's character started screaming and crying it came out so laughable and annoying rather than actually feel sad for her. Jane got a Gun is a film that anyone could see if they are bored or drunk i give it a 6 out of 10 for the 3 leads and some good scenes that's it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, so the flash-backs finally bring us up to speed on what's happened to Jane, Bill, Dan, and the evil John Bishop over the previous 7 years and we're geared up for the show-down.Dan's clever pyrotechnics kill off an untold number of baddies, and most of the rest get it through the roof or walls, except of course for John Bishop. To keep it 'plausible', Jane and Dan receive wounds of varying severity, and Bill finally and conveniently succumbs to his multiple gunshot wounds.Once Bishop has been dispatched, Jane and Dan ride into town to rescue Mary from the scut work she's doing at the bordello, only at this juncture there is no evidence of their wounds, either when they ride in to town or when they embrace Mary. Odd, that.Next we find Jane driving in to town in a buckboard with Bishop in back, and a white horse tied to the tailgate. Jane apparently claims the rewards on all the gang members she and Dan have killed, even though rewards are only paid upon delivery of identifiable bodies. All she had was Bishop.In an inexplicably inane romantic notion, Jane refuses to claim the bounty on Bill Hammond, despite the massive (for the period) $2000 amount, and the fact that Hammond would probably have preferred that money go to his and Jane's daughter.Once Jane has all the reward money (despite a dearth of bodies) she mounts her brown horse (no longer white) and she returns to her family. Dan now has a sling for the wound that hadn't bothered him when they rescued Mary, and the brown and white horses, Jane's and Dan's, are tied to the back of the wagon.How can someone work (or be forced to work) in a bordello and not be aware there's a toddler of their daughter's age in the house? Who pays rewards when the bodies are not present? Who leaves $2000 (1871 dollars) in reward money on the table? How do you change a white horse into a brown horse? To me the choppy back and forth editing was confusing, and the lack of coherence at the end was distracting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A 1871 Western, better than I thought it would be.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We watched this at home on DVD from our public library. The DVD is a rental version with no extras at all, just the movie.I was curious about it for the actors, especially Portman. When she was a young girl she was Marty in "Beautiful Girls", Emmerich was a married man in that movie, cautioning his friend Willie about not trying to romance Marty. Here he plays her husband. My what a few years can do!It was 1871 in New Mexico, no radio or TV, not even electricity, so they had to entertain themselves at nightfall. The movie opens with Jane Hammond (Portman) telling a story to her young daughter about the upside down tree, where bad people could go in and become good people. The next day she is baking bread when her husband Bill (Emmerich) rides up and falls off his horse. She manages to get him inside and attends to his several wounds, pulling bullets and cauterizing with gun powder when she could reach them. Bill is in bad shape.The story is not revealed in a smooth narrative style, instead you have to pay attention and clues are revealed very gradually, some in the several flashbacks. Bill is considered an outlaw for having killed 4 men in a gang, but we eventually find out he did so in rescuing Jane from a forced life in prostitution. But now the gang leader John Bishop (McGregor) and his men are out to track down and kill Bill.Bill and Jane live on a remote plot of land with only one entrance/exit and are sure Bishop will hunt them down. Bishop is the more notorious outlaw, he has a $5000 bounty on his head, dead or alive. With Bill unable to be moved Jane seeks out the help of an old friend, father of her daughter, once thought to be dead, Dan Frost (Edgerton). She pays him, he is still hurt from what he thought was her abandonment of him, but sets out to do what he can to fight off the Bishop gang.There really isn't anything in particular new here that hasn't been in the Western movies over the years. Edgerton was one of the writers, Portman one of the producers, it is a movie they wanted to make and overall it is an interesting 90 minutes. With his prosthetic dentures, dark wavy hair, and mustache, McGregor is all but unrecognizable. His character reminds me of a young Tom Selleck.SPOILERS: There's actually a lot going on for a 90-minute movie. The daughter we see at the beginning is Jane's second daughter, with Bill. She thinks her first daughter by Dan was killed by one of Bishop's men. During the big fight at night Dan and Jane, helped by explosives he rigged, managed to kill off all Bishop's men, and when Bishop himself comes in the house he is held at gunpoint until he told that her first daughter, now maybe 12 or 13, is alive at at the brothel. Jane shoots him multiple times, they gather all the bodies, bring them to town to collect the thousands in rewards. She is reunited with her daughter, working as a washerwoman at the brothel. Bill dies so Jane, Dan, and the two girls head west in their covered wagon to begin a new life, headed for the Pacific Ocean shores.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Jane Got a Gun" is not a bomb but it's not the western I was hoping to see. The draw of seeing a woman in the lead role in this type of film isn't enough to overcome a somewhat weak storyline. There are also some annoying, needless lines in the movie. Take for instance when Jane Hammond (Natalie Portman) and her hired gun Dan Frost (Joel Edgerton) take her outlaw husband Bill "Ham" Hammond (Noah Emmerich) down into the cellar when John Bishop's (Ewan McGregor) gang show up hell bent on killing the three of them. Dan puts a gun in Ham's hand and says, "Anybody ain't us opens that door, you gotta start shooting." This happens literally sixty seconds after Ham has already killed one of John Bishop's men while bedridden.Still "Jane Got a Gun" is worth seeing for the scenery. The story takes place in New Mexico and the movie is loaded with impressive views of mountainous terrain, buttes, billowy clouds and awe inspiring sunsets. There is a scene that occurs just after the title card of the film is displayed which pays homage to the last shot of "The Searchers," and it really is a nice touch. Portman is most convincing in the visceral scene when she learns the fate of her daughter Mary, and is pretty kick ass with her Walker firearm.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a bit muddled, cold violence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's the New Mexico Territory in 1871. Jane (Natalie Portman) is hounded by the Bishop boys after her husband Bill "Ham" Hammond (Noah Emmerich) got severely injured by them. She gets help from her former love Dan Frost (Joel Edgerton). She thought that he was killed during the civil war and she married Ham afterwards where they got entangled with the Bishop boys. It's a tale of lost, tragedy, and revenge.The first half is a muddle of unexplained situations, and confused flashbacks. The story finally gets some exposition in the second half. There is a compelling tragedy but it needs to be told better and earlier. The final act has good cold violence although it sometimes isn't as cold as it needs to be. There is definitely a good potential of a dark, stark western but it's too fuzzy.First, this may have started with the wrong character. It should follow Dan Frost as he searches for his love Jane. The audience can learn about the situation along with Dan. Also the ending is too happy for the tone of the movie. This is a dark revenge story and I would probably kill off Dan midway through. That way would allow Jane to get her killing on for the last act.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Loved this film! Portman's best, IMHO.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film evokes some of the most western images I can remember experiencing. I do remember very long ago reading western novels that were in this vein and enjoying it very much, but they weren't that easily obtained, and so it was only a phase by necessity.Natalie Portman who is the Jane of the title and one of the producers must have loved these stories too. She lovingly handles the lead role and thereby oddly enough does more for gender equality than a dozen firebrands like Jessica Valenti. The Jane in this story is emotionally real in a way I haven't seen many actresses pull off before. This is no Sharon Stone in The Quick and the Dead. It's done for art not commerce.But it's not a great film either. It goes for easy, somewhat modern solutions to its basic problem, how can Jane do battle with a gang when her only help is her wounded husband and her former lover. I've read critics attack this film for its final chapter but I don't see it as destructive to the film's basic accomplishments as others. I enjoyed all the leads especially Joel Edgerton, Ewan McGregor, and Noah Emmerich and some of the minor characters which are handled beautifully and memorably.All in all I've new respect for Natalie Portman and am sorry I didn't see this film much earlier.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every couple hundred movie reviews or so, I wind up catching a film that compels me to rant a bit about the hypocrisy involved in making them. With Hollywood generally lined up with the media and academia on the liberal side of the spectrum, any pretense of 'common sense gun control' goes right out the window with a treatment like this. You can't argue against violence in movies and then have Natalie Portman shoot a guy in the head or pump a fifth bullet into a thug to finish him off after the first four pretty much crippled him for life.Well now that I've got that out of my system I can continue. As a Western fan, I didn't find this to be too bad of a flick. It takes the revenge theme and applies the gunslinger role to a female protagonist, an idea that isn't too common for the genre. The flashback technique utilized a couple of times was effective for establishing Jane Hammond's (Portman) back story, and how she wound up in the position of asking her former fiancé to involve himself in a rescue effort.I'll say one thing about Dan Frost's (Joel Edgarton) survival instinct, he sure did get creative with the kerosene filled Mason jars sporting those nails and shards of glass. When that thing blew, Wow!, it nicely illustrated Frost's go-to-war premise - "Only point of a battle Jane, is to end it in your favor".I don't know that I find it credible that everything tied out satisfactorily for Jane when all was said and done, except for husband Bill (Noah Emmerich) buying the farm of course. I had my fingers crossed for daughter Kate when Jane found out she was still alive back at the brothel. That scrubbing laundry wound up her fate was a whole lot better than fending off scumbags like Fitchum.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A not very good, not very western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This feature is watchable, it is timed nicely at just over 90 minutes, the plot will hold your attention for exactly that long, but... The background story is fine, and the love triangle drama is OK, which indeed is the main idea behind this movie ... But the final shootout?! I mean, it surely is the main point of every western, right? It is unbelievable how poorly this scene was executed. The preparations are naive, the attack itself comes waaay later than a viewer might expect, and the "good guys" are still somehow surprised. The way they get shot, and the way they kill their adversaries is just not worthy of a western, and the amount of talk at gunpoint surpasses even the ridiculous villain explanations in James Bond movies. Unfortunately, the main protagonist - Natalie Portman, just didn't cut it for me, I think she is the biggest miss of this cast. Poor timeline, uninspired Natalie Portman and underwhelming action would leave it at 3 - 4 stars if it weren't for the psychological aspect of the complicated love triangle, and the overall flow of the story which is not that bad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The plot and story-line are listed everywhere so no need to repeat. I will add that, it is painfully slow, no character building, and way too many flashbacks, so many that it is close to making it difficult to follow along.The thing is about these period pieces is those making them, or whoever they use as consultants have no idea about the way things really were.As someone that has spent years researching ancestry, which means pouring over not only photos, but land descriptions, newspapers, correspondence and so on. You would think with the money spent on these films, they would hire someone to give it true authenticity. I am always disappointed when I see a film showing beautiful, clean women and healthy chubby cheeked children, with clean homes, lots of natural lighting, glass windows and unstained, wrinkle free clothing, or starched high collars on men's shirts. Or even the towns that have clean plowed dirt streets, even without trash or waste anywhere.The reality is the men and women were strong people, but living in extremely remote areas such as this setting they would be very thin and not what most in this day and age would call beautiful. They didn't have flawless skin, shaped brows and contouring make-up in the attempt to make it look like no make-up. The children were always dirty and the clothes worn and stained (unless they were a very wealthy family).I gave it three starts simply for the work of the cinematography. Good angles, nice lenses/filters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jane Got a Gun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this century, there have been various westerns I liked very much, either because they added a fascinating philosophical subtext (The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford), big doses of personality (Django Unchained, The Hateful Eight) or a surprising fusion of genres (Bone Tomahawk, Dead Birds, The Burrowers). In summary: they didn't limit to copy the cowboy tales which were popular in mid-20th century, but they took them as a starting point to explore ideas and themes which are more suitable with contemporary sensibility. That's why Jane Got a Gun didn't leave me completely satisfied, despite offering various pros. Among them: Natalie Portman and Joel Edgerton, two excellent actors who seem ideal for a western. Edgerton makes a perfect work as the "sensitive tough guy", while Portman displays the exact combination of demure femininity and internal strength one imagines in the heroines of the old west. The screenplay is simple, but it offers a good balance of drama and violence; I particularly liked the flashbacks which gradually reveal the cause of the enmity between Edgerton's character and Bill, Jane's husband, solidly played by Noah Emmerich. With such many pros, why didn't Jane Got a Gun leave me completely satisfied? I think Jane Got a Gun is a competent and entertaining western; but in such a fertile genre, I expected something more memorable... or at least, more ambitious. In other words, Jane Got a Gun deserves a recommendation; but not a recommendation as enthusiastic as various of its individual elements might suggest. In conclusion, Jane Got a Gun is a decent film, but I was left wanting more. Nevertheless, I like to keep seeing the western genre in force; John Wayne would have been proud (he would have played the sensitive tough guy, of course).</fullReview>

While many have seen or rather predicted the death of the Western "genre" (some might argue it's not a genre itself, just putting this out there), it's still alive and kicking and this movie is testament to that fact.Natalie Portman is a great actress and she saw something in the character here, that made her want to play the role. It had to do with both the toughness and the vulnerability of her. The script may be predictable (the flashbacks give out bits and peaces, but you can put it together far ahead of the time, so I don't think there are too many surprises, except maybe for the ending), but you can't fault the setups and everything the film does to portray what is going on. Some might feel it's too long and there is definitely not enough action for others, but those who stick with it get a nice story</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Are Westerns Making A Comeback?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The official trailer for THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN has been released. Last year saw THE HATEFUL EIGHT nominated for several awards. THE REVENANT won for best picture at the Academy Awards. Are we seeing a resurgence in the classic genre known as westerns? Perhaps we are. And this week another released this year makes its way to DVD, JANE GOT A GUN.Said to be loosely inspired by the 1971 film HANNIE CAULDER (and if it is trust me lose is the main term to consider here) the movie tells the story of Jane Hammond, a woman on the old frontier whose husband Bill (Noah Emmerich) returns home wounded and in need of help, letting her know that John Bishop (Ewan McGregor) and his gang are on their way. Unable to so much as stand to help or to leave, Jane takes their daughter to a nearby friend and seeks out assistance from Dan Frost (Joel Edgerton).As the movie unfolds we learn the past history of these main characters. Jane was engaged to Dan before he left to join the Civil War. When he never returned she headed west. Bill came to her rescue there and in the process garnered the ire of Bishop. The eventual confrontation between all parties involved is inevitable and makes for the majority of the last third of the movie. And before anyone accuses me of revealing too much let me say that all of this comes out in the trailer.Like most great westerns the plot here is pretty matter of fact and doesn't contain a lot of ins and outs like most movies being made. It's a simple story with facets weaved into it that fill out the 98 minutes seen on screen. For me that's not a negative aspect but a plus. Far too often movies these days seem determined to fill a full 2 hours with unnecessary items that muddle the plot or add nothing to the story but fulfill the director's need to make as long a movie as possible. The end result is almost always a long movie that drags often. By using a tired and true formula for a western the film makers here have made something both interesting and entertaining.One thing to note is that the movie seems like it's offering a strong female lead in the title role. The trailer for the movie even makes it seem that way. In fact rather than that we're presented with co-leads in our story, Jane and Dan. Some will take issue with that. Their problem will come from a 21st century perspective. Women have more rights today than in the past and that's rightfully so. But back in the old west that wasn't the case. And while Jane presents a strong female lead that she would be able to accomplish what happens in this film on her own wouldn't have been possible.Not only that, the love triangle presented between the characters of Jane, Dan and Bill that is touched on at first and then slowly revealed via flashbacks makes for an interesting story. It adds the depth needed to flesh out an entire film while still never overplaying that and making the movie far too long. It also makes you care more deeply for each person involved in the story and hate the character of Bishop more than you did at the beginning of the film. This format causes the movie to move along at a slower pace than expected in a western but I never felt it hindered anything.The movie didn't do that well at the box office and was plagued by difficulties getting made. The original male leads intended for the movie backed out and were replaced. The same held true for the original director. Ratings have been unkind to the movie as well. Not knowing that going in and looking into it as I began to write this I reflected back on the movie itself.It's good. It's not good as in being as memorable as say STAGECOACH good but it is a good movie. The story holds your interest from start to finish. The black hats and white hats are pretty much easy to determine which is refreshing in a world where good guys are often as terrible as those they pursue these days. The acting by all involved is completely believable and that says something. For me a strong performance is one where I lose sight of the fact I'm watching someone acting and see just the character instead. That's in abundance here. And knowing now that director Gavin O'Connor was brought in after the project began shows he deserves a tip of the hat.Fans of the western genre will be happy to see it making a comeback. I for one have wondered why it hasn't happened already. Maybe audiences are too jaded and too invested in superhero films these days (which I love as well). There should always be room for different genres. Here's hoping movies like this continue to be made. For an entertaining evening this is one western worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jane Got Gun...Jane Use Gun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The poor grammar apparent in the title of the this film is only the tip of the iceberg with the problems of the script, the directing, cinematography, and the acting.Set in the burgeoning New Mexico Territory in 1871, the film focuses on travails of Jane Ballard, a decent and hard-working sodbuster, who comes into conflict with the outlaw John Bishop (Ewan McGregor) and his boys. There are two romantic strands to the film, including Jane's relationships with her current husband, Tom Hammand, and her former fiancé, who was separated from Jane due to his fighting on the side of the Union in the Civil War and his subsequent incarceration by the Rebels.This basic narrative should not be a difficult one to spin in the film tradition of Westerns. But the clumsy use of unnecessary flashbacks and the incompetent transitions into and out of the flashbacks make the film a labored and indeed confusing experience for the viewer.Portman is earnest in her portrayal of Jane. But the male roles tended to blend together, and the actors were not assisted from the lighting and costume departments. Often, the faces of the characters were difficult to discern. Incredibly, the obligatory shoot-out sequence took place in the dead of night! Perhaps the most serious criticism of the film was its unpleasantness, that included suggestions of kidnapping, rape, forced prostitution, and even infanticide. While some of these horrid experiences may have a basis in fact in the development of the West, the film genre of Westerns typically have sympathetic characters and more uplifting values than those of this disappointing and troubling film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jane Got A Gun.......that fires blanks.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jane Hammond has built a new life with her husband Bill, after being tormented by the Bishop Boys gang of outlaws. She finds herself in the gang's cross-hairs once again when Bill stumbles home riddled with bullets after duelling with the Boys leader, Colin. With the vengeful crew on Bills trail, Jane has nowhere to turn but to her former fiancé Dan Frost for help in defending her family against certain death. Haunted by old memories, Jane's past meets the present in a battle for survival........It seems while watching this film that there is a longer, better, more coherent version begging to be saved from the cutting room floor, because you wonder after watching this poor effort, what motivated fine actors such as Macgregor and Portman to sign on for such an incoherent mess?It all starts all well and good, the imagery of Bill returning home wounded, features some wonderful cinematography, and sets up what could have been a potentially thrilling classic Western.And then the film gets lost in the relationship that Jane and Frost had in the past. So just as we are getting involved with a potentially intriguing set piece, we are treated to a flashback of the two of them running through a field in slow motion, looking very happy, and them a story about him having to go away.And this happens time and time again. Their relationship is never truly elaborated on, neither is how Bill and Jane met, it's just cutting back to Jane, back to Bill in bed, and then cutting to the Bishop Boys and their evil leader, played with as much conviction as a mottled banana skin, by usually wonderful Macgregor.He must have watched endless episodes of Stop the Pigeon and Wacky Races, because he's channelling Dick Dastardly within an inch of his life. It wouldn't have surprised that there wasn't a snickering dog by his side.And his appearance is obviously trying to channel Fonda in Once Upon A Time In The West. But his fake tan makes him look more like Kirk Douglas in The Villain/Cactus Jack.It's a shame, because there must be another cut of this film somewhere, the Weinsteins are notoriously famous for shredding films, and this looks like their latest casualty.So it's beautiful to look at, the sets and the locations are impeccable, but one cannot help but feel sorry for Edgerton, The Gift was an original, if underwhelming piece of work.This feels like its a by the numbers vengeance Western, which I'm sure it wasn't intended to be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Chilled by his directing debut The Gift,and very impressed with the story he came up for the post-apocalypse film The Rover,I decided to look at co-writer/(along with Brian Duffield &amp; Anthony Tambakis) lead actor Joel Edgerton IMDb credits,where I found out he had recently made a Western with Natalie Portman,which led to me getting ready to see Jane get her gun.The plot:Seeing her husband Bill Hammond return home filled with bullets from the Bishop Boys gang, Jane Hammond realises that they have tracked her down.Putting her child into hiding,Hammond decides to put an end to the gang.As Hammond places the fact that she will have to get her revenge on the Bishop Gang on her own,Jane's "long lost" fiancé Dan Frost rides into town.View on the film:Backed by a thumping score from Marcello De Francisci and Lisa Gerrard,director Gavin O'Connor (who replaced original director Lynne Ramsay,after Ramsay got sacked over not showing up,whilst cinematographer Darius Khondji and stars Michael Fassbender,Jude Law and Bradley Cooper all quit the film!) and cinematographer Mandy Walker grill a choice cut of Western pulp.Entering the salon 3 years after filming,O'Connor and Walker fans the flames of Jane's fight with the Bishop Boys gang by soaking the film in blazing yellow which locks a brittle atmosphere over the film.Despite having to re-write the movie during production,the screenplay by Duffield/Tambakis &amp; Edgerton does very well at setting up an uneasy alliance between Hammond and Frost,as flowing flashbacks reveal Frost's wild west adventures and the horrors that Hammond faces.Hanging in the background,the writers gradually bring the Brishop Boys to the front of the shooting range,as Jane gets her gun.Joined by a grisly cameo from his brother Nash, Joel Edgerton gives a terrific performance as Frost,thanks to Edgerton softening Frost's husky image,as Frost and Hammond draw guns.Looking ultra-stylish in a long leather coat, Natalie Portman gives a great performance as Hammond,thanks to Portman peeling the gravitas of the horrors inflicted upon Hammond across the screen,which is wonderfully crossed with a bad ass grin,as Jane loads up her gun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What's the point?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Jane Got a Gun" has no apparent or cohesive theme, but attempts to compensate with rousing orchestral music which seems intended to convey to the audience how they ought to feel at this point in the movie if the plot and dialogue were up to the task of engendering such emotional responses. The acting is actually good, although the dialogue is a bit hackneyed and saturated with exposition. The cinematography would be pretty good if they had spent a small portion of their $25MM budget on some form of rigid support system (like a tripod). The jiggly-cam shots are not the worst by a long shot, but are distracting. The pyrotechnics in one scene are very well done. Lighting and mise en sc?ne are good. Makeup effects are good. Some elements don't make much sense. At one point they need jars and empty out a dozen Mason jars of green beans and such. The film takes place in 1871. People didn't discard their Mason jars. They cleaned and sterilized them and reused them. There should have been a lot of empty jars around waiting to be filled with whatever crop would be harvested. A building is shot up to the extent the walls resemble a colander, but there aren't splinters all over the floor and nothing much inside seems to have been hit. Wanted criminals with hefty rewards on their heads live openly and run businesses. But the big problem is in the lack of a theme or moral. Ordinarily, one might expect an ordinary person to be confronted with an ordeal that tests their mettle and forces them to grow somehow in order to overcome otherwise insurmountable obstacles. Here, the characters don't grow or acquire new skills. They endure hardships that tear their world apart, but survive. Consequently, everything falls into place and they have a much brighter future because they survived, not because they prevailed by becoming stronger. The good guys confront insurmountable odds, but through a clever device manage to even the odds early on. Rather than confronting escalating challenges, they confront diminishing challenges. Jane prevails by becoming as brutal as her adversary, but immediately returns to her peaceful existence as if she had never sunk to such depths.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A decent little Western. Portman and Edgerton, in any case, make it worthwhile.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A nice, solid, little Western starring Natalie Portman and Joel Edgerton. The two were engaged before Edgerton had to go off to war, but she took off west after not having heard from him in three years. She ended up in New Mexico married to a former outlaw (Noah Emmerich) who saved her from a white slaver (Ewan McGregor? That doesn't seem right; I definitely didn't recognize him if he was the villain, and the character name on IMDb seems wrong, too). Most of that history is told in flashbacks throughout the picture. The main bulk of the story has Emmerich wounded by McGregor and his men. Portman has to defend him, and she rounds up Edgerton, who settled in the area after he found out what happened to his former fiancée, to help her protect them. The story's simple, but Portman and Edgerton carry the film nicely. They have a believable sense of history between them. It's not an action-packed film, but it delivers well when it gets to the climax. There are some weaknesses in the details of the film, especially in the flashbacks, which often seem skeletal in their scripting (Joel Edgerton co-wrote the screenplay with two others). Not great, but good.</fullReview>

I thought it would be an imposition of modern prejudices projected back to 1871, but it was quite a traditional tale, although told in a non-linear way through flashbacks. The flashbacks were done extremely well, giving the movie much of its value; if it had been told straight-forwardly I don't think it would have had nearly as much impact.While I have never really liked Natalie Portman very much, she does a fantastic job in this movie, even her slight southern/western accent is very well-done. Rather than a feminist version of a gun-slinger, as the title implies, her Jane seems to be quite a normal woman of her times, competent yet still feminine (she wears period dresses). Joel Edgerton is good, as is Noah Emmerich, but the most amazing actor has to be Ewan McGreggor. I did not know he was in this movie until I saw the credits, although I knew there was something very familiar about him. Wow what a great actor!All in all one of the best westerns made in the last ten years at least.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's two songs that sprung to mind when hearing about this film. The first one being the obvious Aerosmith's "Janie's Got A Gun" which made me think of what Bon Jovi did for Blaze of Glory. The other song, the lesser known seventies hit "Torn Between Two Lovers" by Mary McGregor. It's an interesting premise and I did originally think this was director's Gavin O'Connor's idea, appearing to enjoy making films involving difficult if not awkward family disputes like his previous masterpiece Warrior. But no, it was in fact Warrior star Joel Edgerton who co-wrote the tangled love triangle and wasn't actually set to star himself. O'Connor only came on board after real life drama on the set resulting in people, including previous directors to blow out the movie. Let's not get dismounted. She loved him, him went to war never to return, she got rescued by another him ensuring a bounty on his head. The first him DOES eventually return only to discover the unintentional betrayal. Now the second him runs into some bad luck and her only hope is him, the first him. You keeping up cowboy? Resulting in an awkward, moral questioning situation. It really isn't that confusing and the story unravels quite well with the help of flashbacks. But the trailer and poster really gives off the wrong impression; it's not the action-packed westerner you might expect, nor is Co-Producer Natalie Portman's character 'Jane' the heroine the trailer, poster and title might suggest. Instead what you get is a drama that includes the occasional gun going off. Though it does turn out to be a good drama at that. It's got a good story and when the blanks are filled you can't help but appreciate it. I think it was trying for a similar impact 3:10 to Yuma (2007) had, though it just falls a little flat emotionally and you start to care a little less like how the Wild West was. There's a strong cast with both Portman and Edgerton having verbal gun fights. Steely eyed Ewan McGregor does an awesome gangboss that feels influenced by Leo's Calvin Candie from Django. His look reminded me of Lee Van Cleef from The Good, The Bad and the ugly. 300's Xerxes and Focus' Rodrigo Santoro does little, Run All Night nasty, bad Boyd Holbrook does nasty so well again and Noah Emmerich does little else by lay in bed bleeding.I have to mention the opening credits as I don't remember ever seeing that many company logos fade in and out on the screen before. And what happened to Lisa Gerrard? Such an amazing vocal musician and I can't remember anything of the score. Normally her voice presence takes over everything. For what it actually is, it's good. It got a good story behind it and it's very well shot; however it should have been titled 'The Ex' we all know one who was on the verge of being dangerous. (Polite word for psycho, yes.)

		<fullReview>"Life stopped being something you live after that day. It's Just something you endure." Jane Hammond (Portman) has been taking care of the homestead and her daughter while her husband is away. When he returns, injured with bad news Jane must find a way to save everyone. Her only chance is to ask her ex-lover Dan Frost (Edgerton) for help. This is a decent movie but a little slow in some parts. The movie really felt like it wanted to do more but was held back somehow. It is still better than many westerns recently, but had the possibility of being better. Portman is a good choice and the idea is interesting but there was just something missing to make this as good as it wanted to be. Some of the scenes were a little long and repetitive and really hurt the pace of the movie. On the other hand though I did like it OK but my mind started to wander in a few places. Overall, one of the better recent westerns, but was missing something to make it special. I give this a B-.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>the whole plot is absolutely terrible. based in a day and age where hardship was so natural and common and dangers are ever prevalent Jane, the main character the movie is based around, decided that instead of waiting for the father of her only child and fiancée to come back from a damn war she would join some random group of travelers, in order to chase a ferry tell town in the then territory of new Mexico. Then the group murders her 5 year old daughter by drowning her and turns Jane into a whore by forcibly raping her. She then decided that it would be a good idea to shack up with one of the bandits that just so happen to disagree with rape and child murder and marries AND has another child with him. She then proceeds to spend the rest of the film guilt-tripping her veteran and original lover and basically stating that all that happened is his fault because he went to war. All in all if i was the ex i would have shot her the moment i found out she got my child killed and i would have shot the new husband just for being apart of it. really who the HELL writes this crap.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This complicated the story of a woman who has to seek help from her ex fiancé, when her husband is shot by a violent local gang. Her complicated events and interpersonal relationships over the past seven years is slowly revealed.Maybe I'm not a fan of Westerns. Even though "Jane Got A Gun" sounds interesting, I find it very boring. Even the first fifteen minutes of it seem like an eternity, and unfortunately the film does not get any better. The story is slow, and it's not helped by the characters are always talking in accents that is hard to understand. Even though the lighting is really well done, I cannot get into the film at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pleasant surprise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into this movie with no expectations, and was pleasantly surprised. It's being called "slow," which I suppose it is, by Thor and Iron Man standards, but not in a way that bothered me - I wasn't expecting an action-packed story, because, well, I don't mind if a movie has dialog. I thought the pacing was great, and I loved the way the audience slowly finds out what happened, through flashbacks from several different points of view. I didn't mind that Jane wasn't a super hero, just a determined woman, who was strong because life demanded it of her. It felt very realistic. It's not a perfect movie, but it's worth seeing for great performances and gorgeous scenery (filmed on location in New Mexico). I think this movie will do well on video or streaming, if it finds the right audience (that is, people like me) - I'm certainly telling my friends about it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An awful Western Natalie Portman Vanity Piece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is awful, boring, and emotionless with no redeeming qualities. Natalie Portman's vanity project that she produced turns into a slow, grueling Western that took an effort to sit through. I was surprised that this movie turned out so terrible because it has all the makings of what could be an award-winning movie, great actors, a story with potential, and a solid genre.The worst part was the waste of the solid actors like Joel Edgerton who tries to make the best of a bad situation. Usually Edgerton will steal the show like he did in Black Mass and his directorial debut. The worst part is that the feminist aspect of this film is completely lost because the lovelorn Dan Frost takes over for the titular Jane with most of the shooting, which isn't much.Ewan Gregor plays John Bishop but for some reason IMDb got that wrong as if they didn't have enough time to pay attention to this sickeningly dull film to get it right. The villain was interesting but there is absolutely no payoff. Even the vicious Vic played by Narcos star Boyd Holbrook doesn't have a cool bad guy death. Noah Emmerich also has a small part. He hasn't been able to cross over from television to movies very well.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful but slow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Jane's husband comes home riddled with bullets by the gang from whom they have been hiding, she calls on Dan for support. Only thing is that Dan is bitter at Jane for abandoning him years earlier.This western is beautifully filmed, well acted, nicely plotted, and has an excellent sense of time and place, with the action well handled. Unfortunately, it has bad flashback management (you're not always sure whether you're in a flashback or not), it thinks it is rather more important than it is and, because of that, it lingers on things when it really ought to deal with them with a bit more urgency ? it is a good 15 minutes or more too long. The story of how it got to be made at all is an interesting one, and possibly more interesting than the fairly straightforward story it tells too languidly.Oh, and the title is horrible.Trimmed of its self-importance (and quarter of an hour of running time) this would have been a worthwhile addition to the list of recent westerns.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jane Got a GunNo one has a problem with women owning guns as long as they're disarmed before that time of the month.Mind you, some premenstrual rage might benefit the homesteader in this Western.Frontierswoman Jane Hammond (Natalie Portman) is forced to defend her family farm from outlaws when her bandit husband (Noah Emmerich) riles up the Bishop Boys and their devious leader (Ewan McGregor).But to have a fighting chance against the posse, Jane must enlist her ex-fiancé (Joel Edgerton). Their reunion, however, stirs up ghosts that effect their partnership, and the bloody standoff that's about to ensue.An overall intriguing oater that unfolds in a fashion unfamiliar to the genre, Jane does deliver a fresh take on stock western archetypes, themes and backdrops; however, the same cannot be said of the film's gunfights or uninspired casting.Furthermore, fighting alongside females' guarantees plenty of tampons on hand to plug-up the injured.

		<shortDescription>Please no more "Got a gun but can't shoot" titles!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Because Blockbuster video had a section titled "Westerns" people seem to have come to the expectation that anything taking place during the 1800's has to follow a certain formula, centering around gunfights. But really, "Western" is more a category for it's time placement, which can fall into different genres. Jane Got A Gun is first and foremost a Drama-Suspense-quasi-romance; it's a story that could be told, in the large view, anywhere or anytime. But then there are the particular details of this story that make it unique to the west and help to dictate the decisions that have brought the characters to where they are in life.The good-guy vs bad-guy line of this movie is somewhat standard, but the characters who are caught up in it have a uniqueness to them that makes the story worth seeing. Of course, with sub-par acting it would not be so easy to take, but each of the main characters plays their roles very effectively; especially Natalie Portman and Joel Edgerton.Some have complained that the movie is not feminist enough, but you can't end the movie with Portman being elected the first female president in 1880. No matter how cool that might seem for some, it would take the movie from a well-grounded, realistic western to the realm of fantasy. This is a much more pragmatic feminism that doesn't get caught up in anachronistic wish fulfillment (think of Mattie Ross from True Grit).Lastly, I'll say that the movie (and director Gavin McConnor) does a great job of giving just the right amount of insight to each of the characters to give us the proper level of connection to each. There are ways in which we could have become too overly sympathetic, or conversely, too jaded to certain characters, making it difficult to reconcile the ending, but as it was it all wrapped up efficiently and effectively.Definitely recommend this movie, but keep in mind it is a slow-build, character driven, western story. Not a bang-bang shoot 'em up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>. . . JANE GOT A GUN ranks second, a tad under THE HATEFUL EIGHT, but several hands above THE REVENANT. True, the musical score of JANE cannot touch Ennio Morricone's themes for EIGHT. But, at less than 98 minutes, JANE is more like an early John Wayne Western (before he got bloated), and NOT like a flick whose characters seem suspended between day-dreaming and wakefulness, since its director knows that at least half the audience is asleep. (In other words, you can throw out your Burning Yule Log DVD's once THE REVENANT comes out on Blu-Ray, as it will send you to La-La Land much quicker!) The BLACK SWAN herself, Natalie Portman, shows as JANE that she'd rather ACT than to attach herself to another Billion-Dollar STAR WARS project. As the title character JANE, Ms. Portman outdoes anything Sharon Stone accomplished in THE QUICK AND THE DEAD. JANE's a perfect illustration of the West's #1 Women's Survival Tip from the 1800s and Today: Always--ALWAYS--have a spare Baby Daddy up your sleeve!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Jane Got a Gun" - and an excellent western!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Natalie Portman in a western? (I mean, isn't she the girl who won an Oscar for "Black Swan" and played Queen Amidala in the "Star Wars" prequel trilogy?) What about Joel Edgerton (from "The Warrior", "Exodus: Gods and Kings" and "The Gift")? Or Ewan McGregor, who was also in "Star Wars" Episodes 1-3 as well as unusual movies like "Moulin Rouge!", "The Men Who Stare at Goats" and "Salmon Fishing in the Yemen"? Then there's Brazilian actor Rodrigo Santoro, who famously played Persian King Xerxes in the "300" movies. I'd answer all those objections with another question: Why not? After all, stretching is important for actors. When they play against type, we often get surprisingly enjoyable performances from our favorite thespians ? and these gutsy actors sometimes find entirely new niches for themselves.Actors like Robert De Niro and Leslie Nielsen, known mainly for "tough guy" roles, each decided to start doing some comedy. That gave us the "Meet the Parents" and "Analyze This" movies (from De Niro) and "Airplane!" and the "Naked Gun" movies (from Nielsen). And does anyone remember when Bruce Willis was mostly doing romantic comedy? "Bruce Willis in an action movie?!?" people said in 1988 ? until they saw "Die Hard". There you go. Now, let us consider the very reasonable possibility that Portman, Edgerton, McGregor, Santoro, et al, can bring us an entertaining western in "Jane Got a Gun" (R, 1:38).Portman plays Jane Hammond, a wife and mother living in a small house in Middle-of-nowhere, New Mexico in 1871, six years after the Civil War ended. When her husband, Bill (Emmerich), shows up at home with five bullets in his back, Jane springs into action. The Bishop Boys gang, led by John Bishop (McGregor), and including violent men with names like Fitchum (Santoro), have an old grudge against Bill. He may have gotten away for the moment, but they intend to find him and finish him off. After patching up her husband as well as she could, Jane rides to the house of Dan Frost (Edgerton), trying to enlist his help in defending her home and her family. Dan turns her down cold, but soon reconsiders.Dan and Jane had been engaged before the war. Dan went off to join the Union Army? and wasn't heard from for three years. By the time he and Jane were reunited, Jane had married Bill and had his baby. There's no love lost between Dan and Bill, but Dan can't bear the thought of leaving Jane to the mercy of the Bishop Boys, a decidedly unmerciful group. As the big confrontation with John Bishop and company draws ever closer, flashbacks progressively tell us more about the past interactions among these four characters ? including some well-kept secrets that, once revealed, will change everything."Jane Got a Gun" is a very well-told, very human story. Its setting of the Old West may suggest plenty of gun fights and action, but what we get is much more. There are a number of exciting scenes that are very well staged and executed, but the script is even more appealing than the film's action sequences. The story is interesting and told very effectively, with some nicely quotable dialog along the way. The interactions between the characters make for a complicated and intriguing dynamic, helped along by great performances from the talented and experienced cast. Add to the mix terrific cinematography and a great song called "Perdition", which plays as the credits roll, and you have several wonderful cinematic elements and an outstanding cast which come together to make a very entertaining motion picture.

		<fullReview>I must have passed up watching this flick at least 10 times. I love Westerns, but just the title has me thinking " ... waste of time ... " But I was wrong - this was a decent Western, and Portman surprised me by being able to portray a believable American frontier woman with grit.With the same no-makeup "grimy-like" feeling you get from Eastwood's UNFORGIVEN (1992), the actors, the clothes, the guns, the wagons, and even the town and its dirty main-street come across real, not like the prettied-up Western actors and towns of yesteryear.The plot was good too, and the more you learned, the more you respected both main-men and Portman's character.If you are into Westerns, this is a must-see. Not an Academy Award Nominee, but for a 2015/2016 Western, pretty damn decent.This is one that will be a sleeper - have a small cult following and take time for Western fans to come across it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jane Hammond (Natalie Portman) asks Dan Frost (Joel Edgerton) - her former fiancé - to help save husband Bill (Noah Emmerich) from his former gang who are trying to kill him. Bill barely makes it to Jane's ranch and he's all shot up and tells Jane the Bishop gang is coming for him. We in the audience couldn't believe a husband would lead an outlaw gang to his wife and family. Jane and Dan make preparations for the onslaught. In flashbacks we see Jane and Dan as lovers and soon to be married, but the Civil War intervened and now each has a story to tell the other why it didn't work out between them. Gang leader John Bishop (Ewan McGregor) agreed to help and protect Jane as she needed to go west but he really had an ulterior motive. The ranch was on a patch of desert where anyone could plainly see that nothing would ever grow. But Dan has Jane empty mason jars to be filled with kerosene to be used to help fight the oncoming gang. Now here's the thing: we see the mason jars were filled with string beans and looked good for eating anytime. Where in the world did they come from? They couldn't possibly have been grown on that desert patch of land where nothing would ever grow. Hmmm???A downside was the gun battle when the Bishop gang comes upon the ranch shooting everything in sight. Except for the mason jars exploding to provide some light these scenes were in the dark so much we couldn't see who was doing what to who. (um, to whom)Despite the string beans and gun battle in the darkness, this was pretty good over all. We did know that a gun battle would come about and resolve everything. The good chemistry and spot on dialogues between Jane and Dan kept this story moving at a good pace. (7/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A Gem hidden in the pile of filmsPrior seeing the film, I didn't even think that this movie would make me think about the "Quick and the Dead". Then I saw "Jane With A Gun" last night, and I thought this film might be Natalie Portman's best performance of her career. I no longer see her being awkward, teenage- like, out-of-place in film, using strange body language, etc. She comes across as a full grown confident woman as the storyline said she should be. I recommend it. The plot was great and not like typical predictable films. It will take you places. (This is one movie that you don't read the spoilers or plot before you going, Just going in without knowing what it is about except "gun" + "wild wild west". And you won't be disappointed.) You'll leaving the theater wondering if you like Natalie Portman's "Jane with a Gun" more or as well as Sharon Stone's "Quick and the Dead". See it and enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Home Alone (Almost) Out West</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a fan of Western films, I have been excited about the rejuvenation of the genre recently, with the recent releases of the "Hateful Eight" (disappointing)and "The Revenant" (outstanding) and the upcoming remake of "The Magnificent Seven" and I was looking forward to this film, even though it looked kind of like a minor production. Alas, this film really brings nothing new to the genre, other that the fact that the main protagonist is female, although that's not a first either (see Cate Blanchett in "The Missing"). The plot is somewhat derivative and the ultimate showdown and resolution is predictable. It's too bad because the acting of both Natalie Portman and Joel Edgerton is very good, as well as that of Noah Emmerich in a smaller role. If you've seen "Cold Mountain," Portman's character is almost a direct descendant of the role (albeit minor) that she played in that film - perhaps what would have happened if that character emigrated west. Ewan McGregor's villain is a bit one-dimensional and this good actor is really wasted in the part. The movie is nothing special, but see it if you're a fan of Westerns or the two stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A review from the female side</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most of the reviews I have read on this film have been from men. I have seen several complain that the film progresses slowly and that McGregor's (the villain) character is underdeveloped. I would like to address those things with a review from the female side of things. A female side that loves the romance of love and the journey it takes. This is as much a love story as it is a western. I think people are so used to the explosive, wham, bam, hit em' up action movies that when those things are missing, they don't feel satisfied. We learn a lot about Jane in the first few moments of the movie. She is tough, she is strong and most importantly, she is loyal. She loves those that are in her care and she's willing to stand her ground in order to protect them. This was her movie, which would explain McGregor's underdevelopment. We know enough about him to know we don't like him and that we are rooting for Jane. I thought the flashbacks helped in building the relationship that went on. They correlated with the misunderstanding and struggle that the characters have been through. I don't want to give away anything else so I will stop now. If you like tough women where the action is more to the realistic side and not Hollywood's forced suspension of belief version, then take a chance on this. You might like it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just a Plain Old Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was worried when I first started hearing about this film since everything that we heard brought up the troubled production and all the people that were shuffled around and left the project. I was starting to wonder if the movie was actually going to get made. Fortunately, they finally got to it and brought us a film that, in my opinion, is pretty good. This isn't anywhere near one of the best westerns I've ever seen but it's decent and enjoyable considering the small number of westerns that are released nowadays. The director is Gavin O'Connor who I really only know for the movie Warrior, which was awesome. Anyway, let's talk about the plot.Jane Hammond (Natalie Portman) lives out west but is in hiding from a group of men led by Colin McCann (Ewan McGregor). Her husband is attacked by McCann's gang leading her to find extra help in the form of an old flame and retired Civil War soldier Dan Frost (Joel Edgerton). It takes a bit of persuading but eventually Dan and Jane team up to defend her home and they both learn more about one another and the paths that their lives have taken since they last met.I liked the cast and everything but I don't think these particular thespians were able to pull off the accents required for this kind of movie, with the exception of Joel Edgerton, I thought Joel did a decent job. Portman and McGregor I think had a a little bit more trouble though I'm not even sure how hard McGregor was even trying. Now that that's out of the way, I actually really liked everything else from the cast. Portman brought the toughness needed for her character and McGregor is wonderfully cheesy as McCann. It feels like a more classic type of western villain (look at that mustache!). Finally, Edgerton is quickly becoming one of my favorite actors out there right now. He melds right into this role and gives us all the angst that this character requires.This film takes place in the wild west and the scenery gives us pretty much that. There's a lot of desert, a cabin, and a rundown looking town. Nothing really extraordinary here but it gets the job done. I guess that's the main problem with this movie. It doesn't really feel unique in any way. It feels like a normal run of the mill western without a whole lot else going on. I managed to predict Jane's whole backstory within fifteen minutes of the movie starting. That being said, the film is still pretty good. Nothing extraordinary but if you're in the mood for this type of movie then this one will deliver.Like I said, decent film but nothing really stands out to me on this one. The flashbacks came off a little awkward right at first but I quickly got used to what they were trying to do. I would recommend this one to fans of the genre but there are honestly much better westerns out there. Heck, go watch The Hateful Eight if you can still find it in theaters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Easy "to get a gun" but hardly when finding the target...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Natalie Portman is among the few actresses that can easily adapt and "wear" a role, a character, no matter how different this is from a previous one, no matter how all these characters she has played contradict one another. Natalie Portman always manages to become, the one we watch on the big screen, like she is the one truly.Here in this film she is Jane, a woman that has suffered from loneliness and despair. Losses are following her, all her life as it seems, and the periods that she is settled, calm and happy are only counted in a few scattered memories...Living far away from the many, but not far away from trouble is what makes her burden heavier.Unfortunately, no matter how much she manages to hold the gun she cannot help this movie from finding the target, which is the heart of the viewer. There are many things missing, there are many things that in such a film (western) supposed to be "the everything" but they are just partially present, weak and predictable. I am now left with the feeling that I watched a film which offered a beautiful relaxing night at the movies, but unfortunately a film that I will barely remember after a week or so.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This move is awful it is so bad it will soon be forgotten Natalie P and the other actors were not he problem Micheal F was smart to drop the film as an actor myself we know the director is important as the writer as the producer as the cast editors etc. I think this film has a few problems bad directing being the biggest, nothing to spoil here avoid this watch a good romance or good western Rodrigo S was not mentioned in the other comments so I will add shame on you for being in this turkey Fenix Petropolis for ever our old School My review did not contain enough lines I think this should be revised as a great writer once said i do not have the time to write you a short letter so i will have to write you a long one, why waste time reading ten lines when 8 is enough ha ha get it 8 is enough oh have to stop before i hit 1000 words ha-ha, i could write over that about the good the bad and the ugly or pretty woman but 8 lines it too much for Jane Goya a gun as stolen title for a poor film</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Natalie Portman is not the tough heroine, advertisements sold her to be!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'JANE GOT A GUN': Three Stars (Out of Five)Natalie Portman's triumphant return to the big screen (or so it first seems), is (the lead) in this western-action flick! She plays a wife, desperately trying to defend her outlaw husband, from his vengeful old gang; with the help of her former fiancé. The movie also costars Joel Edgerton, Noah Emmerich and Ewan McGregor. The film was directed by Gavin O'Connor; and written by Edgerton, Brian Duffield and Anthony Tambakis (O'Connor, Tambakis and Edgerton previously teamed together on the 2011 film 'WARRIOR'; one of my favorite movies). Despite the great cast and crew, the film is pretty disappointing.Portman plays Jane Hammond; an extremely resourceful woman, living in the old west, who's started a new life with her family. Her husband, Bill Hammond (Emmerich), is the former member of a vicious outlaw gang; led by Colin McCann (McGregor). When Bill stumbles home, nearly dead; Jane learns he was shot-up, by the gang, and they're coming there, to her home, to finish him off. Jane then turns to the only man she can think of, for help; her ex-lover Dan Frost (Edgerton).The first thing I hated, about the movie, is that Natalie Portman is not the tough heroine, advertisements sold her to be. She has to turn to her old boyfriend (Joel Edgerton, one of the film's writers) for help. Edgeton made himself the hero, and used Portman to sell the film. So that made me mad; because I'm a huge Portman fan, and I've missed her presence (for nearly the last five years) on the big screen. The film is also extremely slow paced, and unmemorable. It has it's moments though, and Natalie Portman!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/0d1sap746-M</fullReview>
