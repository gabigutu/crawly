		<shortDescription>Unforgettable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A bona fide masterpiece. As simple as that. It is ironic that one of the best films about the Middle East conflict, and specifically the tragic civil war in Lebanon, should be made by a Canadian film maker. Incendies is based on a play but it feels as though it has been adapted from a great literary work. In fact there is no specific mention of any country in the film but no one can be in any doubt that the unnamed country is Lebanon.A Canadain-Lebanese woman dies in Canada and in her will she leaves two letters to her twin son &amp; daughter. One is to be delivered to their brother (whom they did not know existed) and the other to their father (whom they had presumed dead). To find these people they have to travel to Lebanon to unravel the mysterious past of their deceased mother. As we follow their search, flash backs slowly reveal to us key moments in the life of their mother.There are extremely powerful and unforgettable images and scenes in Incendies. Suffice to say that even if you have no interest in the history of the Middle East, this film will capture your attention from the start and grips you right till the end. It is the third great film (and arguably the best)that I've seen on this topic after Waltz with Bashir and Lebanon. All of these are essential viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Our Love Became a Funeral Pyre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When people watch the Oscars, they don't usually care about the Best Foreign Film nominees. Incendies provides so many reasons why people should actually get to see those nominees at all costs. Incendies is the kind of film that one walks away from feeling emotionally drained, one where it stays in the viewer's mind for days on end. Like an intense personal experience, it takes a lot to come to grips with the film's story, a moving plot full of twists and catharsis. At the New Directors/New Films Festival in New York, at which I saw this last night, Denis Villeneuve explained that he has made four films in Canada, but this is the first one to be released in America. Right now, I see no reason why Villeneuve, or any of the actors for that matter, shouldn't have a great future ahead of them.Based on the play Scorched by Wajdi Mouawad, Incendies follows a non-linear plot that spans two generations. In the present day, Jeanne and Simon are twins who have lost their mother, Nawal. Nawal has stipulated in her will that Jeanne and Simon must return an envelope to the brother they didn't know existed who is currently living in a fictional Middle Eastern country. Only then can the twins give Nawal a proper burial. Jeanne feels obligated to return the letter, so she goes to the Middle East, only to realize some of Nawal's nastiest secrets. As Jeanne uncovers more about Nawal, the viewer is shown Nawal's story. The film builds up to an unforgettable ending that is sure to rock any viewer.Incendies already had great source material. I've praised the plot enough, but one thing I must add is that the play is apparently four hours long, according to Villeneuve. It's impressive that this movie succeeds so nicely because I can't imagine that anything was cut. But to back up that source material, there's some really great acting. The entire cast plays their parts with such an emotional vigor that it seems impossible that this work of art wasn't autobiographical.Furthermore, Villeneuve has made a film that relies on great filmmaking to impact the viewer. The cinematography is beautifully bland, surely a nod to some of the deserts in the Lebanon- like land where the movie takes place. Color scheme is also used to Villeneuve's advantage to show the parallels between Nawal and Jeanne's lives. Villeneuve seems to love working with extended zoom shots that shock the viewer with their overwhelmingly long silences. Why Villeneuve didn't receive critical acclaim (in America, at least) before Incendies is a mystery.There are many movies about the Middle East. Some have failed miserably in their attempts to strike an emotional chord with critics and viewers alike (Redacted, Rendition), but others have been extremely successful (The Hurt Locker, Lebanon). Incendies could very well be one of the best films ever made about the conflicts in the Middle East. It has its flaws which keep it from being a masterpiece (maybe it could've lost five or ten minutes), but it is that rare type of film that really resonates beyond the initial viewing. Hopefully, Incendies will be remembered for years to come as the little, brilliant film that spawned the great fame of Denis Villeneuve.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful and devastating</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had the pleasure of attending a screening of Incendies at the Telluride film festival and was absolutely shattered by it. This meticulously crafted film was my favorite of the festival. Stuff happens and you'll be like NO WAY and then the film goes even further and you'll be like WHOA OKAY WHAT and then even further and you'll be like OH MY GOD and then even further still and you'll be like HOW CAN THIS BE HAPPENING OH MY GOD PLEASE and then it'll just keep going even further and further and further and by the end of the film you'll just be a steamy, shattered mess like I was.Characters and events throughout are depicted with the subtlety and prowess of a master filmmaker. I don't want to spoil anything, but there were numerous moments in the screening that I attended when the audience was vocally reacting to moments on screen that were extremely visceral and affecting. Beautiful, powerful film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A work of devastating power...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Incendies (Scorched)" opened in town this Friday, just days before it made the short list of nominees for Best Foreign Film for this year's Academy Awards. It played in the Vancouver International Film Festival 2010, but I missed it then.Fortunately, it received theatrical distribution; this devastating film on the horrors of conflict and its enormous human costs simply must be seen. Denis Villeneuve's searing work, his fourth feature, is based on the celebrated play of the same name by Montreal native and artistic director of the French Theatre at the National Arts Centre in Ottawa Wajdi Mouawad. While there is no doubting the immediacy and impact it must have had as a piece of theatre, "Incendies" benefits from the transition to the larger canvas of the big screen, appropriate for the epic themes and emotional conflagrations it tackles.When their mother dies and her will is read, twins Jeanne and Simon Marwan are stumped by its bizarre burial instructions. Nawal Marwan states that she must be interred naked and facing away from the sun in an unmarked grave, until the two letters she has left with the family notary are delivered on her behalf. One is addressed to the father the twins believed dead, the second to a son whose existence comes as a complete surprise to them. The will makes the twins realize that they did not know their mother at all. They have not had an easy relationship with her, and are understandably reluctant to comply with her terms.The daughter Jeanne moved away and found refuge in the abstract realms of pure mathematics. Her sibling Simon, who remained at home, had the more complicated relationship because he dealt daily with Nawal's strangeness. Jeanne agrees to deliver the letter that was left to her, and embarks on an odyssey of discovery, in search of the father she has never known. Later, she convinces Simon to join her.Although the Middle Eastern country is never named in the film, Wajdi Mouawad ascribes the inspiration for his play to Soha Becharra, a woman who was imprisoned for six years in Khiam, southern Lebanon. In an interview with the Montreal Gazette, he explained "For me, the success of this play and the film is a way to give back some life to a woman whose life was taken away from her." The cinematic endeavor is hugely, powerfully successful: as Jeanne scours an alien land for clues of her mother's past, we see Nawal's tough life in flashback in the same locations that her daughter visits for the first time. Sectarian strife, tribal and religious warfare, family blood feuds, and honor killings have been the blight of the Middle East and areas as far as Afghanistan and what is now Pakistan, and parts of Africa. Bloodshed and violence have been a way of life; each side claims to be justified in killing to avenge earlier injustices. While humankind has not lost its baser urges?we just have to recall the recent incident of the young Afghani woman whose nose was hacked off, or the countless rapes in present day DR Congo?the film is a plea for reconciliation and forgiveness to bring about the much needed change.Nawal barely escapes an honor killing due to her unwed pregnancy, gives up her baby son for adoption, and spends the rest of her life looking for this lost child. Along the way, she takes sides in the violence and is imprisoned for fifteen years for shooting a political leader. Upon her release, she begins life anew in Canada with her infant twins, the outcome of brutal rape at the hands of a torturer. Regardless of the change in geography, she remains haunted by the past and her unending quest for her lost child. How does one look for reparation and justice, when the perpetrators frequently flee the country of their misdeeds and seek asylum elsewhere? As she has not kept her word to her son to return to him, she feels unworthy of a proper burial. A character in the film wisely observes that death always leaves its traces, and Jeanne and Simon finally get to know their mother from the relics of her life.The Belgian actress Lubna Azabal's heroic performance brings Nawal to awe-inspiring Brechtian life. Undefeated by each dehumanizing blow, she stoically navigates a war-crazed world devoid of any sense, her driving force is the need to reunite with her son. Mélissa Désormeaux-Poulin and Maxim Gaudette do excellent work as the siblings who gradually begin to understand their mother. Rémy Girard and Allen Altman, playing the Canadian and Middle Eastern notaries respectively, guide the siblings through their search, while Abdelghafour Elaaziz makes an impact in the small but important role of Abou Tarek the torture specialist. The rest of the characters are brought to life by a talented cast of unknown actors; in their hands, even the smallest roles acquire great significance. Denis Villeneuve's film honors the stories of these people by rigorously avoiding directorial excesses. Events and stories this powerful do not require embellishment, and Villeneuve's spare, dispassionate directorial style maximizes impact.Someone remarked that "Incendies" is the closest contemporary approximation of Greek tragedy, and I agree with this assessment: the crimes and consequences are universal and timeless, and if a film holds up a mirror to question our capacity for barbarism, it is reason to applaud. Regardless of the outcome at the Academy Awards, "Incendies" is a major achievement for Canadian cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exquisite</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Denis Villeneuve has created nothing less than a masterpiece. This film is revealing a great Director, especially when given an original story with such powerful dimensions.Despite being skeptical as first of the film being shot in Jordan, when dealing with the very specific, multidimensional Lebanese drama, the geographic distance with the land of Lebanon is detaching the film from the strict reality of the place and taking it to whole other level of significance. Jordan's landscape especially with the film's photography, are somewhat surrealistic, as if the story was taking place in a deep level of the region's sub-conscious.Villeneuve has managed to delicately craft a story with dimensions that a human mind in its normal condition is not prepared to understand and confront. And yet these things did happen, many times during the war and retelling them is a very not an easy task. Actually a quasi impossible one and yet Villeneuve did it.This has to be the film representing Canada at the Oscars. And it will win.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a superb film. Best film of the year in my estimation bar none. This exceptional Canadan film should easily win best Foreign film at the Oscars. Directing, photography, cinematography, casting, acting all outstanding. The film also has something to say on the nature of hate and violence. Unfortunately this wonderful film will neither be seen nor appreciated by a wide audience. Denis Villeneuve has created a fabulous film. He has done an immense job taking this from novel to the screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic! Villeneuve's best film yet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is extraordinary on just about every level. The script is terrific, the actors are perfect, the direction and cinematography are all you could hope for. I recommend it without hesitation.Anyone who has seen any of Villeneuve's previous work--or Andre Turpin's Zigrail--knows that these filmmakers have bodies of work that are almost without peer in contemporary cinema world-wide and are unparallelled in the history of Canadian cinema (until seeing Incendies, Maelstrom was my favourite Canadian film). Incendies does not betray that "legacy". You should absolutely see it.In a film as stunning as this one it's odd to single out one aspect, but I must say that Lubna Azabal's performance is among the best I've ever seen. Though I've watched a few films that she's been in in the past, she never really stood out for me. She is devastatingly good in this picture.I do hope that this film gets submitted to the AMPAS for Oscar selection as it is definitely the best film I've seen this year and a shoe-in for the foreign picture Oscar.My only complaint about the film was the use of music by Radiohead, which took me out of the film each time it played. The rest of the music cues were spot-on and quite excellent, but Thom Yorke's voice belonged nowhere near this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>During the reading of the will of their mother's, a twin brother and sister learn of some unusual last wishes. Amongst other requests, two envelopes need to be delivered to respectively the father of the two and a brother whom are both unknown. The quest leads the twins through the Middle East where they slowly learn of the horrific tales which is the life history of their late mother.The movie tells a very graphic but endearing story, perfectly shot and acted allowing the viewer to get fully immersed into the journey and findings of the twins. Through flashbacks we learn about the hardship of the mother and, eventually, the fate of the father and brother. As a treat, there is a great twist at the end which is really the icing on the cake.Highly recommended.92/100</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: Incendies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film begins in sweeping slow motion, centered around a harsh cemented premises with a bunch of boys undergoing the shaving of their hair ala military fashion, with the camera centered on one boy possessing this crazed looking eyes, before cutting to Canada where twins Jeanne and Simon Marwan (Melissa Desormeaux-Poulin and Maxim Gaudette respectively) arrive at a notary's office to accept the will of their recently deceased mother Nawal (Lubna Azabal), where they are left with letters to deliver to a father and brother that they do not know. In the meantime, they are to bury their mother in a certain strange way until their quest has been completed, with the notary Jean Lebel (Remy Girard), Nawal's boss the last few years, ensuring that her last will and testament is completed the way it was intended.Incendies, based upon the play Scorched written by Wajdi Mouawad and adapted for the screen by director Denis Villeneuve, was this year's Best Foreign Language Film nominee from Canada, and there's every reason why it was a nomination well deserved. Set against a mystery to be unraveled so slowly, bringing together seemingly disparate events together in shocking fashion by the time we're through, the narrative is split into two different timelines, with the current one being the twins' journey to an unnamed Middle Eastern country in search for clues to their unknown father and brother, while with each milestone achieved of sorts, we get to see a flashback to the time of their mother, brought up in a harsh environment involving the staining of family honour, as well as religious zealots and militants who set her off in a tale of an avenging angel, and sacrifice.And the story sprawls in many directions, though with Villeneuve always having an assured hand in not having this fall into melodramatic terms nor have any wasted scenes, highlighting issues that still exist to this very day involving hatred, revenge and forgiveness, but not before laying down a number of surprises that will shake you to the core especially when the mysterious equation finally gets solved ? you may get a hint of what's to come, but this got handled so expertly without being verbatim, that it accentuates and compounds the myriad of complex emotions felt by all the characters involved.With sweeping cinematography that's achingly beautiful to gaze at, one of the best scenes involve the brutal, cold blooded mass murder where militants spray countless of rounds into a packed bus, culminating in that shot of a burning bus shrouded in thick black smoke against an endless sandy environment, with Nawal finally snapping into making a decision to take matters into her own hands from then on. Between the two stories, perhaps it is Nawal's painful journey that makes this compelling viewing, from having her lover forcefully and terminally separated from her by family during her teens, then her volunteering and sacrifice leading to imprisonment and ill treatment within as punishment. What she did as part of reconciliation is in part a masterstroke in inflicting inexplicable pain in return to her perpetrator, is what made this film a winner, although it will stun you into silence well after the end credits roll from the devastation the narrative left in its wake.The other half of the narrative deals with Jeanne and Simon's journey to dig through unwritten laws, and reluctance of tightly knit communities that prefer to keep the status quo and not dwell and reopen wounds inflicted from their collective shameful past, some in denial, while others happy to have seen a more favourable outcome from Nawal's hardships. It is this piecing together of the mystery like an investigative drama that makes Incendies unique, and what more, Radiohead also features in the soundtrack ? strange but true, and very powerful if you ask me.Comparing the ratings between this film at M18 and Womb at R21 reveals what the censors allow and not allow when dealing with more mature themes, likely centered around the intention of its more controversial scenes. It's anyone's guess why was was given the highest rating possible, and the other one rung lower, given that both actually didn't have anything explicit, except perhaps one was used as an unintentional weapon of torture and destruction in the psychological sense, while the other was a love story gotten out of control! Still, for its strong story and excellent production values, Incendies becomes that must watch film in 2011, especially during this season of noisy summer action blockbusters that absolutely don't resonate as much as this film. Highly recommended!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably the best drama of the last few years!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I decided to watch this movie because I have read many excellent critics and because this book is used in Quebec's "cegeps", some kind of a post-high-school, and my girlfriend talked about it with me. Indeed, I am very happy to have seen this intense movie. It is really a great and close to perfection. Even though I have even seen one or two better films this year, this movie is at least the best drama I have seen in the last five years.This movie is absolutely convincing. It has very intense images and words and has a very slow paced and sad atmosphere. The movie begins very calm but the tension raises very fast and you really feel more and more with the tragic characters. This movie makes you cry, it makes you angry, it shocks you. Once again, it is a Quebecker movie that is cut into pieces and may mix you up a little bit in the beginning. You see scenes from the present where Jeanne and Simon are first parallely looking for the truth and trying to fulfil her last will, you see scenes from the dramatic past of her mother at different stages of her life and you also see scenes from the past of her family. The movie shows not only a couple of interesting and diversified characters (played by mostly unknown and indeed extremely talented actors), but also magnificent and intense landscapes, shocking crime and war scenes and insights of a foreign culture and the clash of the generations and ideologies in the past and the present. The movie is much diversified and very intellectual.Many people were surprised by several twists and a very intense and dramatic ending. It is true that the development the movie takes is really shocking but I have seen a few things coming and wasn't that surprised in the end, but that almost does no harm to the atmosphere and tension of the movie. The movie tells in a very philosophical way about the irony of fate, peace and war, love and hate, vengeance and forgiveness, saints and sinners. It is uneasy to watch the movie and you still think about what you have heard and seen for quite a while after the movie.Almost everything is perfect in this movie. There are two minor reasons why I don't give the best note. First of all, I was somehow able to predict some of the punches at a certain point in the movie and I have already seen more intense and shocking dramas that very even more uneasy and heavier to watch than this one, for example "The pianist". Second, some scenes in the beginning of the movie are not done very well by the camera man. In the scene where Jeanne is in her mathematic class and when she looks for some accessories in her room, the camera is disturbingly shaking and moving all the time but not to create an effect of uneasiness, because there are no similar scenes later in the movie during way heavier scenes. Those two scenes (that would not have been complicated to produce or film again) are just not well done and the director should have seen and corrected that before sending the final product to the festivals and cinemas. In a perfect and intense masterpiece, this little detail is really something that could harm the reputation and professionalism of the whole brilliant work. The next time, they should be more concentrated on the movie's perfection and keep their eyes open or invest the money in a good camera director instead of some war scenes.But all in all, I think that we can really talk about an extremely good movie here! It is surely worth watching it and I agree with those ones who would like to see this movie represent Canada at the Oscars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Useless "lone plot twist" movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It started well, though. Mysterious last will and testament with missions to accomplish... Adorable french Canadian accent (I'm french, I love what our cousins have done with our common language ). A Quebec thriller, yeah !Rapidly, first eyebrow raisers... What Arab place are they talking about like everyone should know about it ? Never heard of it...Then you realize the Arab country they are going to is just an archetypal Arab country, non existent. A caricature of many seen-on-TV Arab countries... OK, why not, I suppose Americans (as people living on the American continent) have a lesser history burn with Arab countries than Frenchs, for example, do, and have no problem building a make-believe Arab country just for the sake of... what? At this point, I supposed the filmmakers wanted to make some point about Arab or religious wars... or terrorism... ? Since they are Canadians, not Unitedstatesians, I was hoping maybe for a not so obvious / good vs bad kind of story... But I was really wondering what was the purpose of all that.The story goes on, civil war, religious war, slaughter, all fake, all archetypal, OK, but to what end? What's the point?And then, you finally get the answer, at the end of the movie, with one unforeseen big plot twist.And then you realize the Arab story is absolutely irrelevant. The same plot could have been set in any archetypal place with a credible history of violence and torture... South America? Former Yugoslavia? Caucase? Heck, actually, since the prison/torture part is altogether sufficient to hold the whole movie, the very same movie could have been set just about Guatanamo (and viewers would then believe for one hour they were watching a anti-US movie, only to realize at the end the total irrelevance of all that)At the end of the movie, you get that astonishing plot twist, which makes you realize the vast vacuity and uselessness of all the side stories you have been watching for the past hour. But, OK, what next ? What to do with that extraordinary situation ?Well, nothing. Movie ends here. Tadaaaa.And loopholes appear : there's obviously a wrong choice of actors : one of them should really look like twenty years older that what he looks like. The lawyer, since he wrote all three letters, should have understood much earlier the whole thing: it never shows that he knows more than the others participants to the quest. Weird.Good acting. I loved the actresses. The boy is deliberately annoying, and he does annoy me, so I guess he is a success too.On the whole, a waste of time, the feeling of having been cheated, using a deceitful setup for a story that could hold in three lines.I do suggest, instead of watching this movie, reading the Robert Heinlein 1953 short story "All you zombies". On the same kind of twisted plot, that gem makes this movie looks... petty.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautifully made tragedy but schematic, contrived.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just watched it, hence the ramble... Such a beautifully-made film with terrific performances. I can see how many people find it an extremely powerful tragedy but I wonder if it tackles too much for its length and medium. There's only so much you can do and say in a 2 hour conventional-ish movie without overtly manipulating the audience.Personally I have a problem with many fictional films of this type though I understand my reaction is not the common one. To me, these films take extremely shocking or despicable events which 'could be real' or 'could have happened' and 'do sometimes happen'. They film these events realistically but they ask the audience to dive in and get into the story as you would a piece of riveting fictional drama, The Godfather etc. At the same time they insist the film has elements of reality or quasi-documentary - to have 'this is almost truthful' or 'this is currently happening' qualities. Yet the screenplay, the unfolding drama, is only as real as a Greek tragedy, say - it is carefully scripted and story-boarded to shock and amuse and provoke. It's a play. A drama. A movie. It's still only another The Godfather or The Matrix. It's not a documentary or a record of an event or events which happened. It's like having your cake and eating it - taking an irony-filled, message-laden 'impactful' stage play and putting it in the package of a realistic contemporary action-drama thriller mystery tragedy. I think if another director had played more on the fictional 'Greek tragedy', 'heightened ironic drama written for the stage' aspects I would have loved it. (Eg if the audience understood they were being manipulated for the sake of great drama.) Conversely I think if this director had made a similar movie based on a true story without the central shocking irony I would have loved it. He's a great director.Not meaning to 'compare' different films and different intentions, and perhaps conflicting some of what I have said so far: I liked the way Roman Polanski's 'Death and the Maiden' keeps the stage play aspects of the original. I didn't enjoy 'The Kite Runner's mixing of fact and fiction, and then its action rescue ending. I'm a fan of some films which take real events and work them into drama and then finish by revealing the actual protagonist in real life - Europa Europa is an example. I'm a fan of City Of God only because it is so obviously a complete fiction, a 'Hollywood' style shoot-em-up, rather than a 'state of address'. I'm a huge fan of Sergei Bodrov's 'Prisoner Of the Mountains' as a film depicting some themes of war and religious conflict in a fairly realistic way but somehow with a nice balance between 'this is just a filmed play' and 'this is something happening right now which carries some universal truths'.I don't comment that often on IMDb but I do think that for films of an extreme nature (such as Incendies' central twist) it is probably worth recording people's different reactions.Finally, I do think the director is one of the best of recent times and congratulate him on the film despite it not being to my taste.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One plus One is Equal to One</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Canada, the sixty year-old immigrant secretary Nawal Marwan (Lubna Azabal) passes away and the notary Jean Lebel (Rémy Girard), who had been her employer and friend for seventeen years, reads her will to her twin son and daughter Simon (Maxim Gaudette) and Jeanne Marwan (Mélissa Désormeaux-Poulin), who is a mathematician.Nawal requests to be buried naked with her face down and her tomb without a gravestone; further, she leaves three sealed envelopes addressed to the twins' father that they believed had deceased in the Middle East; to their unknown brother; and the last one to themselves to be opened only after the delivery of the other two. Then, they may put a gravestone on her tomb. Simon is reluctant to respect his mother last wishes, but Jeanne decides to find her biological father and brother.She travels to the Middle East to track down the past life of her mother and she discovers who she was before moving to Canada. She feels disturbed with the revelations and asks Simon to come to the Middle East to assist her in her journey. Simon discovers who his father and his brother are and concludes that one plus one may be equal to one."Incendies" is an intriguing film about the journey of two twin siblings that travel to the Middle East to fulfill the last wish of their mother and end discovering the disturbing history of their family.The screenplay is very well written and discloses in parallel to the journey of Jeanne first and Simon later, the brave history of their mother in an unnamed country in the Middle East. The plot point in the conclusion is totally unexpected and heartbreaking. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "Inc?ndios" ("Fires")</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Incendies starts with twins a brother and a sister receiving a letter from their late mother. The letter sends them on a mission to find the truth about their backgrounds. The main problem with this film is the purpose of the letter. Why does the mother send them on this mission? The truth revealed is cruel and shocking? The mother has died after finding out the truth, now she wants her children to go on a mission to find the truth rather than reveal to them the truth through the letter. One could argue that the mother wanted to reveal the truth and reveal the horror and the pointlessness of the Middle East conflict. But the journey is contrived and feels as though the screenwriter just wanted to use the incest as shock value.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Good Until Becoming Too Contrived</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Incendies" is one of these movies that really disappoints - The ones that for a good portion of the movie are highly enthralling, but then comes crashing down. (Major Spoiler) I had an inkling that the filmmakers might pull what they ended up trying to smear on the viewer, and it was so, so disappointing. Suffice it to say to twist the plot around and pretzel it like they did, the filmmakers stooped to utter contrivance. They blew up logic and believability for the sake of sensationalism. How probable could all of this actually take place in such a sequence (?), quite improbable. Additionally I had a hard time understanding what exactly transformed the mother into a killer(?) The ending became marginal and a continuation of the contrivance. Too bad - it had a great story going up until the last quarter of it's run-time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too far-fetched</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie tries to emulate a Greek tragedy, which is something expected from a movie based on an Arabic story (for example, Egyptian movies are almost all so dramatic and tragic), but it's a flop. Many will consider it as kind of 'artistic' but it's not really, it's just very poor material. First of all the story is very contrived and the events highly unlikely to happen (probability almost nil). Second, the setting is a deformed and inaccurate account of the Lebanese civil war (they changed names and historic events but the backbone is evidently based on that war and that country). As I've seen in some other reviews, with such a setting so removed from reality, the movie lost its impact, it became a farce. A tragedy or a drama is touching especially because it has elements of reality, and when that reality is removed, the movie resembles a ridiculous science-function-like flick that tries hard to be deep but fails. The acting was generally OK, Mélissa Désormeaux (Jeanne) did a good job, however the actress who played Nawal (the main character) was a disaster; they could have found a better actress, at least someone who could speak proper Arabic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So outrageous it becomes blatantly funny!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I never thought it possible that a film with such heavy subject would have me laughing at the end! But thats exactly what happened. After depicting all the clichés that there are about the wars at the middle East (for most of the time, so efficiently and subtly that the movie went quiet well up to a point), and after having us convinced we are actually seeing a really good movie, it drops a twist so "over the top " that instead of delving us in shock, it just leave us there standing like in WTF happened now?MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD......So, the mother had an illegitimate child that was taken away from her (after the killing of her boyfriend by her family) ,who was then captured and trained from an opposite group, who was then later captured and imprisoned from the original group, and then in the blink of an eye changes his loyalties, becomes a tormentor, ends up raping his own mother, and the later, after encountering her son/rapist completely accidentally in the other edge of the world, collapses and dies but arranges to sent her offsprings to find their brother/dad for closure! (which she still loves of course!) Sorry, this is so extreme that it no longer seems horrible or serve us to transmit the dismals of war, it just becomes plainly laughable. If you ever saw a movie that tries so hard to make a point that it TOTALLY misses it, then that movie was it!In the background of course, there are masterfully presented descriptions of the horrors of war, especially civil war, which every nation who has been through this process knows how worst is from "normal" wars, but again everything is given with such extremity, crazy coincidences and the like that you can only accept it if you take them for their symbolic meaning. Unfortunately, the end is so extremely absurd that simply ruins the strength of the movie. Everyone knows what happens in wars. Sorry, such crazy development doesn't happen even in them.The saddest part is how many people embraced that movie, showing beyond a doubt how accurate the story about the naked king (H.C. Andersen) still stands today, both among the critics and the common people. But then again, there is no surprise there!In conclusion if you want to see a "punch in the gut" about such subjects, see "Whistleblower" (or Hotel Rwanda and the like), who truly deliver. This one is betrayed by the fact that it simply tries too much, and hence looses the realism that would give the movie its strength. Oh well, next time...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first seconds are enough. I mean, they were for me. They are able to capture you. And of course it continues for the whole movie. You know you were blessed with a good film. But I particularly like the way in which this movie begins; I believe this is my favorite part of movies. Hearing Radiohead song "you and whose army?" and watching this little boy's sight; the way in which he looks us. Two eyes that are full of anger, passion and pain. These few seconds are the perfect taste of what will be coming up next. A great opening for a great (and tough) movie. A story about family, courage and sacrifice. I recommend this film if you want to get real.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than Greek Tragedy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Because it's so good, after watching Canadien/French Film Incendies for the second time, I thought that it must be based on a novel of play. I needed to find out. I now know that it is based on a play by Wajdi Mouawad. Mouawad is a Canadien writer, and to my delight, Incendies is part of a series of four plays. This means I have three more Incendies-like plays still to read. I won't go through a run-down of the plot, talk in abstractions about arch, characters symbiosis or lack-there-of?. there are tons of proper film reviews out there already dealing with these topics. I thought I'd just talk about two things, the two things that I thought make this an outstanding film: Photography, and the remarkable unfolding of a dramatic story; better film critics than me, which is to say any real film critic, have said that this film pulls off tragedy better than the Greeks. The photography, the photography, the photography? was just as good the second time as it was the first time I saw it. The film opens in a village that could be mistaken for Greece of Israel. At thought maybe this was set and shot in Palestine, but I think most of the film as actually shot in Jordan. Theses shots are actually set to portray a fictional Lebanon, both past and modern day. The history intertwined with the movie seems to be loosely fictional; I can't find any information on any of the places that appear in film. My Lebanese civil war history is a little rusty. Anyone else?There are two shots in particular that stand out. Both are shot at a distance to reveal the vastness of the landscape, unmistakably Mediterranean. Rocky, and the trees, not that I'm a tree expert, but they must be olive or fig trees, they are almost overused as prototypical symbols of the Med, but they work great. The first shot I like is actually two shots, meaning one type of shot that is used twice, almost identically. It's of a bus traveling on a skinny, mountainside road. At first, the camera is in close then pans way out to show the whole panoramic view, massive landscape, and tiny bus, a common technique in World films that are shot in exotic landscapes. The other shot is similar. It is later in the film. One of the characters is driving to a modern day Deressa Refugee camp and there is a shot taken from the sky of the winding roads leading up the side of a mountain. This shot is amazing, and whatever effects of filters the photographer added to make it fit the film's tone so well, I can't think of a better word to use to describe them, and the shot as 'cinematic.' I know that's a terrible term to use when describing Cinema, I really do, but a shot like this is so expressive and well-placed in the film, there is nothing going in the film here excepts visuals, the shot on it's own stands out as an artistic, filmmaking achievement.The storyline, the storyline, the storyline?unfolds with the precision of a textbook tragedy. It sets up the conflict right off the top--- find missing brother and father. As the drama unfolds the story becomes more and more complex, adding twists and turns to the plot that we never even thought possible. In the end we are left with remains that challenge Oedipus the King in magnitude. (but without the fall from grace) The film still manage to exit the scene with a sparkle of hope. Forgiveness lets the audience breath a little easier as the film closes, a catharsis, but even then the story, the film, will haunt your subconscious for a good while after.

		<shortDescription>Contrived motivations and director's political bias undermine Lebanese Civil War victim's compelling tale of survival</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some viewers may regard the climax of 'Incendies' as the most effective part of the film, but I must wholeheartedly disagree . If one really wants to single out the most effective and compelling scene, that would be the massacre on the bus and subsequent shooting of the young child. It works because Director Denis Villenueve compounds the horror exponentially: the bus is stopped by terrorists, the passengers react confused and frightened, the bus driver is murdered, the terrorists strafe the bus with machine gun fire killing most of the passengers, Nawal (the protagonist) and a young mother and her young daughter move to the back as the terrorists pour gasoline on top of the roof of the bus, Nawal escapes and takes the young girl with her only to see the terrorists set the bus on fire killing the mother and finally the child running back to the bus to be with her mother, only to be shot in the back by the terrorists as Nawal watches in horror.With such an unforgettable iconic scene, as listed above (along with a few others, such as the 'honor killing' at the beginning of the film), why must 'Incendies' ultimately be labeled as contrived and dishonest? For starters, Villenueve only vaguely alludes to the film's main setting. We know that Nawal's journey occurs in Lebanon during the Lebanese Civil War but the country, along with the right wing Arab Christian party, the "Phalangists", are never mentioned by name. When Nawal's family members murder her lover, they refer to him as a "refugee" not as a "Palestinian". Despite stripping the events depicted in the film of their political context, Villenueve clearly cannot hide his bias. Nawal decides to become an assassin for the Muslims after her Muslim lover is murdered by her own Christian family and she's a witness to the bus massacre by Arab Christian terrorists. Only a "kindly" Muslim warlord ("Chamseddine") happens to tell Narwan's son, Simon, the truth during the search for the "son" and the "father". And that truth is that the fighting is tit for tat?one reprisal begets another. Nonetheless, Villenueve still implies that it's the Muslim side who are clearly the wronged party here. By no means am I trying to defend the brutality of the right-wing nationalists during the Lebanese Civil War, but there were two sides to the story and certainly that's lost in Villenueve's narrative.As to why the film should be considered contrived, it's not so much the wacko ending which is designed to point out the horrors of war (and hence its pointlessness) but the whole idea that the mother would send her children on a wild goose chase, making them face the truth about HER situation, instead of telling them what happened on her deathbed (she was able to blurt out the main points to family friend, the Notary Lebel) or allowing Lebel to explain it to the kids without having them experience the full impact of the horror by traveling to Lebanon, dredging up old wounds amongst people who they didn't know (and didn't even speak their language). I question whether any mother would have put her children in such a position?why was she so insistent on having them learn the truth about their parentage? After all, the revelation that her son was actually her other children's father, basically drove her insane and led to her death. This from a woman who always claimed she would do anything for her children. And here they would end up in a foreign country, asking sensitive questions which could place their lives in jeopardy.While a series of chilling events, clearly molded Narwan's character, there's little character development when it comes to the son. He has that most disagreeable chip on his shoulder (until he finally bonds with his sister in the swimming pool), but for most of the film, he is an unwelcome, one-note presence. And what's with that lack of hesitation with taking a ride blind-folded with the Warlord's bodyguards? The guide's assurance that "everything is okay" is enough for him to take a ride with a duo of potential killers. How does he know that his guide can be so sure about the Warlord?And what about Abou Tarek (the 'son' and the 'father')? The Warlord trains him to be a crackerjack sniper but becomes disaffected by war and switches sides, ending up in the Christian Arab prison, as Narwan's torturer. Even though we hear the explanation from Chamseddine, it seems a little too convenient that Tarek so easily switches from the Muslim to the Christian Arab side with so little explanation. Of course without him doing so, there's no 'twist ending', designed to shock.I understood that the two letters which Narwan has her children deliver to Tarek reflects Narwan's ambivalence about how she feels toward him. But again, why involve the twins? How is Narwan so sure that her revelation to him that he's her son, will impact his conscience? It's already been established that he's a psychopath so I would hardly think that he would care who his mother is. For all we know, Tarek may have decided to go after the half-siblings, as they could reveal his dark secret publicly and cause him a good deal of trouble.'Incendies' manages to keep one's interest despite the main character's motivations that don't add up and the director's clear political bias. It's worth seeing but hardly deserves the accolades that have been heaped upon it since its heralded release.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A rare piece of gem!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just wonder what could make me watch the 2 hrs long movie at 3:30 am?.. I don't like the movies regarding the middle eastern wars at all.. That is how I thought before watching this one... I just gave it a chance... And wasn't intending to finish it... Just wondered why this movie has been rated 8.2... It's a quite long movie actually but you don't feel and don't complain while you watch till the end... slow pace is easily adapted and even makes you ask for more...The movie contains many flashbacks which at first looks like a historical review of situation of those days... But then you realize the real mastery in telling the story in front of that strong historical background... The flashbacks and the real time connected by the end of the movie in such way that feels like there's no other way to understand and really ''feel'' the movie...The story itself is not comparable to any other one... at least I haven't watched a movie with such a strong and different scenario... very very powerful movie...This movie deserves applause and all kinds of rewards...I strongly advise this movie to everyone over 16 yrs old... as it is not a ''feel good'' or a ''have fun time with family'' movie... just a very very good piece of art... a master's work...I'm very very happy that I watched it!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incendies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Incendies is based on the play by Wajdi Mouawad. The film is a Canadian film in French and Arabic with English subtitles. Going into the theatre to see Incendies, I really knew nothing about it. I had not read any of the reviews that came out, but I had heard from the television news shows that it was supposed to be very good and now with a Best Foreign Language Film Oscar, I assumed that it was going to be a really good film. I decided not to read anything about the plot before I saw the film because these days I find that so many critics gave away too much crucial information of the films in their reviews that when you finally do see the film it does not have the same affect on you. So having known nothing about Incendies and then watching the story unfold before my eyes was quite an experience and I would recommend you do the same if you are at all inclined to go see it. Other than the film's director Denis Villeneuve, I was not familiar with anybody else who appeared in the film, or worked on the sides, but I must say that they all did a fantastic job. This is the type of film that when you are watching it, you are not quite sure what will happen, or how the climax, or the ending will come, but when it does, it makes sense to you and leaves you with a multitude of feelings. At times Incendies was not always the most easy film to watch, not because it was overly violent, or graphic because I thought everything was handled in a very tastefully done way, but it still sucks so much emotion out of us and we get to care so much for the characters and what they are going through as we watch it before our eyes, that we can not help but feel sad, enraged, or even physically ill watching it at times. I should clarify that the film does deal with some of the goings on with the Middle East and the wars, tension and prejudices that came out of some of those wars and moments of terror that people at that time and still are going through. I also liked how when dealing with such a tricky and controversial subject matter such as this that as I mentioned it was all very tastefully done and none of it felt like you were watching a Hollywood movie. I think if this had been a big budget, big name star movie extravaganza, then it probably would not have worked. The reason it works so well as it is, is because the fact that it is so character driven and deals with events that have gone on in the past and in some similar and different ways are still going on today. The film felt personal to me. It felt like the people involved with the film had something to say and instead of sugar coating everything and making it an easily watchable film with a feel good portion of it, it instead goes for all your emotions and in a sense almost takes you on the journey and the personal trials and tribulations that the characters in the movie have gone on and understandably we can almost feel their pain, exhaustion and hurt because the performances have this sense of believability and authenticity to them, that everything we see them go through feels like the real thing and the way they handle each situation is believable and not far fetched at all. The characters in the film give us something to believe in because they are searching for the truth and will go to many lengths to find it, even if at times it is difficult, or even dangerous and the amount of honour and pride they carry with them to set out someone's wishes is truly remarkable. This is an incredibly powerful film that as I mentioned, does put you through an array of different emotions, but I did not mind that because I felt I could connect with the characters more because of this. The look and feel of the film is not big budget or fake looking, which makes all the interior and exterior shots look real and further enhancing the emotions, or moods we are supposed to feel in each scene. The acting by everyone involved is all terrific here as well and this is just a really well put together film with a great cast and director and wonderful material to work and mold into this brave, haunting and yet life changing experience. I have not seen any of the other Best Foreign Language Film Oscar nominees, but having just seen Incendies now, I would say that it has a good chance of winning because of how masterful and great it is. Do not just take my word for it, go and see it when it opens in a theatre near you. This is certainly one of the best films of 2010.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lovely looking and acted film, in desperate need of a script</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Forgive me for being the on person who stood out among the crowd here, but by God I really can't see how this has an 8.2 rating here on IMDb. Now I can see that this would be loved to death by those who only watch "film" and not movies, but come on, folks. I do like Denis Villanueve... Or at least I did. I saw his movie Polytechnique and I loved it. It was brutal, uncompromising yet very heartfelt and uplifting. I loved the black and white cinematography, as well as the feeling of being caught in the middle of the shooting. His filmmaking is just lovely in that film. So with hi expectations already in place, I was hoping this would do the good deed.Alright, from a filmmaking standpoint, as in cinematography and all that jazz, the movie is amazing. If I could give the movie a 10 for that alone, I so would. With all the gorgeous scenery and what not, this film really is pleasing to the eye. And the soundtrack is fantastic too, with "You and whose Army" by Radiohead over the opening scene- I LOVED that! And the acting is really brilliant, Maxim Gaudette and the female lead both did very great together.But how shallow was this film.The biggest problem is its characterization. Characters go a long way in a film for me, and believe me I wanted to feel for the mother and her children. I'll admit they did quite well with the mother, and the scenes with the flashbacks to her past were very intriguing. But them we went to present day with the kids, and the daughter in her mother's homeland, and suddenly the film goes all to naught because the children are SO DAMNED UNINTERESTING. In fact I don't remember a thing about the son because he was in the movie for like, literally, 5 minutes. Another problem is the script... If there even is one.. The movie feels like Villanueve dropped the script one day, then picked it up and instead of putting the pages in the right order, went "Ah, never mind, shoot it like this!" The dialogue is so wooden and hokey, that at times I fell on the ground laughing at the implausibility. In fact scene. After scene, I was scratching my head because the scenes have no meaning. And don't get me started on the twist with the third child, when that came, I asked myself "was this some bad joke the cast and crew had going on throughout the shoot?"I wish I could jump on the bandwagon like a lot of us here have, but the movie is so dire, tired and dull. And furthermore it's 30 minutes too long too. This is a 90 minute or even a 100 minute movie stretched to 2 hours and 10 minutes. It did not need to be that long.OVERALL: 3/10Pros: A very beautifully shot movie, with great acting and soundtrack.Cons: The film is otherwise very shallow, with an almost zero level script, bad pacing, and dull and shallow characters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strong anti-war and anti-religion message</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie isn't intellectual, let alone "falsely intellectual", as some claim it to be. This movie is just a powerful message against war, and I'd say against religion, as well. The author cleverly did not place the story into a particular country, cause the story is universal - war over religion makes no sense anywhere. Because religion doesn't make sense either, to start with. Sure, movie has a flaw or two, I'd say the greatest of them is the terrible cast for the role of brother, who couldn't probably act even in his high school, but miraculously ended here.I can't decide if the movie should have more "pathetic" and "emotional" in it, which could be done just by adding classical music. From the artistic point of view, it's probably needless. However, maybe it would reach more people, "pathos" would probably create greater emotional response, and the message would get farther.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gutwrenching, intense, beautiful, searing (yes, scorching)...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Incendies (2010)Scorched is a good translation of the French title. That's how you'll feel by the end.This Canadian movie, based on a play by a Lebanese writer, is set mostly in Jordan and is a tale of a twin brother and sister (son and daughter) looking for their roots after the death of their mother. It's quite amazing.Don't think this is some feel-good flick. What it shows first of all, better than almost any movie I've seen, is the reality of life in wartime in the Mideast (pick your country). The ruthless, bloody, sectarian violence is made intimate in the worst way, or best way cinematically?you hate it, and feel it. This is the huge strength of the movie, giving light to the dilemmas of ordinary people trying to survive, literally, the mayhem.Equally important is how the daughter's view of her mother changes as she learns more and more about her. The daughter is forced to do this because of a request in her mother's will, but she takes it on, in a more recent Jordan, with utter determination.The movie is divided into two time periods. The first belongs to the mother in an ongoing series of harrowing flashbacks. The second belongs to the daughter, and eventually the son, as they look for surviving members of the mother's past. The steely force of will of the daughter turns out to be a mere shadow of the strength of her mother, and you droop in admiration and sympathy for all of them.The huge, dramatic hook of the movie, which you only learn as the characters learn it at the very end of the movie, isn't something I can talk about here. But for outrageousness it puts Shakespeare to shame?and it was for me also a distraction. Your jaw drops and you think, oh how awful (and more)! But a part of my brain was also saying, this is too much, it isn't contributing to the truth and emotional depth of these characters.It might even undermine them slightly, reminding us this is a stage play, an artifice.But that's a nagging quibble. This is really a powerful movie, beautifully rendered, and acted with unusual intensity. It's rough (realistically violent) in a few spots, but it's worth it. Wow.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story begins with a will, which Nawal (Lubna Azzabal), a Canadian expat with Middle Eastern origins, leaves behind for twins Jeanne (Mélissa Désormeaux-Poulin) and Simon (Maxim Gaudet). The will consists of two sealed envelopes with instructions for delivery listing Jeanne and Simon's supposedly late father, and their recently discovered older brother. From that point forward, the twins embark upon an adventure in a war-torn country, with the sole purpose of unlocking the mystery left behind by their mother; a mystery providing a gateway to their homeland and origins.The magnificent prologue of the film speaks volumes, with a beautiful, seemingly serene hilly landscape tricking the audience into a false sense of security. The camera then slowly sweeps across a room full of young boys either with clippers shaving their heads to a military standard, or receiving terrifying looking arms. The camera pauses on one boy with piercing eyes, looking at us in a moving combination of fear, anger and resentment as his hair falls on his shoulders, rendering him bald and ready. In the background, Radiohead's 'You and Whose Army' hypnotises us, imprinting the powerful image in our memory ? one which will strongly be recalled later on in this film. This scene alone is worth sturdy artistic praise.Face down, naked and without a memorial is the burial instruction left behind by the apparently tortured Nawal, with a haunting quote noting that, "?childhood is a knife in the throat that you can't easily take off". The children realise that a gravestone can only be added when the puzzles of their mother's past are unlocked with the delivery of the letters within the cryptic will.Based on a play by Wajdi Mouawad,'Scorched' which I am not familiar with, but one could feel tell that the screenplay adaptation turned Mouawad's work into a respected and admired, multi award winning picture. The film garnered international attention, with twenty wins in total at various festivals, including an Oscar nomination for Best Foreign Language Film. 'Incendies' was also one of the most highly praised films screened during the second edition of the Doha Tribeca Film Festival (DTFF), encouraging further exploration into its appeal.Can war be poetic? With Villeneuve, this is possible. It is also romantic and ruthless, combining the most extreme of human emotions, leading to radical choices like the Christian Nawal's recruitment by Muslim militia. The poetic narrative exposes idyllic sceneries that the director focuses on often, revealing shortly after the truths of a raw, harsh and poignant reality. .From the moment Jeanne lands in the Middle East we are transported to stories from her mother's history. Although the country's name is fictional, the historical details fail to belie the nation in question is in fact Lebanon. Every location she visits is alternated with a parallel memory from her mother's past, featuring ferocious battles, both as just a woman and also as a political activist. As soon as Jeanne infiltrates her Nawal's hometown, she is exposed to the complex hatred that society continues to struggle with, even years after the war has ended. The villagers blatantly refuse Jeanne assistance upon discovering she is Nawal's daughter, without any mention of her mother treated like a taboo.While Simon is resisting his mother's enforced wishes, it is Jeanne who initially takes the solo initiative to seek closure. Throughout her adventures, we learn that this same, unfriendly village appears to be the basis of Nawal's struggles upon falling pregnant with a Palestinian man who was brutally murdered by her own brothers. Drowned in the shadow of disgrace by everybody in the village due to falling pregnant, Nawal delivers a boy who is taken away from her upon birth. With a tattoo marking his shin, Nawal had vowed to find her child at any cost, only to be driven out of the village for fear of persecution and even death. This is when she takes drastic decisions out of anger, resentment and fear, just like the boy at the opening of the film.The war is not just the context but explains ? regardless of one's political stance ? that there's more to what people choose to practice and preach than mere ideals. Nawal's decision to join the militia was primarily born out of despair and the injustices she suffered. In the style of a mythological Greek tragedy, the plot then cleverly reveals key information within every step the twins' detective efforts reaped. After years of absence, it becomes obvious to them that war had never really left all of their mother's past protagonists, but lived on and festered within them.Although the children had considered their mother as nothing more than a neurotic, unstable character, the journey they embark on honours what is in fact a valiant woman, also known as "the woman who sings". The past was too painful to be easily forgotten, and it seemed they had never really understood their mother.The film is picturesque, memorable in every scene, surprising, tense and mysterious in parts. Villeneuve portrays a vulnerable and curious vision from Nawal's viewpoint, one that is applicable to any person regardless of religion and political parties, but sharing the same circumstances. For someone who is unaware of the conflict of the Middle East, the narration carries no judgment as to innocence and guilt, or what may be considered right or wrong. As with war in general it is a personal perspective which highlights how one's worst enemy can also be a precious part of oneself.

		<shortDescription>Exquisitely and beautifully brutal via a very contrived plot.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is beautiful to view, but emotionally brutal in the end via its heavily contrived plot. There is a cinematic treasure here, to be invited innocently, first-hand, to view the ravages of a civil and religious war on an otherwise normal society - all played out within its stunning rugged countryside. We are walked through scene after scene with our central character guide to view the realities of war - how people suffer and learn to hate. This does not exclude the central character; even she responds to terrorism with a focused retaliative vengeance. But this is only the upper level of the story - the second level down is far, far darker: it is the Oedipus Legend on steroids. The analogy could be made that the central character, by turning to violent revenge as a way to compensate her loss, is instead herself revisited horrifically by her own decided actions. As a shadow horror, her offspring parallels and even exceeds this downward spiral track of malice. That what happens in this movie _could ever happen_ is truly a dramatic stretch, exceeding even the Greek myth makers. Therein, I had to balk.Furthermore - the loving - even transcendental deathbed reconciliation enounced by the main character, "To be together is everything..." seems, no matter how many times I try it out in my normally wildly idealistic mind, too idiotically simple to cover what travesties have befallen in this tale. Can we swallow a forgiveness more Christlike than Christ?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As two teenage siblings are making the funeral arrangements for their prematurely deceased mother, their faithful notary informs them of a very peculiar request that she has left to be completed before her burial. Her children are suddenly told that they have a brother and a father who are still living, and that they are to deliver a secret letter to each of them on her behalf. This situation is succinctly communicated in a very effective opening scene of exposition, and indeed the difficult search of these young adults to find their lost relatives remains the central focus throughout the entire film. A niggling weak point of many critically-acclaimed European films is a frustrating ambiguity in storytelling and a lack of a properly paced narrative, both of which seem to have a certain sadistic purpose about them, as if the intention is to make things as hard for the audience to follow as possible. However, the early firm grounding of plot present here assists greatly with the accessibility, and so is far less discriminative.The scenes making up the body of the piece proceed mostly with a masterful grace, coherence, intrigue and sophistication. The sister, Jeanne Marwan (Mélissa Désormeaux-Poulin) is by far the more willing of the two to carry out their mother's dying wishes ? her brother, Simon (Maxim Gaudette) merely responds with a moody male temper to the words in the will ? and so, at least initially, we follow Jeanne, being shown extended flashbacks of the events from her mother's past that she discovers. In these scenes, we see Mrs Nawal Marwan fighting endlessly to survive in a world fraught with terror and violence, being the horrific religious and political conflicts in the Middle East of the 1970s. The challenges she faces make this one of those remarkably engrossing and poignant stories of hope bravery and love that are cinematic gold.The final discoveries and revelations are again satisfyingly comprehensible, but definitely not for the faint-hearted viewer. Still, even if one finds the overall conclusion distastefully grotesque, there is still something to admire in the most apt direction from Denis Villeneuve and a splendid performance from Lubna Azabal as the mother. With a cast that also includes Rémy Girard, Allen Altman, Mohamed Majd and Abdelghafour Elaaziz, Incendies ("Scorched") may have the occasional patch of sluggishness and over-exaggeration, but you still owe it to yourself to see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A solid premise with a dreadful structure.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Incendies was a mixed bag, but I felt like it's negative aspects really bore down on it's positive ones. On the solid side of things, Denis Villeneuve has a real knack for storytelling and an eye for imagery that is truly gorgeous. Some of the shots here dug deep into my brain, be them haunting or beautiful, they managed to elicit a strong reaction from me.The premise of the story is quite an intriguing one -- upon their mother's death, two twins discovery their father is alive and they have a brother they never knew and then set upon a quest to reveal the truth, and in casting the leads I don't think they could have found more skilled actresses than Lubna Azabal and Melissa Desormeaux-Poulin for the job. These women are a rarity in modern cinema; strong and fierce, fully stood in their beliefs and decisions. It's powerful to see such strong women and the actresses portray them with just that level of gusto and perseverance that is required.Where it falls apart though is it's structure. Incendies is another of the many dozen films this year that employ a split-time narrative structure and it's yet another example of how to do it improperly. The sections (detailing the twins journey for the truth against the mother's past and her own journey) never feel like they mesh well and it ends up feeling like two completely separate films. At first it wasn't so bad, but as the film progressed the space between these two grew further and further apart.The last act is where it really derails, as in the present day there are huge discoveries made that we already knew so they lack the sense of emotional catharsis that the characters receive and in the past we see events that the characters already know about so it just becomes a retelling of things we are already aware of. The final act is this bizarrely awkward display of throwing everything at the audience in quick succession, so out of place from a film that had been slowly building up until that point. It felt as though they didn't want it to end up being three hours long so they threw together half a film's worth of information into half an hour. It ends up feeling very awkward and disjointed and completely lost me by the time the credits rolled.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Incendies' is the film that put director Denis Villeneuve on the map. Now, with 'Prisoners', 'Enemy', and 'Sicario' under his belt Villeneuve has become one the more eye catching directors working today. Just like his other films 'Incendies' strings together a cobweb like story. We watch as a pair of twins venture out to the middle east in search of their father and brother, as a final wish of their recently departed mother. Although the film is more about these twins finding out who their mother was. Naturally this not all that the film is about but, to avoid heavy spoilers and to keep this film as the experience it should be, I will leave it at that.And this film is an experience. Even though the film runs at a fairly long two hour and twenty minute run time, what 'Incendies' accomplishes in that time is remarkable. It is able to draw you in and hold your attention for its entire run time. Its story is unlike anything you will ever see. It's a slow burning thriller that hits every beat that you'd expect and every beat that you don't expect. And it does it in such a way that everything feels completely natural and progressive. The control that Villeneuve has over the film is insane. Every single person involved in front and behind of the camera does a superb job. Villeneuve knows what he wants out of the film and gets exactly that.It's a beautiful film that is able to manipulate its audience with utter ease. Its not just a beautifully constructed film but a beautiful film to look at too. It may not be Roger Deakins who shot 'Prisoners' and 'Sicario' but 'Incendies' seems to take note of this gritty realistic look. And it employs this same style here. And just like his other films 'Incendies' has an ending that will knock you flat. This ending would not be near as effective if where in anyone else's hands. It cuts between flashbacks and reality in such a way that keeps the film from becoming predictable. So, when the film concludes it comes as a complete shock. I could go on and on about how miraculous this film is. But I think I should just leave it here. If you have any desire at all to see this film please go out and purchase it. If you do, I assure you that 'Incendies' is a film that you will never forget. It's a beautifully constructed film with enough style to keep just about any body interested.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When you rate a movie with 10/10, it's usually really really difficult to find the words to describe it. This one was one of the most impactful movies I have ever seen. Can't stop thinking it since yesterday and I am sure I won't stop thinking it for a long time.First of all, the actors were all brilliant. All of them. The story was breathtaking and the slow evolution of the movie leading to the climax in the end, renders you speechless and motionless to say the least. I have to admit that although I assumed such an ending, I did not think it was plausible as the movie leaves out the element of time and kind of confused me. I could not make out the exact age of the lady who sings during the stages of the movie, so I was kind of like doing the math over and over again in the end to make sure I was not mistaken!Overall, a terrible story in its core, but one that shows how life can be in its extremes and how people can rise above such horrible events like war and its crimes and show the kind of attitude this woman showed through her letters. This is a movie that no one should miss!</fullReview>

Lubna Azabal, Mélissa Désormeaux-Poulin and Maxim Gaudette are stellar in it, believable and make you care about the characters and their story. André Turpin's amazing cinematography deserves special mention, those shots of the burning bus with Lubna in front are just spectacular. Brings back also my fond memories of the Middle East and as such strikes personally with me. A future classic of cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was super excited to see Incendies after watching Denis Villeneuve's latest film, Sicario, and I was not disappointed, despite how different both movies are. The plot is simple yet compelling. The way it's presented, with flashbacks to the mother's life and then switching back to Jeanne on her journey is a really cool way to do it. Although I got confused a few times at the beginning as to whether we were watching a flashback or not, I caught on very quickly. Sure, it's a little slow for the first bit, but as you get further and further in it gets a whole lot more interesting. The characters are pretty well-developed, with the audience knowing exactly what they're like from the get-go. There isn't a whole lot of depth to them, but there's enough to keep you interested. Incendies is, similarly to Sicario, brutal. Villeneuve does not hold back, which is something I admire about him. He's willing to show what other movies are unwilling to. It made the movie feel much more real, despite the fact that there were yellow subtitles across the bottom of the screen. Overall Incendies is nothing short of amazing. The plot is intriguing, the characters are solid, and it's brutality makes it much more immersive. To me one scene can make or break a movie, and this is a perfect example of when one scene made the movie. If your interested, then give it a watch, it's great. If you didn't like it, then that's really too bad. Your missing out on something great. I personally would highly recommend you check this out, it's well- worth your time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's disappointing that Incendies didn't get an Oscar because...Incendies is one of the very powerful movies I've watched so far. Probably the most powerful one, because I can't remember the last time a movie made me speechless...that 1+1 scene...OMGBest French Canadian movie in my opinion, even thou I only have watched 2 so far :P, I have no doubt Incendies will be the best French Canadian movie for me for years to come. It is a masterpiece.The story is about the twins that go to middle east to search their brother they never knew at their mother request. It is very fascinating how the truth is unfold one by one and I didn't expect that coming...the ending is very shocking one. Yes it is powerful masterpiece with amazing writing, but it is not flawless, I think there is a logical flaw or technical flaw (damn u make up artist &gt;,&lt;), but it is also something that make the audience from figuring the truth. Even with the flaw Incendies is still 10/10 movie for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't recall watching a movie in which I have wondered so much "My God, How must that feel like?" It is no surprise that it was nominated for the best foreign language movie at the Academy Awards, and shockingly did not win. Lubna Azabal gives an awesome performance and makes you actually believe the story of Nawal. Although her accent does not tie with the accents in Lebanon, Syria, Palestine or Jordan, her performance makes you forget this fact. The movie is not set in a certain country or region, making it more exciting for the viewer to look for clues inside the movie and trying to figure out where the story is set. Although the movie is more than 2 hours long, its characters, the acting, directing and story grab your attention until the shocking end. A heart racing, blood pumping breathtaking movie.

Either way, it certainly is a film worth talking about. An extraordinary film. I agree with the review concerning the violence ; it was handled very sensitively by Villeneuve. Beautifully filmed and splendid photography. Lasting impression is one of sadness for mankind with so much trauma for children and the silent suffering of Women within certain cultures.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Intriguing drama, nominated for the Best Foreign Language Film Oscar in 2012. Hard to get into at first, as it starts very slowly and without a clear direction. This can be quite off-putting, as it looks like it is going to just be 2 hours of drifting.However, from a point it becomes a very intriguing mystery. Plus, it becomes an exploration of religious intolerance and the effect of civil wars on the civilian population. No punches pulled, the war scenes are searing and graphic.The conclusion is quite incredible in terms of unexpected, perverse twists.Not perfect though. As already mentioned, the start is slow, and feels padded. More importantly, some parts of the plot, especially towards the end, seem a bit forced and contrived. Not 100% plausible, ultimately.Still, a great movie. The intrigue just builds and builds.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Long but enormously worth it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd best begin with an admission. Usually, I only come to post a review on IMDb for what turned out to be the lousy films I paid hard-earned cash to see. I do this in the vain hope that others who also work for their money do not waste it on trashy flicks of which, as we cinema heads know, there are far too many. This time, though, I am here to praise a movie. This, believe me, is a first for me on IMDb. The plot and characters of 'Incendies' have been discussed elsewhere by those who have reviewed this movie long before I saw it. So, I won't bore you with repeating all that. My intention is different. You see, I am a European expat who has lived and worked in the part of the word this movie is set in for many, many years. I remember very well the horror of seeing bombed out buildings, the dead everywhere, militia on street corners, gangs running amok on shooting sprees. The fear in the eyes of those in blind panic as they faced the dilemma of trying to get to the shop to buy food for their hungry children without being shot by a sniper's bullet. Now, not for one moment am I suggesting that I ever experienced anything approaching the losses and utter misery of local people. I did not. Rather, what I am saying is that this film is so wholly accurate in depicting the arbitrary nature with which torture, immeasurable pain, and death descend that it left me quite emotional (and, believe me, I'm a tough old so-and so who has seen some real messes from war around the world.) This film is so exquisitely made and so well acted that it has the power to grip from the very first moment as it leads us, oh-so-carefully but painfully, toward the only conclusion available in a world so desperate and lost. It is, quite simply, stunning from beginning to end.I can give it no higher praise than to say it is required viewing for every adult. Please take the time to watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me first say that I enjoyed this film overall. The surrealistic screenplay and photography wholly contributed to the mysterious nature of the story. It is a film the audience won't soon forget after viewing and leaves a lasting impression on the mind. No doubt it will be represented at the Oscars.However, this is not a movie for everyone. I admit my tastes fall into the political/action/thriller genre, but I do enjoy a bit of drama or mystery every now and then. That said, I was honestly a bit bored for the first forty minutes. If you are the least bit squeamish, or can't cope with the idea of years and years of torture and rape, or children being graphically shot and families massacred...then simply prepare yourself by reading the Parental Advisory or just avoid this movie altogether. I personally have a rough time with torturing women and lengthy imprisonment (can you imagine being locked in a room for decades, raped and tortured on a daily basis?). If you don't have a problem with that then go right ahead.Nutshell: This is a movie you will be glad you watched but will probably only watch once. Solid 7.5/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Incendies ("Scorched") is a dark, powerful and haunting thriller-drama from Canadian director Denis Villeneuve. I will leave the plot line out for the benefit of the audience. The film is in French/Arabic, so English viewers will have to go by the sub-titles.The film shares it's secrets in layers - when you've watched one layer and think you've seen it all, you're presented with another that is far more complex and visceral than the previous one and so on and so forth until the film explodes in a shattering climax that will leave you reeling. I remember being stunned as the credits rolled and have never recovered. I decided to own the DVD because I haven't watched such a great thriller in years.The direction and cinematography is a work of art. The acting is excellent and Lubna Azabal is phenomenal. Finally, this film is not for everyone but if you're an open minded movie lover who doesn't mind being taken on a new journey, then Incendies is a ride you will never forget.Thank you Denis for making this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One achievement of this excellent film is that it makes you think about war. It makes you think that many people who migrate to the West have complicated personal stories that influence their lives today. And that what we see on the TV news is a woefully inadequate representation of the actual human impact of war. The intelligent woman at the centre of the film had the bad luck to have been born into a brutal, inhuman time in history, even into a brutal family, and she tries her best to survive. You've got to empathise with her. The film has many twists and turns in its plot, and even as I left the cinema I wasn't sure I'd understood which side she was on at a particular time and why she responded as she did. It made me want to know more about Lebanese history. It's a beautifully made film and well recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just Short of Perfect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Were it not for the fact that the plot is tied in too neat a bow at the very end, "Incendies" would be a perfect movie. Told in both the present and the past, the film traces the efforts of twins, Jeanne (Melissa Desormeaux-Poulin) and Simon (Maxim Gaudette) to carry out the wish of their dead mother (Lubna Araval) to find and deliver letters to their father and lost brother. The twins go to Lebanon -- Jeanne with conviction, Simon reluctantly. They don't quite know where to begin. The brother, their mother's illegitimate son, was sent to an orphanage. That much is quickly established. But from there on, the film follows the search and also plays back the events in the Lebanese Civil War which separated their mother from her child and from the father or the twins. Once the search was fully under way, this viewer was initially bit confused as to which parts were present and which parts were past because Ms. Desormeaux-Poulin looks at times much like Ms. Araval, so I didn't always know whether I was witnessing the search by the daughter or the war time travails of the mother. It's a minor problem because, soon enough, the two elements -- the search and the war -- diverge and the context identifies daughter and mother. The two women each handle their roles superbly. Simon is a necessary player but M. Gaudette is no more than adequate in the role, which is, in any event, subsidiary to that of mother and daughter.I won't reveal the ending. However, the war time scenes are depicted with convincing brutality, and the indifference to suffering that characterized the Lebanese Civil War is as appalling on film as it might have been if one had actually been there when it happened. In addition, the cameras are focused on the bleak landscape outside the villages and towns, which adds to the sense that this is as close to real life as it is possible to get.As suggested in the beginning of this review, I found the ending too pat and much too convenient, but it is certainly dramatic -- and others may find it more convincing than I did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rarely have I been so disappointed by a movie as I have been by 'Incendies'. I've been a member of IMDb for 12 years and most of the time the ratings on here kind of show me whether a movie is good or bad. Not so with 'Incendies'. It is rated 8,3 and is in the top 250, I can not see why that would be so. There is absolutely no depth to any character, no motivation, no background. The problems in some unknown unspecified middle east country are black and white. The only reason why you would make it so is that you do not want to do any research to make the situation believable. But the nail in the coffin was the unbelievable (literally) story. How did the writer get away with such a plot? At least when you read Sophocles you know there is much more to it than just the plot. This was embarrassing, all the more because it is in the top 250.Maybe people don't know what a good movie is anymore, there aren't many made nowadays that make it to most movie theaters. But go to the library people, or some online service. Many great movies have been made with fantastic plot and real characters, with scripts that have been written by adults.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worthy Oscar nomination</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Canadian production that made it to the Oscar short list for foreign language category (French, for this particular one) has been widely acclaimed in film reviews in the two largest Canadian cities. It has been described in various ways as family drama, detective thriller and war atrocities. One mention that nobody omits is "Greek tragedy". To those who have some familiarity with this term, the mere mention may well be a spoiler, albeit perhaps not a completely conspicuous one. One, at least, compares this movie to Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's works ("Amores perros", "21 grams", "Babel") which I think is carrying it too far. A much more appropriate comparison is "Possession".Like "Possession", this movie is structured along two time lines. In the present, a pair of grown-up twins tries to track down the past history of their recently deceased mother by journeying to a Middle East country (unspecified but quite obviously modelled after Lebanon). Running parallel is what happened two decades ago, revealing gradually the atrocities the mother had endured. Geographically, the two parallel narrations track the same itinerary. This is exactly the structure of "Possession" although in the latter, the time gap is a few centuries and the protagonists in the two sequences are not blood-related.The plot is not complicated so I won't even go any further into details other than stating that the whole thing is started by a somewhat strange will of the mother. While the detective-suspense pull is indisputable, it would be going too far to call it a thriller. One thing to remember is that the original material is a stage play. While the movie makers have done a great job in translating stage experience into cinematic experience, the essence of the movie is still its thought-provoking quality. Here, different people may tune in to different aspects. Some would react strongly to the aforementioned Greek Tragedy element, through the deep anguish of the mother. Others, taking a more contemporary angle, see the abhorrence of war, twisting and warping human nature.Having said that, I must compliment the movie makers on the arresting cinematic visual accomplishment in the movie. The desolate nature of some of the Jordanian (the filming location) landscape helps, but there is more. One frame that particularly registers is a burning bus (terrorists' doing) which is placed towards the left a little back at medium distance. The ominously dark column of smoke seems to have taken on a life of its own, a hideous, menacing serpent advancing to the front right of the screen. With compositions like this, who needs pathetically useless and senseless 3D. In the audio department, Radiohead's music has been deftly integrated into the heart-wrenching context of the movie.The performance of Belgian actress Lubna Azabal as the mother in this movie has been so widely acclaimed that there is really nothing more that anybody can add. One critic offers "intensely soulful", a good summing up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Incendies" is a movie I really wanted to like. It's refreshing on several levels, featuring pleasantly strange locales (Quebec and Lebanon). It has a good sense of pace, and covers hitherto unseen moments in modern history with a good eye for detail.Still, I was tempted to give this movie the lowest score possible. Primarily for butchering its own story towards the end, going for the type of plot that only amateur screenwriters fall for: exciting on paper but hopelessly shallow in practice. (Go see it for yourself - it's so contrived it completely undermines the realistic feel the director has fought so hard to establish.) Furthermore, I'm sick of movies that create "drama" by graphically depicting violence against children. We get that mid-80s Lebanon was a hell hole, Denis. Refrain from using the sledgehammer unless your story absolutely needs it; it will make your movie more intelligent, too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A slow, but good film of family secrets</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Incendies (Babelfish tells me this means Fires) is good, but a bit formulaic. It aims very high, but I think it falls short of what it could have achieved. I think it spends too much effort on atmosphere and not enough on plot. Maybe tighter editing was needed. Still, I was impressed, and it's undoubtedly one of the better Canadian films, improving on Polytechnique.Early on, there is the reading of a will, and twins are left with the tasks of locating their unknown father and brother.This takes them to ... somewhere in Palestine, which I took to be within Israel. Other reviews have noted this is supposed to be Lebanon, but looks like Jordan. I have no idea. People familiar with the history of the area seem to think that certain facts of the film mean it could not have been in any particular country in the Mid-East, because the places and dates make it impossible. But because the film never claims to be a true story (or I never saw such a claim) I'll forgive it. Still, it would have been more satisfying if it could have been set in a real place and time.From there, the film follows an almost mathematical formula, which itself is an enjoyable mini-theme of the film. One part of the math was ruined by the English subtitles. Euler's (ridiculous) quote actually was "... (a+b^n)/n=x, hence God exists ...", which I think was presented on screen as "... ©, hence God exists...". I can't tell which version is closer to what was spoken by the character, but I doubt the word "copyright" was used. The original quote strikes me as typical of the obfuscation and confusion used to con people into accepting various beliefs. It's nice to see that referenced in this film, particularly given what happens. It's a rare, believable, and complex representation of all-too-common religious violence.I found the film painfully slow at times. While this did serve to accentuate certain scenes which were very effective as a result, halfway through the film I wasn't sure I wanted to watch the rest of it. If I had been at home, I may have turned it off, and I would have missed a good film.I was impressed by the acting, which is to say that I didn't notice it at all. I believed the characters completely. Also, I found the use of sound helped to draw the audience into the story. The silence is silent. Noise is noisy, but in a real way, not Hollywood.I will only half-spoil the ending. For those who don't guess it, they do tell you what's coming, just before it happens. I'll hint at it here, so consider yourself warned.There is a particular question raised by one character, regarding what "1+1" equals. This can legitimately be interpreted (in electronics) as an inclusive disjunction rather than addition, giving a correct answer that is not 2. Some might see this as a trick, but I think the film is emphasizing that we should be careful about our assumptions and interpretations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Denis Villeneuve's mystery unfolds within the horror of civil war</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Incendies" (meaning "Scorched" in English) is a Canadian mystery-drama and is as intense as any film I've seen. The story begins as brother and sister twins are read their mother's last will, a disjointed, delirious and despairing appeal that they travel to the Middle East to uncover the dark secret of their family history as a condition of fulfilling her last wishes. We're never told exactly WHERE the mystery story which unravels as Nawal's life takes place; at least no specific countries are named: all military raiment, weapons and vehicles are either generic or anonymous (best as I remember, even the university is simply "The University"). On the other hand, the bus massacre is conducted by AK-47 wielding "Christian rightists" (the Phalange, if we assume a Lebanese parallel), the off-camera destruction of the orphanage at Kfar Khout was committed by "nationalists" (movie code for Lebanese Arab Nationalists) while Nawal's son was "mercifully rescued" by the Muslim warlord Chamseddine.OK, we get it. Even without naming a specific country or political cause, there's little doubt who's the off-camera bad guy whose regional presence provokes the conflict that is the movie's backdrop. But this is a movie review, not an exegesis on geopolitical policy or regional prejudices. Just be aware that a socio-political narrative exists, and accept that the film assumes secondary evils emerge from a primary source ... without directly saying so. The adult twins' quest quickly becomes a passionate and exhausting peregrination into the cycle of violence too often dismissed as endemic in the Middle East. Our persistence for staying with Incendies through to the climax is rewarded with the revelation that the incestuous consequence of personalizing anonymous violence to become internalized and incarnated into retributive action is the birth of an even greater and more loathsome lusus naturae: when we incubate malevolence and evil we risk becoming the wellspring of the evil confounding us.Although described as a masterpiece by some critics I have no desire to see Incendies again nor can I think of a good reason to recommend Incendies to casual viewers ... not because of excessive gore, gratuitous violence or sensationalized sexual content (Incendies is probably modest in this regard, given the film's setting) or because Incendies is a bad film, but because Incendies so effectively immerses its audience into the emotional horror and wretchedness of despair without extending a commensurate glimpse of either redemption or restoration.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The 2010 Canadian mystery drama film written and directed by Denis Villeneuve is excellent.The mix of fiction and realism is the most striking feature about this film. Constant flashbacks take you back in time to the mother's point of view (played extraordinary by Lubna Azabal). Her twins, played by Mélissa Désormeaux-Poulin and Maxim Gaudette have a beautiful arrange of emotions set trough the entire film. Especially Poulin's scenes are a striking sign of talent. Grégoire Hetzel composed a intense soundtrack for the tense scenes. Very minimalistic scenes.Most of all, I want to applaud André Turpin for the film's cinematography. The scene with the bus on fire was a visual masterpiece. The color palette mostly contains a lot of greys and blacks which are also coherent to the mood and atmosphere.The politics weren't biased and that's what makes the story. Great twist at the end, too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This kind of movies are not needed to be discussed too much. Instead I would recommend you to watch the movie.If you watch this film whose content and focus are risky to be too much political, which I think dangerous sometimes because while watching an interesting politic story or similar sort you without intention got yourself focused on the "issue" not the art and cinema, and your brain use the movie as a weapon against the thoughts you are already against. But movies are not weapons. I always believe cinema must be a very useful short path to criticize, feel, live as you are in the action and it is valuable, more importantly it is immortal. This movie does not exploit your politic ideas or sensation. The script uses a good story of a woman who's been tortured for years without giving up her strength and energy she instills and shows us how can an idea may feed the bond between your soul and life or love. Another aspect of the story is that her ability of standing up against the torture was not some kind of skill that she trained. This is the energy whose source is love. And the idea derived from love. In this work I think camera seems cool, creative ideas, sounds and cleverly prepared actions are what you can expect. It always can be better. Acting in this movie had the chance to be better. More colors could be added. However this is not a negative comment. In this form they did a very good job. It is a manner of choice. I think the director chose that way. As a result and short expression: if you want to hear about an extraordinary and shocking story which occurred in North Africa watch this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliantly directed portrayal of life in times of chaos marred by a flashy climax !!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Incendies' is a film directed by Denis Villeneuve and it is adapted from Wajdi Mouawad's play of the same name with the screenplay co- written by Villeneuve and Valérie Beaugrand-Champagne. The film's plot has an epic-feel to it because the film takes place over a lengthy spell of time covering a large number of years. The film stars Lubna Azabal as Nawal Marwan and Mélissa Désormeaux-Poulin and Maxim Gaudette as Nawal's twin children Jeanne and Simon respectively. After Nawal's death, Jeanne and Simon get informed that their mother had left two letters one for each of them respectively. They learn that their father is alive and they have a brother whose existence they were unaware of. Jeanne is supposed to deliver her letter to the father, while Simon is supposed to deliver his letter to their brother. This mission takes both of them individually to an unnamed Middle-Eastern country as they try to piece together clues to gather more and more information about their mother's past.This is a film that becomes very tough to watch at times. Villeneuve really goes for a gritty, stripped down depiction of what it is like to survive in a country divided by hate and experiencing civil war. The film is brilliantly directed and Villeneuve's brutal guerrilla style of shooting reminded me Alfonso Cuarón's style in 'Children of Men'. The themes of the film range from the absurdity of hatred borne out of religious diversity to elements of immigration. It shows the sorry state of the lives of children in countries and regions devastated by war. Their lives pretty much end before they even begin. The film also underlines the concept of showing people living is financially well off countries, the privilege that they sometimes forget to acknowledge. The acting is brilliant from the main players, but a special mention has to be given to Lubna Azabal. A fair portion of the narrative of the film rests on her shoulders. The screenplay is cleverly written. The film doesn't give you all the information all at once. The expositions happen gradually. The narrative shifts from mother to daughter constantly in a very Godfather II-esque manner.I would have probably given this film a 9, had it not been for the ending. The shocking revelation at the end is genuinely unexpected and has an impact while you're watching the film. But once you start to think about it, it becomes very difficult to buy it. To some extent it might be meaningful from a thematic standpoint, but in a film directed in such an aggressively realistic manner, even symbolism has to have some literal believability in the context of the plot.'Incendies' is a well directed, well acted film about war, hatred, intolerance and the hardships of living in ultra-conservative and unstable societies. The film will have an impact and make you ponder about life itself. But the ending of the film in my eyes hinders it from making the transition from good to great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>epic Greek tragedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Twins Simon and Jeanne Marwan are given instructions at the reading of their mother's Will. They are to deliver letters to their father and a brother they know nothing about. Simon dismisses their mother's weird wishes but Jeanne decides to discover the truth. In Lebanon, their Christian mother Nawal Marwan had an affair with Arab Wahab. Her family killed Wahab. Her grandma saved the pregnant Nawal. The baby was given to a mysterious woman. Narwal would go off to look for him.Director Denis Villeneuve delivers some compelling images. It's a dark murky tale of religion and family set in the middle of a sectarian war. There is a point in the middle where the story double down and make this a true Greek Tragedy. I have a small problem with the dying nurse telling the twins about the babies born in prison. They should be able to figure that part out by themselves. The last half is stretched out a bit. By the midway point, I wish the movie picks up the pace to get to the big reveal. Nevertheless, this is a brilliant tragedy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Simon (Maxim Guadette) and Jeanne's (Melissa Desormeaux-Poulin) mother, Nawal (Lubna Azabal) has just died. Their mother's last wishes are to go and find their long lost brother and, previously thought dead, father. This prompts them to journey to the Middle East where they learn the secrets of their mother's dark and mysterious past. And it is dark. Incendies hits you with gut punch after gut punch. Each blow is another lesson learned about Nawal's past. A war torn region of the Middle East is most of where the flash back takes place. Nawal, like most people, is hurt in more ways then one. The narrative structure starts with segments in modern day and then flashes back to scenes with Nawal during wartime. Initially the structure is a bit jarring but eventually the viewer will get the hang of it. The standout part of this film is the acting. Lubna Azabak as Nawal is especially great. It's a powerful performance that is truly heartbreaking in every sense. Maxim Gaudette and Melissa Desormeaux-Poulin both did a stand-up job as well. Canadian director, Denis Villeneuve has slowly grown into one of my favorites. Every film he has progressively impressed me with each of his films. I'm happy to say Incendies is far and away his best. I don't want to go too in depth with this review because I think it's genuinely best to go into this with as little information as possible. Take my word for it, Incendies is one of the most breathtaking films I've ever had the pleasure of seeing. It deserves to be talked about in the same vein as There Will Be Blood, The Prestige, Zodiac, and Whiplash, all of which are some of the very best of the 21st century. I implore you, go and see Incendies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was absolutely blown away by this film. It's one of those movies that sticks with you awhile after watching. I cant get this film out of my head. Not only is a beautiful looking film, the story is told in a beautiful way. Sure, it's a story that takes place during some of the middle east conflicts, but that's not what you will remember from Incendies. You will remember the characters and the relationships or lack of relationships that each of them have. Denis Villenueve gave us yet another masterpiece here.The film deals with twins who are looking over their mother's will when they find she has given them each a mission before they are allowed to bury her. The mission is to find their brother, who they didn't know existed, and their father, who they assumed was dead. It's such a unique and interesting premise. Definitely one that keeps you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end. But what's great about Incendies and Villenueve's directing is that it doesn't rely on actual suspense like scenes to make you feel suspenseful. In other words, the film can be shocking but it doesn't rely on big shootouts or real life dangerous scenes. I just loved that the film was able to pull off vulnerability without cheapening the shock value. The film is told through two parallel stories. The mother, Nawal, in her younger days traveling through the middle east going from jail to jail. And her kids, looking for the brother and father through various people who knew Nawal back in the day. The first half of the film when the mother and daughter are both going on their journeys I felt was more interesting than the brother's arc, but they all turned out to be valuable in the end.I loved the subtle emotional acting that the children gave. Often, Villenueve would keep the camera on their faces for a long period of time while they hear something life changing. It proved to be a great technique in creating more emotion than the scene would have otherwise called for. Of course, this film is known to be shocking and have loads of twists and turns, but I never felt the film reached for too much shock value. Every twist seemed possible and something that actually could happen. And it's a tribute to the lead actors that they were able to ground the film in reality enough to never take me out of it. Incendies is one of those films that I put off seeing for awhile because I didn't think the story interested me enough, but I'm now jealous of anyone who hasn't seen it and will be able to experience it for the first time. It's a film that is both devastatingly beautiful and beautifully devastating. I absolutely loved this film.+Lead performances +Shocking twists and turns +Villenueve's directing style +Edge of your seat drama +Parallel storytelling 9.4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incendies : She was a woman full of sorrow and acute pain</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Incendies" has a familiar plot used in many mystery fictions. The odd instructions are delivered to the characters with no explanation. The journey begins eventually, and the mystery is peeled away step by step. While following their path, we begin to sense that there will be the unexpected answer at the end of journey. Shortly after the death of their mother Nawal(Lubna Azabal), twin brother and sister, Jeanne(Mélissa Désormeaux-Poulin) and Simon(Maxim Gaudettte), meet the notary Lebel(Rémy Girard), for whom Nawal has worked as his secretary for about 20 years. The request in her will surprises her children with her hidden past. Before dying in the hospital after suddenly fallen into some catatonic state, she left two letters. The one is for the twin's father; Jeanne is instructed to find him and deliver it to him. The other one is for the twin's hidden brother; Simon is instructed to do the same thing like her sister. Until their missions are accomplished, Nawal's body will remain buried without coffin or tombstone.Jeanne and Simon are confounded by this revelation. While living a new life with them in Canada for a long time, Nawal seldom mentioned about her past to them(the twins thought their father was dead during the war in their mother's homeland). Angry and confused for this, Simon refuses the request. In contrast, although she has been distant from her mother for a while, Jeanne decides to go to her mother's homeland to find their father after advised by her adviser professor in her graduate school not to ignore this matter.The movie goes back and forth between Jeanne's journey and Nawal's long, hurtful journey. When she was young, Nawal fell in love with a Muslim guy, and she got pregnant by him. Her Christian family certainly did not approve of that; after their failed attempt to run away, her lover was shot by her brothers for the family's honor, and she had to leave behind her baby right after she bore him. Before separated from him, she promised to him she would find him again.However, several years later, when she studied in the university, the sectarian conflict between Christians and Muslims got more intensified, and her hometown became a war zone. None the less, Nawal was determined to find her son for keeping her promise. Though well aware of the dangers, she went back to her hometown, and that was the start of a long ordeal she had to struggle through ? it was impossible for her to stay in the middle in this conflict.There are several striking moments to depict the horrors of war in the film. The director Denis Villeneuve, whose screenplay based on the acclaimed play by Wajdi Mouawad, handles the brutality in his movie with restraint and conciseness, as shown in the gut-wrenching scene where Nawal is forced to save herself in a shameful way from sudden brutal mass killing by a militia group. In the opening sequence crucial in the story, Radiohead's "You and Whose Army?" is effectively used in the soundtrack against what is shown on the screen, and this memorable moment is chillingly connected to the scene where the boys are attacked by a sniper not so older than them.Villeneuve deftly moves the story between the past and present. Compared to the violent past, Nawal's homeland at present is relatively peaceful, but there is still the conflict, and there are still the shadows of the past which people do not like to talk about. Nawal's family members do not forget what she did even after so many years have passed. When Jeanne meets the former prison guard who knew her mother as prisoner, he is very reluctant to tell her what happened to her mother, while emphasizing that he has been a school janitor.Later in the story, Simon finally joins her sister with Lebel. Their search is continued, and, in the end, there is the shocking truth waiting for them. Of course, I will not tell you what it is, but I have to say this; I already guessed what would be revealed based on some storytelling logics, but it was really devastating to see how the movie silently reveals that horrible secret to the characters with the emotionally shattering effect.By the way, while watching the last scene, I wondered about the plausibility of the story because I was a little bothered by some small calculation based on the one tiny detail shown in that scene(Maybe I was wrong about that, but I cannot go into the details due to spoiler problems). In addition, the story relies on the coincidences a little too much. For instance, Jeanne and Simon's journey could be aborted with the dead end by any chance. Come to think of it, it is very lucky that there are enough surviving people and documents to lead them to the arriving point. I know it would have been really hard for Nawal to tell the truth, but could she just leave one letter to her children for explaining everything?Nevertheless, the story works well on the emotional level with the haunting performance by Lubna Azabal, who is convincing both as Young Nawal and Old Nawal. Mélissa Désormeaux-Poulin and Maxim Gaudettte are also good as the other half of the story, and Remy Girard gives an interesting performance as a kind, courteous man with the strong professional ethics he firmly sticks to.Nawal can be described as a woman full of this complex feeling. Her heart was burned by so many pains and sorrows in her past - and her fate was as cruel to her as the Greek tragedy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film tells the story of a young woman and her twin brother who go to Lebanon in search for their mother's past, as instructed by the mother's will. They discover one heartbreaking fact after another, shaking the ultimate core of her and her brother's existence.Just like the twins, I was unprepared for the shocking emotional roller coaster that unfolds gradually. Just when I thought it could not be worse, things turn for the worse. It's a very sad film, but somehow there's still hope, love and forgiveness in the air. The ending is very profoundly powerful, it leaves me paralysed in thoughts, entranced in emotions. "Incendies" is a must watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not enough stars available - pure masterpiece!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the midst of my Villeneuve-exploration this film hit me like no other in the past decade. It took me about 10 minutes after watching it to be able to do anything (eventually I had a smoke). Everything that composes a film, editing, camera work, acting, all the choices for narrative, converge most perfectly, emerging as the most complete whole I have seen on the screen in a long time, at once hauntingly beautiful and quietly earth-shattering. And, as it always seems to go with Villeneuve, there's not a single superfluous grain. There's no lingering, no exploiting of cruelty (each aspect and scene of the sort is thus also presented in the most tactful way), the soundtrack as well is reduced to what is necessary, to much greater effect. The camera is closely kept on the protagonists (without exception every performance is excellent), wider shots are reserved to set the stage. War is seen through the eye of the intimate in a fact-finding odyssey into the past. Virtuous also the division of these time-lines without ever confusing, and never l'art pour l'art, but an essential story-tool. The story itself is in the end the main character. It still hasn't left me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are always some movies that you will see and remember it for the rest of life. I can assure you INCENDIES is one of that kind of movie.This movie started with very dramatic situation and some of you mayfeel boring. But after a while you will hook up with this movie and keep going. At the beginning, you might find some characters are really suffering through the movie. And at the end the person will suffer most would be definitely you. I always hate war thought I know the cruelty of war. After seeing this movie i really understand what is cruelty.Thank god it is just a movie not a real life story. Otherwise, i would think how could kind GOD can Punish someone so badly!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Involving Psychological Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is widely considered one of the best films that came out in 2010, and rightfully deserves this acclaim. The story starts pretty simple: two brothers needs to enter in a quest on the birth-land of their deceased mother in order to follow her last wish: to find and give two letters for their 'lost' son. It sounds very simple and generic, but while the story is advancing the film really starts to involve you into Nawal's story, that is told in flashbacks. So i don't need to say that the development of the characters is very good.As i was saying, her life is told by flashbacks. The editing don't makes very clear in the beginning of the film what was happening at all, but soon we start to get a notion of which story is Nawal's story and then, as i also already said, gt involved by the story. And while we follow Nawal's story, we are also following a world of pure horror and cruelty, which may upset some viewers, but again, some of these cruelties depicted are essential to our understand of the story, and also to establish a compromise with the viewer.This film is not for everyone though, it has some blatantly critics to the Christianity's followers, so be aware of that fact before watching the film if you are one of these persons that become easily offended by that kind of stuff. Just a warning.The cinematography in this film is very beautiful at times, it is totally done using only digital cameras. I also liked the homage to the French New Wave's films, whose directors used lots of cuts of a same scene but in different angles in the only purpose of mock the 'Hollywood Blockbusters' kind of cinematography.And i also find the music score to be very interesting.Anyways, it's a must watch film. And the so-called ending wasn't so powerful to me, but that's just me. I have already watched a couple films with similar powerful ending, so this one wasn't that much of a 'shock' for me.. 8.4/10Although, is far from being perfect. It has a few events that are just forced upon the viewer, and that is not cool.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A mesmerizing, beautifully crafted movie that creates an almost tangible emotional attachment. It's so captivating and so realistic it becomes emotionally exhausting at certain points throughout the movie. You will be gripping your seat in disbelief or bewilderment at the shocking events that happen on screen and you'll do it not because of huge explosions or amazing action sequences, but because the movie makes you genuinely care about the characters and their fates. Although everything about the film is quite well done - acting, cinematography, music - it's the cleverly crafted plot and the way it's delivered that takes the cake. I really don't want to reveal any details about it though, suffice it to say that it's an amazing work of art that will leave you anything but indifferent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful. Intense. Unflinching. Devastating. Haunting.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Powerfully haunting, brutally unflinching &amp; emotionally devastating, Incendies is that slow poison whose real potency is realised only when it's too late &amp; the irrevocable damage to your psyche is already done. Absolutely unforgettable once you've seen it, Incendies isn't just the best feature that director Denis Villeneuve has made so far but is also the finest to come out from Canada.Opening with Radiohead's single, "You and Whose Army?", the story of Incendies is told in two different timelines which later converges into one to deliver a huge jolt of shock. One storyline follows twins Jeanne &amp; Simon who journey to the Middle-East in order to fulfil their mother's final wish which is stated in her will, while the other timeline follows their mother's life &amp; is told in flashbacks.Directed by Denis Villeneuve, whose other works include Polytechnique, Prisoners &amp; Enemy, Incendies presents the filmmaker in prime form &amp; even though the film is slightly overlong, it somehow manages to keep us invested into its story long enough until its final revelation, which is strong &amp; shocking enough to shake the very foundations of human relationships.Set pieces provide a very raw &amp; authentic atmosphere to the whole feature, cinematography brings a gritty layer of its own &amp; captures the events in fine detail, editing could've provided a better pace by trimming down a few lingering moments, performances are very convincing, and the score is brilliantly composed plus Radiohead's single seamlessly fits its narrative.On an overall scale, Incendies is a beautifully crafted, nicely written &amp; strongly performed cinema about love, hate &amp; wars which delivers such a disturbing, distressing &amp; traumatic cinematic experience that it will leave an indelible scar of its own on the viewers' psyche &amp; is a haunting masterpiece in every sense of the word. Definitely amongst world cinema's finest films of the decade, Incendies comes strongly recommended.</fullReview>

Very powerful drama, one of the best ever. Just watch it !! I watch it months ago and I'm still under impression. The story is about love, hate, war, forgiveness . Brother and sister are looking for their roots - father they didn't know and surprising cognition: another brother. Their mother left them with a big bag full of shocking secrets. Very shocking secrets. 1+1 is not always 2. I could not imagine someone living with such a weight on shoulder. I strongly recommend this movie to everyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Emotionally Exhausting Experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Incendies belongs to that rare breed of films that induce a tumultuous surge of emotions in its spectators while engaging them through the narrative. Jerry Seinfeld once said in his show Seinfeld, to add to the humor of that show undoubtedly, that Leo Tolstoy wanted to name his novel 'War: What Is It Good For' instead of "War and Peace". Maybe that rhetorical question of a book title would have been an apt tagline for what was portrayed in this film.What sets Dennis Villeneuve's 'Incendies' apart from other films with post-war trauma as their underlying theme, is the spectrum of human relationship he constructed on the screen. The film starts with twin brother and sister, Jeanne and Simon, receiving their recently deceased mother, Nawal's funeral wishes; wishes that need to be fulfilled, before the children can proceed with the burial. In two different letters, the twins were asked to locate their father and half-brother, who we would later find was called Nihad. With initial reluctance and refusal from her foreboding brother, Jeanne finally set upon the journey that would uncover the truth through several different realisations, taking the audience with it.In Incendies, Villeneuve never loses the grip that he gets to hold from the very first few minutes. The narrative had the mother and daughter tracing the same path in a Middle-Eastern country, only with different perspectives and scenarios. The civil war, that was shown here to have its inflictions on the protagonists, can be compared with the Lebanese Civil War. The places that had horrific memories for the mother are visited by the daughter. Thus, blending the two timelines in the narrative, a sense of déj? vu is channeled in the film. At one point, viewers along with Jeanne would be forced to ponder whether being oblivious to the truth was a blessing or not.If the screenplay is the heart of the film, then the oxygen was provided by the cast to keep it pumping. Lubina Azabal's Nawal Marwan is tremendous feat in acting. It was important for her performance to be in accordance with the story, with she being the protagonist in this tempestuous journey of a film. Mélissa Désormeaux-Poulin as Jeanne, was not far behind either. Apart from these stand-out performances, the film is bolstered with performances from the rest of the cast akin to that of a neo-realist film.Incendies is as intense and brutal as one can get. Nothing hits harder than the truth that comes out of nowhere and you do not want to hear. Incendies is quite an achievement at that. It becomes incessantly difficult to revisit the first scene where Nihad, a child, would leave you with self-judgment and introspection. Radiohead's "You and Whose Army" adds to the cause.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely fantastic! One step away from being a true masterpiece!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Note: I don't know how true this story is, I am only judging it as a movie. I think this movie is one of the best pure drama movies I have ever seen.Acting: Top Notch all around, extra shout out for Mélissa Désormeaux- Poulin whom I thought was totally brilliant, so much so that I won't remember her real name in a few hours. Characters: Well this is a drama so there isn't much variation but there is something to be said for realism. On paper the twins seem to go through a deeply involving emotional journey even though they come to terms with it relatively quickly its still well done. The beginning was relatively slow and we don't really seem to understand Jeanne very well, there is some sort of brilliant but subtle hinting with math(Euler's identity seems to be metaphorical) but its insufficient to understand the characters, only in hindsight, though this is excusable with Jeanne as she seems to be introvert. A little more on the relationship of the twins would have also been nice, as far as I am concerned they didn't need to be two different characters. Plot: Since the movie was rather realistic its just a little bit disengaging if you take the discovery process of their mothers future to be so conveniently laid out in a progressive manner so at to leave the big shock for the end. This is the main reason I give this movie a 9 and not a 10, I believe some more thought on the timeline elements would have made this movie a true work of art. Directing: Great and crispy camera work with some very good shots. At times the character moves about too fast, such as the orphanage, the scene were she visits the ravaged orphanage is a bit too quick and a little more camera work to help the viewer understand the extent of the war/hate would have been better. random twist comparison: I keep drifting to Old Boy and trying to compare the use of the the same plot twist. I think its more excusable to reveal it in the end of Old boy because the plot causes the twist and the information about the twist is centrally controlled by the villain. Conclusion: Great movie, probably not for the soft of heart though I don't find it particularly graphic but conceptually it can affect some people. Probably a good movie for starting controversial conversation topics afterwards.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I just want to point out two things to help you enjoy this brilliant movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are two things I want to say here. The first is that while most of you know that the movie is based on a play, many seem to ignore that the play was also written in french, and therefore named Incendies, not Scorched. The Writer is one of my favourite persons in the world and his name is WAJDI MOUAWAD, so if you could stop calling him Mouhad it would make me very happy.But the second and most important thing I want to say regards the reviews that that criticized the ending of the movie for being too far-fetched and killing itself by going over the top. I probably would have agreed a little if I had no prior knowledge of Mouawad's work. So I feel the need to point out that it is a Greek TRAGEDY. It is part of a trilogy where no piece is linked to the other in any other aspects than themes, from what I gather (the two other pieces are called Littoral (coast) and For?ts (Forests)). I had the chance to read a bit of his work, including Incendies, before I saw the movie and once you are aware that this is a Greek tragedy despite the settings, you see it under a different light. Maybe it seems strange, but it works - and besides, Genius always does, right?Now that I've got that out of my system, I can skip to recommending you this movie with all my heart. I swear I am not saying that just because It's from Quebec (like me - if the spelling and grammar mistakes in this haven't tipped you off). The emotion won't need subtitles to pierce the screen. The choice of scenery and colours, the imagery, but mostly, above everything, the plot really makes it worth seeing. I love the fact that this is the movie that represents Quebec's cinema on the international scene. I love that it is a play that drives you deep into the middle-eastern world without exploiting the terrorism issues in a mediocre way. I love the fact that it isn't set anywhere particularly. I learn from the reviews that Mouawad was inspired by the Lebannon conflict, but it doesn't change the fact that it's not about the country or the nation but about humans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disturbing, Touching, Revealing and Gripping...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story starts from societal issue of the protagonist, Nawal Marwan, being a single mother and traverses through various emotions, hardships and stark realities of the world, her world.The notary officer, for whom Nawal worked for 18 years as a secretary, delivers two envelopes to her kids, the twin brother and sister, after she dies of a stroke. One envelope reads "For your father" and the other reads "For your brother". The kids are in a shock after they come to know that they have another brother. The boy, having hatred in his heart for their mother, denies doing anything with those envelopes and thinks of moving on with their lives. However the sister is sensitive and thinks of following the trail back to their mother's past and dig the links as their mother's last wish. The story starts from here.The plot is set in an imaginary place named "Daresh". After being impregnated by her lover and after her family comes to know about this, her brothers kill her lover and almost killed Nawal too. The grandmother somehow pities on her and asks her to deliver the child. The grandmother then asks her to leave the village and move to town, without the kid as she gives away the kid, the village not being safe for Nawal anymore. Nawal moves into city, starts working with University's radio station, learns French but the desire to find the whereabouts of her child is still burning within her. With the same desire she starts tracking back her child and comes to know that the kid was given to an orphanage in South (a place dreaded to be full with extremists).She then gets caught for killing a Nationalist politician and spends 15 years in jail. The movie talks about her sufferings while being a single mother, being away from her child, being in jail and being in a society so full with hatred and revenge. Her ordeal in keeping a secret, facing the torture and yet forgive the torturer, and above all be rational about everything is captured very beautifully in the movie. Also the movie shows us what kind of world surrounds us and we have no idea of. See this movie to watch what a woman have to go through in a life in extreme situations and what being a mother means. No doubt the movie was nominated for Oscar in 2011 and has won Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just watched the movie today. And I think more of coincidence or karma as we believe in India - this is just the right moment for a movie like this to be seen. In the last week the entire India has seen mass protests and violent demonstrations against the govt in view of a merciless gang-rape that has left the 23 year old victim battling for life. This incident being one of the 600 odd rapes that have occurred in Delhi - The national capital of India, in this year alone . Of course there is no other resemblance to the movie . Except the fact that rape can be such a inhuman crime and makes us wonder whether the human race is become more like animals with crimes to this extent. I applaud the writer and director for bringing it out in the most shocking form and gives a repulsion which almost makes you want to puke . I know this movie is going to keep me thinking for days ... I hope others in India will also witness THIS movie in the coming days, as our govt decides whether rape requires a captive punishment or the seven year imprisonment will suffice</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Any film that begins with the mercurial Radiohead and uses their music throughout is going to do something for me. There is a lot of good here with an excellent performance from Poulin and some stunningly shot landscapes. The film goes back and forth in time but not enough to confuse though may be a little too subtle for some viewers. The plot is disturbing and ultimately shocking but again manages to portray this in a subtle way which is no mean feet given the subject.A real surprise and thrill to watch that never failed to mesmerize and shock at the same time. It was well paced and never strayed from the powerful message it conveyed. For me one of the best foreign films I have seen and surprisingly did not gain the credit it deserved.</fullReview>

Maxim Gaudette does enough to warrant a good performance certificate.All other characters have been played well. Lot of research seems to have gone into the development of the script based on a play by Wajdi Mouawad who is the co-writer with the director Denis. The direction by Denis Villeneuve, is just awesome and moving.The film can stay in your mind for days together.After reading this review, do not see the film with any expectations, see it with a free mind.You will be captivated no doubt, but do have some patience in store.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incendies, A Modern Greek Tragedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>¨Death is never the end of a story. There are still traces. If you want to find your brother, you'll have to go back into your mother's past.¨Incendies is a very powerful and emotional film from Quebec director, Dennis Villeneuve, which won almost every award in Canada, several international awards for Best Foreign film and it was also nominated for an Oscar. The movie is based on Wajdi Mouawad's play and it actually plays out as sort of a Greek tragedy. It has several interesting twists; it jumps back and forth in time, and has a very emotional and shocking last twenty minutes. I really never guessed what direction the movie was going to go next as it mixed some romance, drama, and interesting thrills in ways I never imagined it too. The first half hour I have to admit I was kind of bored with the story, but as things began to intertwine and develop I was totally hooked and the final payoff was really worth those long first minutes. The story is really well told and that is perhaps what I enjoyed the most about this film more than the cinematography or the performance from the cast. The film has a very solid and well structured story that allows us to gather information little by little and figure out how all these different characters end up being connected to each other. The story sticks with you long after the film has ended, and makes you want to go back and see everything from the beginning again. I really enjoyed this film and was shocked by the end.Twins, Jeanne (Melissa Desormeaux-Poulin) and Simon Marwan (Maxim Gaudette) are surprised to discover that they have an older brother whom they have never heard of and a surviving father who they have never seen when their dead mother leaves them the task of finding them and delivering a letter to each in her will. Simon has no intention of following her mother's wishes once he hears the news from the Notary Jean Lebel (Remy Girard) who was very close to his mother. Simon claims his mother was always absent minded and may have been a great employee for Jean, but as a mother it was a different story. Jeanne on the other hand is intrigued about finding out who her father and brother are, so she decides to travel to the Middle East and trace the steps of her mother as the past may reveal several clues as to who her mother really was. While Jeanne is in the Middle East searching for her brother and father, we have flashbacks of her mother, Nawal Marwan (Lubna Azabal), growing up during the dangerous civil war and fights between Christians and Muslims. She is sent away from the village where she lived in for falling for a refugee and getting pregnant. They kill him, but Nawal's grandmother spares her life and the life of her son. She sends her to live with an uncle and study, while she gives her son for adoption. Nawal promises her baby boy that she will one day come back for him, but when the civil war broke out she lost all contact with him. Jeanne begins to see how one terrible act lead to another as the horrors her mother lived through escalate. Incendies is a Canadian French production but most of the film takes place in the Middle East. I thought the actors gave a convincing performance, and they let the story be the true star of the film. Every scene is connected to another in some way or another, although you don't quite understand why some scenes were shown until the end of the film. I had to go back and rewatch some of them just to see what I had missed. There are several hints and clues that the director leaves on the way as to what the final outcome is going to be, but I really wasn't expecting the shocking finale. I like these kinds of thrillers that have convincing twists without trying to fool the viewer. If you go back and watch the scenes again you realize that everything was there and you could have made the connection long before the end. Incendies shows us how one hateful act can lead to another and only make matters worse, it also shows us how religious wars blind us and make us do things we'd never do in a million years. It will be hard to get this movie off my head and I absolutely recommend it because it's a very powerful and emotional thriller.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bit confusing, actually...and a great illustration of the phrase 'TMI'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whether or not "Incendies" is a good or bad film, one thing that struck me was that for the longest time I had no idea where the film was taking place or the context for the film. I am sure I am not the only one who felt this way watching the move. I thought that perhaps it was taking place in North Africa or Lebanon--I just wasn't sure. A bit later, it became more obvious--but only because I knew a bit about he history of Lebanon and their long and amazingly destructive civil war. Because of this, it really would behoove the viewer to read up on the war BEFORE watching the movie--then it will be a bit easier to follow.The film begins in the French-speaking portion of Canada. Two young adults are at the reading of their mother's will and are in for some surprises. First, their father, despite what they'd been told, is NOT dead. Second, they have a brother! The rest of the film consists of the daughter going in search of these folks and eventually the brother going to Lebanon in search of his sister--who seems to have just disappeared.From this point, the film bounces back and forth from the past to the present day. This can be a bit confusing--you have to really pay attention to keep track. I know that this sort of yo-yo cinema has become more popular in recent years, but I really wish they'd stop doing this and make films in a much more linear fashion. You do learn that the mother's life was hellacious but you also learn that the two children certainly did NOT need to know about their hidden past! I am pretty darn sure I wouldn't want to learn what they learned about this. And, I also predicted this awful truth well before it was divulged in the movie--making it a bit of an icky anti-climax. I thought the film was interesting but also pretty unpleasant from start to finish.By the way, the film is very, very adult--with many adult themes and lots of bloody violence. Now I am NOT saying it was gratuitous--but it's not a film for kids or anyone who doesn't a realistically violent film. Folks getting burned alive or getting shot in the head at close range are among the things you see and, fortunately, the rapes are underplayed but still make this a super-adult film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Though a well produced film, the material source is that of propaganda. Do your own research to find out that this film is merely a tool in creating one of the most untrue stories ever told during one of the most difficult times in human history. The author of this story is Muslim and apparently in his story his characters live in an alternate universe were there are no Muslim terrorists instead, a very small minority, namely Christian Maronites are terrorists who cease another's life for out of wedlock pregnancies and are busy running rampant throughout the Middle East committing mass murders.Please check out the Damour Massacre where 582 Maronite Christian civilians were annihilated by Arab/Palestenian refugees residing in Lebanon. These perpetrators, an army of thousands (Muslims including PLO refugees) attacked and killed these Maronite Christians reportedly stating during their attack that they were offering a hollocaust to Muhammad. Nice!I am all for freedom of speech but producing a film based on the writings of such screwed thinking is a jagged pill to swallow. If this is possible perhaps there will be a film in the near future exonerating Hitler and depicting him as some sort of persecuted victim. Well made film are not, some seriously perverse thinking going on here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I expected more</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having seen Sicario, anything but whimsical, and some of the comments made about this film and the director in general, I expected something more than this convoluted, cack handed effort at emotional drama. Sure the cinematography was excellent, the acting exquisite, the Middle-Eastern landscape lovingly captured but the story was so preposterous that it undermined the real suffering which has occurred and continues to occur in the war-torn areas of the Middle East. Right from the hackneyed letters device at the beginning of the film I started to worry, ooh person speaks from the grave, what is this "The Greatest Gift" all over again? To the inexplicable throwing-up of the lives of the children, really you're just going to drop everything including your burgeoning career and whatever else is going on for a wild goose chase on the behest of your emotionally distant and possibly unhinged mother? These decisions seemed incongruent if we were to assume that the children were sane, balanced individuals and we were certainly meant to perceive the daughter as such, as she was, along with her mother, the emotional centre of the film and had clearly made something of her life, excelling in her field. As a result of this incongruence, you're left with this emotional centre losing its impact as the character starts to come off as a plot device, add the brother and lawyer to this category too, used to expose upon her mother's fantastically tragic past and to tie together an exaggeratedly distressing and chronologically mind-boggling familial history. I loved the music, the setting, the acting and the way the film was shot. The pacing was a little off at times, constant transitions between mother and daughter threatened to become jarring, but at the beginning of the film it worked well and even seemed to be channelling The Godfather Part II at times. It's true that Villeneuve has a real command of his craft and the films I've seen from him show that. The thing I really had a problem with, however, was the story. It was just unnecessarily absurd and over-the-top. If Villeneuve can stick to more realistically hard-hitting fare in future, again I mention Sicario, he'll serve his talents much better in my view.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A compelling yet emotionally taxing film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Incendies is proof that great films can come out of Canada. Director Denis Villeneuve is one of the most talented Canadian actors working today.Incendies is a beautifully shot, acted, and directed film about a brother and sister trying to unravel their mother's dark past. It delivers on nearly all fronts from the performances to the cinematography to the delicately crafted story. It is a great film that I'd recommend to anyone who loves the art of film making.Canadian actors Mélissa Désormeaux-Poulin and Maxim Gaudette deliver great performances and I'm a bit disappointed they didn't become bigger stars later in their career.However, Incendies is very emotionally exhausting film. Throughout the tightly-wound script, a number of disturbing, unsettling events take place. There's almost no happiness to be found here in this film. Incendies is a great film and Denis Villeneuve is one of my favorite directors. After Prisoners, Enemy, Sicario, and this film, I'm excited to see what he does in the future.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On the reading of their mother's will, a twin brother and sister find out that they have another brother and their father, hereto presumed dead, is still alive. Their mother's last wish is for them to find them both and deliver each a letter. And so a journey starts that will lead them to Lebanon and deep into their mother's tragic past.Incendies has a great story well told by Villeneuve and excellent performances by a cast of mostly unknowns, but, for a movie about the Middle East, it has very little to say about the Middle East. While the mother's story obviously takes place during Lebanon's protracted civil war, Lebanon is never explicitly mentioned, it's just presented as a generic Middle East country. As such there is no background, no context. The Middle East, it seems, is just a place where people kill each other.Nevertheless, it is a hard-hitting film, and the solution to the mystery, while not free from incredible coincidences, is a shocker.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of those movies that is like a long race, or some sort of rigorous exercise of the mind. As I have mentioned in other reviews, I am always trying to find a movie that leaves me speechless afterwards. Where the end credits come on and I am just staring blankly at the screen. This movie did this to me. Apparently, this director is a real up and comer after the success of other movies. After really enjoying Prisoners. and reading many good reviews on this movie, I decided to give it a go.This movie is in French and Arabic. If you don't understand those languages (which I don't), you will have to use subtitles. It is okay, though, because the story is so gripping that you will forget that you are reading subtitles shortly after the beginning credits.I'd list this movie as a drama/thriller. There are some very dramatic parts where it is almost hard to believe what is happening on screen.If you think you have a firm grip of what is going on in the movie, how it will all end, you are in for a big surprise. Please, watch this movie because it is truly one of the better films out there. This movie will not leave you with a smile on your face, but it will leave you with the feeling that the story is complete. It will make sense when you watch it, so carve out a couple of hours of your day to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There aren't any flaws in this film. Shortly : a piece of art. It draws your attention from the very begging, from the first scenes and involves you entirely through the development of the plot to the drama of solution. This film is in many languages, including french and Arabic, but the main language you can hear in this film, in its original purity, is the language of human heart. You will see many beautiful landscapes in this film, but the most beautiful is the landscape of human soul, when it forgives. You will see many religions and traditions in this film, but the oldest tradition is the tradition of mercy, and the oldest religion is the religion of love. We were all born on the South (you will understand where this place is when you watch this film) and just don't remember about it. Just watch it.</fullReview>

In search for answers they travel to Middle East and their mother's homeland. Before starting her life anew in the West, the mother lived in an environment ravaged by civil war.The twins are to discover more about their mother, but we're to see that no one stays unharmed by war.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even when you think you understand what you - as for a part of the audience - see on screen after few minutes you see there's nothing you really understood and the story simply sticks you to your stall and you start another piece of the puzzle. Two stories engaged together that became a whole great and sad story of a woman who leaves two children and a huge mystery behind.The film is quite long. Though you don't feel the time passing and going. After more or less 30 minutes you want to jump on the screen and just try to help. Some woman maybe will feel identified with the main character in some parts of the movie (no spoiler....) and some man will hate their gender on some scenes.At the end - you get an entire story of separation, unification, love, revenge and mercy - without the sticky taste of the classical American movies.Almost a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Canadian screenwriter and director Denis Villeneuve's fourth feature film which he co-wrote with screenwriter Valérie Beaugrand-Champagne, is an adaptation of a French play from 2003 by Lebanese-Canadian writer and theater director Wajdi Mouawad and somewhat inspired by the life of a Lebanese woman named Souha Bechara. It premiered at the 35th Toronto International Film Festival and at the 67th Venice International Film Festival in 2010 and is a Canada-France co-production which was shot on locations in Amman, Jordan and Montréal, Quebec in Canada and produced by Canadian producers Luc Déry and Kim McCraw. It tells the story about fraternal twins Jeanne and Simon Marwan who shortly after their mother Nawal Marwan's death is contacted by her notary Jean Lebel, who has been assigned to pass on their mother's will to them. During a meeting in Canada where Jean conveys Nawal's final words, Simon and his sister learns that their mother has written two letters addressed to their father and brother, and that unless they want a funeral with a nameless headstone, they have to find their brother and father and deliver the letters to them.Distinctly and acutely directed by Canadian filmmaker Denis Villeneuve, this finely paced and humane fictional tale which is narrated from multiple viewpoints, draws a heartrending and multifaceted portrayal of a daughter's journey through her mother's footsteps and her and her brother's pervasive search for their unknown father and brother during the first decade of the 21st century. While notable for it's naturalistic and versatile milieu depictions, nuanced production design by Canadian art-director and production designer André-Line Beauparlant, cinematography by Canadian cinematographer André Turpin, fine editing by film editor Monique Dartonner and use of music, this character-driven, dialog-driven and somewhat political drama depicts several condensed studies of character.This concentrated mystery about identity, family relations, war and a mother's afflicting struggle to keep a promise, is impelled and reinforced by it's prominent and fragmented narrative structure, interrelating stories, substantial character development and the empathic acting performances by Belgian actress Lubna Azabal, Canadian actress Mélissa Désormeaux-Poulin and Canadian actor Maxim Gaudette. A consistently involving and unsentimental character piece which gained, among other awards, the award for Best Canadian Film at the 14th Toronto Film Critics Association Awards in 2010 and the award for Best Feature Film at the 5th Adelaide Film Festival in 2011.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Film of the Year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although nominated for Best Foreign Language Film at the 83rd Academy Awards, Incendies did not win, with the award instead going to In A Better World, a Danish film directed by Susanne Bier. While Bier's family conflict drama was a fine film in its own right, it lacked enough power, intrigue and narrative to sustain its two-hour length. Incendies may occasionally overstay its time, but there is no denying its raw emotional impact.When Nawal Marwan (Lubna Azabel in deeply affecting form) suffers a stroke at a Quebec swimming pool, she spends the remaining weeks of her life silent. At the reading of her will before her two children, Jeanne (Mélissa Désormeaux-Poulin) and Simon (Maxim Gaudette), notary Jean Lebel (Rémy Girard) reveals not only that Jeanne and Simon's father ? whom they believed was dead ? is still alive, but that they also have a brother. Given an envelope each to deliver to their father and brother, respectively, their long and disturbing journey begins.Incendies is not an overly complicated film, but it does require a certain amount of attention, along with an even larger portion of believability as, towards its stunning conclusion, the viewer will have to rely on its stretched credibility. The final revelations of the film are sure to divide viewers. Some may see it as a nonsensical attempt to impress audiences with a shock twist, while others will view it as a harrowing but powerful reminder of the harshness of war, racism and violence.It cannot be said that Incendies is a perfect film ? the film's length does occasionally stretch itself further than it should and it depends very much on coincidence. But for its flaws, Incendies makes up for them ? Azabel's pitch-perfect performance as Nawal will shake the cores of even the coldest viewers, while André Turpin's stunning cinematography makes it almost impossible to believe that the story was once confined to a stage. It may not promise easy viewing, but Denis Villeneuve's fourth feature film is an outstanding achievement and will resonate with viewers across the globe for long after the conclusion.VERDICT: A superbly acted, astonishingly filmed and remarkably told masterpiece, with an emotionally staggering climax. 2011's finest film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Packs a genuinely emotional punch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This French Canadian film - the title translates as "Scorched" - is located mainly in an unnamed Middle Eastern country that is clearly Lebanon although it was shot in Jordan (both nations that I have visited). It tells a powerful and deeply disturbing story about how Nawal Marwan, played wonderfully by the Belgian-Moroccan actress Lubna Azabal, dies and leaves her twin daughter Jeanne (Mélissa Désormeaux-Poulin) and son Simon (Maxim Gaudette) with a strange instruction: letters must be delivered to the father they thought was dead and to a brother they did not know they had.Based on a play, the narrative by writer and director Denis Villeneuve repeatedly jumps back and forth from the present day to several decades earlier which does not always make the story easy to follow (advice: look for three points on the back of a heel). So the viewer has to pay close attention as the twins learn more and more about their enigmatic mother and in the process themselves in some shocking turns of events. This is cinema of a high order that packs a genuinely emotional punch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Will leave you devastated..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've worked in the middle east and it was kinda fun watching the scenery unfold and you'd know exactly why the actors have to be in long enveloping shirts despite the heat. what got me thou was the plot. it just grips you from the opening scene and will leave you feeling miserable for what happened to all the main characters ...even the antagonist. i highly recommend you watch this and don't read the synopsis below coz its a spoiler..Synopsis:After their mother suffers from a stroke at a community swimming pool, twin brother and sister receive final requests in their immigrant mother's will. To fulfill these wishes, they must journey to her birth land in an unnamed Middle-Eastern country (based on Lebanon during the Lebanese civil war[3][4][5]). The movie contains a series of flashbacks to the mother's life (Nawal Marwan). Nawal, a Middle-Eastern Christian gets pregnant from a refugee (likely a Palestine refugee in Lebanon). Nawal's infuriated brothers kill her lover as they try to escape. She reveals to her grandmother that she is pregnant. They keep the pregnancy secret in order to save face. Upon the baby's birth, the grandmother tattoos the infant's heel, and they give the baby boy away. Nawal follows her promise to her grandmother to study in Daresh (a fictional city) during which a Civil War breaks out. Under threat of war, Nawal returns to find her lost son. War has preceded her arrival as she discovers her son's orphanage has been destroyed. She then pretends to be a Muslim to board a bus with other Muslims fleeing to get to the camp where her son has been moved to. On the way to the camp her bus is attacked by armed Christians. She and a Muslim woman and her daughter survive, only to have the bus covered in gas to be burnt. Nawal escapes by showing her cross. They would not spare the woman, so Nawal claims the other woman's daughter as her own. However, the daughter runs back to the bus and is shot. Disillusioned, Nawal joins a radical organization. She is planted as a French tutor for a prominent Christian leader and assassinates him. She is sent to prison, where she becomes known as the woman who sings. Before her release after 13 years in prison, she is raped by the torturer Abu Tareq. She becomes pregnant and gives birth to twins in the jail. A nurse secretly saves the babies and returns them to Nawal after her release. They emigrate to Canada. After her death many years later, Nawal leaves a will requesting that her children, Simon and Jeanne, find their father and lost brother. Simon refuses, but Jeanne continues on her own, following in her mother's footsteps. She finds her extended family, who refuse to speak to her because of the shame her mother brought on the family. She then finds the prison and learns from a former employee that her mother was raped and gave birth in prison. He gives her the name of the nurse who birthed the babies. Distraught, she calls Simon to join her. He arrives with their mother's former employer from Canada. They find the nurse and ask for the baby born in prison. Only when the nurse reports that their mother gave birth to twins, do Jeanne and Simon become aware that they have been searching for themselves the whole time. A local solicitor identifies the name of their lost half-brother as Nihad. He further manages to trace the warlord who seized the new orphanage where Nihad had lived following the destruction of the first, and arranges for a meeting. Simon learns that Nihad had been taken in by the warlord, turned into a soldier, and eventually became a torturer at the prison where their mother was held. He was then known as Abu Tareq. Having discovered that their father is their half-brother, they find out that he too had moved to Canada. They find him, and deliver the letters from the mother. We learn that after many years, while swimming in a pool, Nawal spots a man with a tattooed heel. Meeting her rapist and lost son again after so much time, she suffers from a stroke and dies shortly after. At the end, her son visits her grave after he learns what he had done to his own mother.From the names (Christian) and the fact that Nawal's lover is "from the camps", the Marwan family are likely Christian Lebanese (further, Maronite, since Nawal's uncle's name is "Charbel"), while her lover is Palestinian. However, Nawal's accent, as well as her family's and most of the actors, is not Lebanese.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story dreadfully drags on for a good hour at a false rhythm favourable to boredom, the plot then accelerates in the last 35-40 minutes, but unfortunately this regain of interest is completely annihilated by the highly improbable aspect of the outcome.The narrative structure therefore turns out very blurry and this feeling is emphasized by a very confused editing alternating past and present, for example you get the mother and the daughter mixed up, especially at the beginning, because they resemble too much, and the temporal referential isn't very clear so you never now which period it is or how much time has passed.Moreover, and more importantly, nothing is explained regarding the historical context in Lebanon during the 70's, we're offered raw data that isn't supported and unless you're aware of this civil war episode, the movie tells nothing on that subject even though it occupies a primordial place in the story.Therefore, it's hard to understand the enthusiasm for Incendies and the raving critics it arouse since the content is so weak and hardly compensated by a rather catchy photography and seamless direction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Root of all Evil</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A film with 8,1/10 (36000 votes) on IMDb should be an instant classic, a masterpiece of cinema, a film you will remember for the rest of your life...or so you would think. Well, no. There is a 'twist' in the story that you could say is cleverly written, it does not make up for the other defects of the film. It's slow, with the character going though to motions of their 'discovery', but none of that makes for interesting scenes. I didn't care much for the characters and certainly failed to identify or sympathize with them (a basic requirement for liking a film). The story takes place in an unidentified Middle-Eastern country (apparently they didn't want to offend any middle eastern people or they think it's all the same over there -whatever) and religion is (surprise, surprise) basically the root cause of all the evil that happens to our protagonist. The sum of all these elements does not add up to a great film. I even turned it off after 35 mins. After a few days I gathered enough courage to plow through the remainder of this film, and it does get a bit better after the slow start. My advice is: there are films you'd think are perfect but there's always such a thing as personal taste.</fullReview>

For all of you out there, this is the biggest "must" anyone has ever suggested to you. Just don't miss this absolutely hard and raw and at the same time extremely tender and most humanistic film.

Pls trust me on this: You do not need to know any more details about it that's why i don't see the point of analyzing it any further. You'll like it either way.. Even if you're absolutely heartless, you' ll still be captured by its story and its shocking yet unfortunately, very much part of the real world, scenes. Now if you do have a heart after all, you'll be touched that deeply by its hard and heartbreaking-yet not melodramatic at all- truth, that it will take you days to overcome it. How wouldn't you? It's a genial masterpiece we're talking about here, very much inspired by "Oedipus" the great Greek tragedy, but not copying it at all!...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Movie Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have probably by now watched this movie over ten times, in counting all the times that I have shown it to friends. ?And every one of them loved it? This movie I should not have liked, because it started a little bit slow. I didn't know what I was dealing with, and what significance the initial scenes would have throughout the movie. First the scene of the child whose hair is being shaved, then an ugly file room with a man standing there and then a will being read to two other protagonists. ?hmmm? Definitely a boring movie. NOT SO... Approximately five minutes into the movie I was hooked.I have to admit though that I did watch the trailer and that I was attracted to this movie by the part where it was mentioned that "your mother was not crazy." This was enough to entice me to watch it. Throughout the movie, the facial expressions and display of emotions of the actors, especially the ones of Lubna Azabal were stunning. It made me an immediate fan of hers. The acting was just superb this movie all around.This is not your typical movie and not your typical feel-good storyline. It is something new and refreshing, something that I had not seen before. Very few movies made in Hollywood have good plots now-a-days. The few recent Hollywood movies that were memorable in my opinion were Doubt and Precious, because the plots were unique. With that said, I am usually underwhelmed by the lack of a good plot/story-line/twists, or just shocked at how they overstep the imagination in order to somehow come up with a " TWIST," Watching Incendies was a great experience. This movie made me go on the search for non-Hollywood movies left and right.I read some reviews criticizing such things as Lubna's accent and how the scenery didn't match every aspect of Lebanon (the presumed country where this was taking place). I disagree with that finding, as after all, this is all fiction, and as such, it does not have to be 100 percent perfect. Being that I know that this is fiction, I understand and tolerate the fact that the plot development and culmination are unrealistic, but that's what art is all about. After all, this movie came from a play, correct? You might as well criticize the play, instead of the movie.Compared to the crap that Hollywood feeds us most of the time, I say that this movie is probably one of the best ever made. I could give this movie an 11 out of 10, because it really deserves it.</fullReview>

The question "Does 1+1 equal to 1?" is the summery of this movie, it tells everything. Jeanne and Simon's brother and father is the same human, it is amazing and frightening.

This was undoubtedly one of the most pleasant surprises that a film has ever given me.I will not go into the plot to spoil anything for those of you that have not had the pleasure of seeing this. What I will say is that this it is definitely one of the best films I have ever seen. The direction is superb, there are some breathtaking shots of the rundown, war torn Middle Eastern landscapes. The score containing various works from Radiohead is fantastic and really sets the bleak tone of the movie perfectly. I'll be honest and admit that I did not recognise any of the actors or actresses but they are all exceptional, particularly Lubna Azabal who gave one of the best performances I have seen in a long time.

Put that kettle down, your coffee will go cold anyway, JUST WATCH THIS!!!" - And I know he'll thank me for my obstinate insistence. Thirst will mean nothing, the 'bathroom'? You'll learn to hang on, hunger? It won't occur. Very rarely will you encounter such a masterful telling of a story, trust me - yet don't allow anything to distract you, and when you think "the subtitles aren't working", you're not meant to understand.....it's from the main character's perspective and they don't speak Arabic either, a clever touch that you'll learn to get. Monsieur Villenueve, if I ever win the lottery and write the script that's in my head - YOU will direct it after rewriting it. I'll pay you anything and give you free reign - pure Dogme with subtleties of touch and inflection that very few of us will ever have but can only dream of thinking once in our lives. IF THE Oscars WEREN'T SO 'EXCLUSIVELY ANGLO' AND INCLUDED FOREIGN FILMS FOR BEST PICTURE ETC - THIS WOULD HAVE WON A HALF A DOZEN. Bravo, again, Msr Villenueve, BRAVO!!!!! Wajdi Mouawad - you gave us this play from your heart - I hope it's not you're own life story - if so......go with God, peace brother.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Hall of Fame material</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film opens at present day in Montreal with twins in their twenties, Jeanne and Simon Marwan, hearing the will of their mother Nawal Marwan, who has just passed away, from a notary Jean Lebel she'd worked for many years. Her last wish is for them to find their father and brother, to their bewilderment, because they thought their father dead and they never heard about having a brother.At first, only Jeanne is willing to undertake the journey to an unnamed country in the Middle East (however, this clearly refers to Lebanon, where the author of the play himself was born at and escaped from) while Simon, questioning their mother's sanity, refuses to embark on such a crazy quest.Simultaneously, their mother's story entwines with their research. An incredible story of a woman who is caught between the conflict of religious conflict between Muslims and Christians, especially the war in the country in the 1970s' and 80s'.What gives the story an extraordinary strength is exactly this comparison between the perceptions Jeanne and Simon who grew up in a free country versus the life, habits and ways of a nation in the middle of a raging conflict in a country so distant from their lives, especially ? and this is apparent during the entire film ? because Nawal has shared nothing of her past with their children.This is portrayed during the twins encounter with the local tradition, especially at one moment, when Jeanne meets the villagers who could have known her father and is told by an elderly woman that "she is looking for her father, but is her mother she knows nothing about". This exactly depicts the relation of the audience in the western world, who, unless they've lived in similar conditions, cannot relate to some of Nawal's later radical actions and the endurance with which she accepts the imprisonment that follows.This endurance of Nawal through the atrocities she is faced with during her life before the final escape to Canada is mind-blowing. Death, abuse, inhumane conditions and life-lasting rage are emotions Villeneuve has captured with a divine skill.All pieces to the puzzle are gradually served to the audience (depends of how quickly you pick up on the clues) and the moment you realize what actually happened just stops your heartbeat for a second.Like many of the critics, I would have thought this film would win the Oscar for the best foreign film. It has everything a film should have to be more than welcomed to the Hall of Fame and a message that clearly, is immortal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best. Twist. Ending. Ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Woohoo! Turns out their brother is also their father! Best twist ending ever!Uh, actually, no.I sat through the first 1.5 hours of this movie, hoping that there'd be some redeeming quality at the end, other than the usual arty farty French (or French Canadian) BS. Wow turns out it's not quite what you expected.For a more authentic and heartwrenching Canadian performance depicting horror and grue, go see instead "One Lunatic One Icepick" (warning: parental advisory). It's only about 10 minutes long, compared to 2 hours of this Incendies nonsense.P.S. I sat through the movie thinking how absolutely shitty the twin brother's acting was (the others were OK, but nothing stellar), so my mind was blown when I read Rotten Tomatoes' summary which called the acting "impressive".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Promising, but disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The beginning was marvelous. You could tell this came from a play, because the weight of everything hung from words alone - the incredible malediction the mother pronounced on herself, and the contrasting reaction of the two children. Now that I think of it, there are elements of a fairytale in that beginning, present in the task set before the children much as Aladdin is sent for the lamp or Cinderella to clean, and this may - if not justify - provide insight to the structural failures further on; but, as I said, the latter half of the film is a disappointment."Incendies" is about a brother and sister, twins, who are sent by their mother via her will to search for their father and their brother. This journey reveals, via flashback, the mother's ordeal in an unnamed Arab conflict (Christianity vs Muslim, as usual), and is capped by the revelation that the father and brother are the same person. War is so horrible that it causes even this sort of thing to happen, but whereas the mother can't survive this last atrocity (the realization makes her literally will herself to die), her children can live on.The message, as it were, is all well and good, but the film as a work of art that clarifies life by being an artifice doesn't work for me. It's not that characterization in itself is missing: the children are flat (flatter, at least, than Nawal, who isn't exactly a masterpiece of characterization), and that's kind of an empty promise on the life after war, isn't it? Aren't they just two springboards that serve, in the story, solely to dig up the past? Towards the end, characters such as the lawyer are mobilized like chess pieces, and we find out that Nawal was almost a mythic figure in the jail, "The Woman Who Sings" -- some sort of superhero. Things fit together too well, a bit like Nawal's outfit, with her rather stylish jeans and jacket; indeed, the revelation at the end, with the silly bit of dialogue from the brother ("One and one... how can they make one??"), couldn't transcend its tawdriness. It's like Disney meets Oedipus Rex.The movie was still entertaining and had moments, of course, of grandeur. But ultimately disappointing. Glad I saw it on the plane.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ugh (Spoiler)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like 'Blue Valentine', the virtues of this movie, its craftsmanship in terms of photography, performance, exposition, and so on, ultimately lead to its undoing. Its absolutely repulsive denouement simply destroys any viewer satisfaction in the whole. This is indeed the spoiler - the brother for whom the twins are searching, and the father, turn out to be the same person - with the added flourish that their conception occurred as the result of torture/rape.What exactly was the point here? Was there one? In 'Chinatown', which has a similar twist, the revelation is treated with horror and disgust (plus it explains eccentricities in the Faye Dunaway character). Here it says absolutely nothing about anything - in fact, the revelation is accompanied by the ludicrous hope of the dead mother that it 'will end the cycle of anger'.Are you kidding? What it's going to do is lead to permanent estrangement and alienation of all three, plus do permanent damage to the twins' self-perception.And what does any of this say about the Middle East? Or any larger human issue? Next to nothing.Disaster. Ugh.</fullReview>

Three dimensional, believable characters, breath taking moments of truth will make your heart beat like crazy. There is some really visually touching moments in the film, like the shot from the burning bus, beauty of the lands, the shocking close-up Marwan face. Incredibly well made movie on modest budget. It is a great and prominent work of Villeneuve, not every director can make such as humane and wondrous film. He know the medium of language of cinema to craft a story.

		<shortDescription>If its title translates out of French and into English as "Scorched", then this is a near red-hot drama making the difficulties of taking this subject matter on look easy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The opening scenes of Incendies paints an image of a cantankerous elderly women whom, even in death, is forcing her children to run around on goose chases after a series of eccentric entries to a will that does nothing but pose further questions and cause further action when closure and other such things are all that's desired at such a difficult time. We feel sorry for the kids, a Canada residing brother and an elder sister; we feel a little bitter towards their recently deceased mother and then we witness a duel pilgrimage across the Eurasian border so startling that words such as 'humbling' don't really do it the sorts of justice it requires.The family to whom all this bother is unfolding are the Marwan's: siblings Jeanne (Désormeaux-Poulin) and Simon (Gaudette), here in the present day, and then that of Lubna Azabal's Nawal, way back when. Needless to say, I'd rather have the modern-day set bother and the strife of the siblings than that of Nawal's. Jeanne and Simon sit silently in a solicitor's office, an odd air of grief and frustration abound as these requests documented by Nawal are read; requests more broadly encompassing the apparent need for the two to journey great distances and find a specific someone which will reveal all. Jeanne is the one who takes the plunge and ventures away from the niceties of her first world, economically developed living quarters to that of where Asia meets Europe. In the solicitor's office, Jeanne chirps up ahead of Simon when asked if there are any problems or inconveniences with what is being presented to them ? yes, there is and the labelling of this person as being the sort to initially put the foot forward is established when Simon only begins to enquire once the green light has been instigated.A maths teacher, so good with problem solving and equations which are seemingly impenetrable, Jeanne heads out to a place which is ambiguous in its actual identity and that people appear to entrust is more broadly representative of Lebanon, in spite of the fact a Palestinian flag is very briefly identifiable in the corner of the frame at on one fleeting instance. Her journeys take her there so as to look for what the will says is a long-lost father as well as another brother whom neither she nor Simon ever knew of. Unfolded in crisp tandem is the tale of their mother some thirty-odd years ago, and Nawal's own hardships born out of persistent rejection from peers; religious circles and family members. It leads her to exploring this free-spirited characteristic embedded within by herself, and on a very dangerous line throughout, as she attempts to look for a son born out of wedlock and to a certain individual of a certain ilk many of whom within Nawal's initial circles take issue.The parallel between either journey mother and daughter undertake, similar in structure and scale, is fairly clear; the quest taking either woman all around the houses, from bombed out orphanages to grotty prisons. There is one sequence, a sort of grotesque centrepiece in its content but quietly beautiful in its harsh and thoroughly professional depiction, which is absolutely terrifying: a sequence which depicts a bus full of Muslims being ambushed by that of a Christian group of militants during this, a Civil War which has broken out in the undetermined nation. It is a sequence remarkable for its stark nature anyway, but additionally because it isn't necessarily the emotional crux of the film. The scene is made more impacting given the happenings within recent years of the film's production in nations such as Pakistan and Angola, and attacks relayed onto that of sporting personnel whose tales have graced news reports when their buses have come under fire and lives have been lost. Additionally, the sorts of brutality aimed at those within does well to subvert the idea of anonymous Muslim aggressors, of whom are shrouded in mystery and come complete with towels around their faces, attacking innocents and children by reversing the religious backgrounds as well as the respective roles of victimised and perpetrator. Here, Christian soldiers go on a rampage thus destroying a small, and often easily demonised, Muslim congregation. Regardless of that individual sequence's affecting qualities, Denis Villeneuve's film is a real sucker punch of emotion and biting self-discovery which, at certain stages, crept up on me; a really ambitious and worthwhile piece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This astounding movie will stay with you for a long time. So many reviews have been posted, anything I could say would be a repeat: this is how movies should be made. I didn't mind the subtitles, I only hope my family will sit through them, because it is definitely worth it.Although it did not have the gut-wrenching impact that movies such as Sophie's Choice and the Eagle Has Landed had on me, and I did not feel the intensity of the emotions other reviewers reported feeling, I deeply appreciated and enjoyed the dramatic impact of the unfolding of the mystery. I believe Incendies will stay with me over the years as the other movies have because of how well it is made.The talent of all the main actors was such that I will remember them as characters in the story, not as actors playing the roles. I appreciated the artistic elements, the choice of set pieces that gave a really authentic look to each setting. It was refreshing not to have Hollywood fake-y white teeth ruining the look of working class and rural characters. However, I do feel the make-up artists, and perhaps other techniques, could have given a better sense of the actual age of a few characters at various points in their life and that would have given the audience gain a better sense of the actual time span. It was a small distraction to make mental allowances for that while the scenes unfolded.My only notable frustration was I couldn't find a reference to the identity of performer who provided the marvelous ethereal mezzo-soprano singing at the ending credits, and the composer and piece. (Perhaps it was in French and I missed it?) I finally found out the singer is Ciara Hendrick. I hope it will be possible to get a recording of her performance on the soundtrack. I found a Youtube recording that displayed the German lyrics, however, it sounded like a different performer: the quality of singing was not as satisfying.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not simply 'scorching' but 'blistering'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>INCENDIES began as a play of the same name by Wajdi Mouawad and was opened up as only cinema can do by the author with the assistance of Canadian director Denis Villeneuve and consultant Valérie Beaugrand-Champagne. The result is a staggeringly powerful film whose story is so well revealed by a cast of sterling actors that telling too much of the plot would be a disservice to those who come to this experience for the first time. In this viewer's opinion it is simply one of the finest films of the decade and it bound to become a permanent part of the cinematic library.The opening of the film reveals many clues as to the direction the story will take. In a stark room young boys are having their hair shorn: one of the boys as a tattoo on his heal - three aligned dots on the Achilles tendon. After this unsettling beginning the camera moves to Canada in the office of notary Jean Lebel (Rémy Girard) who has the responsibility of executing the will of his secretary Nawal Marwan (Lubna Azabal in an illuminating performance that plays through the entire film) and presenting the will to Nawal's Lebanese- Canadian twin children Jeanne (Mélissa Désormeaux-Poulin) and Simon (Maxim Gaudette) Marwan. The will divides Nawal's worldly goods equally between the children, but describes in detail how the deceased mother is to be buried (naked, face down, with no coffin in an unmarked grave) and provides two letters charging Jeanne and Simon to find the father and brother they did not even know existed. The remainder of the film moves back and forth between the past and the present as the twins attempt to find their living relatives and the story of how Nawal's life was an unbelievable nightmare. Nawal was a Christian Lebanese, had a lover who was a Palestinian, and when her lover is killed she realizes she is pregnant, shaming her family and thus forced to give up her boy child to an orphanage - but not before her grandmother sensitively tattooed the three dots on his heel for future recognition. From that point Nawal becomes a mathematician, a hired killer, is imprisoned and tortured and once again becomes a mother. The twins trace clues as detectives to follow the rocky road of Nawal's life and make discoveries that are astonishing.Though Lubna Azabal is clearly the central star of this film, the entire cast particularly Mélissa Désormeaux-Poulin and Maxim Gaudette as the twins is exemplary. Very little of the tragedy of Nawal's life is spared but the power that comes from the moments of discovery of the truths of that life lies in the quiet shock in the eyes of the twins. This is an amazingly powerful film that keeps the audience tension level high making the surprising ending just that much more powerful. The cinematography by André Turpin manages to capture both the vast power of the Middle Eastern desert and villages as well as the moments of intimacy. The musical score by Grégoire Hetzel enhances the atmosphere and the story line very subtly. But in the end it is the sensitive direction of Denis Villeneuve that brings with human tragedy of a story alive. Highly recommended. Grady Harp</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My eyes are wet, my heart is heavy, my mind is busy thinking and my lips are shut. I am totally speechless after the film ended, left me in a shock. The choir at the end, and the shocking ending of the movie, I just wonder, is this story real? I strongly applaud for the director.I am a Pakistani born, having spent half of my life in Iran. I watched this film because it had some places shown in the film which resembled the place where I had spent my childhood. More over the IMDb rating for this movie was quite enough for me to make me watching this film. When i saw the film, I wasn't expecting such shocking end. There are very few films that got me in so seriously, the movies which captured my mind so brutally. Yes I admit that the movie ended but it didn't end yet, in my mind. It left me with so much unanswered.Indeed the film has been perfect through every scene. The actors, the co-actors and the leading character Nawal. I simply have no words to tell you how I found this movie, but I assure you it's worth watching. There was a scene where Simon Marwan returns after meeting the war lord, and he is hysteric and tells in an exclamation to her sister, can one plus one equal to one and she shrieks briskly, I got scared and I stopped the film for a while, thinking what does this mean "can one plus one equal to one". Some notions struck me, but I shuddered myself that no, how it can be, what! Can it be? Ohh my holy God, please don't and exactly the same I found, when the film ended, I was sitting numb.For me, this is the victory of an author, writer, screen play and the director and to everyone involved in film making, that you involve the viewer and make him shocked.For me this is a 9 out of 10 film. I just gave one film 10 out of 10, and that was "stoning of Soraya M." I also recommend you all to watch it too. Its Persian but totally superb, outclass and epic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Brilliantly Constructed Dark &amp; Disturbing Mystery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Denis Villeneuve's "Incendies"- an adaptation of Wajdi Mouawad's play "Scorched"- is a film about a soul being put to rest.This dark mystery is a disturbing, yet moving, tale of a mother, Narwal Marwan (Lubna Azabal); her twin son- Simon aka Sarwan (Maxim Gaudette) and daughter- Jeanne aka Janaan (Mélissa Désormeaux-Poulin). After their mother's death, the two siblings are sent to Lebanon where they are to investigate their mother's past- her final wishes. As the plot of the film unravels, flashbacks from the past are cinematically woven together with images from the Twins' modern day investigation, in a non-linear fashion.The film begins with the reckoning and death of Narwal, after which her twin children are called before the trusted notary Jean Libel (Rémy Girard)- whom Narwal had worked under for many years prior to her death- for the reading of her will. Each of the siblings is given a letter and left with a task that must be accomplished before their mother will allow them to mark her grave with a stone and any sort of recognition.Simon is dealt the task of tracking down their brother. While Jeanne- a mathematician who works on unsolvable equations and the realization of the woman her mother was meant to be- is entrusted with the task of tracking down their father. Both of whom are thought to be back in Lebanon- the country that their mother had emigrated from. While Simon first thinks his mother had gone insane, Jeanne- intrigued by the impossibility of the task at hand- heads off to Lebanon to see what she can find out; possessing only two names and an old photograph.As Jeanne's investigation progresses, we are shown flashbacks from Narwal's life in Lebanon before she had come to Canada. These flashbacks provide us with information prior to the Twins becoming privy to it, and as such, allow us to put the mystery together one step ahead of them. Although, Villeneuve does cleverly try and throw us off by having Jeanne "put things together" wrong in the first half of the film...by which I mean how she thinks Wahab is their father and Abou Tarek the father of their brother (when we know this clearly cannot be the case).As Jeanne is joined by her brother, it becomes evident that the quest they have been sent on is not only a journey to discover the truth about who their mother really was; but also one of self-discovery- as they soon realize they are exposing the truth about their own story as well. The ultimate closure the siblings could achieve for their mother; and their mother for themselves.The Twins reveal how their mother was a Christian woman living in a Lebanon during a time in which tensions between the Muslim and Christian Nationalist communities were becoming increasingly strained and violent. They discover how she had fallen in love and become pregnant by a Muslim man- bringing disgrace to her ultra-Nationalist family; and how she was forced to give up her child- their brother; only to dedicate the rest of her life to tracking him down.As the two delve deeper into Lebanon and the truth we discover more and more about the hardships their mother had to endure. How, after being run out of town by her family, she set out to find the orphanage her son had been sent to- only to find it had been razed by the local warlord.What happens next (in combination with the conclusion) gives the film it's title.In order to continue the search for her son, Narwal needed to get to the town of Daressa. To manage this she was required to disguise herself as an Islamic woman and catch a bus that was bringing a group of Muslim passengers into the town. Before they were able to reach their destination, though, the bus is stopped at a checkpoint by a group of armed Christian Nationalists who inexplicably pepper the bus with bullets- killing most of the passengers.Narwal manages to survive alongside a woman and her daughter, but when the men start to cover the bus in gasoline...she has no other choice but to reveal herself to be a Christian. The men spare her life, but force her to watch a horrific massacre unfold- which includes the woman being burned alive and her young daughter being shot down in cold blood right before her eyes.Ashamed by the actions of her people, and greatly traumatized by the events she just experienced, Narwal gives up the search for her lost son and joins the Muslim revolt- agreeing to assassinate the leader of the Christian Nationalists.Her children discover that she not only successfully assassinated the man; but was also arrested, imprisoned and tortured- which included being raped repeatedly- for 15 years in one of the Country's most infamous prisons. During which she became known as "The Woman Who Sings".As the Twins wrap up their investigation and get to the bottom of the story they were sent to expose, they are hit with a series of disturbing revelations about their mother; lost brother; father; and even themselves. I love how Villeneuve foreshadows this prior to revealing it cryptically in the "how can 1+1=1" scene; then explaining it more concretely in the film's conclusion.With "Incendies", Villeneuve has brought us a brilliantly constructed dark and disturbing mystery that allows us as the viewers to be the sleuth- which is half the fun! A wonderfully shot film with lots of stationary shots from a distance that possess a sort of Haneke vibe. The entire cast does an excellent job, but Belgian actress Lubna Azabal really steals the show. And on top of all this it's a Canadian film! A Must See. 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This films seems like any other, and then it draws you in by its beautiful frames. Such a pretty film with a good cast, you are just watching to find out if the production costs are worth the story. It is. To think of it like that, in retrospect, is at the very least showing how little it takes to please us. The moving watching public. Could this film have been made in the US? It is so true to the story and unforgiving in every way. In the states, the movies we see are a result of test screenings, dumbed down plots and studios that are looking for maximum profits ("all hail the American corporation machine"). This film is not an easy movie to watch. First of all the whole thing is in subtitles and some of it not even, and doesn't pull any punches. It's was like they said "not everyone will get it, not everyone will give it a chance, and most people won't even be exposed to it, but we will say, what we want to say. As an American it was the most connected I've been to an Arabic movie. It is a new generation of film for the world. There are no "terrorists" with "WMD's" just honest characters and epic performances. We always heard that there were atrocities in this region, but any portrayal I've seen, seems to stop at the stereo typical Arab that is on CNN/Fox. This movie goes beyond that, it's set production is great, costumes, angles of photography are brilliant. So many little extras that make up a great movie. On top of a story that any person, any where could understand. It is appalling and beautiful all at the same time. I hope this hasn't created feeling like you are about to watch, (insert any comic book movie here,) this is real. And emotional. And a tough movie to comprehend. It is just amazing....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shocking and excellent cinema.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Incendies' the Oscar nominated entry from Canada as the best feature film in a foreign language however, 'In a better world (Denmark)' won the Oscar. Incendies is a shocking drama set in the backdrop of war in Lebanon. The movie starts with a mother's will with envelopes being handed over to her twin children. The will says to establish the existence of their father and brother and give the envelope respectively. Consisting the twist and turns, this movie ends with a shocking climax.It is based on the Play by Wajdi Mouawad and has been adopted wonderfully. The scene are crafted wonderfully by showing in back and forth, the story is poignant and filmed with brilliant cinematography. The Outlying areas of Jordon captured beautifully and this gives a big canvas to the screenplay. The war scenes display a distinctive&nbsp;feature to a heightened degree magnificently. The acting, direction and character development is at its best.It is somewhat disturbing and can shake the moral ground of anyone.This is an essential cinema for open minded movie lovers. this is highly recommended because it is the one of the best movies of the decade.</fullReview>

This is one of the films that leads to conversations and discussions afterwards which really is the mark of a great movie.The movie flows beautifully in and out of different eras (although somewhat confusing the first time there is a flashback, so pay close attention),showing just enough of the surrounding conflict to pull you in without over doing the disasters that are occurring around the storyline.Sometimes, less is more if you know what I mean.Well done and would highly recommend this movie.Personally, this movie is even better than slum dog millionaire. The subtitles are an easy read if you don't speak French.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too much and not enough.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For the last 2 years i was saying to myself "you should see Incendies that everybody is talking about, it must be awesome" and i finally did...The goods: great actors, great cinematography, some strong dramatic scenes, sometimes very realistic. The bads: Loooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooong, way to long, especially the beginning of the film. I didn't care about the characters and i've found myself fighting against boredom for the most part. Nothing really happens until the 48th minute, THE 48TH MINUTE!! I didn't bought the plot in the first place; a twin's odyssey in the middle-east to meet an unknown brother and understand the mystery behind the mental illness of their dead mother; and that's too bad because i wanted to like this movie very hard, but i didn't. The ending is twisted at a point it became ridicule and laughable, i didn't bought that either... Yeah, i know, truth is stranger than fiction, but sometimes fiction pushed too hard is overkill.In my opinion the music didn't fit for a middle-east movie, for the most part at least. I mean, why not include some Twisted Sisters, Bon Jovi and Justin Beiber in the soundtrack once you are there? A bit of "phrygian dominant" would have helped.I didn't liked the structure either, i think they tried to make it too "artistical" or something, and it didn't helped the story.If you want your vacation to last longer, that 2 hours and 10 minutes felt like 5 hours, just saying...Not a bad movie, but not that great either. A lot of bones but a lack of meat. Maybe i had too much expectations but in one word : deception.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow, what a GREAT MOVIE!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie will forever imprint in my memory. What a story! I could never believe this movie was just based on and adapted from a play. The screenplay, the storyline and the scenario are one of the best I've ever seen. It's so complicated yet the shocking end is at the same time so obvious in plain sight. Like the Plot of IMDb: The title in French means "Destruction by Fire" and "Scorched" in English, but if you refer to the Greek tragedy "Oedipus", "the fable of Oedipus, with a theme of inadvertent relationship between a mother and son, ends in disaster and shows ancient taboos against unacceptable direct bloodline relationship as Oedipus is punished for committing an already existed ancient taboo by blinding himself. In the "sequel" to Oedipus, Antigone, his four children are also punished for their parents having been entangled in bad incestuous original sin. we could even link this movie's title 'Incendies' was not far away from 'incestuous' crime and punishment from Oedipus. What we didn't see in this movie is the Oedipus-like guy blinded his eyes and banished himself into the wildness, and the Antigone-like young female mathematician and her twin brother were tormented and troubled by the finding, discovery and the myth of their origin.The only thing not so clearly portrayed in this movie is the war, the location of the war, the period of the war. Also the racial and religious conflict of the mother's first love. It seems that from the very beginning, the 'Singing woman/prisoner' was a combination of Oedipus and Antigone, she was mysterious punished by the unseen fate, her first romance and affair as well as the vague war. A war at first looked like the independence war declared by Algeria from the French, then became more confusing as a war between the Palestinian and Israeli, then after some research, it's actually about the Lebanese Civil War (1975?1990)! The Christians and the Muslims killing each other, both sides were blindly manipulated by the forces around this once-like-paradise then a war-torn country. At the very beginning of this movie, it should have been clearly told that it's during the Lebanese Civil War, giving us a more exact time frame and locality.This is the only unsatisfactory confusion in this movie, but the directing, the casting, the performances played by the two actresses are all top-notched. Failed to win the "Best Foreign Movie", "Best Screenplay", "Best Directing", "Best Cinematography", "Best Female Actress" and "Best Supporting Female Actress" of Oscar were the biggest shame of Hollywood. To us, this movie should have won all of the above-mentioned categories. In the meantime, by watching this great movie, we also understood what "greatness" and "catharsis" really meant. We also inevitably realized that the two mothers of all evils in this world: Religions and the wars caused by religions and ethnics differences.Let the sleeping dog lie somehow might be the best way to deal with your life; never look back; let bygone be bygone; never believe that the truth will set you free, because sometimes, the truth will kill you. Your past really that important? Hell NO, your DNA actually is not that important, just move on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Emotionally engaging mystery and drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My husband and I were both very impressed and emotionally engaged throughout the whole film even though we had seen the play Scorched which we both considered the best play with deep meaning we had seen in years. Let me recommend the play, too, whether or not you've seen the movie. Someone said the play is 4 hours long. It may have been but I don't remember a boring moment, though I remember parts that aren't in the movie. The movie, nonetheless, is whole and complete.The characters of the mother and her twin daughter and son are all extremely sensitively portrayed by the actors. Without flashbacks to the emotionally distant and confusing parenting they received from their mother, you are able to imagine the wounds they received, compounded by a complete lack of knowledge of the reasons. The daughter, Jeanne, seems to have dealt with this by becoming a student of pure mathematics. The professor to whom she is a TA welcomes the students to the world of abstraction and solitude. Her brother Simon simmers in rage.After their mother's death, they embark on a journey of discovery their mother stipulates in the cryptic and startling instructions in her will. The journey leads first Jeanne and eventually Simon to Lebanon. They discover the origins of their mother's wounds, little by little, as they learn of her difficult (an understatement)life as a young adult in a country with unforgiving moral standards for young love relationships and at war with itself. As the viewer, you see this difficult life of the mother through flashbacks of her coming of age in horrendous circumstances, as her children in the present day learn of her tortured life and of her determined strength.The movie, as does the play, provides the audience an opportunity to see what may lie hidden behind the face of distance, withdrawal, or rage in others. It encourages compassion for ourselves and others whose demeanor is simply a survival mechanism to deal with wounds which you may not know or understand. It also lets one experience vicariously (thankfully)the horrors of war, especially, war based on revenge for personal and "tribal" atrocities. All of this makes us more whole, more compassionate, and less quick to judgement of good or bad in a very complicated world.</fullReview>

The story starts with demise of lead protagonist Nawal Marwan (Lubna Azabel) and her will with last wishes for her twins, daughter Jeanne Marwan (Poulin) and son Simon (Maxim), to hand over 2 envelopes to their unknown Father and their surrogate brother. Hence story unfolds with hunt for parentage, family secrets across miles and time, director Denis Villeneuve's beautifully interwoven 2 parallel stories, Nawal Marwan fighting for her rights in Middle East and twins searching for parentage. When these 2 stories linked, a shocking truth revealed 1+1 =1, twins search ends with father and brother being same person, while it is brutality, viewers will appreciate the circumstantial events of Nawal Marwan lead to this and walk out appreciating her brave soul.

		<fullReview>Trying to understand the Mideast is difficult at best, and something that requires a lot of study with an open mind. This film is an excellent step in seeing one piece of the puzzle. Though not specifically mentioned, it is set in Lebanon in the present, and through flashback to the Civil War (1975-1990). The Christian population suffered the loss of all their leaders. The mother in this film, Nawal Marwan (Lubna Azabal), has a relationship outside the clan, has a son, and becomes part of the rebel movement. She is imprisoned, raped repeatedly, and has two children. She is ostracized by her family, and eventually ends up in Canada with her children.After her death, her daughter, Jeanne (Mélissa Désormeaux-Poulin), travels back to find her brother and father. The journey, the stories, are more and more incredible as the story goes on. There was one point where I thought the unbelievable would happen - and it did!A story that can only happen in war. Absolutely incredible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tasty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was exquisite. There are some slow-moving parts -- low-action shots of say the lead actor swimming, or traveling through the Mid East's dry arid land.There were repeated flashbacks in which it was sometimes hard to tell if it was the mother or daughter since they had similar looks. Flashbacks were done judiciously, sensitively, subtly, without giving the audience hard, obvious evidence in the quest to "solve" this retroactive mystery. A tearjerker with some action, violence, rape, but it was a character study too. The notary/executor was great, and this opened up another world to me too, and it lets one have a new view of this profession. I liked that the notary had a "colleague" in the MidEast.The references to historic events in the country where this film was set, closely resembled the history of South Lebanon (which goes without being named) in the late 1900s. My knowledge is nil here but I seem to recall a multitude of complex, external forces involved in what's referred to as the Lebanese "Civil War." Some of the actors, like Christians and Palestinians, are correctly identified though. Hatred for Palestinian refugees by the "Lebanese" is a prime driver in launching the plot.This is the birthplace of Lebanese-Canadien writer Wajdi Mouawad, who wrote the play "Incendies (Scorched)," upon which this film is based. There is a maddening subtext of logic and math. In fact there was one statement, something to the effect of, "everything happened precise logic" (in that country), which would be why your standard warlord would have encyclopedic knowledge of something decades past.The heroine is a math professor's is training to teach math. And he tells her, "For this quest you'll great intuition. That, you have, and that's why you'll be a great mathematician." Later, the simplest arithmetic problem known to man, grates, repeatedly, and actually sums up the entire plot of the film. I didn't get this part at first. Oddly, Mr. Mouawad has a straight-up fine arts background, but I'm guessing he was once involved in math, science, or technology. There's even a very brief mention of a cabdriver who has an engineering degree.I partially agree with Ebert about that part of the start of the quest was a plot device or Deus Ex Machina. But it doesn't matter since the plot is really interesting, as layers of reality of the young siblings' history are peeled away, to the denouement. Ebert gave this a 3-1/2 of 4 stars. IMDb gave it an 8.2 of 10 stars.English subtitles. I speak Arabic and French an it was an added bonus to me that most the movie was in these two languages. Not keen on Radiohead -- one of their songs in any movie is too much for me.Watch this stunning, award-winning film. You will puzzle, sigh, laugh, cry -- and you will not be let down.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having received rave reviews and been familiar with the quality of Denis Villeneuve's work, especially in Polytechnique, I did what I do rarely and bought this without having seen it previously. I was not disappointed in the least.War. Death. The story starts strong and will bring you to a voyage in space, time, thought and emotion along with the characters. The writing, directing, editing and cinematography are outstanding. The acting is rather natural and from the gut. Many scenes feel so real and personal. At times you may feel dirty as a urinal. This is not a feel good movie. This is a hard movie that deserves to be seen. It beautifully explores the ugliness of war. It shows that intolerance, hate and bigotry passed down by generations and cultural conditioning are hindering our quality of life and depriving as of true respect &amp; dignity in our dim human condition. This is true everywhere, even in Canada where the quality of life, physical security and cultural openness are arguably among the very best in the world.The story's backdrop balances between realities of peace, education and prosperity and plunges us through the chaos of rejection, violence, fear and family feud in search of redemption and truth. We see a nondescript Arab country with a Christian minority's imprint on its people. We are reminded of recent or ongoing similar situations in the Middle East and Africa, but also in Europe and Asia in the not so distant past. Yugoslavia, Cambodia, etc. Discrimination, children army, murders, massacres,etc. The best humankind has to offer or so it seems...This story goes there, dark, deep, dangerously borderline depressing, yet with a unflinching conviction that telling the tale and finding the truth may not actually liberate, but may allow us to get it straight. Perhaps to finally get it right.There are many symbols and silent unsaid commentaries in the movie, but the narrative also speak volumes in many ways. The reflection is real and relevant. How can we live and leave a better future for our children? How can we brake the destructive and devastating cycle of war and hate?As if the movie was not enough, we are also privy to Ana?s Barbeau-Lavalette's stunning making-of documentary :Se souvenir des cendres - Regards sur Incendies http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1756720/ which takes a life of its own with revealing interviews,crisp cinematography, eloquent editing, poetic vision and spellbinding storytelling. It is easily the best making-of documentary I have ever seen.For all these reasons go buy it. Sell your weapon if you have to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Searching a mother's past revives Lebanese tragedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lebanese-Canadian Nawal Marwan (Lubna Azabal) has passed away. She was at the swimming pool, started staring off into space, and then slowly faded away in the hospital. She has left behind her twins, Jeanne and Simon, who are in their early '20s. To them, their mother was a secretary to a local notary, liked to swim, and that is all. Their mother does not have a past, at least not one which she ever brings up in conversation. There is no father in the picture and the twins assume he died back in Lebanon during the war.At the reading of Nawal's will, the twins receive startling news. Their mother has left instructions for them to deliver two letters, one to their father and one to their brother, relations which they know nothing about. The twins take the newfound discovery in completely different ways. Jeanne (Melissa Desormeaux-Poulin) accepts what her mother wants her to do and takes off for Lebanon, a place that is familiar to her only from textbooks. Her brother, Simon (Maxim Gaudette), refuses to have any part of this nonsense and wants to stay out of the affair altogether. For Simon, his mom may have had some alternate, hidden past, but that was not who she was to him. She was a Canadian secretary, not some Lebanese village girl.I will reveal absolutely nothing about what comes next, that is for the audience to discover right along with Jeanne. As Jeanne slowly pieces together the facts of her mother's previous life in Lebanon, the film cuts to Nawal in the past and shows her experiences firsthand. The children start the plot of Incendies; however, Nawal gets most of the screen time. Furthermore, the film does not take time to explain what the war in early 1970s Lebanon was all about. It assumes the audience is familiar with the right-wing Christian militias and the Palestinian refugee camps in the south. If you are not, it may help you to read about the different sides beforehand so you will not waste time during the film trying to sort it out.This is very well written script and the acting is high-quality. What the film lacks is a score. There are two Radiohead songs played in the film which fit in nicely and help shape their introspective scenes. On the other hand, the rest of film is sparse, just dialogue and scenery. This is most likely what the director (Denis Villeneuve) intended, but a memorable score would have gone a long way in helping the events portrayed here land with a deeper impact. The choice of two mellow, thoughtful Radiohead songs though was a very good idea.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a very intriguing story. Most of it takes place in war-torn Lebanon.The plot concerns the will of a mother for her twin children ? a boy and girl - both raised in Montreal. They must return to Lebanon to fulfill this will and in so doing, they unravel parts of their family past they were never aware of. The story weaves back and forth between the life of the mother growing up in her native country and the daughter during her first sojourn to Lebanon. It was somewhat difficult for me, at times, to distinguish between mother and daughter in these alternating scenes.This is a film that does require close attention. It starts off rather hesitantly in Montreal and slowly develops into a full-fledged story with many rewards. But there are excruciating scenes ? not a film for young children. One very potent scene is when the daughter returns to the village of her mother. The village women, upon finding out her identity, refuse any further communication with her. This sets the stage for the many layers of the puzzle needing to be resolved. And there is resolution at the end.All and all a most worthwhile experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Arab Spring's origins</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>World attention throughout much of this year has focused on uprisings in the Arab world. The Tunisian people forced the country's dictator to flee, and the Egyptian people overthrew Hosni Mubarak, while protests continue in Bahrain and Yemen.However, it's important to understand the roots of these uprisings. Denis Villeneuve's "Incendies" shows some examples. The movie focuses on Nawan Marwal (Lubna Azabal), an Arab immigrant in Quebec whose final wish is for her son and daughter to give some information to their father (whom they have never met) and their brother (who they never knew existed). So begins the children's journey to find out why their mother fled her native country.The native country is never identified, although it appears to be Lebanon. And in finding out what Nawan saw in her native country -- told in flashback -- we see some VERY ugly stuff. The movie leaves practically nothing to the imagination. But it's all part of the children's learning the family history. And certainly, the horror that Nawan witnessed should give the audience an idea of why the Arab world has been rising up for the past six months (in that respect, it probably would have been appropriate to give "Incendies" Best Foreign Language Film). Above all, it's a very good movie, although very gut-wrenching.Also starring Mélissa Désormeaux-Poulin, Maxim Gaudette, Rémy Girard and Allen Altman.</fullReview>

It goes along well with other moronic attempts such as Jolie's film about the war in Bosnia. This "masterpiece" is set in an inexistent land (?), with the political situation and other circumstances resembling to those of Lebanon. The resemblance with the real life stops there. What follows is a chain of unrealistic and senseless occurrences, which aim to shock the viewer, but it is actually going from bad to worse each minute. All in all, this is pathetic attempt to elucidate the sense of human suffering and get an insight in destructive forces within through the portray of society in a spiral of violence.

"Incendies" (or "Scorched" in English) is from Canada, with the dialog mainly in French and several Middle Eastern languages. I am thankful that this movie got that Oscar nomination, or else I would have missed a very well-plotted and executed dramatic film.This movie starts very slowly with the reading of a very strange will. Upon her death, a mother instructs her twin children to deliver mysterious two mysterious letters to their father and a brother they never knew. Only upon accomplishment of this request will she allow a tombstone with her name engraved to be placed on top of her grave. This quest brings the twins Jeanne and Simon out of the comforts of Montreal, Canada into the harsher world of Lebanon as they discover the intricately tragic life their mother had.Despite the slow pace, the story is very compelling as the story shifts from the present into the past and back following the life of Nawal Marwan, and her children's quest. You will intently follow the progression of the story as facts unfold piece by piece until the jaw- dropping major revelations towards the end. The Director handles the story with much control such that the audience's interest and attention are held to the very end. This story was told in the best possible way.An excellent film! Compared to the eventual Oscar winner "In A Better World," I would say that this film "Incendies" was a better film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Fire," "burnings," a strange family history and a parable of sectarian war</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you watch the French Canadian director Denis Oscar-nominated filmIncendies -- and it is worth watching ? prepare for something long, literally dark, and shocking. The film, adapted from a play by the celebrated young Canadian-Lebanese playwright Wajdi Mouwawad but expanded into a film rich in Middle East location (and in Arabic as well as French dialogue) delves deeply into the hidden past of a family of Lebanese origin. A mother from Lebanon, Nawal Marwan (Lubna Azabal) dies at 60. Her twin son Simon (Maxim Gaudette) and daughter Jeanne (Mélissa Désormeaux-Poulin ) go before a notary for whom their mother also worked, Jean Lebel (Rémy Girard) and they receive instructions in the form of two sealed letters, one for a brother and one for a father. This is incredible news for the twins. They thought their father died a heroic death and they knew nothing of a brother. Nawal also requests that she be buried naked in the ground, face down, without a coffin. Simon is angered by all this and rejects it. Jeanne wants to comply with their mother's wishes. What follows intermixes flashbacks to the early life of Nawal with sequences about Jeanne's quest, which Simon eventually joins. For reasons not entirely clear to me, the name "Lebanon" is never mentioned, though it is clear that violent fighting between Christians and Muslims and a country where educated Arabic-speaking people also tend to speak French mark the setting as Lebanese. (Actual location shooting was mostly done in Jordan.) Here it is meant to be a fictional country called "Foad," though it could still have been universal, at least for countries of long war and savage factional conflict, without the fiction that it was not what it plainly is. Rape, torture, genocide and dislocation dominate this world, whose distance from the experience of Jeanne and Simon we can only guess at. Incendies is powerful and absorbing and while the images of war are familiar from many films, what holds them together is the detective-story trajectory that we cannot reveal and is a discovery even Nawal herself comes to until shortly before her death.Eventually we see the deceased protagonist watch her lover shot in front of her, then gives birth to a child who's immediately taken from her, then is the sole survivor of a bus shot up by Christian militiamen, later is imprisoned and repeatedly raped. It's all a bit much, but it's so stunningly staged and shot that you rarely question it. You only wish the two siblings investigating their mother's secret, violent past were more interesting or more involved.One of the first flashback sequences reveals what the twins will only realize later: that the heroic father who died in a moment of strife, a Muslim refugee despised by Nawal's Christian siblings, was actually the father of their older brother, not them, and that older brother was taken away from Nawal because born out of wedlock, but tattooed with three dots on the heel so she may recognize him one day. Those dots will be connected. I wish they hadn't been.More flashbacks show Nawal going in search of her lost son, sent to a Christaian orphanage burnt in reprisal by Muslim militias, but the orphans were saved -- somewhere. Nawal volunteers with a Muslim militia in hopes of finding the boy, and is jailed, for 15 years, where she is known as "the woman who sings" and is so resilient no cruelty, including rape, causes her to crack. Informants' accounts to Jeanne alternate with images of Nawal herself. I couldn't help being reminded of Ana Ularu, in the Romanian film Outbound, just seen, who also is a spare, stony-faced young woman in search of a young boy who's been put in an orphanage. But Nawal must endure greater tests. I can well believe the assertion of Peter Debruge in his Variety review that Villeneuve "excises entire blocks of text" in the transfer from play to film. Instead there are many striking images, often in a soft semidarkness that underlines the mystery the twins are unraveling. Debruge further suggests that Villeneuve lets us draw our own conclusions and speak our own words where the playwright Mouwawad spelled everything out in long monologues. Whatever one may think of the thorny tragic and tendentious plot whose final revelation strains credulity, and however excessive the measured pace of the 130-minute film is at times, Villeneuve has realized the play on film in a bold and richly cinematic manner and his accomplishment has already gained festival kudos and the justified admiration of cinephiles.Incendies could have been a better film if it allowed itself to breathe and curbed some of its drawn-out and less necessary sequences. Perhaps it could have taken a moment to smile, yea, even in the world of near-biblical suffering. Ultimately the source play shakes you up while lecturing you and the film does the same. One is fascinated by the plot twists and can see their poetic justice without consenting to believe them all. Some of the truths of war and sectarianism might ring truer if not all so neatly tied into the detective-story search for family origins. I think often in this kind of context of Claire Denis's The Intruder and Arnaud des Palli?res 2003 Adieu, multi-level films about family and wrongdoing whose failures to connect all the dots make them richer and more memorable and perhaps more truly cinematic. Perhaps only a disturbing and never-explained opening sequence in Incendies of boys having their head shaved to the tune of Radiohead's "You and Whose Army" has that quality of boldly evoking inexplicable but dangerously real worlds. Seen and reviewed as part of New Directors/New Films, the series co-presented by the Film Society of Lincoln Center and MoMA, New York March 22-April 3, 2011.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horrifying at times but a gripping story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It would help if from the beginning, you were aware that this movie is mostly involved with the vicious Lebanon civil war between the Moslems and the Christians. It make take a bit to become completely oriented as the movie does consist of alternating stories in different time. It also doesn't help that it is mostly in French with English subtitles. But eventually we got the hang of it and the very unusual plot which we are introduced to at the beginning as twins Jeanne and Simon are being read their mother's will and realize she has asked them to carry out her final wishes and deliver two letters on her behalf. Their task seems almost as difficult as finding a needle in a haystack. If you don't mind fiction being stranger than the really terrible things that happen to people in these type of wars, the movie provides a gripping story. It is horrifying at times with what should be an unexpected ending. It provides lessons of persistence, forgiveness, motherly love and an appreciation that any one of us if we were switched at birth, could be quite the opposite of the person we turned out to be. The movie, which was co-written and directed by Denis Villeneuve, received recognition with several film festival awards and was nominated for an Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film.(2011)FilmRap.net</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie moves you completely.It is a very intriguing movie that got me glued till the end. Every scene in the movie is important and has linkages to what happened earlier / what will happen later in the course of the movie. The movie depicts background of Palestine at the time the war broke and how it linked many characters in the movie through one woman.It is a first movie of Denis Villeneuve i have seen but it made sure that I would research and see more of his work.Lubna Azabal is totally into the character that she plays. She doesn't have verbose dailogues. Yet her fantastic facial expressions and her emotions speak volume about what she goes through in different phase of her life. Mélissa Désormeaux-Poulin and Maxim Gaudette also do justice to their roles in the sense how their perspective on their mother changes and how the respect towards her only grows more and more as they come closer and closer to the what happened to their mother. All in all a great movie to watch. However this movie is not for a mass audience. If you like and intellectual movie with a strong serious storyline then you can definitely go for it. I give it 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting but frustrating at times</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film got off to a difficult start for me. Having spent time in the Middle East the initial sequences were frustrating as I was trying to work out where the film was set. Also the fictional war between Christians and Muslims was not realistic, which added to my confusion. I couldn't 'normalise' this film then.Once I got over that, accepting it is a work of fiction or alternative history it them became easier to take on faceout of kilter value. The story was poignant and depicted human trials in a very realistic and gritty manner.The story is set around Nawal - a Lebanese(?) woman who has her first child taken from her at birth and years later in Canada has a nervous breakdown leading to her death. In her will she charges her twins to search for their father, and brother (whom they did not know about) to give them each a letter in a sealed envelope.Jeanne (the daughter) is prepared to do this but her brother Simon is reluctant and she sets off alone to the Middle East to begin the search.I'll say no more regarding the plot except that the search uncovers surprising events in their mother's past and a traumatic conclusion.Given the volatility of the region in which the story is set the events depicted could well have happened, but that she would send her children off on such a mission is not so believable.Overall cinematography is beautiful and I thought the script and acting was excellent. A good film but not, in my opinion, the great one that some are saying it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Imagine When 1 + 1 Doesn't Equal 2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is recommended. Imagine there's no countries, It isn't hard to do, Nothing to kill or die for, And no religion too. -Lyrics from John Lennon's Imagine Religion has always been a unifying and emotional force to some and a polarizing and divisive one to others. It has shaped and guided our world with the holiest of words and actions and also destroyed and misled many under the philosophical guise of good and godliness. It has provided insight and strength to one group while blinding and weakening another with overt powers over its most devout believers. This dualism is ever present in the thought-provoking Oscar nominated foreign film, Incendies, directed by Denis Villeneuve. We are forced to examine the far-reaching effect of religion and its aftereffects in its tale of two siblings who begin a spiritual journey to fulfill their mother's last wishes. The plot involves a twin brother and sister who are forced to confront their mother's past deeds and secretive life. Jeanne and Simon ( Melissa Desormeaux and Maxim Gaudette ) are given two letters from their dead mother, Newal ( Lubna Azabal ). They are asked to locate their brother who they never knew had existed and deliver an envelope to him and also find their lost father. This request takes Jeanne to a Middle Eastern country as she tries to unravel the mystery while Simon looks elsewhere. Told in flashback, mostly from Newal's point of view, we learn about her unknown past and her loves. Just as Jeanne and Simon unravel the threads of her lifestory, we discover the impact that politics and religion formed upon her mother and Newal's ultimate choices that led her to a violent conflicted existence. The film takes its bleak depressing subject matter and immerses itself directly into the world of civil wars, martyrs, violence, and religious zealots. Director Villeneuve successfully shows this clash of cultures between Christians and Muslims and the consequences of hatred and pointless bloodshed throughout the years. However, he weakens his own film by allowing some scenes to go on too long, causing less tension and suspense with his narrative. With his cumbersome flashback structure, he also divulges key evidence in the ongoing investigation to the movie audience before his present day characters can unravel the intricacies of the mystery itself. ( I, for one, figured out the supposedly shocking climax with a half hour left before the film's end credits appeared. ) Still, the film contains powerful images, mostly when dealing with the film's violent nature ( a bus and its passengers set afire, close-ups of battered and bruised legs of political prisoners, a frightened child cold-bloodedly shot as she tries to flee for safety ) and strong performances by its cast, especially Lubna Azabel as the sad and tortured woman whose death begins this tale. Incendies presents both worlds with a haunting clarity, one steeped in traditions and servitude and another trying to break free of its bonds. This is serious and fearless filmmaking that leaves one feeling moved and helpless at the same time. The moviegoer leaves the theater hoping the world will live as one, even if the equation can never be solved. GRADE: B</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Ending to a Slow Convoluted Slog</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know I am in the minority regarding this widely acclaimed film, but after reading a review of "In A Better World" saying how terrible it was compared to this and the other nominated foreign films of 2010, I was expecting this film to be much better than I felt it actually is. Let me say that I realize it is ambitious and well acted, but it is done in a manner that I find rather annoying, that is where a mystery requires the principals to find something in the past, and everyone they encounter at first is reluctant to help, and then seems to be able to supply an additional bit of information, which leads to the next encounter. They rarely encounter dead ends, and their mother escapes one treacherous moment after another, much like Indiana Jones, or the Bourne films, which I find unlikely and ultimately empty at the core. I know those films are very popular, so if you like those, you will probably like this slower paced one. However, the ending was indeed different, and quite interesting. Had the ending been predictable from the start I would have rated this a 2 or 3, as it also kept switching from the present to flashbacks without the viewer realizing which it was, making the first half of the film hard to follow. I admit I prefer movies that try to tell a straightforward story, and if they use flashbacks, it is fine if they signal it someway. For me, "In a Better World" was the masterpiece. This was just a well made overlong formulaic indie with a terrific ending which almost made the trip worthwhile, but not quite.</fullReview>

I guess this movie was given extra credit because: it is a "author" movie, and it is about a harsh Arab tragedy.The story and actors are not bad. The cut of the movie is.The director needs to cut its movie so the story can really flow. In Incendies many scenes are long with unnecessary still picture, or traveling.The "Author" would say you need time to convey a story with feelings. BS.

		<shortDescription>Another Muslim Propaganda Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can understand some of the attraction to 'Incendies,' as there are some well crafted elements of the film, including beautiful cinematography, superb acting, and a story that immediately draws the viewer into the world of its troubled characters. But what I find inexplicable, as well as frightening, is how so many people who have seen 'Incendies' appear incapable of seeing it for what it is, i.e., a Muslim propaganda film. While the protagonist of the story is an Arab Christian, her character clearly serves no other purpose than as a medium for illustrating completely unprovoked evils of her own people against the Muslims, who are all portrayed in this film as the most perfectly innocent victims one could possibly imagine. It is worth noting that the lead actress in Incendies also played a major role in 'Paradise Now,' a Palestinian film in which it is the Jews who are portrayed as the unprovoked tormentors of the Muslim people. While there have in fact been incidents of violence against Muslims by non-Muslims, there is a long and indisputable history of Muslims committing acts of violence upon not only non-Muslims but each other. And while I've seen much passion, beauty and poetry in films written by Muslims, I have unfortunately never seen a single one that even attempts to show any sympathy whatsoever with non-Muslims or that places any responsibility whatsoever upon the Muslim people for any kind of problem facing them. But equally disheartening is how many people--including some of those who are the objects of the lopsided demonization portrayed in so many Muslim-made films--subscribe to such blatant hatred and lies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing Considering All Those Genies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was expecting a lot more especially after all the awards the film has received. I was curiously zoning out in the middle act - the movie wandered about in the desert (literally)and I did not feel engaged by the characters at all.There seems to be some sort of ying-yang morality tale going on judging by the ending, but it lacked real emotional punch. I felt manipulated by the story. This was an extreme situation and maybe it was just too hard to suspend my disbelief. Given the source material, I'm not sure they could have done much.Having re-watched the Hurt Locker the night before I saw this film, I found that the cinematography lacks the clarity and point of view that Kathryn Bigelow's film does. I'm surprised that this film won the Genie award for editing and cinematography - it must have been a slow year in Canadian cinema.I found Villeneuve sliding into some Gus Van Sant territory - deliberately infuriating shot setups meant to imply something greater than whats on the screen.</fullReview>

In Lebanon, Palestinian refugee camps were good and Christians were amorally ethnocentric in trying to uphold traditional values. War is bad, except when it is the topic of a film, in which case it leads to self-discovery, which is good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>INCENDIES-- If you can watch the film right through, you will be properly horrified by the inhumanity of man to man, and the fierce grimness of life, for simple people in a barbarous middle-eastern wasteland of destruction. But first you will be baffled and frustrated by the breaks in continuity, in location, and in action... A swimming pool,empty--then suddenly with one glamorous female swimming under water, (used no doubt for "artistic symbolism"); then oddly populous; then a hospital scene. Incoherence, and grimness, are the keynotes.The "twins" introduced near the outset, are given a heart-rending puzzle to solve when their mother's strange will is read out. Jump cuts offer no help to the viewer trying to follow this trail. But the prevailing mood of tragedy, danger, hostility pervades.Against the film-world hype and "glamour" of the award (director's interview among the Extras), I find it to be artistically self-indulgent, the director drawing on the pathos of tragedy in order to display his originality and talent.</fullReview>

Child murder, mass slaughter, sons raping mothers - who wants to tolerate that sort of barbaric behaviour??? Not only is the storyline so extremely fetched,physically and emotionally violent and so sick and twisted that you can't actually believe what you're watching, but there is a really dangerous religious message to the story too. There are a lot of annoying things about the film too, like where are they? Why do they fight? which time are we in? It keeps going back and forth in time. Why does the son look about 40 when he was meant to be abput 19 and then doesn't recognise the woman he raped systematically? Why are the "twins" supremely intelligent being a product of their brother and mother- surely they would have some birth defects being so closely related? Why do none of them age in appearance throughout the film, making it impossible to gauge what's going on? And what on earth is the 1+1=1 about???I pity the person who's troubled mind could even make up such a story...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I mean what is this movie about? It starts already with a theatrical mysterious will of the mother setting protagonists and us unfortunate viewers on a quest to uncover the MYSTERY. Of course, the quest into the past of the family brings our heroes to what seems like Lebanon and here the second story line starts telling about the HORRIBLE FAMILY PAST during of course the tragic events of the Lebanese civil war. But the second storyline twists and turns and wherever it goes it is just one boring unbearable scene after another. The massacres, the rape, family violence, hatred between the Muslims and Christians,- all this abounds in the movie but what lacks is actually any attempt to look deep into the conflict, to what caused it. Why did Christians and Muslim communities start the war? Who were the actors, who benefited from it, how did this madness happen? I mean, if you decide to touch upon this particular historical event, which is so traumatic for Lebanon, why not actually try to look at it deep, see the different sides, pick up some real drama/ I am sure any documentary about the war is much more satisfying in showing the psychology and the devious mechanism that drives people to start such atrocious conflicts.But instead we are treated to the mind boggling i nits perversity family story that is just so ridiculous and grotesque one can't get anything out of it. I mean, it's gore pure and simple, and is created solely for shock value. There are no nuances here, no real dialogs, no complex interplay of emotions. There is an attempt to say war sucks, but we all know it and there has been a gazillion of better movies on that topic. What we want is something original, fresh, subtle, personal.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is overall a "nice" movie with a deep message about wars and a few clever analogies, but it is somewhat too far fetched and unbelievable. Several movies like this one have been made, where a person is torn between two religions or ethnic groups since their birth and confronted to their origins when going on a quest (Greek vs. Turks, Armenian vs. Turks, etc.), but they don't need Radiohead to be entertaining. This movie shouldn't either. I also don't like movies that rely on spectacular coincidences. With everything else, it completely threw me off.Last but not least, the whole mathematical parallel was clumsy and appeared as a sign of "trying too hard" to be "deep" on too many levels. Anyone having studied maths at university will find the professors' characters (both Lebanese and French/Canadian) unreal. Maybe this worked better when it was a play. One can easily see the classic tragic themes and elements. But I didn't see it then.</fullReview>
