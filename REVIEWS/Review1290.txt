		<shortDescription>The Purrfect Summer Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In case there is any doubt, there are cats, real ones, in Nine Lives not zombies/vampires/ax-wielding psychopaths (choose one) that come alive every nine years to terrorize a village/teens/family (choose one) with blood and gore abound. So unless you at least like cats a little, you may not like Nine Lives. But I can tell you that the kids in the audience I was in--loved it. And so did the adults who came to the movie with me. (Yeah, OK, I admit we like cats.) And I think in the end that may be all that matters. What saddens me are the many critics, and wannabe critics who are trashing, and I mean trashing, this film. Now that they have had their opinions and comments, everyone has a right to MY opinions and comments. Here are a few... I grew up going to see Disney live action family comedy/fantasy films such as The Shaggy Dog (to which this film is similar), The Absent Minded Professor, Son of Flubber, the Love Bug films and so on. (I think the great theatre actress Helen Hayes was in a Love Bug.) Were these Oscar caliber films? No, they were made to be good family entertainment. Did Oscar award winning actors appear in them...you bet your life they did. If in doubt, check IMDb for the casts of Disney live action films made in the 50's 60's and 70's. I liked the characters in the film, their connections to each other, and the love shown throughout the film. (Note: I am not mentioning Kevin Spacey, Christopher Walken, Jennifer Garner et al. here, because I saw them as characters not actors. One of the criticisms of the film is that some critics could not believe a certain actor(s) would make this kind of film or play that kind of part. That is not a criticism. Actors play all kinds of characters. It's their job. So I look at how well they played the characters. Were the characters believable? I admit there is some broad character acting. This is not uncommon, however, in a fantasy/comedy, especially one playing to a kid audience. So taking this into consideration?were they believable for a comedy/fantasy film? Yes. Back to what I liked about the characters--I loved that the daughter clearly loved BOTH her mother and her neglectful father. I loved that the ex wife and wife, both very different people, were friends. I loved that the older step brother loved his younger step sister, loved his father and was loyal to him despite the rude things his father said to him. I loved that family love remained constant, although wavering at times, even when the head of the family had a difficult time sharing his love with them. In a cynical world, this kind of family love does not exist, but we can hope for it.Third, I liked the story. Nine Lives is a comedy but it is also a fantasy. I think this is what some of the critics forget. Fantasy requires that we believe things that may not be possible or logical. If we believe all the things Harry Potter and his friends did, why can't we believe a man could change places with a cat to learn a lesson. (By the way, one of the professors in Harry Potter could change into a cat?and she was an Academy Award/Emmy winner.) I do think the business story about the tallest building was weak, but I think that may matter more to adults than kids. (And, who knows it might be the kind of thing that might matter to someone like, say...Mr. Trump.) This part of the story gave an opportunity for the villain(s)to be established, and again for the son to show his loyalty and love for his father and his father's ultimate love for him. Fourth, and this is a personal/technical thing...it was not animated, except for CG effects. I love animated films. Some of my favorite films are animated. In fact there was 15 minutes of nothing but animated film previews before this film started. I felt it was nice to see actual humans...and cats...for a change. Thankfully, too, the cat's mouth is not animated to look like it's talking. There is no Academy Award to-be-nominated song, although I did like "Three Cool Cats".So I can't trash this film. It made me laugh. It made me feel good. The underlying message is simple, love your family...if you are human, you only live once so do it right. And if this message is cliché, it can't be said enough, especially in these times. So, if just this is enough motivation for you or you and your kids to see it...Don't paws, go! PS: By the way, real cats are not allowed in the movie theatre. They will need to wait for the DVD. But I hear that stuffed toy cats are welcome.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a light-hearted comedy! Unlike Star Treks and the likes or cheesy teens comedies, easy to sit through. Good not only for teens, though a bit offensive for cats. Acting and casting are not for disappointments! I rate it 9 lives +1 for its longer life and against dog lovers' low ratings discriminating, habitually, against little cats on the big screen! After all, it is thought-provocative, with a cat character brought to life by a compelling and intelligent cat star. Young actress Malina Weissman as Tom's daughter Rebecca is sweet and innocent childlike. The movie is absolutely Underrated! Pre-paid bad publicity?((((((</fullReview>

Clean movie.Christopher Walken played the part of a mysterious man with mystical connections who runs a pet shop with cats. These cats can become receptacles for humans who need to learn what's really important in life.Keven Spacey plays the billionaire whose greatest dream is to build the tallest building in North America.Jennifer Garner is the wife and mother. Their little girl wants a kitten for her birthday. Dad is not happy with that but ends up getting a cat.Don't want to say much more or I'll spoil the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>its not as bad as people say</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've read some awful reviews about this movie and my expectations were set low. I was expecting to be dragged by my kids to a mix of "Baby Geniuses 2" and "Battlefield Earth". But I was pleasantly surprised. This movie won't win any Oscars, but its a reasonable kids movie. Kids liked it, and I was OK with it. Yes, the plot is predictable, and the jokes are pretty flat, but they are geared toward 10 year olds and adults who really like cats, and that is what is expected from a kids movie about a cat. If you hate cats, well, don't see it, see "Shaggy Dog" instead, its virtually the same plot, except its a different type of a pet. I think this movie is OK and I look forward to seeing new incarnations of the same plot in the future movies, such as "Being Goldie" (hint, hint movie studio, in about 10 years we will be ready for another one of those plots)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Calling all Cat Lovers - You have to watch this!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We almost didn't watch this movie because the ratings were so bad, I am sorry I waited this long! I went with my sister and my kids aged 10 and 7, we laughed the whole way through! It was such a funny movie. I loved all the characters, especially frustrated Mr. Fuzzy Pants..! The supporting characters were great especially Christopher Walken and Cheryl Hines. Jennifer Garner and the girl cast as her daughter were beautiful and perfectly cast. Yes the story was a little predictable, but it didn't matter..the cat antics were hysterical, cat lovers and Kevin Spacey lovers will enjoy this film. We wanted an enjoyable family, summer movie and we got it!! PLEASE go watch this movie! It's a great last hurrah before school starts :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much Better Than I Expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My girlfriend made sad faces at me until I agreed to go and see this with her today. And the movie is much, much better than I had anticipated from the trailers and promos I had seen (read: been shown against my will). I went in with a bad attitude and was pleasantly surprised. Some cheap CGI is to be expected, but doesn't ruin the movie.THE TRAILERS DO A TERRIBLE JOB OF ADVERTISING THE STRENGTHS OF THE FILM. It's a surprisingly mature and well-developed plot, and doesn't dwell too long on either the sappy bits or the humor. It is very plot-driven, and has nicely well-developed main characters (except the cartoonish villain). All of the movie both makes sense and flows very well. I rather liked Mr Spacey's character arc over the course of the movie, just the right amount of jerk at the beginning, and not too much lovey-dovey at the end. Mr Amell does a very good job as an aspiring businessman &amp; under-appreciated son, though again the villain he plays against is weak. Ms Weissman plays a solid rich-kid middleschooler, though I suspect the part was intended to be a younger child. And most importantly, Christopher Walken's character was NOT overused or trite like the previews suggested. Unfortunately, there were some 'love or not' fakeouts with Ms Garner, but oh well. When you size it up against the in-genre competition, it frankly blows it all away. Not necessarily a 'children's movie' like you might expect, and worth the price of admission. My girlfriend would like to add that the 'celebrity cat cameos' are too short, which seems like a good thing to me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hoping for not having 8 prequels!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So Men In Black director, Barry Sonnenfeld goes from aliens to cats and just like in MiB fashion, it's CGI rich. We follow Kevin Spacey who's the super wealthy, power-hungry business man who supposedly neglects his wife and daughter due to being completely company driven. It's a story not dissimilar from an Ebenezer Scrooge though he becomes trapped in a cat with voice over style of Look Who's Talking Now, and has to earn family favour by reestablishing relationships with his family.There's little explanation of the curse, giving little detail away about the actual title of the movie, but seems insignificant by the time you figure it out and a lot of it doesn't really add up on the emotional level. Spacey, those cat narrative is incredibly poor, doesn't actually seem that too bad a guy and young supergirl Malina Weissman doesn't seem that neglected or annoyed with the arrangement.&nbsp;It has a needless complicated family set-up which whilst it's not far from reality, it's possibly inappropriate for a family film. In fact there's quite a few tasteless acts in the film like attempting to taser a cat and binning the furry feline in a garage bin. We have Cheryl Hines (The Ugly Truth) playing his ex-wife who comes to the family home, in semi-amicable fashion to be company for younger model wife #2 Jennifer Garner.&nbsp;Christopher Walken repeats his character from Click as Mr. Purrkins, the cat whisperer and gets to perform his trademark jig. (I'm sure it's a clause in his no-role-refusal policy that he must be allowed to dance, even for a little bit.)&nbsp;The film loses its way very quickly and pounces from catdad trying to convince the family he's trapped in the cat, to Ian, who's trying to take advantage of the situation and steal the company from him, similar to Meet Joe Black. Ian, played by Mark Consuelos is reminiscent of characters frequently played by Dominic West or Jeremy Piven, that egotistical, arrogant and conniving back-stabber.&nbsp;There's unfortunately quite a few negative points about this movie, some which would get overlooked by younger audiences but I'm an advocate for educating through film so accuracy is important, such as wrongful defibrillation and using a mobile whilst driving already dangerously (couldn't help but notice the Lexus product placing) is rather bad for a family film. Only nice thing I can say about this film was the score from brothers Evgueni and Sacha Galperine and even that isn't amazing.&nbsp;I do believe Sonnenfeld and the writers forgot their main target audience, hearing a young girl in the cinema asking her mother what the Yellow Pages were and including subjects like divorce, corporate business and even a possible suicide is beyond family films. It's certainly aimed for cat people across the globe and even opens with a montage of viral cats videos, but it's one of Spacey's and Sonnefield's worse film to date, it's certainly far from purfect and lets just hope they make purquels of the other eight lives!&nbsp;Running Time:&nbsp;2 The Cast:&nbsp;4 Performance:&nbsp;3 Direction:&nbsp;2 Story:&nbsp;2 Script:&nbsp;2 Creativity:&nbsp;2 Soundtrack:&nbsp;5 Job Description:&nbsp;1 The Extra Bonus Point:&nbsp;-5 for inaccuracy and actual bad messaging.&nbsp;18% 2/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>funny and sweet! I lol'd!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a purrrrfect example of its genre, the "animal movie." The animal movie is designed to appeal to the "entire family" meaning it's really for adults but safe to bring the kids to see. The target audience is lovers of the specific animal who is the main character, in this case, a cat. It features the animal's behavior in both funny and serious ways. It may have an uplifting message or tone, even if it deals with serious situations. Yep, checkmarked all those perfectly.The point of view character is the dad, Brand, stuck in a cat's body. Brand is a rich guy obsessed with building a giant tower with his name on it, who likes to fly through the air and land on his tower. So basically he's Tony Stark as a dad. How would Tony Stark be as a dad? Well, not that great. Until he learns to embrace cat-hood. I think this movie may have been mis-marketed a bit. All the previous that ran ahead of it were kids' movies. But the person the viewer is supposed to identify with is the parent. There are kids in the movie, but the dad-cat is the character who has a growth and redemption arc and is the focus of most of the scenes. The movie deals with some serious subjects such as death and divorce. The plot turns on knowing the meaning and significance of terms like "articles of incorporation" which you will need to be able to read off the screen and immediately understand to get what's going on, so younger kids might not be able to follow all of what's happening in the plot. They'll still enjoy the cat antics, though.I loved the destructive cat stuff: the jumping around, knocking things over, scratching things up (and scratching people up) and I literally laughed out loud a few times. I think I laughed the loudest when Mr. Fuzzypants peed in Brand's ex-wife's purse. There were some internet celebrity cats featured in the movie, too. It was hilarious! Go see it if you like cats.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's the greatest movie ever!!!...If you love cats.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was the movie everyone sneaked into see after watching Suicide Squad. I kept thinking to myself, why would Barry Sonnenfeld make a movie like this?Also thinking that House of Cards star, Kevein Spacey could have landed himself a better between seasons gig. So what's going on?I'll tell you what's going on, that cat is the reason why you want to see this movie.Kevin Spacey's soul gets trapped into a cat thanks to Christopher Walken, because he's neglecting his family for his company. In his attempts to convince his family that he's the cat, he starts doing the cutest things, thus becoming the longest (Possibly the most expensive) Youtube cat video ever made .There was one scene when the Cat (With Kevin Spacey's voice), attempts to write a letter to his family stating he's stuck in the cat. When the cat picks up the pen, my eyes popped out of my socket. Sure, as he starts to write you realize that this is CGI, but I was hooked.From that moment on it became about when was this cat going to reappear on the screen. I should have known this was going to happen as the movie started out with clips of cat's on the internet.As great of as Spacey is at playing the jerk you can't help but to love, That cat was the real movie star here. Every time it shares a scene with the little girl playing Spacey's daughter in the movie I'm all like "so Cute".As you can tell I'm a cat lover. If you are a cat lover you might enjoy the film as much as I do. Other than that. it's literally ninety minutes of nothing only worth seeing if you have nine lives to live.http://cinemagardens.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why has this film been given such poor ratings? It is a lovely film, perfect for kids and adults alike. It is gentle, funny and charming. Visually it is a treat and the set designer deserves an award for producing such beautiful sets. Jennifer Garner never fails to charm and in this film and in this film she is perfectly matched with her little look alike daughter, Malina Weissman. Malina is perfectly cast and her future should be assured, based on her performance in this film. Cheryl Hines is very funny in her part of the ex-wife. Kevin Spacey is never my favorite actor, however he is perfectly cast as the self centered, uber successful business man, content to neglect his family. The film is funny with several laugh out loud moments. You don't have to be a cat lover to like the film but for those cat lovers out there you will recognize several famous cats. Overall it is a very enjoyable film. Go see it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For once in the summer of 2016 we had an opportunity to see a film that was not a sequel, prequel, remake, rehash, regurgitation or serialization of an other/previous film. i know Hollywood likes to bank on safety in Box-Office numbers but it was just nice to see something original. (where have all the screen writers gone?). And seeing this cast totally playing straight-person to felines: funny. (and fine acting too). Anyone who has a cat in their life will find this amusing. worth the price of the popcorn; i haven't laughed this loudly in the cinema for a long time. while we're on Box-Office: i wish the powers that be would NOT talk about films in terms of money made but tickets sold. the money figures will always get bigger as inflation is a fact of life. But are films selling as many tickets as they used to? End of rant.</fullReview>

I think I'd go for the buffet.There is a paucity of PG family style related movies these days, so maybe folks think the star power and rating is enough to draw everyone in.But there is nothing big screen around this admittedly grade B movie. It isn't that it is bad, it's that it's bad for the investment dollar of a public that still thinks, we're in the middle of the great Recession. Sorry, this would have done better as a NETFLIX original or HULU exclusive.Most of the $30M for this flick went for the stars. Frankly, I'd rather have seen lessor mortals, and the bill for the flick come in under $8M, which at that level would have been a blockbuster. There should be a venue for little movies like this.The next time folks want to go "B", if the stars want a cut, let them take points and suffer some of the risk. That is the way of the future, if you don't want folks waiting 60 days till Netflix or Hulu or AMZN sucks this up, with extras on the DVD, and commentary to make it all worth $15.

		<fullReview>Nine lives has a lot going for it. This movie stands out as one of the most funny of the season with great pratfalls and some great one-liners that are near pre-fect. There is a very nice build up to the transformation which most fantasy movies don't really develop much. There are some very well executed scenes of practical cat moves that are extended for per-fection. The emotional highs and lows are intense and meaningful. There are perhaps three logical flaws with the script that diminish the per-fection of the movie of (spoiler) how does the cat get out of its cage, why does the cat have to taken an alternative route to the Brand tower instead of just going with his son, and how does the son just somehow have a parachute (spoiler). Nonetheless Nine Lives is a perfect treat for young people, families, and pet lovers. This is summer Scrooge package for your summertime delight.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cute animal flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, the cat (or cats) in the role of "Mr. Fuzzypants" was endearing and comical. The movie has a simple story line: a self absorbed millionaire businessman, played by Kevin Spacey, is simply too, well, self absorbed and into the ultimate profit to pay attention to his pre-teen daughter or grown son so he finds himself transformed into a feisty feline at the suggested hands of Christoper Walken's quirky and mysterious pet store owner.Spacey-as-the-cat goes through some growing pains emotionally, getting into a lot of trouble and learning not to be a jerk to his neglected wife (Jennifer Garner) or his decent kids. There's some good acting support from Cheryl Hines as his ex-wife (the first one) who's also the mother of his grown son (Robbie Amell). Mark Consuelos is on hand as the figurative mustache twirling villain who wants to undermine his boss and steal the company.The start of this film is a bit slow while we learn about Spacey's desire for "the tallest building ever" or something like that but it gets rolling once he visits Walken and gets turned into the kitty. It's pretty cool seeing both Spacey and Walken in something light and amusing like this, considering they usually play darker or often, villainous roles.Cute movie, worth the trip to see. Don't expect anything Oscar- worthy or filled with tons of crap exploding at every turn because this isn't that film. Check it out if you have kids or if the kid inside you isn't too jaded or dead yet.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I kept trying to understand why it was so bad. I had a lot of time to wonder in the theater and liked the process because it distracted me from how very bad this was.It wasn't just that the dialogue was wooden and it seemed like Kevin Spacey (whom we all adore and is the reason I went to this picture) did his performance in over Skype while reading the script for the first time, or that the plot was so predictable you could leave, buy popcorn, apply for a refinance on your mortgage, come back and know exactly where you were - the movie is disturbing.The Big Bad Board was absolutely right. The story was so unbelievable even an 8-year-old will be asking: "Can you do that in two days? Or at all?"I have no idea what they did to that poor cat to make it walk "drunkenly" but it was horrible to see the fur all matted and strange - did they use masking tape? It was the director, I decided. He had to have told that girl to behave like a possessed, grinning animated walking dead ready to monster-morph and cook the cat for dinner. Pretty girl. I bet with the right part and director, she'd be delightful.Just ... don't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Strange Kids Movie that Fails at Being a Kids Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll start by saying that I am not the target audience for this movie. I'm a single 38 year old man who hates cats. I also am a minister and I was asked to go along with a youth group from my church, so I went, not really knowing what I was getting myself into--I thought the movie was animated right up until the time that it started.That said, this is a live action film starring Jennifer Garner and Kevin Spacey. The gist of the plot is that Spacey plays a business tycoon whose little girl wants a cat for her birthday--but before Spacey gets the gift to the party, he's involved in an accident that leaves his body in a coma and his soul trapped in the body of the cat.Yeah.So what to say about this movie. To state the pros, it could be worse. I've given it four stars because that seems about right--it's a bad movie, but there are worse movies that have been made. The acting isn't terrible, and there are a few laughs spread throughout the film. I suppose if you were a cat lover you might like it, although I must say that the lady in our group who is the biggest cat lover of all (and I'm talking like, her entire house is decorated in cat stuff and she currently has thirteen cats living in her home) didn't like the movie because she thought the scenes were a bit rough on the cat. Those scenes were obviously CGI effects, but still--you get the idea.As for the cons, again there's the "rough treatment of the cat thing". But the much larger issue for me was that this was a kids movie that just didn't know how to be a kids movie very well. I know I said above that I'm a minister, and so it would be easy to pigeonhole my next comment as my being a prude, but trust me, that's not the case. I'm just a reasonably smart adult who knows the difference between a movie made for kids and one that's not. And this movie falls flat in the whole kid friendly department. Again, this is a movie about a man being trapped in a cat's body, and it was extremely clear that the target audience here was kids. Yeah, well....read on.First off, there is enough of a weird vibe going on with this script that it almost borders on deranged in the first place. I said almost. I'm not one of those people that looks down my nose at Harry Potter or anything like that, and I get that the gist of the story is all in good fun--but there's this whole element of mysticism involved in this movie, what with the soul swap thing and a strange "cat whisperer" played by Christopher Walken (as if waiting expectantly for him to produce a gold watch out of his pocket wasn't bad enough). That said, there's this almost Halloweenish feel to the movie--despite its being happy go lucky and kid oriented throughout most of the film. So the vibe of the script is the first red flag.Then you get into some particulars. The cat gets drunk off of scotch at one point. OK, again, I'm no prude--but why make intoxication a source of humor for a kids movie? Or the couple of times that a swear word was almost used? "Son of a...." trailing off into nothing. The little boy behind me turned to his mother and said "Oh, he almost said a bad word!" Why even have that in a kids movie? OR, for that matter, at one point Spacey's character does in fact say "damn". OK, I get it. It's 2016, not 1956. And certainly there are other kid friendly movies that have used their fair share of light swear words. E.T. The Goonies. Ghostbusters, etc. None of those movies were as childish or as overtly marketed to kids as this one was, though.And finally, at the end of the film there's a scene in which it is strongly implied that a character is about to commit suicide. I won't spoil it for you, but the point is that to even imply something like that is a little heavy for a movie targeted to fourth graders, if you ask me.I'm sure if I wanted to nitpick I could think of a few more problematic scenes. The relationship between Garner and Spacey and Spacey's ex is a bit odd for a kids movie. In fact, as I'm finishing up this review, it's just now hit me what the problem is: Someone decided to combine a romantic comedy with a kids movie. That's it! This movie is half "Bridesmaids" and half Disney, and the result is a strange film that doesn't fit well into either of those genres, thus falling flat all the way around.All that said, again, there are worse movies that have been made. But this is a bad movie, and there are better things to spend your money on at the box office right now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Full of Laughs and Little Chuckles</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This fun film was full of laughs and little chuckles.Did the CGI look silly? Sometimes. Might casting have been different, maybe. Was it easy to catch on to where the story was going? It's possible.BUT, the cat is adorable. Christopher Walken is a hoot. The set design is crisp and classic. We almost passed on seeing this b/c of the mention that the character is like Donald Trump. Sure there are some parallels to him, but thankfully this was not really a political film, other than the Bush moments, which you can just roll your eyes at and move on.The theatre was full and everyone was along for the ride. The parents next to me who commented during the previews...of that's gonna be 2 hours that I'll never get back really seemed please with this film.I did enjoy it so much more that Secret Life of Pets.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I almost didn't go because of the terrible ratings.I'm not sure what everyone's deal is with the CGI,they aren't going to put a real cat through all that. And "cliche", well most movies ARE repeats of different things nowadays. Maybe it's just because I love cats, but personally this movie was good. I'd suggest it to anyone, def cat lovers.

		<shortDescription>Not a great movie for younger children</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The premise for Nine Lives seems like something that would make this funny for kids. Indeed, this preview showed up before a couple of animated films I took my kids to.But Nine Lives, for the most part, is NOT really for kids, at least not younger children. Mine are 12 and 8. My 12-year-old enjoyed it. My 8-year-old was bored. Reasons why this film doesn't seem to cater to its intended child audience (SPOILERS!!!)1. The film starts off with a montage of cute random cat videos, but after that, there is a looooong section of film where it's just the main character, Tom Brand, in his office discussing plans for building the tallest building in North America and generally showing him being a jerk to everyone he encounters. Kids will be bored by all the office politics (Ian Cox is trying to take the company away from Tom Brand, Tom's adult son David from his first marriage works at the office too and is trying to earn his father's respect, etc.)2. Finally the film gets to the "meat" of the plot, and it's not cute. Tom agrees to meet Ian on the roof of the building-in-progress in the middle of a rainstorm, Tom ends up slipping over the edge and clinging to the ledge, begging Ian to pull him up...and Ian just stands there and watches him and lets him fall. That is very, very dark for a "children's" movie, which I realize is rated PG, but might be scary for very young viewers.3. Tom survives by a fluke, but is in a coma while his soul goes into the body of a cat he bought and intended to give his daughter for her birthday. I thought, "Finally, maybe we can get the kids to some real laughs here!" Well, one of the first things the cat does is purposely gets into Tom's liquor cabinet, manages to dump some alcohol into a dish, and drinks it. Cue scenes of drunk-cat-Tom staggering around the house. Drunken cat...in a kids' movie. Again, maybe funny for older kids, but not young kids.4. And that brings me to alcohol. Besides the drunk cat scene, there are numerous scenes of Tom's ex-wife (who happens to hang out/visit Tom's current wife) all the time. Yes, she is supposed to be an alcoholic, but there are a LOT of scenes focusing on her drinking, asking for more drinks, trying to push drinks on other people, etc. Not great for a kids' movie.5. At the end, David (who battles Ian Cox the duration of the movie for control of his father's company) heads over to his dad's tower, having seemingly lost to Ian. The implication is that he is going to commit suicide. Again, VERY adult theme. As it turns out, he does jump but with a parachute on his back, but the implication is that he up there getting ready to kill himself. Language is mild. I caught one "hell" and one "son of a bi---" (it was cut off, they didn't actually say it. That was okay for a PG movie. There is reference to the cat getting "fixed" and then Jennifer Garner's character says something along the lines of it being illegal to castrate her husband, but there is no rules about what she can do to the cat, which is a little graphic. And there are some bizarre plot inconsistencies too. Mom brings the cat home from the hospital after Tom's accident and the first thing they do is...leave the cat alone while they cuddle up in Mom's bed, leaving the cat to fend for himself. And the next day upon waking, Mom pours the cat a bowl of food and sets up the litterbox. They didn't set up the litterbox right away the night before?!? And it was supposed to be a gift for the little girl, but they shut it out of the bedroom and in most scenes the cat is just "there" in the movie and not being played with or shown love by the main character? Thumbs down for that.All in all, I'd suggest not taking any kids younger than 8 to this movie, or honestly, maybe not younger than 10. I think younger kids might find some funny parts but most of it will bore them or go right over their heads.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Cat-Friendly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the movie and I would like to comment on the storyline of "Nine Lives." I found it to be disturbing. I understand and accept that the cats in the Purr-kins shop were there voluntarily and that some - like Mr. Fuzzy Pants - apparently agreed to donate some of their lives in order to help "troubled" humans straighten themselves out. But when the cats were given away, they were soon "possessed" by the spirit of the humans that needed their help. The cats ceased to be cats altogether and the humans were trapped inside the cats. If the human possessing the cats could or would not reform, then the cats remained possessed and would be lost forever. If the human successfully reformed, the cats would have to die, in order to release the repentant humans' spirit. Mr. Perkins states that love requires sacrifices. The spirit of Mr. Brand flings the body of Mr. Fuzzy Pants off a skyscraper in a futile attempt to save his son. It is the cat who is sacrificed, not the human. The cat may have been attracted to the human initially, but there is never love between them. How can the death of the cat be considered a loving sacrifice? The way that this movie presents itself, cats are just vessels to be used by humans and discarded. For those reviewers that state that this movie is about a man who is turned into a cat, that is not correct: the poor cat is possessed by the spirit of a man and that spirit thinks and behaves like his human self throughout the possession. As a cat lover, I resented the treatment of the cats in this movie as mindless objects whose sole purpose was to correct bad human behavior; there was no regard for the cruel fate that they would have to face - no matter the outcome for the human possessing them. I'm sorry, but this is not the kind of film that could be written by or intended for people who love and admire cats.</fullReview>

Kevin Spacey which is one of the best of all time now tainted his reputation with this. When I saw the trailer I asked myself what are Kevin Spacey and Cristopher Walken doing in this. I asked if I could have my money back. An ELEVEN Metascore is just so bad that I cant even process why Kevin did this. I would love to ask him why did he do this. Now enough about Kevin because everything was just so bad. The acting was horrible and the screenplay was very poor. Anyone who reads this DO NOT WATCH NINE LIVES it is a waste of money.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Barry Sonnenfeld's Nine Lives is a profoundly stupid movie. It's about a billionaire New York businessman who is egotistical, full of himself and likes to put his name on every building he owns (Sound like anyone who's been in the headlines a lot this past year?), and how he learns to be a better father to his adult son and young daughter, and a better husband to his wife, while having his soul trapped in his daughter's cat.The movie stars Kevin Spacey. Yes, Kevin Spacey, that most gifted and treasured of actors. The man has won numerous awards, including the Oscar and the Tony. Now he can probably expect a Razzie early next year. To be fair, he's not sleepwalking through this movie, though you kind of wish he was. He gives the material more effort than it deserves. The movie also stars Jennifer Garner as his wife, and Cheryl Hines as his ex-wife, who shows up to be humiliated once in a while. When Hines shows up at his penthouse apartment, Kevin Spacey (in cat form) decides to use her expensive purse as a litter box. Ho, ho.Spacey is Tom Brand, who wants to build the world's tallest skyscraper. When it's revealed that a building in Chicago is going to be taller, he has a fit, and threatens to miss his 11-year-old daughter's birthday party. Still, he's determined to impress her, so he races around Manhattan for a pet cat that she wants. This leads him to a tiny little pet shop run by a mysterious shopkeeper, played by Christopher Walken. The performance Walken gives is sadly subdued. A little bit of his strange humor would have done wonders. Tom picks out a cat named Mr. Fuzzypants, and then decides to head back to his corporate building, so that he can go to the roof in the middle of a thunderstorm and yell at his corporate lackey Ian (Mark Consuelos). To make a long story short, a stray thunderbolt knocks Tom off the roof, placing him in a coma.When Tom wakes up, his soul has been transported into the body of Mr. Fuzzypants, and he finds himself in the hospital where his wife and daughter are fretting over his unconscious human body. Fortunately, Christopher Walken is there to explain what has happened, and tells him he has to learn to appreciate his family in the cat's body before the doctor's pull the plug on his human body. Tom's wife and daughter (who don't seem nearly as distressed as they should be that he is clinging to life) bring Mr. Fuzzypants home, not knowing that Tom is inhabiting the feline. He tries to get their attention, but nothing seems to work. It's not until he starts bonding with his daughter that he starts to realize how important his family is.Nine Lives is credited to five different screenwriters, who must have gone home weary after a long day of dreaming up scenes like the one where Mr. Fuzzypants tries to open a bottle of scotch with his tiny paws. The cat itself is played by a combination of a real cat, and a blatantly CG one for when it has to leap off a windowsill and bounce off an awning, or when it starts doing amazing dancing and backflip moves. I'm not blaming the filmmakers for using special effects in order to display things that a real cat simply can't do. I just wish they made more of an effort, so the effects would look slightly more convincing than Gumby and Pokey.The movie is 90 minutes of pure mindless fluff with no nutritional value whatsoever. And no, I am not exactly condemning all fluff. I have enjoyed films that most have dismissed as such in the past. This is simply bad fluff. It's cheaply made, poorly written, and has absolutely nothing to offer other than those with the simplest of tastes. This is yet another movie that feels like nobody really wanted to make it, and just showed up every day.I will probably never know what drew Kevin Spacey to Nine Lives. All I can say is I hope he got more out of it than I did. At least he got paid. I got to sit in the dark, and wonder what I was doing with my life for 90 minutes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cat Spent All Nine Lives With This Junk.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nine Lives (2016): Dir: Barry Sonnenfeld / Cast: Kevin Spacey, Jennifer Garner, Christopher Walken, Cheryl Hines, Robbie Amell: This film doesn't deserve any lives, let alone nine. Easily Barry Sonnenfeld's most embarrassing film since Wild Wild West this contains a horribly over the top computer generated cat. Kevin Spacey plays a wealthy industrialist who is set to construct the tallest building in America. He hasn't time for his family. Christopher Walken plays a cat whisperer who apparently turns him into a cat when he stubbornly arrives to buy his daughter a cat. This is the same idea as The Shaggy Dog only it manages to be even worse. Seeing Spacey go from winning Academy Awards to shitting in hand bags as a cat is hideous at best. Jennifer Garner is a complete waste as his wife who is exhausted with his being late and basically disappointing everyone. Walken as the cat whisperer seems to appear at will at the screenwriter's urge. Walken is a talented actor but this is not the first time he signed on to crap like this. The whole magic element is poorly elevated as well. I was waiting for Walken to pull rabbits out of hats. Cheryl Hines is another over the top presence. She plays Spacey's ex-wife who spends way too much time with his current wife. Her daughter is another snit who pretends to care about Garner's daughter. The work subplot takeover attempt while Spacey is in a coma is another lazy plot element. Theme of spending time with family is clear but being in a coma has a bright side when it comes to avoiding this cat litter piece of trash. Score: 2 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From a legal standpoint, and by that, I am referring to Writer's Guild regulations, according to the on-screen credits, it appears as though the screenplay was begun by (Matt Allen &amp; Caleb Wilson) and then subsequently rewritten by (Dan Antoniazzi &amp; Ben Shiffrin), before Gwyn Lurid completed the final shooting script. (For legal reasons, writers who collaborate together have their names linked with an ampersand, " &amp; ". while those who worked separately have their names separated by the word "and", according to the Writer's Guild regulations). It took five writers, at three different stages to dream up this horribly dated story of a corporate exec whose soul ends up trapped in the body of a cat?It feels like this may have been written in the early 1990s, storyboarded in the early to mid 90s (judging by the wardrobe and colour composition), but not filmed until 2015, and then sat unreleased for a further year, before being scraped out of the kitty litter box, and flung at cinema screens.Iincredibly lame, with out-dated references (I counted at least two references to W. Bush, who left office nearly eight years prior to this film's release) and poorly done (and out of place) time lapse photography, and a mishmash of a screenplay which includes only a handful of Jokes, none of which are funny.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is my review for Nine Lives (spoiler free)* (1/5) Director: Barry SonnerfeldCast: Kevin Spacey, Jennifer Garner, Christopher WalkenPlot: Tom Brand (Spacey) a businessman is celebrating his daughter's birthday and has an accident he then wakes up as the family pet, and though the family does not understand him he has to try to reconcile with his family.Spacey is known as one of those versatile who make you laugh and cry or even make you fall in love with every role he is in, however this is probably the most preposterous and most studiously inept role he has ever taken. Director/producer Barry Sonnerfeld who made Will Smith, an on screen charm in Men in Black however everything that he screwed up for the third installment of the series is transferred into this, a film that takes pride in calling itself a kids film but fails at that. To put it plainly this film will literally make your brain eject out of your head with such a high velocity. Let's start with the script, the script is poorly laid out and it's written even worse even the actors who are probably the most talented casting choice for a film like this even they look embarrassed to be here, it feels like it's inspired by Nine Months a film that made Hugh Grant unbearable to watch still it's better than this but not much. Spacey stars as Tom Brand a stuffy Trump-like character whose workaholic lifestyle takes him away from his loving family, so during his daughter's birthday he has an accident he then wakes up as the family pet, however this makes one of the most beloved animals in the world a complete joke much like Dr. Suess' Cat in the Hat. He has to reconcile with his family as the cat and all though he tries hard he keeps failing much like this fails to generate laughs. However all is not lost except for perhaps will power, the family hires Felix (Walken) a cat whisperer who speaks to the cat in hope to get something out of him Tom can't stand the cat whisperer, so disaster strikes as the family get into even more cat crap literally and metaphorically Tom then turns into a bad cat and is in a cage until he can behave, still that gives him chance to reconnect with his daughter Rebecca (Malina Weissman) who loathed him at first but since he turned into the cat she falls even more love with him. As far as character development goes there isn't any so as the film goes one you'll be wondering who these people really are, let's just the gimmick gets better, oh wait too late the FX are dreadful all not too dreadful, because Tom looks like a real cat when he is standing or walking but when he gets picked up or even thrown at some point it looks like a failed attempt to make him, laughable but fails at that. There is one funny bit but then the laughter from the audience die down when Tom falls off a desk he lands on his face, even the trait of cats is to land on their feet. The performances are bland even from Spacey who can literally transform into any role whether it is a fictional psychopath in Se7en or even a relentless romantic from his second Oscar winning performance in American Beauty; however even for him this performance is dreadful, yes even more dreadful than Horrible Bosses the film makes even the most lovable actor unbearable that is no easy feat. The film even has very poor editing standards it takes ages trying to funny however there is a unfunny selection of cat Youtube videos to enjoy or not enjoy but they are videos that probably everybody has seen before, even the Cobra Cat video which was funny the first time however watching them again is just sad. The editing is so bad at some points that when Tom is jumping from a plane 14,000 feet above New York it looks like green-screen used in a TV Movie lie for instance Sharknado, but even that is more fun than this. Probably the best of this film is the talented cast but you would expect them to be in something better than this painful disaster. Does the ending make up for it? No it does not when it finally gets to the ending the audience has already fallen asleep; the film has a very predictable ending the family find out that the cat is Tom and he has another as the cat to turn back to normal its very predictable still at least they tried?oh wait they barely tried. Remember when Kevin Spacey and Christopher Walken won Oscars? Well this isn't that.In conclusion this is a dreadful seething mess that if you manage to watch the full 90 minutes your brain would've ejected out of your body, you wouldn't ever think that you would hate Spacey so much. This film takes pride in call itself a kids film tries to overload the audience with an ambush of laughs however fails at that. This is to tedious even for a six year old to enjoy.Verdict: Spacey's most studiously inept role ever an unfunny and quite frankly stupid mess, your nine lives of will power will soon run out after enduring so much pain. This will even make your cat hiss with anger.2/10 hiss, scratch, claw, run away</fullReview>

Christopher Walken gives his best performance since Seven Psychopaths, Cheryl Hines is as always lovely and hilarious, and the young Malina Weissman.. She's gonna be a star! That's all I gotta say. And there's jokes for both kids and adults, so don't worry if you think this looks like a cheesy kids film - It's not!The movie had me rolling with laughter and an ending that actually made me tear up a bit.

Since few people would confuse a glamorous Hollywood star like Mr. Spacey for the Trumpster in the Flesh (a personage far likelier to be compared to Voldemort on Social Media), perhaps it's not giving too much away to reveal that Spacey's part is visually filled for most of NINE LIVES by "Mr. Fuzzypants," a feline who's a dead ringer for Mr. Trump's head. Otherwise, most of NINE LIVES' plot could be ripped from Today's headlines. Much of it centers around Spacey's namesake tower. Sound familiar? The Rich People Party nominated their Trumpster Fire based upon his sole achievement of borrowing credit from Daddy to erect "Trump Tower." The plot is rounded out by all the Family Intrigue we saw at the Rich People National Convention. Back-stabbing, plagiarism, nepotism--it's all there in spades.

		<fullReview>Some films make you speechless in a good way. Not so with Nine Lives, my brain is working on full power trying to churn out words to describe its total lack of quality!Firstly, the star. Spacey has always done that relaxed, deadpan character very well. This time though he just looked bored and lazy. He probably read each of his cat lines in the studio once and thought "that'll do", walking away with a fat wad of cash. In fact every actor was outperformed by Weissman, whose enthusiasm and honesty made her the only thing worth watching.It's interesting that the first names on the end credits are the cat trainers, who do deserve praise more than anyone else in the film. However, when the real cat is replaced by the painfully bad CG one, all the good vibes quickly diminish, even with Walken around recycling his character from Click. The script is so poor, the first twenty minutes will easily bore the kids with business conversations, stocks and shares, and the rest of the movie feels like it could have been penned by a kid.I expect more from the Men In Black director, but even Sonnenfeld couldn't salvage the witless and barren script. With five writing credits, there's really no excuse for making something so dreary and plot-less, with such forced sentimentality at the end it's practically smashed over your head. Let's be happy for the guy who only wants a 2000 foot monument to himself! No.1/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even by children's movie standards, this film is awful. The plot is essentially that a Donald Trump wannabe--Kevin Spacey--winds up taking residence inside a cat's body while laid up in a coma. The selfish, tyrant is then taught valuable life lessons. If only the producers of this farce would have experienced the same transformation prior to making this movie, we'd all be better off.The premise of the film has some hope as a nice way to entertain the family without much worry. The cast is certainly talented and experienced. The problem is that the script is completely flat without one truly funny line or visual. All of the characters are nothing but cardboard cutouts and the actors appear to know this; everyone in this film seems to be going through the motions for a paycheck--even the normally reliable Christopher Walken. One telling example of the lousy script is that everyone in the Spacey character's life goes right back to normal existence almost immediately after he suffers a horrible accident and struggles for his life; this includes his own daughter, who seems more interested in her new cat than the fact that her dad is on life support. Sure, this is needed to move along the thin plot, but it still comes across awkwardly on screen. The cast continues to sleepwalk through the duration of the film, which makes it fairly difficult for the audience to care. The audience is also subjected to the typical Hollywood political drive-by messages--a George W. Bush picture gets defaced multiple times (which would never happen to a Democrat in a Hollywood film). It would be one thing if the scene was actually funny, but it was forced much like the rest of the film. With the plethora of family movies available, including the animated variety, there is no reason to spend time on this mess.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nine Lives is one of the worst movies of all time. Everyone involved should be ashamed of themselves</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my previous review of The Secret Life of Pets, I mentioned that I had two dogs and a cat. Their companionship is something I always look forward to in the evening when their ready to plop themselves on my lap as I watch some Netflix. Whenever I watch something involving household pets (and most animals when their not villains), I suddenly get a feeling more for them then their human leads. In fact when I saw Krampus, I thought to myself that the monster could do anything they wanted to the adults and their children, but nothing better happen to the bulldog. The reason I bring this up is that animals have an interesting place in movies. They may be around to build atmosphere and possibly serve the characters, but we have a lot of care for them. That has to do with the fact that animals don't have a lot of the conditional emotions that humans have in their thinking. Because of that, we see them as more innocent and don't want to see them get hut in a realistic context. This only breaks when the animal is suddenly given a voice and human personality. If you see Nine Lives, you'd wish that the cat in question would have gotten putted down. Tom Brand (played by Kevin Spacy) is the president of a major corporation that lends it's name on several products. He loves his title and even goes as far to skydiving to show that he can do anything. He devotes so much time to his job, he has little time for his adult son David (played by Robbie Amell), his wife Lara (played by Jennifer Garner) and young daughter Madison (played by Cheryl Hines). In fact, he's disliked by most people, including company vice president Ian Cox (played by Mark Consuls).For his daughter's birthday, Tom purchases an adult cat at an odd cat shop run by an eccentric Felix Perkins (played by Christopher Walkin). He takes a detour from home by going back to the office for news. A lighting strike causes a body swap, putting Tom into the cat, while his body ends up in a coma. He's taken home by his wife and daughter while he takes in that he's a cat. The only one who knows is Felix to later tells him he has one week to reconcile with his family or be a cat forever.Where do I even begin with this?strange and awful movie. Nine Lives, as a story is every body swap story done before like 18 Again, Freaky Friday, and The Change Up. This adds nothing new to the idea and follows each cliché beat for beat. The joke's never fire and neither do the emotional moments. This feels like a bad Disney movie from the 1970's, back when they were desperate to try anything. The acting, while not bad, is uninspired. With a lot of big name stars like Kevin Spacy, Jennifer Garner and Christopher Walken, this is proof that no matter who you put into movie roles, you still need a good writer to carry them through.It's shocking to see that Barry Sonnenfeld (the Men in Black series, The Addams Family series, etc?) directed Nine Lives. Though he might have done this for kids, the movie barely even looks like it had much of a budget. The film is full of shots that were obviously green-screened, visual effects that are obviously fake, and a tone that could really use some dark humor. This is seriously one of the worst family movies that I've seen.I'll give this one cat litter boxes out of ten. There is nothing to be proud about Nine Lives. Everyone involved with the making of this movie should be ashamed of themselves. This makes the live action Garfield look like an Oscar winner. Children deserve better then this. This cat needs to be put to sleep and never wake up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice Family TV Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw "9 Lives", starring Kevin Spacey-Elvis &amp; Nixon, The Men Who Stare at Goats; Jennifer Garner-Miracles From Heaven, Juno; Cheryl Hines- Suburgatory_tv, RV and Christopher Walken-Jersey Boys, Joe Dirt.This is a family comedy that could have easily been on TV. Kevin plays a rich businessman-think Donald Trump before he decided to go into politics-that has just finished his newest sky-scrapper. He has been spending so much time on completing it that he has been ignoring his family life. Jennifer plays his second/present wife, who keeps trying to remind him of his up-coming daughters' birthday, to no avail. Cheryl plays Kevin's first wife that divorced Kevin because he ignored her so much and now, keeps hanging around as a 'friend' to Jennifer by telling her to divorce Kevin, too. Kevin finally asks what his daughter wants and is told, a cat, so he stops at a pet shop owned by Christopher. The cat and Kevin are then in an accident that causes Kevin to go into a coma and his mind goes into the cat's body. Hilarity ensues. There are a few funny parts but there are also lots of unfunny, predictable parts. It's not a bad movie, just a little predictable. Lets just say that kids will probably like it more than adults-they haven't seen as many TV shows as adults have and it is new material to them. It's rated "PG" for language and rude humor and has a running time of 1 hour &amp; 27 minutes. It's not one that I would buy on DVD but if you have some little ones around the house, it would be a good rental.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's Cute But A Rental</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I gave this film a 4 out of 10 only because of the cuteness factor of the film. I wanted to see Suicide Squad BUT my friend wanted to see Nine Lives so I gave it a chance. I have a cat of my own so I can see why people will like this film. I enjoyed the film but it's a rental for me to be honest. Basically the film about a guy who is this big to-do guy in New York, he wants to buy the biggest Tower in the world. His daughter birthday is coming up and she asks for a cat for her birthday so Kevin Spacey goes to the pet store, picks out a cat and comes back to his Tower to see what is going on with the building and basically one of his workers tries to kill him by throwing him and the cat off the building and the guy is in a coma and basically the guy becomes the...cat. That's it. That's the premise of the movie. So basically the film is the Dad trying to deal with the fact that he's a cat. There's some cute moment of him adjusting to being a cat by eating cat food or using the litter box but I could have watched my cat for free instead of this film. Christopher Walken plays the Cat Whisper who helps the cat figure out what's going on and Jennifer Garner who was okay as the wife but anyone could have played that rule of a demanding wife who wants her husband to be there for their kid more. The daughter was cute in the way she interacts with the cat was adorable. I think if you have kids you'll like this film BUT I would wait and rent it on Redbox but that's just me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a truly bad movie, but (mostly) a lot of fun to experience if you take it as a fun-bad experience of epic, monumental don't-give-a-hoot proportions.Wow. Talk about no one really giving a damn that this is the kind of project that was stale ten years ago, with the kind of CGI that the Garfield movies did better (not to mention that this is 2016, and this is DECADES after George Miller gave us relatively acceptable talking animals with their mouths moving and here it's the Homeward Bound style). Also, this didn't have nearly enough cat puns if they had to get completely silly with it - for all of the funny WTF moments there are also parts that are just dull kid's film fluff (they have maybe like five or six at most, and my wife was hoping for... 37, so yeah, missed the mark on that).I have a lot of questions by the way, to be sure, of course. Like... how is Brand (Kevin Spacey, collecting a paycheck that's more than many of us would make in ten years to lazily voice a cat, this a 2 time Oscar winner and John Doe AND Frank Underwood!) allowed to get this far with using his companies time and money to make the Tallest Building in the World? And yes I realize this is a squishy Soft version of Donald Trump but, still? Why does no one see when the cat spells out things? And why does the daughter suddenly - OUT OF NOWHERE - start to look up Cat Mysticism on the internet because ::gasp:: maybe her dad's a cat? And what's up with everyone being alcoholics here and it's all a big larf? And how do I know this is from a decade ago though - there's a George W. Bush joke... A BUSH JOKE! Who thought this was a good idea in 2016? And Sonnenfeld trying to compensate with a slew of super complex tracking shots early on that just disappear through the rest of the film (though he does give us 'Three Cool Cats' as a recurring song because, uh, cats).This is amazing and I'm so glad I saw it. Whether you will be depends what you're looking for. And if you think to show it to your kids, simply, don't. Pop on the BFG or Finding Dory or something if it has to be from this calendar year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...until I took her to this movie. Fellas, you are wasting a golden opportunity to get in good with your girl. "Nine Lives" is an adorable romp around a serious topic we've neglected: Cats rights. The local cat lady I spoke to thought this is the "Spartacus" of all cat movies. And "Cat Fancy" is doing a three page spread on the long reaching effects this movie will be.Some say that I am a Jennifer Garner apologist. Puh-lease. I'll be the brave one and say I did not care for "Elektra" I hate them even more that they spelled her name with a "K." So you KNOW I'm being honest with you.A time-honored classic, and oral to boot. How can I give this thing anything BUT a 10. GO GO GO! See it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For cat lovers only</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No matter if movie buffs like or not this movie, I rather find it quite light and a slight reminiscence of old Disney movies (at a time where "The Wonderful World of Disney" or "Disneyland" was a crucial weekly rendez-vous).I kinda liked the CGI cat there. If the actors (Spacey and Walken won Oscars) are not as much convincing here than in their prime, let's say they had fun here in a movie which rather repeat past stories which had moral issues.However, how can your own soul gets into your cat while you're in a coma, it is inconvenient yes, but at the end, can get positive results...And for feline lovers, I believe they're in for a kitty treat. For more serious movie lovers, they can pass by...</fullReview>
